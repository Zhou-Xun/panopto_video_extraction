1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,560
Yellowdig is about creating communities. I'm 
not going to spend a ton of time on that.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:04,808
And we're at some schools, including 
the University of Michigan at LSA

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:16,800
and Ross, actually, as well.
And while normally, I would say

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,720
retention isn't probably an issue at 
Michigan in the current environment.

5
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,080
It might actually be more of an 
issue of students feel disconnected.

6
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:33,675
They tend to fall away to some degree.
And we can help with that a little bit.

7
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,480
I worked in online learning at Rochester 
Institute of Technology at the turn of the

8
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,156
century, which is fun to say.
At that point, my job was to

9
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:49,920
help faculty move their courses online, 
whether that was in a distance mode or

10
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,120
even back then in a blended/hybrid type
of class where they would use online

11
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,692
tools in their face to face classes.
But the tools were terrible and the pedagogy

12
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:05,840
also did not really bring it to that point.
I moved on from that position to teach

13
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,476
political science for over a decade.
So when I learned about Yellowdig,

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:18,080
I was really impressed and intrigued because of 
that sort of frictionless type of sharing and

15
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,640
all that kind of stuff in the social interface 
that students would definitely be familiar with.

16
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,560
But what I didn't know at the time 
was that while those things are great,

17
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,520
what really makes a difference in Yellowdig 
is sort of the behind the scenes stuff,

18
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:37,840
the A:the ability to be sort of in a walled 
garden where you're able to see all that

19
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,440
student interaction and understand 
what your students are engaging with

20
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:47,440
and specifically how they're engaging with it.
And also the behavior changing paradigm

21
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,640
shift of our points system, which 
you may or may not be aware of.

22
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,880
And I'll get to more when we're in the 
platform itself. But we have what I like

23
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:01,760
to call an organic student engagement engine.
This point system changes the whole pedagogy

24
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:08,320
of of online discussions.
And we'll get to that.

25
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:15,120
So this is just a quick overview of what 
Yellowdig looks like inside of Canvas.

26
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,240
It can be outside of Canvas 
as well. Single scrolling

27
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,414
feed that everyone's gonna be familiar with.
And the stuff over here, the private configurable,

28
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:29,760
that stuff is more probably of interest 
to IT people and to university admins.

29
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:36,080
But but this gamification is really 
what's important here for you and the

30
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,200
impact measurement, the ability 
to see what your students are

31
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,800
doing at any particular time and 
over the course of the semester.

32
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:50,240
And while Yellowdig is available in the 
classes, and that's certainly where our

33
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,840
focus is in the formal learning spaces.
One thing that's really unique about

34
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,000
Yellowdig is our conversations are our 
communities are persistent, meaning that

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,360
they don't end at any particular time.
So some of the ideas that people are now

36
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,800
starting to experiment and use Yellowdig 
in, which may or may not apply to you.

37
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,880
We've had some schools over COVID using it 
for virtual orientations instead of in-person

38
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:17,680
orientations, that asynchronous model.
But it can also be used for student clubs

39
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,520
or for first year experience.
And you go from orientation

40
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:26,000
into the same student First year 
experience and that cohort can be

41
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,640
followed in the same Yellowdig community 
all through their time at Michigan.

42
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:38,880
So that offer some thoughts and opportunities to, 
also alumni, mentoring, all that kind of stuff.

43
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:45,760
But again, Yellowdig works just as well 
outside of the LMS as it does in the LMS.

44
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:51,440
In Canvas, excuse me.
And students like it.

45
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:57,120
And that's true at the graduate 
level and the undergraduate level.

46
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,640
They just like it. And because of that, to 
a large degree, instructors often like it

47
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:08,240
from that perspective as well.
But let's talk about the pedagogy.

48
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:16,000
So this slide is supposed to represent the 
sort of traditional online pedagogy where the

49
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:23,280
instructor, the sage on the stage, you know,
creates an assignment where the students must

50
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:29,920
write every week 200 to 300 words to a 
particular prompt that the instructor has made.

51
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:35,280
Everyone writing to the same prompt. And then 
the instructor goes on to say, you write to

52
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:43,544
me that 300 words and then you respond, you 
comment on two of your peers posts as well.

53
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,400
I'm sure there are some wonderful 
examples of people using that really well.

54
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,080
But let let's talk let's break it down 
a little bit, what happens as far as

55
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,440
building community and discussion and engagement.

56
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:01,520
So you have in the beginning of the semester, the 
eager student who goes up and wants to impress

57
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:07,600
the instructor and writes it the first day and 
doesn't have anyone to comment to at that point,

58
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:13,520
because no one else is doing that, because pretty 
much everybody is ultimately looking at this

59
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,960
as an assignment with a due date.
Sunday at 11:59 p.m., that's when I have

60
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:27,651
to have my 300 words in and then go comment "Good 
job", or "I agree" on the other people's posts.

61
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,760
But that last person or the majority of students 
who are waiting until that last minute, even if

62
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:45,920
they wanted to interact with those conversations,
they can't because that time period has elapsed

63
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:51,040
and that conversation will never be looked at by 
anybody again except the instructor has to read

64
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:57,920
those same essays over and over and over again.
And by the way, I know of what I speak. I

65
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:04,960
spent 12 years scoring AP U.S. government 
and politics exams where I would read about

66
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:10,960
5,000 of the same essays over the course 
of nine or 10 days for twelve years.

67
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:17,280
So, yeah, it's it's a you know, I don't know.
It doesn't really promote learning.

68
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:23,200
It's more of a publicly submitted 
assignment to the professor because

69
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,080
that's who the students are writing to 
and they realize that this is happening.

70
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,560
And as time goes by, not even that go getter is 
going to be up there up front because there is

71
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:38,640
no interaction, or limited interaction and limited 
ability to communicate or expand on those ideas.

72
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:43,360
And, you know, Yellowdig is 
very different from that.

73
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:49,760
As I mentioned, our discussions are persistent.
I'd also like to mention that we

74
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:58,080
consider our communities to be not instructor 
led, but rather instructor modeled.

75
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,080
You as the instructor are another 
citizen of that community.

76
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:07,600
You're the first citizen to some 
degree, you want to set the tone,

77
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:13,600
but you're not going to be in there 
having to drive all the conversations.

78
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:21,360
In fact, we find that some of these these actually 
work better with less instructor input than

79
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:27,600
communities where instructors try to input a lot.
And also, we don't

80
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:33,920
support the idea of the prompt base, 
the weekly prompt-based pedagogy.

81
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:41,600
So, you know, you can certainly tell students 
what kinds of posts that you want to have them

82
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,680
providing.
But ultimately,

83
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:51,840
this is a freer and more open arena where 
they don't have to feel like they're just

84
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:57,600
working to impress the instructor all the time.
And this opens it for questions in ways that

85
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,393
regular communities wouldn't have 
and can really get things going.

86
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:07,920
And oftentimes - I'm going to jump to 
the platform itself in just a minute,

87
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:14,880
but oftentimes instructors are wary of 
the point system and making students work

88
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:19,760
to achieve these points seems artificial 
or something to that degree degree.

89
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:24,000
We'll get into why it really is just the 
behavior change and it doesn't really do that.

90
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,480
But ultimately, once the semester is underway, 
we see quite a bit of time when students

91
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:34,720
just ignore the point totals and 
pass them because they're just

92
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:38,960
in the communities like they would be
if they're scrolling on Facebook or Instagram,

93
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:42,320
they get a little notification. They go in 
and, oh, yeah, let's see what's happening.

94
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,880
And then they'll comment because it's 
interesting to them. So just wanted.

95
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,520
>>Can you just say a few words? Maybe you will get 
back to this when when you get to the platform.

96
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:55,280
But what are you talking about when 
you're talking about these points?

97
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:58,480
>>Yeah, I'm going to get to that right 
now into a, I'll switch to the platform

98
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,536
when we get to that. Are you seeing Business 101?

99
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,240
The point system is there's a certain number 
of points over the course of the semester

100
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,120
that you as an instructor specify. We have 
some defaults set up and I'll show you later

101
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,920
how how you can easily do that and walk 
through the wizard that we have for points.

102
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,960
But the bottom line is 
this. All right? Every week,

103
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:28,800
every earning period, we'll call it, students 
try to earn a particular number of points

104
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:37,200
that go towards the total that they need for 
the entire semester, which then relates to some

105
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,880
percentage of the grade that goes to 
participation for the entire semester.

106
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:50,160
OK? And as you'd probably expect in a platform 
that rewards students for their participation,

107
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:55,920
that students get points for creating a post.
Makes sense. They type something,

108
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,840
they get some points. And in fact, we 
do it with a minimum number of words.

109
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:05,280
And then you can change that. But we found that 
between 40 and 100 words are the most engaging

110
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:08,560
places. I mean, nobody wants 
to read the 200 word posts.

111
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,880
And you want to have enough in 
there to catch someone's attention.

112
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:16,480
So we found that, you know, a minimum of 40 
words is probably a good spot to do that.

113
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:23,600
And again, as you would probably expect, students 
get some sort of points, reward, what have you

114
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:31,040
for commenting on another person's post.
So if Ella wrote a post and Kim commented on it,

115
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,760
Ella would get points for the post.
In this case, 250 points and Kim

116
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,880
would get one 125 points.
And that's a wonderful

117
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:44,320
way to quantify students typing skills.
Right. Those participation points, they're getting

118
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,840
points for typing a certain number of words.
And that's wonderful. However,

119
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:54,720
what makes Yellowdig different and 
what really drives engagement are these

120
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:03,440
what we call social points. OK? So and they work 
and in tandem with the participation points.

121
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,120
But but here's the difference.

122
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,640
So in the model before Ella posted

123
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:15,280
200 got to 250 words and I mean 40 
words and got 250 points for doing that.

124
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:23,760
And but now not only Ella gets one 125 
points for commenting on, or excuse me,

125
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,640
Kim gets one 125 points for 
commenting on Ella's post.

126
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,400
But on top of that, Ella, 
who did the original post,

127
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:35,760
gets 75 points for Kim 
having commented on her post.

128
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:42,880
OK. Or giving it a reaction or, you know, 
a thumbs up or another specific reaction.

129
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:49,840
And what this does, what it does, it changes 
the student behaviors because instead of waiting

130
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:55,120
until the end of the earning period, they soon 
learn that if they post earlier in the week,

131
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:01,360
they're more likely to get responses, 
which means that they have less to do

132
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:08,560
because they're going to get a lot of 
their points from the social points.

133
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:15,760
In addition to that, being early isn't enough. 
They also have to write engaging posts.

134
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:21,120
Right. If you write something that is 
not on point and is not interesting

135
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,920
to the other students, those other students 
are less likely to interact with that post.

136
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,080
Meaning that I'm going to have to go back in and

137
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,680
try again and write a different post 
if I want to meet my point targets.

138
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,600
So these social points really create a shift in

139
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:42,000
the way that students look at this as an 
assignment and how that they need to approach it.

140
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It's not an assignment due at the end 
of the week. This is an ongoing thing

141
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,240
that they are motivated to get in there 
early and create better content because

142
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,640
it's going to ultimately be easier for them 
to achieve what they're trying to achieve.

143
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:00,960
Does that make sense? OK, awesome.

144
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:08,560
So that's the general basics of the point 
system, did that help answer your question? OK.

145
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:13,120
What I'd like to do now and we'll come back to 
the points and other things as we move forward.

146
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,720
But I want to just show you around 
a little bit. Is that cool? Ok.

147
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:26,480
So, again, single scrolling feed should be very 
familiar to anyone who has ever used Twitter,

148
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,600
Facebook, LinkedIn, so it's going to be familiar 
to them. So the actual interaction is not going

149
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:39,600
to be a challenge for them, or at least 
it shouldn't be for ninety nine percent of

150
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:46,560
students who have a smartphone and know how 
to, you know, share something on Snapchat.

151
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:51,040
Couple of things I want to point out 
within the feed that make it very unique

152
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:56,560
and designed for higher education as opposed 
to some of those other platforms. Excuse me.

153
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,680
First of all, these topic tags are defined 
by the instructor or the course designer

154
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:10,640
and should generally reflect your top 
level syllabus equivalent subject matter,

155
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:20,320
not week one, week two, week three, but rather 
in my case, the Constitution, the bureaucracy,

156
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,960
civil liberties, something like that.
OK. Does that make sense?

157
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:26,880
>>Where are those Bob, could you 
just point? Where it says marketing?

158
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,320
>>Yeah. And question. There are a 
few others outside of the syllabus

159
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,960
sort of range, which would be like questions, 
introductions, breaking news, things like that.

160
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,680
And again,

161
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,480
you can define these yourself as instructor. 
Students can't define them, but you can.

162
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,840
And then I think one thing 
that is not a requirement,

163
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:47,120
but in my mind ought to be a requirement is that

164
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:52,160
you require students to add topic 
tags to each and every post.

165
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,800
This does a couple of things and 
I'll show you how to do that.

166
00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:02,960
But what it does is, a) it makes finding things 
much easier because if a topic tag is attached to

167
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:08,880
a post, you can simply click on that topic tag and 
you will see all the posts under that topic tag.

168
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,520
So it's going to make it easier 
to find that that way. There's

169
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:15,360
other even better searching and 
filtering tools that I'll get to later.

170
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:23,120
But the second thing is, if I'm a student and 
I'm outside of class and Ella, can you remind me,

171
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,920
I thought I heard, but what is 
the course that you're teaching?

172
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:34,480
>>An epidemiology, public health course.
>>Excellent, OK. So you thought I was

173
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:39,280
gonna go Covid there, but instead I'm gonna
>>It's a writing class, though, I will say.

174
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:46,240
>>h, OK. All right. But let's say and maybe 
I'm not going to get this exactly right. So

175
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:58,720
bear with me. But let's say, you know, you 
have a topic on disease spread. Make sense? OK.

176
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:04,400
And students may have heard of. I'm not 
gonna say Covid, I'm gonna go with Ebola.

177
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:08,800
>>OK.
>>Sure. And they bring

178
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:16,960
in something from, they see an article in their 
daily lives about an Ebola outbreak in Madagascar.

179
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:24,720
I hoe not, but they do. Right. And they bring 
it into the class. Now without making those

180
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,920
topics required, they may just plop it 
in there saying, "we were talking about,

181
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:39,440
you know, diseases I'm just gonna pop it in here."
But if they have to think about how to categorize

182
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,360
that particular article, 
it's gonna make them think

183
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,440
where in this course does it make the 
most sense? What is the learning element.

184
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:53,760
What is this related to? So I think it actually 
gives them a chance to process the information a

185
00:16:53,760 --> 00:17:01,120
little bit more and decide how it really applies 
into this framework of the class by assigning

186
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,800
those topics, you may not agree with me, but 
I think it's a pretty good method for doing.

187
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:09,520
And again, like I said, it 
makes it much easier to do.

188
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,560
And as you can see, you can 
add more than one topic tag

189
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:16,960
to a post - or the students 
can, I should say. You can, too.

190
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:21,280
But we also have in a somewhat similar way,

191
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:26,080
hashtags. And hashtags can be 
defined by you and/or students.

192
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:26,151
Hashtags can be used for sub-topics, they can be 
used potentially for ad hoc student groups where

193
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,760
like there's a small student, you know, three 
or four students working on something for a

194
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:40,880
particular part of the semester, not the entire 
semester where they might, you know, hashtag

195
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:46,320
Group 1 or something like that, where they can, 
you know, follow each other's comments easily.

196
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,320
But but mostly for sub-topics.

197
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:56,480
And in addition to that @ mentions, @ mentions are 
the ability to call attention to either you or a

198
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,445
particular student on a particular post.
And so now I want to show you

199
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:12,560
the posting itself, because it's something you do.
So you click create. And you would get this

200
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:19,360
exciting little box where I'll type 
Welcome to class, something like that.

201
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:24,000
Now, again, I'm pretending 
that I'm the instructor here.

202
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:33,920
Hi, my name is Bob, and I'll learn to 
type someday and I'll be your instructor.

203
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:37,040
Wow. That's the keyboard stinks.

204
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:46,480
Anyway, what do you see 
happening there? When I type.

205
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,920
>>Progress bar.
>>Yeah. That little bar,

206
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:54,880
is it its count. It's doing the word 
count for you and for the students,

207
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,240
so nobody has to count the words.
It'll turn green when it hits

208
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:04,160
the required amount. OK, so so it's just 
something that eases your life a little bit.

209
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,240
But there but there's a lot 
more that you can do here.

210
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,840
First of all, as instructors,

211
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,920
not students, but as instructors, you 
can pin one of your posts to the top.

212
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:16,800
So if there's an announcement or something that 
you need to make in that regard, you can do that.

213
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:22,560
You can easily create polls and you can 
do those for formative assessment before a

214
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:26,005
unit starts. How much do you know 
about this? So those are some examples.

215
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:35,120
Here's another.

216
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,760
Hi, my name is Bob. Welcome to class.

217
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:43,120
We're going to be using this platform to allow 
you to do a free ranging discussion on all the

218
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:50,560
issues that you think of related to epidemiology. 
Please remember that we are trying to emulate a

219
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:55,280
professional group and that you are students 
who should behaving and blah, blah, blah.

220
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,760
Something like that, anyway, so you can 
record video and students can record video

221
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:05,120
right from the tab.
And you may or may

222
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,760
not want to encourage them to do that.
But it is a nice way to do introductions,

223
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,400
to have short reports.
By the way, currently the limit

224
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:20,800
for the record video is one and a half minutes.
So it's nice for those types of introductions.

225
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:25,520
You can also upload video easily 
and that can be larger files.

226
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:30,080
But you wouldn't want to be too big anyway because 
no one wants to sit there and wait for an upload.

227
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,120
Another thing that I think is 
relatively important to show is -

228
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,000
>>Can I just ask a question about your videos?
>>Sure.

229
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:44,152
>>So how does. Do they still need to add 
text to get the points for their posts?

230
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:52,800
>>So right now the platform does not by 
default award points for video posting.

231
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:58,880
So there are two ways to handle that. One 
is to have the student write a 40 word,

232
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:03,360
something or other to get those points.
If that's not something that you want to do.

233
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,920
There is another thing, and the reason I mentioned

234
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:09,600
thanking Frederique is because I forgot 
to point out these little doohickeys.

235
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:17,920
These are called accolades. These are instructor 
designed or defined, excuse me, little badges,

236
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:23,680
so to speak, that you can add to posts to 
recognize a student or add additional points.

237
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:29,360
So it'd be very easy to go in and create a video 
post if you did not want to require the additional

238
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:35,520
typing, where you would then just go in.
And with these three little dots here

239
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:43,440
you can go Accolade > Add accolade and then choose 
the accolade you want with whatever amount of

240
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:48,960
points that you want to award for that video. OK. 
And I'll show you a little bit more about this.

241
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,640
The other thing I wanted to say about accolades

242
00:21:52,640 --> 00:22:00,240
is that one of the strengths of Yellowdig is a 
platform is that the openness of the community

243
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:05,440
really makes it more available for 
students to answer each other's questions.

244
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,800
Right. The asynchronous nature 
of it and the instructor modeled

245
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:13,440
rather than instructor led nature of it,
allows students to apply their learning

246
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:19,200
to process what they've learned and go 
in and answer their peers questions,

247
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,840
which can be really valuable for the 
student. Students at both ends of the thing.

248
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:29,520
The downside of allowing a student to do that is 
you don't know necessarily, you want to make sure

249
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:35,920
the students focus on the right answer, right.
So if you gave students, say, if someone posted

250
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:40,560
a question and you gave students a particular 
period of time, 24 hours, 48 hours, what have you.

251
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:44,080
To answer all those questions, 
encourage that type of behavior.

252
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:50,000
You could then just go in or have a T.A. just 
go in somewhat later and put an accolade.

253
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:56,400
We have one that we call "Verified response" 
or you could say "Instructor approved"

254
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:01,200
And then students would know this is the 
answer that you should look at when you're

255
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:06,560
studying for your test or what have you.
And then again, they can click on this

256
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:12,000
particular accolade, verified response, 
and bring up all the verified responses.

257
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,830
So that they'll sort of be pointed in the 
right direction for what you're looking for.

258
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,400
Getting back to the posting, if by accident, I

259
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:29,440
closed my post or my browser froze or 
something like that, I hit create again.

260
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:36,080
It will ask and it will have saved it so that 
you don't have to retype the whole thing again.

261
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,920
The only other thing. Oh. There are 
two other things I want to show you on

262
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:46,160
posting, first of all, this is where 
they would students would add topics. OK.

263
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:52,480
And second of all, I think this makes sense in 
your paradigm of what you're teaching is that we

264
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:58,720
have a function where you can annotate images, 
charts, graphs, photos, maps, what have you.

265
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:04,251
So if you were to upload an 
image using the drawing tool.

266
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:13,680
So you can then, you know, in this case, 
imagine what I would look like with a comb over.

267
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:19,440
Right. That's not probably the best use, and by 
the way, I don't want to look at that anymore.

268
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,600
Is that all right? I'm going to 
get rid of that. But the point is,

269
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:28,240
you if you have charts, graphs, tables 
that you want to work with and show them,

270
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:33,680
you know, interact with, you can do that 
by using this edit this drawing tool.

271
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:39,840
And in this case, honestly, unless 
you have a stylus on your computer,

272
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:47,440
your work computer, I would recommend 
using a phone or a tablet for because

273
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:59,200
your finger is way better than your mouse 
as far as drawing, does that make sense?

274
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:05,600
So one thing that I think comes to mind when 
you're thinking about a single scrolling feed

275
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,200
is the fact that to find everything, we 
want to look for something on Facebook,

276
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,520
you can do a search, but it's 
usually not that helpful.

277
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,880
And you have to scroll for, 
you know, two, three, four

278
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,200
hours until you find something. It's 
not going to happen on Yellowdig.

279
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:24,720
If you again, if you use the topic tags, clicking 
on those topic tags will help you do that.

280
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,600
We have the ability to do a 
you know, a textual search.

281
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,960
We can do that as well. But what 
you can do that's really good

282
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,480
is you can stack these all on top of each other.

283
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:41,520
So, for example, if I was looking for the 
word video and this is a demo community

284
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,000
with almost nothing happening, so 
you're not really finding anything.

285
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:54,320
But I can search not only by the the text 
search. But I can say, you know, under this topic

286
00:25:54,320 --> 00:26:08,880
with this hashtag. And this date range 
by this student I can really dig down.

287
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:14,160
You don't have to use all those filters. But 
what I'm saying is if you choose to select

288
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:17,120
the right filters, you'll be able to 
easily find what you're looking for,

289
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,400
especially if you require those topics to be used.

290
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,800
So it's a pretty, pretty great 
system as far as that goes.

291
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:29,920
And then you can easily clear the filters too.

292
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:34,640
As instructors, though, you have some needs 
that students don't necessarily have and that's

293
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:39,520
being able to just see what they're doing 
and being able to take advantage of that

294
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:45,280
data and reach out to at-risk students or 
just to help out students in another way.

295
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:51,120
So. We have a Community Health area

296
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:56,839
that allows you to see globally and 
granularly how your communities are doing.

297
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,920
So this the Community Health area, 
the first thing that I want to point

298
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:03,760
out to you is sort of this global 
view of your of your community,

299
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:08,000
which may or may not be that helpful as 
an instructor, but as a course designer

300
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,880
and somebody who's using designing a lot of 
courses, it might be more useful to compare them.

301
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:17,280
But this this is the important figure 
here. This is the conversation ratio.

302
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:22,160
This is the number of comments relative 
to the number of posts. In the standard

303
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:25,360
pedagogy we spoke about before that 
number would be two - one comment

304
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:29,920
or one post two comments. We'd like to 
see a number of about seven or higher.

305
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:34,080
And, you know, if you get less than seven, 
I wouldn't be upset or anything like that,

306
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,920
but at least you have something 
to strive for. But beyond that,

307
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:42,000
some of the other things that 
you can do here, click on topics.

308
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,520
This is my favorite area. 
But if I click on topics,

309
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:51,360
I can see how those students are engaging 
with those particular topics specifically.

310
00:27:51,360 --> 00:28:00,160
Why are they engaging in disease 
control but not Scientific method.

311
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:03,520
I'm making up crap, obviously. 
I apologize for that.

312
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:09,760
And then I can go down and granularly see 
which students engaged with which topics.

313
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:13,440
Would that be helpful?

314
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,680
So we can see how they're doing.
And then you can reach out to that

315
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:21,124
student and say, hey, what's going on, Kyle 
student, why haven't you talked about Ebola?

316
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:27,920
Finally, not finally but the other 
part of this that's interesting,

317
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:32,800
these checkmarks indicate that you're 
complying with our basic best practices.

318
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:37,440
Right. And so you can see that at, you know. And 
generally speaking, I think more than generally

319
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:44,080
speaking, if you follow our best practices, your 
community is likely to be successful and engaging.

320
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:49,280
But beyond that, you can see how you're 
doing relative to all other Yellowdig

321
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,840
communities and you'll be able to, at Michigan,

322
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:58,720
see how you're doing to compare to other SPH 
communities or Michigan at large as well.

323
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:04,720
So on a number of metrics, the sharing score, 
which shows all of these particular metrics,

324
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,880
listening score, which we think is one important,

325
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,560
and the interacting square, which we think 
is very important as well and different.

326
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,271
So that can help with that. 
Anyway, you can also see

327
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,560
in reports and then I'll 
get to all your questions.

328
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:21,120
I'm sorry. I just wanted to point out you 
can go into reports and see what students are

329
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:27,040
doing and add or subtract points there as well.
If you clicked show log you'll be able to see

330
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:34,400
all the specific elements of what they've done and 
how they've been assigned points or what have you.

331
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:40,960
So there's that. And I guess with 
that, I'm happy to take any questions.

332
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,600
>>One more thing. I know you mentioned it's only 
in beta, but can you talk about the network,

333
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,800
the network analysis?

334
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,321
>>The network. What? I'm sorry.
>>The other day you showed us

335
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,600
the network analysis of the students.

336
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:02,160
>>That's you know, that's 
that's kind of interesting

337
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,880
to see sort of who's interacting with whom.

338
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:10,400
>>Yeah, I agree. It's still, I think, in beta, 
but I think we can make it available to you.

339
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:15,600
So anyway, this this allows 
you to, as you can see,

340
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,280
pull apart the interactions and see 
exactly where they're coming from.

341
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:22,000
So this this person, Olivia student,

342
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,960
has responded to 38 percent of members 
received responses from 44 members.

343
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:31,200
So you can really see that interaction 
and you can see that this guy

344
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,880
is really just sort of not 
interacting with the community at all.

345
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:40,720
He's outside. So you want 
to reach out to that person.

346
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:47,600
So so this is a graph. I will say that this 
graph is more useful I think in smaller classes

347
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:53,200
and large classes, it becomes a really big 
sort of complex tool, but it's still useful.

348
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:58,560
You can also go to the chart and see 
the information in a list view as well.

349
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:04,480
But I think this graph does give a good 
sense of who is interacting with who.

350
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,360
If you saw one student was only 
interacting back and forth with

351
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:11,840
one other student or maybe two other 
students, you might want to find out

352
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:18,240
what's going on there and why they're 
not interacting the class as a whole.

353
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:23,600
There is a lot of data that you can use 
directly from the platform and we can also

354
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:29,360
pull through our API, almost any other kind 
of data that you can imagine the students.

355
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:34,960
And you can also in this reports area,

356
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:40,640
you can pull your own reports on the state of 
the community as a whole or the specific members,

357
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,840
and that will create a CSV file 
that you can download and then

358
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:50,080
do whatever kind of Excel tricks you 
want to do to analyze what's happening.

359
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,280
>>And one last question from 
me, and then I'll let Ella

360
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:57,120
take over from here.
But so do the points

361
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:02,720
as they are awarded, do they then feed into 
the Canvas grade book or how does that work?

362
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:07,040
>>Yeah. Yes, that's a good question. 
And this is one of the places we find

363
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:14,240
the most confusion, I'm going to be upfront 
about that. So the points are regularly updated.

364
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:18,160
I think it's something like every 
four hours or every hour into Canvas.

365
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:23,920
However, because of the weekly earning period,

366
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:30,400
they return, they go back down at the beginning 
of that next earning period in Canvas, right.

367
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:37,200
Just as they do here. So it's always accurate in 
Canvas, but people don't always understand it,

368
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:43,120
which honestly shouldn't be a problem, 
because I highly recommend that instead

369
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,400
you point the students here, because 
this is always gonna be accurate.

370
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,680
This shows the cumulative participation 
grade, what they've earned at this point,

371
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,520
and this shows their weekly points.

372
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:54,880
And if they click in, they can 
even get it broken down more.

373
00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:00,720
So that should be really where they 
go until the end of the semester when

374
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:09,200
Yellowdig will show the exact 
proper grade and Canvas.

375
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:16,240
Yeah. I don't know how else to talk about that, 
except to say that what's passed back in Canvas

376
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:21,840
at the earning period is the 
proportional grade as it's going forward.

377
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:25,280
And then the following earning period 
will go. It will dip back down.

378
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:28,560
And students often find that 
to be disconcerting. We are,

379
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:33,760
just so you know, working on other 
ways to sort of reflect that. But

380
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:39,040
that's still a work in progress. But you will not 
go wrong if you tell them just to rely on this.

381
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:43,360
I mean, in my own classes, I count on 
participation pretty heavily, about 20,

382
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:49,280
25 percent of the students didn't really 
see that great until the end of the course.

383
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,280
They you know, if they wanted 
to know where they were,

384
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:54,800
that's where they were. And that's sort 
of how I think about it personally.

385
00:33:54,800 --> 00:34:00,640
>>Right. You know, I think if we did this, we 
might tell instructors to keep the grade hidden

386
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:07,360
in the Canvas grade book idea until the end of 
the term. Right, and then the students can see.

387
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,440
>>Right. They'll always be able 
to see here where they are.

388
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,440
>>Right. Yeah. So I was 
more interested in sort of,

389
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:18,320
you know, does the information from Yellowdig 
automatically feed into the Canvas grade book,

390
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:23,280
there's no manipulation to be done by the 
instructor in order to transfer the points from.

391
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,960
>>The only thing you have to 
do is and this is important

392
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,680
when you're setting up 
Yellowdig in your Canvas shell.

393
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:37,040
You need to set it up as a single assignment and 
Canvas - one assignment for all of Yellowdig.

394
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:44,560
And students must enter through that assignment at 
least one time in order to enable the pass back.

395
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,166
>>OK.
