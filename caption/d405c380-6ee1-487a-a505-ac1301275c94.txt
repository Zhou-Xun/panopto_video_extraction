00:00:00,265 --> 00:00:05,265
Welcome to Part two of the Session on Causality, which focuses on the sufficient cause model

2
00:00:05,265 --> 00:00:10,265
and the Bradford Hill criteria.

3
00:00:10,265 --> 00:00:16,265
The sufficient component caused model is also referred to as Rothman's Causal Pie model

4
00:00:16,265 --> 00:00:21,265
or simply the sufficient cause model. This is a theoretical, mechanistic

5
00:00:21,265 --> 00:00:26,265
model where each causal pie represents a sufficient causal mechanism.

6
00:00:26,265 --> 00:00:32,265
And that's what's shown here on this slide with these three theoretical causal pies,

7
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:37,265
each of which represents a sufficient cause of a given health or disease outcome

8
00:00:37,265 --> 00:00:43,265
and various sets of sufficient causes or sorry component causes

9
00:00:43,265 --> 00:00:48,265
that each contribute to the sufficient cause represented by the pie.

10
00:00:48,265 --> 00:00:53,265
So each pie represents a sufficient causal model representing a minimal set

11
00:00:53,265 --> 00:00:58,265
of conditions or events that are sufficient for the outcome to occur. The

12
00:00:58,265 --> 00:01:04,265
sufficient cause model acknowledges the multifactorial etiology of health outcomes.

13
00:01:04,265 --> 00:01:10,265
This means, more specifically, it acknowledges that different individual cases

14
00:01:10,265 --> 00:01:15,265
of a health or disease outcome may be caused by a different set of component

15
00:01:15,265 --> 00:01:20,265
causes that together make up a sufficient cause for that health

16
00:01:20,265 --> 00:01:25,265
outcome to occur. Here's an example on

17
00:01:25,265 --> 00:01:31,265
this slide, which shows a hypothetical sufficient cause model for TB

18
00:01:31,265 --> 00:01:36,265
infection. So causal pie's A, B and C each represent three

19
00:01:36,265 --> 00:01:43,265
sufficient causes, each of which is made up of different component causes.

20
00:01:43,265 --> 00:01:48,265
For example, in causal pie, A we have exposure to TB indicated

21
00:01:48,265 --> 00:01:54,265
as T equals one and unknown, which is indicated as you

22
00:01:54,265 --> 00:01:59,265
a very important aspect of sufficient cause. Models is acknowledging that there are often

23
00:01:59,265 --> 00:02:04,265
unknown causal components in disease etiology. And we indicate these

24
00:02:04,265 --> 00:02:10,265
with the letter U. And causal pie b again, we have exposure to

25
00:02:10,265 --> 00:02:15,265
DP indicated as T equals one, but now we have AIDS as a equals one. And

26
00:02:15,265 --> 00:02:20,265
poor nutrition as other component causes that would lead to that individual person

27
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:25,265
developing TB infection. And similarly with C. Again, we have exposure to

28
00:02:25,265 --> 00:02:30,265
TB. And again, we have poor nutrition, but we have crowded housing as a different component

29
00:02:30,265 --> 00:02:35,265
cause that leads to the development of TB infection.

30
00:02:35,265 --> 00:02:41,265
Note here that the presence of each causal component indicated by that variable equaling

31
00:02:41,265 --> 00:02:46,265
one implies that their absence where the variable would equal zero would

32
00:02:46,265 --> 00:02:52,265
block the occurrence of the outcome. Here are some definitions,

33
00:02:52,265 --> 00:02:57,265
component causes are events or conditions that play a necessary role in the occurrence

34
00:02:57,265 --> 00:03:02,265
of some cases of a given disease. So in each of these three causal pies,

35
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:08,265
we have component causes that makeup together, a sufficient cause.

36
00:03:08,265 --> 00:03:13,265
So in pie A, we have two component causes contributing to sufficient cause. A.

37
00:03:13,265 --> 00:03:19,265
And in pies B and C, we have three component causes that contribute to sufficient causes.

38
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:24,265
A necessary cause is an event or condition

39
00:03:24,265 --> 00:03:29,265
that plays a necessary role in the occurrence of all cases of a given disease must be

40
00:03:29,265 --> 00:03:34,265
present for the disease to occur. You'll note that exposure to TB or T

41
00:03:34,265 --> 00:03:39,265
equals one is common across A, B and C. There are no scenarios in which

42
00:03:39,265 --> 00:03:45,265
TB infection occurs with exposure to TB. Thus exposure to TB

43
00:03:45,265 --> 00:03:50,265
is a necessary cause. A causal complement is

44
00:03:50,265 --> 00:03:55,265
our other factors, which are necessary and sufficient conditions for a factor to produce

45
00:03:55,265 --> 00:04:00,265
disease. So in causal pie, a on a mixture of unknown factors

46
00:04:00,265 --> 00:04:05,265
are the causal complement to exposure to TB, whereas in B, having AIDS and

47
00:04:05,265 --> 00:04:11,265
poor nutrition are causal complements to the necessary cause. Exposure to TB and in causal

48
00:04:11,265 --> 00:04:17,265
pasi, poor nutrition and crowded housing are causal complements to exposure to TB.

49
00:04:17,265 --> 00:04:22,265
The sufficient cause model helps us to understand the multifactorial nature of disease causation.

50
00:04:22,265 --> 00:04:27,265
And it acknowledges that there is often an unknown contribution to disease causation. It's important

51
00:04:27,265 --> 00:04:34,265
to note here that the composition of you may vary both between people and between populations.

52
00:04:34,265 --> 00:04:39,265
They also help us to understand that the fraction of a given disease attributable to its component

53
00:04:39,265 --> 00:04:44,265
causes often sums to 100 percent. And this is due to the multifactorial

54
00:04:44,265 --> 00:04:50,265
nature of disease etiology. If this concept is confusing to you, it is explained very

55
00:04:50,265 --> 00:04:55,265
well on pages 14 and 15 of Modern Epidemiology.

56
00:04:55,265 --> 00:05:00,265
The sufficient cause model is probably more useful on a conceptual basis than an application.

57
00:05:00,265 --> 00:05:05,265
And this is because it does not depict sequential mechanisms. So we know from the previous

58
00:05:05,265 --> 00:05:10,265
lecture module that the timing of causation is very important. And we can't get an idea of timing

59
00:05:10,265 --> 00:05:16,265
from using the sufficient cause model. It also doesn't tell us much about direct versus indirect effects,

60
00:05:16,265 --> 00:05:21,265
effects of component causes. If we think those are important. So, for example, one component cause

61
00:05:21,265 --> 00:05:26,265
may exert its effect through causing a second component cause, which in turn exerts

62
00:05:26,265 --> 00:05:33,265
an effect on the outcome. And we can't really disentangle this very well from the sufficient cause model.

63
00:05:33,265 --> 00:05:38,265
Next is Bradford Hill's viewpoints or criteria, you may often hear them referred to

64
00:05:38,265 --> 00:05:45,265
as criteria. But this was not the intention of Bradford Hill when he developed these viewpoints.

65
00:05:45,265 --> 00:05:50,265
These these nine viewpoints are debated in the literature. Some

66
00:05:50,265 --> 00:05:55,265
of them have been disproven and are not used. Some of them are very useful. Some of them apply

67
00:05:55,265 --> 00:06:01,265
in certain scenarios, but not others. There is a great deal of subjectivity in using Bradford

68
00:06:01,265 --> 00:06:06,265
Hill's viewpoints, the ones that I think are most important and most useful. I've bolded

69
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:11,265
here, but that doesn't mean that the other ones may or may not be useful to you in your own work.

70
00:06:11,265 --> 00:06:16,265
And I will say that often I find that these nine viewpoints are useful when assessing a body

71
00:06:16,265 --> 00:06:21,265
of literature rather than thinking with respect to one individual study.

72
00:06:21,265 --> 00:06:26,265
So let's go over them very briefly. The first is strength of association. And this one's actually

73
00:06:26,265 --> 00:06:32,265
very useful. And the idea here is that the stronger and observed association is the more likely

74
00:06:32,265 --> 00:06:37,265
that the relationship is causal as opposed to representing bias or error.

75
00:06:37,265 --> 00:06:42,265
So when we observe a very, very weak magnitude of association, we it's more likely

76
00:06:42,265 --> 00:06:47,265
that this week magnitude of association may be due to residual confounding or bias rather than a real

77
00:06:47,265 --> 00:06:53,265
effect. However, on the flip side, observation of a weak association

78
00:06:53,265 --> 00:06:58,265
does not negate the possibility of causality. There can be true effects that truly are weak in

79
00:06:58,265 --> 00:07:03,265
magnitude. The second is consistency. And this one is a little bit more

80
00:07:03,265 --> 00:07:08,265
subjective, and the idea here is that consistency is the repeated observation of an association

81
00:07:08,265 --> 00:07:13,265
in different populations under different circumstances. And this one is often actually not

82
00:07:13,265 --> 00:07:18,265
used because a consistent association may simply affect the consistency

83
00:07:18,265 --> 00:07:23,265
of bias or confounding across studies. If all models are wrong and they're all wrong

84
00:07:23,265 --> 00:07:31,265
in the same direction, we will observe a consistent association and might just be the wrong association.

85
00:07:31,265 --> 00:07:36,265
And here are some reasons why true causal associations may not appear consistent.

86
00:07:36,265 --> 00:07:42,265
We won't go over these in depth. But there are many reasons why a true causal association

87
00:07:42,265 --> 00:07:47,265
may not appear consistently in different populations using different study methods

88
00:07:47,265 --> 00:07:49,890
and at different times. If

89
00:07:54,395 --> 00:08:00,395
leads to a single effect and not multiple effects. And this criteria or viewpoint

90
00:08:00,395 --> 00:08:05,395
is generally considered to be invalid because there are many real causes that actually do have multiple

91
00:08:05,395 --> 00:08:10,395
effects. So I would recommend ignoring this one. The next is temporality.

92
00:08:10,395 --> 00:08:16,395
This is probably the most important viewpoint of Bradford Hill and simply this is that the exposure

93
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:22,395
must proceed, the onset of disease. This is essential for causation, and it's an arguable.

94
00:08:22,395 --> 00:08:28,395
It can be difficult to establish temporality. We need to conduct studies that can

95
00:08:28,395 --> 00:08:34,395
that can accurately measure the correct ordering of exposures occurring before diseases.

96
00:08:34,395 --> 00:08:39,395
So, for example, poor childhood nutrition must necessarily precede

97
00:08:39,395 --> 00:08:45,395
the rate of cognitive aging as an outcome.

98
00:08:45,395 --> 00:08:50,395
The next is biological gradient, which is also referred to as a dose response relationship

99
00:08:50,395 --> 00:08:56,395
here, the relationship between the magnitude or dose of an exposure and the risk of outcome

100
00:08:56,395 --> 00:09:01,395
is often regarded as strong evidence for causality. This slide shows

101
00:09:01,395 --> 00:09:06,395
three examples of different types of dose response relationships. So the

102
00:09:06,395 --> 00:09:11,395
first is a monotonic relationship between the exposure and disease, whereby

103
00:09:11,395 --> 00:09:16,395
as the dose or amount of the exposure increases, the risk of

104
00:09:16,395 --> 00:09:21,395
the disease linearly increases correspondingly. In the middle of

105
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:26,395
the slide, we have J shaped relationships. An example here is the relationship between

106
00:09:26,395 --> 00:09:31,395
the alcohol consumption and the risk of cardiovascular disease, where we observe

107
00:09:31,395 --> 00:09:36,395
increased risk of cardiovascular disease at very low levels of alcohol consumption or

108
00:09:36,395 --> 00:09:42,395
no alcohol consumption, which then decreases with very minimal amounts of alcohol consumption

109
00:09:42,395 --> 00:09:47,395
and then increases quite a bit at higher levels of alcohol consumption. And

110
00:09:47,395 --> 00:09:53,395
the third common type of dose response relationship that is often observed is a threshold

111
00:09:53,395 --> 00:09:58,395
relationship or a threshold pattern whereby below a certain level of exposure, we

112
00:09:58,395 --> 00:10:03,395
do not see any change or increase in the risk of an outcome. But beyond a certain

113
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:09,395
threshold level, the risk of the outcome increases quite a bit.

114
00:10:09,395 --> 00:10:15,395
The next Bradford Hill viewpoint is plausibility. This is also referred to as biological rationale.

115
00:10:15,395 --> 00:10:20,395
And here this means that there should be a scientifically plausible mechanism between the exposure

116
00:10:20,395 --> 00:10:25,395
and the outcome, which can help us to infer causality. An important

117
00:10:25,395 --> 00:10:30,395
caveat here is that Hill noted that the knowledge of the mechanism is limited by the current state

118
00:10:30,395 --> 00:10:36,395
of evidence. And so we should actually take this with a grain of salt because the plausibility

119
00:10:36,395 --> 00:10:42,395
of a given exposure outcome relationship can change with time as our knowledge and evidence grow.

120
00:10:42,395 --> 00:10:47,395
The next is coherence. This one is very straightforward and basically implies that

121
00:10:47,395 --> 00:10:53,395
a cause and effect interpretation for an observed association should not conflict

122
00:10:53,395 --> 00:10:58,395
with what is known of the natural history and biology of disease. This is closely related to the

123
00:10:58,395 --> 00:11:03,395
plausibility viewpoint. The next is experimental evidence.

124
00:11:03,395 --> 00:11:08,395
And so this can come from laboratory experiments in animals or humans such as randomized controlled

125
00:11:08,395 --> 00:11:14,395
trials. However, it is often not ethical or possible to randomly assign

126
00:11:14,395 --> 00:11:19,395
exposures. We know that we can't always get experimental data. And so a lack of

127
00:11:19,395 --> 00:11:24,395
experimental evidence should not preclude our ability to infer causality.

128
00:11:24,395 --> 00:11:30,395
OTUS specific exposure, outcome, relationship. And finally, analogy

129
00:11:30,395 --> 00:11:35,395
where Bradford Hill recommends that the effect of similar factors may be considered. This is not considered

130
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:41,395
to be a useful criterion and I wouldn't recommend using it. And that's it for part two.

131
00:11:41,395 --> 00:11:46,395
The next is part three, which will focus on potential outcomes and DAGs in the live Zoom lecture,

132
00:11:46,395 --> 00:11:51,962
which is happening on Thursday, September 3rd, beginning at 10:30 a.m. Eastern Time.
