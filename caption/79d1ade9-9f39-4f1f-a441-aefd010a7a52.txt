1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,780
I just want him to be honest about it. But I didn't want to work on the project.

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:09,300
Just tell me that. And I was glad we do have this kind of credibility and that's great.

3
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:20,760
We didn't want to do it, but I don't have to because I have to go on.

4
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,500
I just look like I want somebody else to affect my brain.

5
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:34,440
It's not fair. I know. I'm just going to do it this afternoon.

6
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:42,900
And, you know. You know, it's kind of scary.

7
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:52,920
Doesn't matter. You know, I definitely had the comparison of our greatest try.

8
00:00:52,950 --> 00:01:00,410
Something you used to like.

9
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:09,450
I don't know. Did you show up for office hours? Did you ask questions like, how do you how do you purchase based on the interactive was an.

10
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:19,220
I don't understand how it might be for just you know because he said he doesn't check.

11
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:34,640
I think it's I think it's did you do your. Basically it's just chatting what like I would start with great I think should be evident and then he

12
00:01:35,850 --> 00:02:13,110
would be happy and I feel like that's my a job that they have done so much fast in advance and I'm like.

13
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,710
Does this make sense?

14
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:52,040
No, I don't want to be able to bring people to think about it.

15
00:02:52,310 --> 00:03:05,200
Okay. I did my part because most people don't realize that.

16
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:24,680
So it's like you're trying to get me and I'm like, oh, yeah, you're a law student.

17
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:47,330
I no, I'm not just saying, but that I can see these guys.

18
00:03:48,820 --> 00:04:00,090
Yeah, I've seen. Let's see. I know. But I was like, well, if you're just joining us because like I said, I would want to talk.

19
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:06,560
I mean, I don't think I want to tell you what you're going to call great.

20
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:10,490
But for the time being.

21
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:15,410
Yeah, I get any word I like.

22
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:21,790
Reminds me a lot of a lot of other things.

23
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:30,140
Brings me back. Today we're going to talk about social networks and some social class.

24
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:33,140
I like a lot of information to share with you.

25
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:41,440
Um, well, one of sort of started off pretty broad in terms of social relationships and all of this.

26
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:49,580
And it's important because, you know, we know that social relationships influence the stress and stress management.

27
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:57,500
What we talked about last week and they sort of showed up in those stress models is ways that we can suffer the effects of stress on outcomes.

28
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:07,910
So what impact that a little more today. So the people in our lives influence our health in both positive and negative ways.

29
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:15,980
In terms of positive, they help us cope with stress and they also help us get us through times of sadness.

30
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:23,060
They provide us with tangible resources such as food, money, and perhaps a place to live.

31
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:28,610
If you must reassurance and let us know that we're doing okay and things will

32
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:34,099
get better and they give us information that we can use to help ourselves,

33
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:38,509
such as, you know, for example, who might be a good doctor to see.

34
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:48,460
So social relationships can really help with passing information, and they can also encourage healthy behaviors.

35
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:54,800
They might ask us to go exercise with them or remind us to see a clinician about a particular issue.

36
00:05:55,670 --> 00:06:03,260
And they might also help us manage our illness, such as reminding us to take our medication or giving us a ride to our doctor's appointments.

37
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:07,230
And they also provide us with a sense of purpose.

38
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:16,500
And one of the ways that happens is that when we're in social relationships, we acquire various roles like parent, teacher, doctor, friend,

39
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:25,680
nurse, etc. And through these roles it creates a sense of meaning and purpose and belonging that can really have positive effects on our health.

40
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,610
So our social relationships can also have negative consequences around health.

41
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:40,470
So the individuals in our lives can create great actual stress.

42
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:49,520
For example, say an individual develops a serious illness, they can inadvertently create stress for many people in that person's life.

43
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:56,190
The financial troubles of a particular network member might spill over into the lives of other people in that network.

44
00:06:56,250 --> 00:07:02,780
So another example of how social relationships might have a negative impact on people.

45
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:10,820
They can also, in terms of our social relationships, they can also cause us both physical and emotional harm.

46
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:22,430
We all know, for example, about domestic violence that I'm sure we can all name someone who is not ready was a critical comments.

47
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:29,030
And those comments, depending on how serious they are, have the potential to cause pretty serious emotional harm.

48
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:37,570
And then the people in our lives can also encourage unhealthy behaviors, for example, for trying to quit smoking.

49
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:43,340
But everyone in our social network smokes. It might be more difficult to really quit in that circumstance.

50
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:50,570
And lastly, through the people in our lives, we can pass infectious agents to one another, for example,

51
00:07:50,570 --> 00:08:00,980
a minor cold virus between each other and also something as serious as a sexually transmitted infection.

52
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:08,770
But on the whole, though, despite some of the negative things that might come out of social relationships on the whole,

53
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:16,630
individuals who are socially isolated tend to have a higher risk of death compared to those who are connected to other people.

54
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:21,250
So social relationships on the whole have a positive impact on people.

55
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:30,490
So when we talk about a social network, what what exactly are we talking about?

56
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:37,180
So one definition really considers a web of social relationship that really surrounds an individual,

57
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:41,200
and it also includes the characteristics of those ties.

58
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:47,480
So more simply, who are the people in our lives and what is the nature of those various relationships?

59
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,890
That's what we really think of when we think of a social network.

60
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:59,460
And when we talk about social networks, we talk about them from the perspective of a particular individual.

61
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:04,230
So, for example, we can map out the connections of every single one of you.

62
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:09,560
You would be at the center and then we would map out who exactly you're connected to.

63
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:15,090
And that's what we refer to as an egocentric or personal network.

64
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:25,080
And ego typically refers to self. So when you see ego centered network, think of a network map from the perspective of a single person.

65
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:33,780
And we can also talk about whole networks where we plot out, for example, like an entire community who knows who.

66
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:42,640
And instead of focusing on any one individual, we can also get a sense of, you know, what this whole network might look like in a larger community.

67
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:55,430
So this plot of a social network was produced by Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler.

68
00:09:55,950 --> 00:10:02,450
And in one of your readings and this is just a piece of a network and what I wanted you to see here

69
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:09,080
is that each of these dots represents a person and each line represents who is connected to whom.

70
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:13,670
So when we look at this social network, we can see how does it.

71
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:22,710
This is just, again, a piece of a whole network. So what you can see here is that these maps can get pretty complicated very quickly.

72
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:26,810
So this is just a little piece of a very large network.

73
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,259
But these sorts of maps can tell us a lot of things.

74
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:39,020
For example, you know, if you look at the people on the outskirts of this network, so sort of over here down there,

75
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:48,650
that that sort of tells us that these people may not have as many social resources when they're sort of on the edges.

76
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,219
So when we talk about various characteristics of a social network,

77
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:02,760
some of these characteristics apply to an entire network and some characteristics applied to individual connections,

78
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:06,060
such as the nature of the relationship between two people.

79
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:15,060
So exam, for example. One way we can characterize relationships, relationship between two people are through complexity and multiplexing.

80
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:24,750
Basically what that refers to is the range of support provided or the number of functions that are served in a particular relationship.

81
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:32,430
So what are the types of supports that are provided? Is it only one type of support or are there multiple types of support?

82
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:38,790
So in a few moments, we'll sort of talk about the different types of support and all all that a little more.

83
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:45,600
And we can also talk about the density of a social network.

84
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,409
And by density,

85
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:55,380
I'm referring to the number of people in that network know each other relative to the number of people in their network who could know each other.

86
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:01,860
So when you look at a social network, you can get a sense or as many people connected to each other as you would expect.

87
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:06,920
And the more dense the network is, the more people who are connected to each other.

88
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:10,920
And that may be a good reflection of how you said that network actually is.

89
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:16,500
So when you see a picture of a really dense network, that's a sign of cohesion.

90
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:27,960
You can also talk about dispersion or proximity, and that simply refers to how close geographically are the people in that network to one another?

91
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:32,430
Do they all live in the same community or are they all spread out throughout the nation?

92
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:41,400
And we can also talk about durability and duration, and that simply refers to how well and how long have people know one another.

93
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:50,820
Are these lifelong relationships or most of these relationships in the person's network fairly new because they perhaps relocated, for example?

94
00:12:51,750 --> 00:13:00,840
So so these are the different characteristics of a social network and what you might try to describe.

95
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:08,069
Pretend we have a few more. We can also talk about frequency,

96
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:16,560
which is often how does contact occur between members of a social network and that can be face to face email, letters, cell phones.

97
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:24,329
And we can talk about the homogeneity of a social network and that that really simply refers to how

98
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:30,209
similar are the network members to one another in terms of things like like demographic factors like age,

99
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:38,520
gender, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status that might affect the beliefs that are sort of held within that network.

100
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:43,799
And we can also talk about the intensity or strength of social relationships.

101
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:49,410
And by that, but simply rehearsing emotional closeness people have to one another.

102
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:54,059
And in general, the stronger or more intense a relationship,

103
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:58,620
the more kind of supports that are pretty there are typically exchanged between two people.

104
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:07,620
And we can also talk about reciprocity, which refers to how support is given and how much support is received in a given relationship.

105
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:12,240
Is one person giving more than another or is a relatively equal?

106
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:20,810
And finally, we can talk about the size and range of the social network, which essentially refers to how big or small a social network that faces.

107
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:28,799
So what I talked about are the characteristics of a social network,

108
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:34,290
and we often refer to these as sort of the structural characteristics sort of on the surface.

109
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:41,770
What does this social network look like? So the people.

110
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:51,340
So the people in our line should perform various functions.

111
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:57,389
One of those functions is to provide social support, and we'll talk about this more in a little bit.

112
00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:01,020
But another social comparison and another is social influence.

113
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:05,250
And then there's also social engagement. There are even more functions.

114
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:09,570
But I just want to focus on these for today to give you a snapshot.

115
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:20,100
So social influence is one function, and it's really described as a process by which thoughts and actions are changed by others.

116
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:27,420
So this could be things like social norms, and it can also be encouragement to engage or not engage in a particular behavior.

117
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:34,130
For example, we can think of things like peer pressure that fall under this category.

118
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:42,600
Social influence over way is perhaps one person offering a cigaret another person.

119
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:47,610
And another way that's very subtle is where you might see a lot of people

120
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:53,610
smoking and it feels like he or she needs to smoke as well in order to fit in,

121
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:57,470
even though nobody is overtly offering someone a cigaret.

122
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:01,230
So sort of the influence can be both over and over.

123
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:11,100
So another function of our social network is social comparison.

124
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:18,030
And technically, this could be considered a special form of social influence.

125
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:22,040
But it's important enough that I wanted to sort of pull it out and discuss it differently.

126
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:29,640
So as human beings, we sort of gauge how well we're doing by comparing ourselves to people who are similar to us,

127
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:34,500
sort of doesn't know different than those of the people we have nothing in common with.

128
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:40,380
So in social comparison, we're really comparing ourselves to people who are like us.

129
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:44,040
And there are three sort of major types of social comparisons.

130
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:51,649
There is downward comparison. That's when we're comparing ourselves to people who are doing worse than we are.

131
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:55,370
And the idea is that it helps us feel better about where we are.

132
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:02,510
And then there's upward comparison when we're comparing ourselves to people who are doing worse than we are.

133
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:10,819
And the idea is that it helps us feel like we're comparison as comparing ourselves to people who are a little better than we are.

134
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:16,790
And this can sort of serve as a source of inspiration, or it can promote learning through modeling.

135
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:20,620
And we talked about modeling when we talked about social cognitive theory.

136
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:24,709
And finally, there's a third type which is lateral comparison.

137
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:31,150
And this is when you related, compare yourself to people who are on the same level as you instead of being better or worse.

138
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:38,720
The lateral social comparison creates a sense of camaraderie and sort of reduces feelings of isolation,

139
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:44,150
and it makes you feel like you're not alone in whatever issue you're dealing with.

140
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:50,690
So a classic example of this is why we may all be able to relate to is when professors return your

141
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:57,530
assignments or exam grades to students and show the class the distribution of grades in the course.

142
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:02,060
So say a third of it has got to be used. So in a particular midterm, let's call it bias.

143
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:08,959
So if you're by assessment and a third CS and a third grade is the students with

144
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,960
B's might do a downward comparison of their grade with those who got CS and think,

145
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:18,710
Hey, I did pretty well on that exam compared to that group of CS.

146
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:27,440
And the students with B's might also do an upward comparison with students who got A's and think I might try to put in a little more studying,

147
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:31,460
just like they did to see if I can reach their level in the final exam.

148
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:40,459
And the students with B's might also do a lateral comparison to other students who got B's and think a third of this class did just as well as I did.

149
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:49,280
So there are quite a few around me who are really demonstrating mastery of the material at the level that I do so.

150
00:18:52,550 --> 00:19:01,490
So lateral comparisons may even sort of show you you're at the same place and I

151
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:06,650
think can really help again with camaraderie and feeling like you're not alone.

152
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:24,150
Okay. So then the last major function of social networks is social engagement, and this is simply the things that we do with other people.

153
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:29,190
So this can mean participating in a variety of social activities, such as clubs,

154
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:34,230
organizations, meeting friends for dinner or coffee or saving a movie with other people.

155
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,850
It can also include attending church and school and workplace activities.

156
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:45,270
So when we interact with other people, we acquire roles such as friend, teacher, researcher,

157
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:50,250
colleague, and those roles create again a sense of purpose, meaning and belonging in our lives.

158
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,020
So again, social engagement can also be health promoting.

159
00:19:55,770 --> 00:20:02,160
So when we engage in perhaps, for example, health promoting clubs, maybe you're part of a running club.

160
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:09,240
You might be more likely to engage in physical activity due to sort of social elements of that club.

161
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:18,679
So this is a model in some of your readings and it provides a conceptual model of

162
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:23,719
how we can think about the relationships between social networks and social support.

163
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,780
And so sort of bringing those two things together.

164
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:39,830
And then there's sort of an excessive use of double headed arrows in this trigger that doesn't really align with the text in the reading.

165
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:46,250
If you take a look at that, so just set up one on one that if you revisit this model again,

166
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:49,640
but this model is saying a few things that I want to point out.

167
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:55,880
I'm saying that social networks and social support can have direct effects on our health regardless of stress.

168
00:20:56,330 --> 00:21:02,060
You take stress out of the equation in social networks, in social support, do have direct impacts on their health.

169
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:11,060
They can also have direct effects on our individual and community level coping resources that are evident by parts two and four.

170
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:21,420
I mean, these coping resources can also change or modify the effect of stress on our physical, mental and social health to aim for.

171
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:25,850
And this is similar to what we see in the transactional model of stress and coping.

172
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:30,450
So we talked about loss in our networks and social support can also cause.

173
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:39,660
So part three and like I mentioned before, although they can have a lot of positive benefits, they can also have negative influences as well.

174
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:42,420
And lastly with Part five,

175
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:51,959
it shows us that our social networks and the social support we receive can also influence the behaviors that we engage in that relates to our health.

176
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:58,080
And this can have a actual reciprocal relationship on more digital health outcomes.

177
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:05,580
So why do we care about the characteristics of a social network?

178
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:06,910
Why does this matter?

179
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:14,490
So the reason why we care about it is that characteristics of a social network influences the availability and flow of social support,

180
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:20,250
but also the spread of beliefs, behaviors and disease from person to person.

181
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:26,880
And we'll talk about this in a little bit, but it also affects the way we approach and design our interventions.

182
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:36,120
So for those of you who are single and looking, I have some data for you to consider.

183
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:43,800
So how we are meeting our partners has dramatically changed over time.

184
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:52,610
You guys are so intensive and things like this might be a little bit relevant now.

185
00:22:53,610 --> 00:23:02,820
You know, over time we've been seeing a rapid increase in meeting people online and especially from the 1990s to present.

186
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:10,770
But when we look at the purple line there, which means meeting, meeting people through friends and acquaintances.

187
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,379
And it used to be that meeting people through friends and acquaintances.

188
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:20,970
So potentially through our social networks was really a predominant way that people met their partners.

189
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:28,530
And although this is clearly declining, as you see in the graphs and meeting people online has dramatically risen,

190
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:34,920
it's still high compared to some of these other ways that you might meet someone or find love.

191
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:40,260
Um, so it's still very up there in terms of one of the main ways that you might think on purpose.

192
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:47,400
So the lesson here, ask people in your social network, you know, if you're looking.

193
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:03,190
So we'll get to the article you read by her staff and Fowler in a little bit,

194
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:08,649
but I wanted to highlight a few areas in which they've shown sort of social and

195
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:14,530
health related phenomena spread through social networks and across their studies.

196
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:22,510
Christakis Themselves. And so some behavioral phenomena to spread between one and three degrees of separation,

197
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:28,630
where they've been able to find some sort of statistical significance based on the data that they've been looking at.

198
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:39,370
So so this is this is basically showing obesity and we're going to impact this one a little more.

199
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:49,270
So the Y axis shows like an increase in percentage and probability of the ego being obese if the alter ego is so.

200
00:24:49,300 --> 00:25:01,090
So the probability that I am obese, if my alter my friend is also obese and alter social distance, this might derive from this friend of a friend.

201
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:05,140
Friend of a friend of a friend. So that's what that means by the 1 to 3.

202
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:20,110
So since basically saying I'm more likely to be obese if my direct friend is more likely to be obese, they have to show this was smoking as well.

203
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:35,990
Getting seven or more hours of sleep. Heavy drinking.

204
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:48,260
Abstaining from alcohol. Marijuana use.

205
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:59,210
Long way. So then think about this for a minute.

206
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:08,310
You. So the increase in probability that I am lonely if my alter is lonely.

207
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:14,260
So clearly we're not that good of friends. We seem to be connected, but we both feel lonely.

208
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:23,959
Yeah. I feel like that's kind of like it has to do with, like how we talk to each other and,

209
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:29,750
like, how you express gratitude, appreciation towards the person.

210
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:35,660
Cause, like. And my family and my siblings all have different ways to be like, Oh, I really appreciate,

211
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:42,380
like you being my sibling and one of my sisters, huge aunt hugging, so you never feel left out because she'll give you a hug.

212
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:46,400
My other sibling, though, is just, like, hot. It just.

213
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:52,910
It feels less because you're. Because you compare how people are showing that they like to be with you.

214
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:58,810
Like it is a family setting. So they like that has a lot to do with that where people are like in relationships.

215
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:02,840
Other people are discovering that. Yes.

216
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:09,690
I love that example and that you brought that up because I'm going to be able to put some terms around that.

217
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:17,800
So there are some definitions and concepts around exactly what you just described, which is sort of to describe what we're saying here.

218
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:24,760
Okay. So I have a couple bonds of depression as well.

219
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:36,730
So we we are more likely to experience depression, I guess, in terms of our direct relationship between particular people.

220
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:46,960
Happiness as wealth. Smiling in your profile picture.

221
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:59,290
Divorce. Okay.

222
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:06,340
So I think we saw the trend, right? I mean, across such a wide variety of social phenomena.

223
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:15,550
So when I talk about the Christakis and Fowler article, the spread of obesity in a large social network over 32 years.

224
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:24,490
So the purpose of this study was to really test the hypothesis that people with similar behaviors associate with each other.

225
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:29,590
So sort of testing the same birds of a feather flock together,

226
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:42,280
and then they use weight gain as a proxy to sort of examine if behaviors that lead to obesity cluster within a social network.

227
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:51,400
And they looked at associations between an ego's weight, the person of interest, and not of their friends or people in their network.

228
00:28:52,000 --> 00:29:00,070
And they also wanted to see if sex, sex of the person, smoking behavior or geographic distance,

229
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:04,510
perhaps change the effect seen in an ego and an alternative weight.

230
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:14,890
So how did they do this? So they looked at secondary being there on this crazy hand-held, steady state in fashion.

231
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:23,080
And this study actually provided a pretty nice dataset because this is a study that's been going on for the

232
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:30,610
past 50 years where they point preyed on people in a town related to their cardiovascular risk factors.

233
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:36,730
So as you can imagine in all of this study, subjects are really coming from the same town for a period of time.

234
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:41,020
Many of them probably are connected to each other in some way, shape or form.

235
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:46,390
And they were able to figure out how people are connected through tracking sheets.

236
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:51,400
So in a research study, when you're following study participants and doing data collection,

237
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:57,760
especially at multiple time points, we typically ask folks to provide their emergency contacts.

238
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:03,820
So from the data, Christakis and Fowler piece together the network they used in this study.

239
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:07,720
So who did you put out as your first emergency contact?

240
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:10,719
You know, we can criticize that.

241
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:22,180
That might not reflect not may not give us a lot about the nature of that relationship, but it's sort of a sort of a rough sort of proxy.

242
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:25,420
Who did you put as your, like, first and second contact?

243
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:34,510
And again, you can't ascertain the quality of those relationships, but you get a again, a first stab of how people might be connected to each other.

244
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:40,990
And though now says they did what is very complex, but they did adjust for homophily.

245
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:51,130
And what homophily is, is a tendency for people to choose relationships with people who have similar sort of antecedent attributes as them.

246
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:59,830
So when you hold this constant meeting, whether or not you hang out with people who are more like you in social network,

247
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:07,870
you're better able to sort of tease out if there's an influence on a person's behavior on the person they're connected to.

248
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:12,540
And this is what they referred to as social contagion.

249
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:15,970
So one person's behavior influencing another person's behavior.

250
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,440
In biological contagion, you've probably heard that.

251
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:25,250
Is that a transmission of a biological agent, such as an infection from one person to another?

252
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:37,000
So what do they find? They found that proximity and smoking behavior didn't necessarily change and alters weight gain on the ground.

253
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:46,310
The more socially removed you are from a person, the less likely an ego is to experience weight gain.

254
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:55,280
They also found effects to arms to be stronger in certain types of relationships.

255
00:31:55,280 --> 00:32:03,750
So married couples, siblings, same sex friendships, mutual perceived friendship or ego perceived friendship.

256
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:11,809
So what that means is a mutual perceived friendship, as we both put each other as our emergency contact.

257
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:16,490
So we both acknowledge each other as friends. When is ego perceived?

258
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:21,050
You put me down, but I never put you down. So I perceive you as my friend.

259
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:24,649
But it may not be reciprocated.

260
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:35,180
So I think we refer to that as frenemies that you don't perceive as a.k.a. frenemies, perhaps shorthand for.

261
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:35,569
Remember,

262
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:45,920
waking was again used as a proxy in the study to suggest that certain behaviors that lead to weight gain are transmitted from person to person.

263
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:53,180
So we're not transmitting the pounds from one person to another, and it's the behaviors that potentially lead to obesity.

264
00:32:55,400 --> 00:33:01,940
So the medical community and public health have sort of different perspectives on obesity at times.

265
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:05,840
And I want us to tie back to some definitions.

266
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:09,740
So based on the CDC definition are labels.

267
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:17,300
These are labels attached to ranges of weight that have been shown to increase risk for health problems.

268
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:23,360
So you can be overweight or obese based on your height weight ratios, but also be perfectly healthy.

269
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:38,060
So the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute suggests that BMI, which was the thing measured in this study, is only one indicator.

270
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:48,049
Abdominal fat is another, and risk factors related to other sort of obesity related conditions are also another.

271
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:55,670
So based on this, it really sounds like it's the health risks of conditions that manifest for weight gain that

272
00:33:55,670 --> 00:34:01,729
are transmitted from person to person through similar behaviors and not a particular disease.

273
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:06,950
And so so we see this, you know, one, why am I getting so literal about this?

274
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:11,900
So I see this because there's obesity as a contagion.

275
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:21,379
And pathology was severely sensationalized following the release of this study that we just talked about, for example,

276
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:30,080
in Christakis and Fowler's book Connected, where they talk about their work and sort of a whole host of factors that spread through social networks.

277
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:42,409
This is what was used to sort of hook in the lay audience to really understand their findings.

278
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:46,700
So your colleagues and sisters can make you fat even if you don't deliver.

279
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:55,290
So these are the headlines publicizing the study that came from many common themes.

280
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:13,250
So what do you think of this? Yeah, I think like really simplified.

281
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:20,980
It's a lot of correlation being looked at as causation by like the idea.

282
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:29,900
So correlation being interpreted as causation are what I describe to you.

283
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:36,620
My summary of that study by Christakis and Fowler was completely correlational.

284
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:45,390
It was not an observational study. Yeah.

285
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:52,200
I mean, that also plays on the fact that, like, being overweight or obese is like a negative thing.

286
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:56,670
It's like it's it's made us be aware. Friends and family.

287
00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:03,840
Obesity is catching. That's negative. You like it feels like a fear, like a danger factor.

288
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:07,080
And it's just like that's not that's not what this is about.

289
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:12,959
It really isn't. Yeah. It is like a blame game.

290
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,650
Like, I don't know, like, I just. I don't really like it, cause it's just like.

291
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:23,300
Not the people who you hang around like you aren't who you hang around all the time.

292
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:31,430
It's like you can be that one person to change. Like, Hey, look, I can introduce healthy habits like etc. like I don't really.

293
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:43,310
I don't get it. Right. So perhaps putting greater emphasis on the power of social networks than the actual reality

294
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:50,150
when it comes to the transmission of health behaviors and information and beliefs.

295
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:10,280
Yeah. It makes me wonder, like they're saying, okay, if you're a non obese person who's obese, your chances of being obese go up.

296
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:16,110
But is that like a reverse effect where if you're an obese person starting your own non-obese people,

297
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:21,710
does your chance of becoming healthier increase or is it only in the negative?

298
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:26,779
Yeah, because I guess you can exactly. You can interpret in the other way.

299
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:34,880
I mean, that's all sort of public issues, but a way perhaps the findings could have been.

300
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:41,860
Spun in a health promoting weight that was even a possibility.

301
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:53,310
So there were implications that were briefly described in the study.

302
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:58,740
So how would you change some of those headlines that you saw to you?

303
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:03,660
You suggested one way to just sort of flip it around.

304
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:13,210
But could these findings be packaged differently? Yeah.

305
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:21,630
Maybe you can say that the behaviors of the people around you. Okay.

306
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:31,200
So greater emphasis on behaviors, even if they weren't able to catch or measure particular behaviors in that study, at least, you know,

307
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:39,030
we can speculate some of the types of behaviors that might lead to obesity and overweight,

308
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:43,500
and perhaps there are opportunities to emphasize the role of those behaviors.

309
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:58,880
You might not only just be like the behavior of the group or maybe like the average behavior, like what's normally accepted within the group.

310
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:04,209
So like if you hang around a group of people that you know their pants engage in a certain kind of behavior,

311
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:08,920
the longer you're around them, the more likely you're going to engage in that similar kind of behavior.

312
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:20,370
So that's a great point. So today, what you're describing is sort of a time effect here and sort of going back to what Tim said,

313
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:25,060
like it's correlational, but when you add a time element to it, you don't really know.

314
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:33,510
How long does it take for that contagion to sort of pass on to the other person, especially when we think about health behaviors?

315
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:38,980
I imagine it's not as fast moving as an actual infectious disease.

316
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:50,800
So I want to talk a little bit about loneliness.

317
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:58,920
So more than 300 million people globally seem to not have a single front and more than

318
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:03,270
20% of people don't have friends or family they can count on whenever they need them.

319
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:09,360
So that's some of the data on loneliness in our society.

320
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:20,190
What is loneliness? So. I mean, it's a subjective feeling of having inadequate social connections.

321
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:26,480
And this is important to understand the definition, because loneliness is about our perceptions.

322
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:29,610
We're talking about social networks.

323
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:40,320
Social isolation is defined as more of an objective sort of distance based definition, as in sort of pertains to our social network.

324
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:48,750
So, you know, when we're looking at those maps, we're sort of seeing how people are in proximity in terms of how they're actually connected.

325
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,560
But loneliness is not the same thing as that. Loneliness is different.

326
00:40:52,560 --> 00:41:01,740
It's about how it's sort of this subjective feeling of having inadequate social connections and how we perceive our social connections.

327
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:07,170
So nearly 40% of adults in America report feeling lonely.

328
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:14,190
I mean, our current surgeon general, Vivek Murthy, describes it as an epidemic plaguing Americans.

329
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:21,270
So loneliness, based on these statistics is it's an epidemic in our country.

330
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:32,530
So one way of buffering the effects of stress on health is through how we cope, and social support can really play a big role in that.

331
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:39,410
So I want to unpack social support a little more, given that it's also one function that our social network serves.

332
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:49,160
So there's substantial evidence for protective effects of social connections on risk of mortality from all causes.

333
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:52,729
So this graph is right out of your textbook.

334
00:41:52,730 --> 00:42:01,600
Sorry, it's a little crooked, but what it shows is the odds of decreased mortality based on a variety of factors that protect them.

335
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:05,870
That's what we sort of see on the Y axis here.

336
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:12,530
It includes smoking cessation, abstinence from alcohol, flu vaccine, physical activity.

337
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:18,770
And this was from a meta analysis which is essentially pulling data across the literature.

338
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:23,950
So across lots and lots of studies, they pulled all that data, reanalyzed data.

339
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:32,060
And what is very clear from this graph is that social relationships and high social support have

340
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:37,790
the greatest odds of decreased mortality on our health compared to all of these other factors.

341
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:42,929
And that's that's pretty huge for our field.

342
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:48,150
So we haven't really focused nearly as much, you know,

343
00:42:48,210 --> 00:42:52,890
in terms of our public health efforts nationally on strengthening social

344
00:42:52,890 --> 00:42:58,650
connections between people as much as we have on curbing tobacco use or obesity.

345
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:05,430
I mean, when you think about the amount of funding we pour into different types of prevention programs,

346
00:43:06,390 --> 00:43:12,900
we see a lot with tobacco and obesity, but not so much in terms of strengthening our connections.

347
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:22,259
So it's not to ignore these other factors, but considering enhances and social supported interventions can be even more powerful,

348
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:29,760
given that it has one of the highest odds of decreasing our mortality.

349
00:43:32,850 --> 00:43:40,470
And you know what I think of, you know, reflecting back last week and I talk to you about my dad a little bit in his recovery,

350
00:43:40,890 --> 00:43:45,210
I really believe it was social support that aided him through his recovery.

351
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:51,299
Obviously, he got medical care, but I really think what helped him was social support.

352
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:56,400
And I think some of this literature might support that assumption.

353
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:07,430
So what is social support? Social support is aid and assistance in exchange through social relationships.

354
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:11,510
That's essentially what that is. So how do we help one another?

355
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:16,450
That's the question I'm asking. When it comes down to.

356
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:28,320
And one thing I really want to emphasize with social support is that by definition, it's always given with the intention of being home.

357
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:36,420
So if someone does something with no intention of the action being helpful, that would not be Social Security.

358
00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:52,809
It is given with the intention of being. So when we talk about supportive acts, you typically classify them into one of four categories.

359
00:44:52,810 --> 00:44:56,360
And the first one is emotional support.

360
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:01,810
So emotional support includes acts involving empathy, caring, love and trust.

361
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:06,880
So it might be something like giving someone a hug, telling someone that you love them,

362
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:11,860
letting someone cry on your shoulder, or even just calling to see how someone is doing.

363
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:20,379
Instrumental support refers to any behaviors that directly help the person in need.

364
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:29,380
And it could be you could be providing hands on care to someone such as provided by a caregiver.

365
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:39,190
It could be giving someone money. You might be shoveling someone's driveway of snow or picking up leaves, or even just giving someone a ride.

366
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:45,670
So it's something tangible. And because of that, sometimes it's referred to as tangible social support.

367
00:45:45,670 --> 00:45:48,850
So you see tangible sort of social support.

368
00:45:49,090 --> 00:45:52,210
That's sort of the same thing as instrumental support.

369
00:45:54,390 --> 00:46:01,770
In the last two forms of social support are both information based forms of social support, appraisal and informational.

370
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:08,340
So appraisal support is information that allows an individual to sort of evaluate how they're doing.

371
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:13,190
And it might be a job evaluation that you get from your supervisor.

372
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:19,950
It could be a grade on an assignment that you turned. It could be someone just telling you that you're doing an okay job.

373
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:27,180
So so that that sort of all those things sort of fall under the bucket of appraisal support.

374
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:29,640
And then there is informational support,

375
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:37,350
which refers to things like advice and suggestions given with the intent to help someone manage or deal with an issue.

376
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:43,319
So I want to distinguish an instrumental and informational support.

377
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:49,410
So instrumental support is a tangible act that is done for someone to help them.

378
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:54,450
And informational support is just giving information with the intent of being helpful.

379
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:58,200
So if someone is having a financial issue,

380
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:03,179
instrumental support would be giving them money and an informational support might

381
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:08,790
be recommending them to a financial adviser sort of assisting with the same issue,

382
00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:14,040
but a little different. Would you say appraisal and reassurance kind of is kind of like reassurance?

383
00:47:16,430 --> 00:47:27,360
It can be. I would say reassurance might fall under emotional support, but I could also see it in context.

384
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:35,060
So my boss might reassure me that I'm doing just fine if I ask it.

385
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:42,389
So in that context, I would say that's appraisal support because they're telling you you're doing just fine,

386
00:47:42,390 --> 00:47:46,860
but you're like worried and I'm reassuring you because you're my friend.

387
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:56,650
I think I would put that under emotional support is. And.

388
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:10,519
So what I point out important distinctions between actual support that it's an exchange between two people and how it is perceived.

389
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:22,459
So perceived versus being supported so receives support is really the exchange of social support that is intended to be supportive and perceived.

390
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:34,250
Support is is really about beliefs and perceptions about the support received that are held by the individual receiving the support.

391
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:42,590
So it's a mouthful. But what we know is that receive, perceived and receive support is only moderately.

392
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:47,870
That's all we know from the beginning. Let me give you an example.

393
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:56,330
So one time my husband and I were making pasta and we were making some sauce and

394
00:48:56,330 --> 00:49:01,190
we were putting mushrooms in them and there were there was dirt on the mushrooms.

395
00:49:01,490 --> 00:49:07,879
So I proceeded to wash them and he was like, You can't wash the mushrooms.

396
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:18,050
They're going to absorb all the water. And he was upset because he felt it ruined the sauce because I watched the mushroom, not just trying to health.

397
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:24,230
It's a two person job to make the sauce. That was my role to assist with the mushrooms.

398
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:28,580
So I put them under water to get the dirt off.

399
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:36,930
So I was I was trying to provide support, but it was not received as support.

400
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:44,320
In that situation. Apparently, you're supposed to brush off the dirt.

401
00:49:44,530 --> 00:49:49,899
I'm not sure. I always in where he was going with that.

402
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:55,810
But again, I perceive and receive support is only moderately correlated.

403
00:49:56,500 --> 00:50:07,060
If it was perceived as support, I would have clean them exactly the way he expected them to be in order to be adequate for themselves.

404
00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:19,549
So perceived support is more protective on our home and receives support is not perceived

405
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:23,840
as being helpful by the recipient and associated with higher rates of mortality.

406
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:27,720
So I put my husband in a high hotel.

407
00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:41,810
So high for interventions aimed at social supports and social relationships need to improve perceptions of support received by the receiver.

408
00:50:42,410 --> 00:50:50,840
That's really important. Like if perceived support is most protective of our health and interventions, we really want to capitalize on that.

409
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:54,680
We're giving support. We want to make sure it's actually perceived as a support.

410
00:50:59,050 --> 00:51:04,990
So let's talk about intervention approaches. And I want to talk about these a little broadly.

411
00:51:05,410 --> 00:51:06,910
And I'm going to talk about them broadly,

412
00:51:06,910 --> 00:51:14,410
because I really hope you get creative with this in your in your intervention projects that you're doing in your groups.

413
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:25,240
So the goal is that interaction should facilitate trust, closeness and caring, mutual interdependence and exchange.

414
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:30,610
And any support enhancing intervention really needs to begin with some sort of

415
00:51:30,610 --> 00:51:34,920
assessment of the social networks that are maintained by the study population.

416
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:38,890
Like you really need to sort of find the needs and the strengths.

417
00:51:42,450 --> 00:51:45,809
So this is a quote from James House.

418
00:51:45,810 --> 00:51:55,139
He was a longtime faculty member at U of M and I believe in public policy and sociology.

419
00:51:55,140 --> 00:52:05,070
And he did a lot to sort of develop the literature on how we understand social support and what

420
00:52:05,070 --> 00:52:10,170
he says in order to effectively enhance the health protective functions of social networks.

421
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:14,100
We really need to ask the question of who should provide what to whom.

422
00:52:17,610 --> 00:52:24,510
So. So in thinking about who effectiveness of support may depend on the source.

423
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:31,530
So a natural or informal network of family, friends, coworkers, supervisors?

424
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:38,520
Is there formal helping networks which are health care providers and social service workers?

425
00:52:39,630 --> 00:52:49,220
So, you know, when you're helping someone with your using your MPH credentials and in a more professional role, you're in a formal helping.

426
00:52:52,730 --> 00:53:02,810
So, you know, when you think about this, how effective how is how effective is support given with respect to these two groups?

427
00:53:04,670 --> 00:53:13,100
So an effective provision of support likely to stem from people who are you know, when it is affected,

428
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:20,150
it's likely to stem from people who are socially similar to the support recipients and people who have experienced similar stress.

429
00:53:20,390 --> 00:53:27,110
So when you go back to social cognitive theory coping model, that's essentially what that is.

430
00:53:27,530 --> 00:53:36,200
So it's likely to stem from people who are socially similar to the support recipients and people who have really experienced similar stressors.

431
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:43,640
Empathetic understanding is really means more likely to support.

432
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:54,590
They typically have an empathetic understanding and they're more likely to provide support that's in line with the needs and values of the recipient.

433
00:53:55,370 --> 00:54:06,739
And we know that intimate social ties is sort of best used for emotional support, and other relationships are better suited for informational support.

434
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:16,130
So that's where perhaps more informal helping networks might make the most sense with informational support.

435
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:21,890
So people in close relationships are often distressed by the same sort of stressors.

436
00:54:22,190 --> 00:54:31,339
So the quality of the support can be affected by that and also sort of create a negative response just from that supporter.

437
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:34,520
So let me give you an example of this.

438
00:54:35,510 --> 00:54:44,659
So going back to my dad when he was in the hospital, he was losing a lot of weight and he wasn't really eating that well.

439
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:51,739
And that wasn't a good thing because again, he was completely paralyzed, needed to build up his muscle mass again.

440
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:56,030
And obviously good nutrition helps with that. So here I am,

441
00:54:56,030 --> 00:55:03,480
his public health train daughter in the hospital room with him telling him exactly

442
00:55:03,830 --> 00:55:09,170
you need you need to eat is going to help you with your recovery need protein.

443
00:55:10,910 --> 00:55:18,620
And he you know, he's upset and he essentially said you don't know what you're talking about at night, you know?

444
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:25,920
So then I go talk to his doctor. I leave the room and go talk to his doctor and express my concerns.

445
00:55:26,210 --> 00:55:36,260
Say you need to tell him to focus on his diet. So then he goes in there and talks to him about, you know, eating and how that might help him.

446
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:44,270
And then, you know, my dad then turns to me when he leaves and he's like, you know, I might like this.

447
00:55:44,990 --> 00:55:50,160
Maybe it was like an omelet or an egg, something with protein. So he sort of got on board with that advice.

448
00:55:50,810 --> 00:55:54,410
We were essentially telling him the same thing, both of us being heard.

449
00:55:54,410 --> 00:56:02,840
It's from the informal health network, more than, I guess the natural informal network, which is me in that role.

450
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:10,110
Doing his job is. So it's really the combination of formal and informal helpers that may be most

451
00:56:10,110 --> 00:56:14,430
effective in situations in which both informational and emotional support are.

452
00:56:17,230 --> 00:56:25,780
So when we think about why perceptions of support recipients rather than objective support, is once strongly linked to health and wellbeing.

453
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:33,370
So we really need to identify behaviors perceived as supportive before really designing any sort of an intervention.

454
00:56:34,030 --> 00:56:38,589
So you really need to work with the target population to identify sort of previous

455
00:56:38,590 --> 00:56:43,210
successful experiences and those that have not worked to sort of get the whole picture.

456
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:51,490
So what are our perceptions of support that the population perhaps you're looking to engage with, with your intervention?

457
00:56:51,490 --> 00:56:54,460
What is it that they perceive as supportive?

458
00:56:57,060 --> 00:57:04,350
And then when times have networks and social support, they enhance well-being and health are different according to age,

459
00:57:05,310 --> 00:57:08,570
developed and developmental stage of the support recipient.

460
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:13,649
So people who experience a major life transition or stress or benefit from different

461
00:57:13,650 --> 00:57:18,420
types of support during sort of various stages of coping with that stress.

462
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:29,230
So you really need to think about how. Okay.

463
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:35,830
So I want to talk about four broad categories of social support interventions.

464
00:57:37,330 --> 00:57:48,280
As we wrap up here. So one of those approaches is enhancing existing network ties.

465
00:57:49,630 --> 00:57:55,060
And this offers a lot of untapped potential. There are challenges to this,

466
00:57:55,060 --> 00:58:03,510
like identifying our members who are sort of committed to providing support and sort of have the resources to sustain that commitment.

467
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:09,670
And really also identifying changes in attitudes and behaviors that will really

468
00:58:09,670 --> 00:58:14,470
result in increased perceived support on the part of the support recipient.

469
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:19,460
And intervening in ways that are consistent with established norms and styles of interaction.

470
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:28,420
So those are just some of the challenges. But one approach in a broad category of interventions is enhancing existing network ties.

471
00:58:30,550 --> 00:58:36,830
And then another broad category of social support interventions is developing new linkages.

472
00:58:36,830 --> 00:58:44,200
And so this is useful when the existing network is small, overburdened or unable to provide effective support,

473
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:48,700
and new ties are introduced to sort of reduce chronic social isolation.

474
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:56,560
Some of the new ties are introduced in response to major life transition or perhaps a specific stressor.

475
00:58:57,070 --> 00:59:01,660
You can introduce mentors or advisors, people especially.

476
00:59:01,660 --> 00:59:05,860
You've already coped with the situation being experienced by the individual.

477
00:59:06,190 --> 00:59:11,620
You can introduce buddies going through the same experience at the same time.

478
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:17,049
Self-help groups. The role of the supporter is really mutual, mutually shared.

479
00:59:17,050 --> 00:59:20,050
So there are really high levels of reciprocity.

480
00:59:21,070 --> 00:59:26,890
So those are all things that sort of fall under developing new network linkages.

481
00:59:28,780 --> 00:59:32,180
And then there's the use of Indigenous natural helpers.

482
00:59:32,190 --> 00:59:36,729
So these are network members. Naturally, we naturally turn to advice,

483
00:59:36,730 --> 00:59:45,640
support and other types of aid and these folks are usually respected and trusted in the network and responsive to the needs of others,

484
00:59:46,210 --> 00:59:49,780
and they give leading network members to resources outside the network.

485
00:59:50,230 --> 00:59:59,470
They typically, you know, they work in the community and we often want to identify people who started demonstrate those.

486
00:59:59,910 --> 01:00:07,510
So when I think of the social network of being the natural helper that sort

487
01:00:07,510 --> 01:00:12,220
of become the natural helpers they come to mind to me are Jackie and Kieran.

488
01:00:12,430 --> 01:00:20,770
They're sort of at the core of the network and they've established themselves as providing advice, support and other types of aid.

489
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:26,420
They're consistently sort of respected and trusted by our students.

490
01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:30,980
So, you know, when I think of a natural helper and the network of we.

491
01:00:35,150 --> 01:00:39,800
And then there's enhancing networks through community capacity building and problem solving.

492
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:46,370
And these interventions aim to address broader community issues and also strengthen social ties.

493
01:00:46,370 --> 01:00:51,040
And you can sort of combine these strategies to really maximize the impact of.

494
01:00:58,430 --> 01:01:06,560
So I want to give you an example of how our program was developed on some of the provinces we talked about today.

495
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:10,880
And so I want to talk about Big Brothers, Big Sisters of America.

496
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:21,020
And, you know, sometimes when a program scales up to the extent that this did are may not you know,

497
01:01:21,020 --> 01:01:26,390
sometimes we don't see in terms of its true elements as we did in the past.

498
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:29,480
But what I do want to point out here is, you know, why was this formed?

499
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:35,240
And, you know, what did they intend to do? And, you know, sort of see some of the principles we've talked about come to life.

500
01:01:36,050 --> 01:01:45,020
So social connectedness is a major factor in protecting youth from engaging in behaviors that may be detrimental to their health.

501
01:01:45,530 --> 01:01:51,710
I mean, Big Brothers and Sisters of America have a 110 year history.

502
01:01:52,920 --> 01:02:02,420
And for more than a century, they've been helping change children's perspective and giving them the opportunity to sort of reach their full potential.

503
01:02:03,230 --> 01:02:11,780
And they have more than a century of volunteers, donors and advocates to really sort of thank for that.

504
01:02:11,810 --> 01:02:14,360
So it all sort of started. How did this come about?

505
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:25,520
In 1904, there was a young New York City court clerk named Curtis Colter, who was seeing more and more boys come through his court.

506
01:02:26,210 --> 01:02:30,770
He recognized that caring adults could actually help many of these kids stay out of trouble.

507
01:02:31,700 --> 01:02:38,540
And he set out to sort of find volunteers that were sort of the beginning of the Big Brothers movement.

508
01:02:38,810 --> 01:02:40,100
And around the same time,

509
01:02:40,490 --> 01:02:49,550
there was members of a group called Ladies of Charity that were befriending girls who came through the New York Children's Court as well.

510
01:02:50,660 --> 01:02:58,760
And that group would later become Catholic Big Sisters. And both groups continued to work independently until about 1977,

511
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:07,790
when Big Brothers Association and Big Sisters International really joined forces to become Big Sisters, Big Brothers, Big Sisters of America.

512
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:17,450
So they the point of this is they're really meant to be bringing caring role models into the lives of children.

513
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:23,040
And they operate in all 50 states and in about 12 countries around the world.

514
01:03:23,060 --> 01:03:32,330
And it's really based on the premise of having a mentoring program to reduce risk behaviors that might be faced by people.

515
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:37,520
So what is Big Brothers, Big Sisters of America do?

516
01:03:38,540 --> 01:03:44,870
What they essentially do is they provide mentors to use living in single parent households.

517
01:03:45,950 --> 01:03:51,589
Their national office typically provides like standards of the program and particular guidelines.

518
01:03:51,590 --> 01:03:59,000
And the expectation is for local affiliates to adopt to their local communities and their communities.

519
01:03:59,510 --> 01:04:08,270
And they essentially match mentors who are volunteers with youth and based on gender and geographic proximity and availability.

520
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:14,520
And they typically sort of spend about 12 hours a month with their mentees for at least a year.

521
01:04:15,030 --> 01:04:19,609
They provide training and really sort of monitor their relationship.

522
01:04:19,610 --> 01:04:27,249
And it's. The goal is really just on addressing specific problems,

523
01:04:27,250 --> 01:04:37,610
but really sort of meeting the EU's basic developmental needs in terms of the different types of supports we offer or talked about.

524
01:04:38,390 --> 01:04:49,030
So they really want to sort of engage them in more social activities with each other, you know, eating out, attending sports events,

525
01:04:49,030 --> 01:04:55,299
hoping that some of those elements of social supports that we talked about sort of pass through that relationship.

526
01:04:55,300 --> 01:05:00,850
So, you know, does this program actually work? Well, they've done some evaluations on this.

527
01:05:00,850 --> 01:05:05,259
And I think, you know, some of the data to show you has relevance to, you know,

528
01:05:05,260 --> 01:05:10,330
the broad scope of mentoring programs that we see out there on so many levels.

529
01:05:11,110 --> 01:05:16,210
So they did do a randomized controlled trial with youth across eight cities.

530
01:05:17,530 --> 01:05:25,270
And 18 months after being large, they did see pretty good results.

531
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:32,380
They saw better attitudes towards school, better attendance,

532
01:05:33,370 --> 01:05:41,530
less likely to engage in antisocial behavior, less likely to initiate drug and alcohol use.

533
01:05:42,490 --> 01:05:52,870
And they sort of attribute this really to rigorous matching and the relationships sort of formed between the mentor.

534
01:05:52,870 --> 01:06:03,550
And then there are these sort of connecting relationships and the supports that can pass through them just based on the evaluation of one program.

535
01:06:03,970 --> 01:06:09,730
And you can sort of see that there are profound effects of this kind of behaviors and how.

536
01:06:11,630 --> 01:06:14,920
So give you a lot of information.

537
01:06:15,070 --> 01:06:21,800
You know, there are many questions. Okay.

538
01:06:21,860 --> 01:06:24,860
So your theory. Assessment is all about social support.

539
01:06:24,870 --> 01:06:29,990
You'll get to watch a short video and try some of the that you talked about today.

540
01:06:30,620 --> 01:06:35,330
So again, let's do on Friday, if you have any questions, feel free to reach out to us.

541
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:47,690
See you next week. Three things.

542
01:06:48,710 --> 01:07:01,270
I know that's not what it was.

543
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:05,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah. My dad. Exactly.

544
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:07,080
I feel like I want to go.

545
01:07:07,790 --> 01:07:31,580
I finally got 25 to $49, so was like, I like having such a hard time and like, I guess the things I've ever had in my life before I go to work here.

546
01:07:31,790 --> 01:07:50,030
Okay, so it's not like I can't afford to because I phone and I will tell you that the White House,

547
01:07:50,340 --> 01:07:55,370
meanwhile, I know never doing what I just heard today.

548
01:07:56,060 --> 01:08:01,220
I'm so sorry I didn't interrupt the call.

549
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:13,410
My that next time I know better than I really have no right to.

550
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:28,380
I go to Lansing. I'm just like like I was thinking, what do I feel like?

551
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:35,210
I'm like, oh, my God, I'm growing.

552
01:08:35,610 --> 01:08:43,960
It's fine. I just got sick and I wouldn't mind.

553
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:48,400
So I talk about my little boy all the time.

554
01:08:48,800 --> 01:09:03,470
I was like, Oh, you know what she said? The why, I think, is that when I'm like, I'm not thinking about you being so skinny at all.

555
01:09:09,830 --> 01:09:15,420
Oh, never mind. I don't know.

556
01:09:16,670 --> 01:09:26,010
We're off for now. I can't sit down to my last year.

557
01:09:27,030 --> 01:09:36,320
I'm not hungry. And I guess I want to encourage you to feel like.

558
01:09:37,070 --> 01:09:48,750
Yeah, right. Yeah. I have to be like, I want to take the point of the aging.

559
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:55,040
It's like when you have chance, you know,

560
01:09:55,040 --> 01:10:05,960
the kind of thing what color were you ask for you would I want to go through that like 27, very agitated, like just went with.

561
01:10:06,260 --> 01:10:10,110
No, you're right. Sort of like. So why did you ask that?

562
01:10:10,140 --> 01:10:19,760
Lashing out like a color, like if she would have went like, you know, and I was like, yes, okay, let me see if I could see you again.

563
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:30,470
This is kind of stupid. How much do you think you could take the oath?

564
01:10:31,190 --> 01:10:35,089
Oh, here it is. If you want to send out. Okay. I see.

565
01:10:35,090 --> 01:10:38,280
When you hear the other responses, somebody say burnt orange. Okay.

566
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:41,930
My friend was playing too much. They're thinking green like me. That's absolutely not.

567
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:47,329
It raised. It was like Halloween coming up is going to last longer to hold on to the issue because

568
01:10:47,330 --> 01:10:51,889
it was too much too much to want to do a black eye to get my ass for a couple of weeks.

569
01:10:51,890 --> 01:10:54,920
And my you must have a lot of money because I'm going to raise my hand.

570
01:10:56,790 --> 01:11:00,409
Oh, yeah? How much do they range? Sorry if I ignore it.

571
01:11:00,410 --> 01:11:05,809
I've just never really gone into detail, but at length it's easy for me to think, okay, so.

572
01:11:05,810 --> 01:11:10,880
But I mean, for them the last two months, that's like we're going to spend amount of money.

573
01:11:11,180 --> 01:11:14,750
Two weeks, usually for like how long does it take?

574
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:20,890
7 hours, but then depends on your size of your head. So like, I was my hair, so like my seven.

575
01:11:22,070 --> 01:11:25,400
But some people then how is your stick? These are media.

576
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:29,120
So I think we started at five and I left at 11.

577
01:11:29,260 --> 01:11:33,709
But we she said that two days.

578
01:11:33,710 --> 01:11:40,460
My momma did it. Yeah, I know her mom did. Is she literally would like we would go to her house and she would just like wake up doing whatever she.

579
01:11:40,460 --> 01:11:43,590
Mom, you can't keep in my head like this. Like I need. I'm done, you know?

580
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:48,170
You know, because it was something crazy. Can I touch it? And I feel it, you know?

581
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:56,860
So am I animal like, you know, I'm just always curious what I see African American 50 with like I loaded up there and

582
01:11:56,930 --> 01:12:02,440
I'm like I think the color stay there but you can just hear it out enjoy your old cart.

583
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:06,020
But my dad's house downstairs, it's like he'd have a suite.

584
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:10,340
So I will get it on and I'll get, you know, roll back home.

585
01:12:10,340 --> 01:12:22,160
She gets her son for three and oh, you know and we don't know it's like they will was 165 but I'm up here and how much this usually costs.

586
01:12:23,570 --> 01:12:28,380
Oh, you bring in $5 one of those big packs.

587
01:12:29,390 --> 01:12:33,110
But you got to get I like to have more than.

588
01:12:33,110 --> 01:12:36,589
Well, just in case I had too much. Yeah, my wife had four packs.

589
01:12:36,590 --> 01:12:42,020
I said, Well, you didn't tell me. You didn't tell me. I wasn't exactly screaming.

590
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:47,620
It's cold. And when they put the nothing whipped cream, it is so much on my head.

591
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:49,729
I know. I believe it was. Get on my shirt.

592
01:12:49,730 --> 01:12:54,220
I'm like, this is just too much that they lose on the pile to do a pilot and they because they have to spring.

593
01:12:54,810 --> 01:13:00,290
Oh, my God. It's so I do. But it because they were thick.

594
01:13:00,290 --> 01:13:03,380
So like, can you get wet? Yeah.

595
01:13:03,410 --> 01:13:09,139
But typically when I get my hair done, like in a couple of days, I don't like to get it with new and fresh.

596
01:13:09,140 --> 01:13:14,270
I'm my know but then it's like a month was. Oh yeah it usually it doesn't show.

597
01:13:14,270 --> 01:13:19,980
I mean I usually like what it's like new growth week I had to do so.

598
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:24,350
But it's not how you take care of it. If you don't take care of you, don't wrap it up.

599
01:13:24,350 --> 01:13:31,130
And I if you sleep on in I don't think people's opinions and colors but it's like, okay, oh my God, I want to make some mistakes.

600
01:13:31,310 --> 01:13:39,320
I was just curious to know because I've never, you know, even I would say I was just like looking like but the hair,

601
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:43,520
you know, you walk into class like I knew I bet I was like when I was there.

602
01:13:43,610 --> 01:13:46,670
All that. Oh, my God.

603
01:13:46,820 --> 01:13:50,719
Your hair grew overnight. Yeah. I didn't know your hair was that long.

604
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:54,340
I, i because right now I please don't blame them, you hear you?

605
01:13:54,400 --> 01:14:04,370
You always go. But like I used to when I was little, I used to get like, here, but I like I was only think about like back in the days.

606
01:14:04,370 --> 01:14:10,670
How long, like, you know, your, say, 6 to 7 hours, you know, how do they think that they would be on my phone back in the day?

607
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:14,850
All of our phones out the phone policy, finally.

608
01:14:15,310 --> 01:14:21,590
But what if you don't like what you look like, your stylists or like they're older, you get like a older.

609
01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:30,649
I've always say, like back in the day every year because you didn't class and you just sit there in silence for 7 hours.

610
01:14:30,650 --> 01:14:34,850
When I panel were little, my mom used to sit there for a couple hours and then she would go down the street,

611
01:14:35,060 --> 01:14:40,820
but she would teach me as I got older, she'll leave longer and they'll teach me to sit there.

612
01:14:40,820 --> 01:14:47,580
And then she always talk to the salons, do my hair, like how I imagine I always do like a rough session.

613
01:14:47,860 --> 01:14:53,870
And it's like you're sitting there, you're just sitting there doing, I can't even like I can't even talk to my friends.

614
01:14:54,730 --> 01:14:59,000
That's why you turn it down low. And then when you turn your right and you know, first of all, just takes.

615
01:14:59,010 --> 01:15:03,890
Yeah. Yes, it's really they got it. When I was a kid, they used to turn on movies for me.

616
01:15:04,310 --> 01:15:10,639
So like they used to the people at the place sometimes maybe I'll just sit there and watch a classroom and like a lot of places,

617
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:15,300
people come in with food like. Exactly. But my mom will always bring me food.

618
01:15:15,530 --> 01:15:21,680
She didn't trust that because, like, you're not trying to be rude, but it was like African, you know, the way they.

619
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:27,350
They were having to wash your food. Yeah. Oh, really? Wash your hands like everybody would dig in in the same.

620
01:15:27,350 --> 01:15:35,089
I don't I'm on a don't they that is this your what about you know if his pinkie toes please.

621
01:15:35,090 --> 01:15:40,970
Hello. I did I think you're being great.

622
01:15:41,810 --> 01:15:45,049
They don't get it because they're not. I tried to explain it to you guys.

623
01:15:45,050 --> 01:15:53,060
Remember, like black stories. Oh, I know. So I didn't have to wait for that.

624
01:15:53,780 --> 01:15:56,830
Oh, I'm. I'm concerned with the little space.

625
01:15:56,960 --> 01:16:00,650
My momma, that's where I used to wear my hair. So I was like that, too.

626
01:16:01,220 --> 01:16:06,980
Yeah, I used to like I started going out with when I was a certain age, that's when my mom was coming to the store,

627
01:16:07,190 --> 01:16:12,260
like not to sort of the shop, but, but like when my friend used to do it didn't last long.

628
01:16:12,650 --> 01:16:16,040
Like because they were just like it was just a quick sale for me to get through.

629
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:20,490
Yeah. For a couple of weeks I was kids who's out picking my hair?

630
01:16:21,110 --> 01:16:28,690
Out just it's just crazy the difference in like share prices of your guys's last two months for sure.

631
01:16:29,030 --> 01:16:32,630
I go to two days, two days, two days.

632
01:16:32,900 --> 01:16:38,360
Well, yeah, I mean, like the fluffiness and stuff. And like, even if I get it so precious, I feel like it will last like two years.

633
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:43,320
I like to it, but, like, you know, like the the texture and, like, how your hair is like.

634
01:16:43,340 --> 01:16:46,370
It's like it lasts, you know, all two months.

635
01:16:46,380 --> 01:16:51,300
Like, for me, I get blow dry and stuff and like, I get my hair straight and blow dry.

636
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:54,709
It's like six days and maybe 5 to 6 days.

637
01:16:54,710 --> 01:16:59,540
But then like, do you guys wash your hair? Everything. So I know I do my once a week.

638
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:02,740
Okay, I start doing that. I do it twice a week, okay?

639
01:17:02,990 --> 01:17:07,399
Just cause my hair's curly and then it starts to flatten out and then it looks ragged.

640
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:16,850
These get my watch in two weeks. And when I wear braids, it's like whenever my like, how long does like the washing?

641
01:17:16,970 --> 01:17:18,650
When you want, you're like, how long does it take?

642
01:17:18,650 --> 01:17:28,400
Like you saw like a lot of shampoo and conditioner when you really have to like every but rarely I notice, you know, I be lazy and not even that.

643
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:31,810
It's just like I got this in my hair for reason for to not wash it, like,

644
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:38,690
but if you do use like a a good amount that is like a down side and you focus on the scalp,

645
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:42,170
don't focus on the his this be like you want to focus on where it's growing.

646
01:17:42,170 --> 01:17:49,330
Yeah. And then, but I mean you could do it like you can come down like here where you're here is why but it's like nozzle application.

647
01:17:49,370 --> 01:17:56,360
Yeah, those nozzle and then you can use the little sponge things to like, you know and where does your real hair stuff you would say.

648
01:17:56,960 --> 01:18:02,000
Because I'm like trying to see where it it's really hard because there's still new hair stuff like here.

649
01:18:02,090 --> 01:18:09,829
Okay because I was like I saw this the like the black darker hair, the my yeah, that's but I'm going to mix with different colors to.

650
01:18:09,830 --> 01:18:12,959
Oh, yeah. So it's red and black. Yeah, I knew, I noticed that.

651
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:15,890
So I was noticing the, the roots. Yeah. The bus. Yeah.

652
01:18:16,250 --> 01:18:20,990
And now you're trying to see but shouldn't make the air weird because if it was already you could see it.

653
01:18:21,350 --> 01:18:24,559
But she makes it with red and black. So my hair and I cut my hair too.

654
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:27,980
So I got to see. So, like, just like Leila just said, guys.

655
01:18:27,980 --> 01:18:30,980
Well, my sister in law would like to be like, she had an appointment.

656
01:18:31,010 --> 01:18:37,309
Your hair like to get braids before she had my niece and she wanted to birth early and she was like, [INAUDIBLE] kill myself.

657
01:18:37,310 --> 01:18:41,450
Like, I'm like, the reason I give birth because I'm sweating my hair.

658

662
01:18:58,040 --> 01:19:01,279

663
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:04,759
Like your hair are hair can get mad. It's like we're not combing.

Yeah, I do. I had my memories, but that's like the struggle was like kids being mixed.

674
01:20:11,510 --> 01:20:15,649
Like if their mom's white and they can't do it. Yeah, because then they all they get it suppresses their whole.

675
01:20:15,650 --> 01:20:21,470
Like, my cousins are mixed, so my mom had to tell her they were like, listen, you got to take her to like that.

676
01:20:21,870 --> 01:20:25,579
Yeah, here is going to come out but times they tried to like white silence can't do it.

677
01:20:25,580 --> 01:20:31,620
And they will. They'll think they'll be doing something. It's coming out they both of them out of there.

678
01:20:31,940 --> 01:20:34,400
I'm at the moment I'm sending heartbreaking. That's right.

679
01:20:35,180 --> 01:20:42,829
I want to know the basics like Cosmo at least know how to party, like put the grease in and like sprayed it into the breast.

680
01:20:42,830 --> 01:20:46,070
And I want to do the basics, but I don't really want to carry my hair.

681
01:20:46,360 --> 01:20:49,550
I'm not going to do my own. You know, it's not real here.

682
01:20:50,120 --> 01:20:56,210
Oh, that is so cute. I remember that for Easter. But, you know, I never let me wear an old velvet dress.

683
01:20:56,670 --> 01:21:00,410
She she let me wear, like, the exact same dress.

684
01:21:01,100 --> 01:21:05,730
That black velvet. Yeah. Why? Oh, I had the green one Christmas bags for sure.

685
01:21:05,810 --> 01:21:09,140
Oh, I know. It was a red one. It was the right one. I thought this was sheer sleeves.

686
01:21:09,420 --> 01:21:18,380
I mean, I read one and I had a write one with the in the flared out and the ruffle socks for church for my kids are going to go through that phase.

687
01:21:18,390 --> 01:21:25,070
I have to this was the only way. For Kathleen.

688
01:21:25,790 --> 01:21:29,480
I have to like the class. Just laugh. That's a professor.

689
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:34,730
I give you three, hourglass, but don't ever say the full 3 hours that she talked so much.

690
01:21:34,790 --> 01:21:37,850
I guess she talks with you so much. Oh, yes.

691
01:21:37,890 --> 01:21:42,470
Only we still haven't always had that rare. The little bear with you.

692
01:21:42,620 --> 01:21:47,210
Meanwhile, you can have it for the loved ones and their sentences over Christmas.

693
01:21:49,010 --> 01:21:53,990
And I hope I can find it is there for me for Easter description bluray.

694
01:21:54,290 --> 01:21:58,850
But it is the way to go. I agree with your cameraman.

695
01:21:59,060 --> 01:22:04,549
That's great. Oh, is the red velvet? Oh, come on with that.

696
01:22:04,550 --> 01:22:07,700
Out of the blue. This is a picture I'm looking for.

697
01:22:08,240 --> 01:22:16,340
She kept the braids real short and the little button down, but it's moving to having braids and being uncomfortable in a dress.

698
01:22:16,650 --> 01:22:23,809
I'm like, Can I take these stockings off? You're like, All right, you're in the glass.

699
01:22:23,810 --> 01:22:27,440
We're going. Are you guys for. No. We were in prison.

700
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:30,860
We already suffered for the next week. I can't wait for it to be done.

701
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:34,970
Yeah. You'll be so happy.

702
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:38,780
I mean, how is it? You know, I'm going to lose my ear.

703
01:22:39,110 --> 01:22:45,130
I hear your voice. All right. Oh, I'm going. If you ask one more thing.
