00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:10,920
Hello. Welcome to this lecture

2
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,765
on statistical
hypothesis testing.

3
00:00:12,765 --> 00:00:15,960
In this lecture, we'll cover
the concept of p-values.

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,690
Now, making decisions,
it based upon data is

5
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,525
the bedrock of what we do
in public health science.

6
00:00:21,525 --> 00:00:23,670
However, as we have discussed,

7
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:27,360
we rarely encounter a cut
and dry foolproof decision.

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,595
Instead most of our decisions,

9
00:00:29,595 --> 00:00:31,935
also known as
statistical inferences,

10
00:00:31,935 --> 00:00:34,965
do require some leap of faith.

11
00:00:34,965 --> 00:00:36,870
It boils down to the question,

12
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,450
do my data give me
evidence that I believe

13
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:40,740
more than the level of

14
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,495
skepticism that goes
with that evidence?

15
00:00:43,495 --> 00:00:47,060
The amount of faith we have
to exercise has traditionally

16
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,580
fallen upon a single
calculated number

17
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:51,195
known as the p-value.

18
00:00:51,195 --> 00:00:54,800
It is one of the most commonly
known and unfortunately

19
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,330
misunderstood tools used by

20
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:59,465
both non statisticians
and statisticians.

21
00:00:59,465 --> 00:01:01,700
So today let's
examine what p-values

22
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,390
are and how we're going
to use them correctly.

23
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:06,890
So that end our learning
objectives are: first to

24
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:09,065
understand the
purpose of a p-value,

25
00:01:09,065 --> 00:01:10,670
then to relate the value of

26
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,950
the p-value to our
Type I error rate,

27
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:14,705
to comprehend how a p-value

28
00:01:14,705 --> 00:01:16,810
is determined from a set of data,

29
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:19,040
and then to understand
what incorrect conclusions

30
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,875
can be reached from p-values.

31
00:01:21,875 --> 00:01:25,430
Now, there are numerous specific
hypothesis tests that we

32
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:28,520
use in public health
including: one-sample t-test,

33
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:32,050
two sample t-test, Chi-squared
test of association,

34
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,580
and an F-test for
linear regression.

35
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,695
All of these tests
will be covered

36
00:01:36,695 --> 00:01:38,960
in our course and all of

37
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,645
these tests have a
specific null hypothesis

38
00:01:41,645 --> 00:01:43,840
and a specific
alternative hypothesis.

39
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,590
All of these tests will use

40
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:47,930
data to decide whether
or not they're

41
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:49,310
null hypothesis should be

42
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:52,430
rejected and all
of these tests use

43
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:54,800
a value known as
the p-value to make

44
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:58,085
the decision as to whether
or not to reject the null.

45
00:01:58,085 --> 00:02:00,105
So what is a p-value?

46
00:02:00,105 --> 00:02:01,800
A p-value is a number,

47
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,230
that ranges from zero to one.

48
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:06,920
Smaller values represents

49
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,710
stronger support of
the alternative.

50
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,960
The p-value is a measure of

51
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,430
how much our data and

52
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:16,370
the null hypothesis do not
agree with each other.

53
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,425
The smaller the p-value is,

54
00:02:18,425 --> 00:02:20,465
the more disagreement there is,

55
00:02:20,465 --> 00:02:23,255
between the data and
our null hypothesis.

56
00:02:23,255 --> 00:02:26,780
So therefore, the null is
incompatible with our data

57
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,115
and we must reject

58
00:02:28,115 --> 00:02:30,950
either the data or
the null hypothesis.

59
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:34,190
We always choose to side
with our data and therefore,

60
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:38,200
we reject the null hypothesis
with small p-values.

61
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,460
Therefore, how small does

62
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,950
the p-value have to
be before we are

63
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:44,600
comfortable saying that we have

64
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,495
enough data to reject
the null hypothesis?

65
00:02:47,495 --> 00:02:49,640
That decision is determined by

66
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,185
our desired Type I error rate

67
00:02:51,185 --> 00:02:53,345
which we discussed in
a previous lecture.

68
00:02:53,345 --> 00:02:57,110
Traditionally, this Type I
error rate is set at 0.05.

69
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,920
So therefore, any
p-value below 0.05,

70
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,110
gives us enough
evidence that we are

71
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:06,005
comfortable with rejecting
the null hypothesis.

72
00:03:06,005 --> 00:03:08,645
So therefore, any p-value
less than this number,

73
00:03:08,645 --> 00:03:10,790
we will reject the
null hypothesis

74
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,590
and accept the alternative.

75
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,545
In contrast, any p-value,

76
00:03:14,545 --> 00:03:18,560
that is above 0.05 or equal
to 0.05 does not allow us to

77
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,930
reject the null hypothesis and

78
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:24,055
our conclusion is that
we fail to reject it.

79
00:03:24,055 --> 00:03:27,650
Now, we can also focus upon
this range of p-values that

80
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:31,025
ranges from zero to around 0.05.

81
00:03:31,025 --> 00:03:33,080
Because p-values in general,

82
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,260
should be interpreted along
a continuum, unfortunately,

83
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:39,095
we typically, interpret
p-values as binary

84
00:03:39,095 --> 00:03:42,350
either above 0.05 or below 0.05.

85
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:44,060
But the actual number itself

86
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,880
indicates a level of
strength of evidence.

87
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,280
Anything below 0.05
we would reject

88
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,270
the null hypothesis and say
we have a significant result,

89
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:55,160
but perhaps from 0.01 to 0.05,

90
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,010
for p values we might say
we have strong evidence.

91
00:03:58,010 --> 00:03:59,540
Whereas, the p-value even

92
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,850
smaller below 0.01
we might say we

93
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:03,710
have overwhelming evidence or

94
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:06,250
a result that is
highly significant.

95
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,605
For p-values above 0.05,

96
00:04:08,605 --> 00:04:10,400
we could have a
p-value that is just

97
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,010
barely above 0.05 say 0.06.

98
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:15,620
Now, there is not enough
evidence for us to

99
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:18,710
say that we have statistical
significance but we

100
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:21,470
might say we have some weak
evidence that the null could

101
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:24,635
have been rejected and
any p-value above 0.1,

102
00:04:24,635 --> 00:04:27,095
we might say, there is
no evidence at all.

103
00:04:27,095 --> 00:04:29,215
So where do p-values come from?

104
00:04:29,215 --> 00:04:30,530
In this course, you will not

105
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:32,030
be computing p-values yourself,

106
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:35,390
they will be derived from
computations in a computer,

107
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:38,225
but it is useful to know
how they are computed.

108
00:04:38,225 --> 00:04:42,215
They come from your data and
the null hypothesis value.

109
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:45,290
Now remember, data are
typically summaries by

110
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:48,140
three values for this
point: the sample mean,

111
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,790
the sample standard deviation,

112
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,625
and the number of observations
or the sample size.

113
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,160
We take these three numbers
in combination with

114
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,195
the null hypothesis mean
which is Mu naught.

115
00:04:58,195 --> 00:05:00,470
We have a ratio of
two numbers which

116
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,525
we call a t-statistic.

117
00:05:02,525 --> 00:05:04,775
The numerator is our evidence

118
00:05:04,775 --> 00:05:07,490
comparing the null
and our data and

119
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:10,130
the denominator is our
skepticism or the amount

120
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:11,390
of variability we believe

121
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:13,100
would occur from study to study.

122
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,440
The numerator looks at
the sample mean and

123
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,065
compares it to the population
mean and the null.

124
00:05:18,065 --> 00:05:19,865
It determines how different

125
00:05:19,865 --> 00:05:21,710
these two numbers
are from each other.

126
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:25,220
Now, because our sample mean
changes from study to study,

127
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,450
we need to look at
this difference

128
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:29,180
relative to that
sampling variability,

129
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,740
which is in the
denominator and is

130
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,585
the standard error of the mean.

131
00:05:32,585 --> 00:05:35,030
It is the ratio of
these two numbers,

132
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,770
that helped me decide
whether or not

133
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:39,565
the data are in
conflict with the null.

134
00:05:39,565 --> 00:05:42,620
Now, if the null hypothesis is

135
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:46,340
true and I performed a
huge number of studies,

136
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:49,220
a histogram of all
those t-statistics,

137
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,335
would look like the
diagram on the right.

138
00:05:51,335 --> 00:05:53,435
If the null is true
those few numbers

139
00:05:53,435 --> 00:05:55,820
should be close to each
other and therefore,

140
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:59,015
these t-statistics showed
on average be zero.

141
00:05:59,015 --> 00:06:01,280
In fact, we know theoretically,

142
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,140
that all of the
t-statistics across

143
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,940
many studies should be centered

144
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,980
around zero with a
normal distribution

145
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,260
with a standard deviation of one.

146
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,420
From our previous
lecture we discussed

147
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,875
that if this is the case,

148
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:15,860
then a 95 percent of
all t-statistics,

149
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:19,250
should range between two
standard deviations of zero,

150
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,365
which is from
negative two to two.

151
00:06:21,365 --> 00:06:24,680
Therefore, the remaining five
percent of t-statistics,

152
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,565
either must be less than
negative two or bigger than two.

153
00:06:28,565 --> 00:06:31,020
Therefore, for this 0.05 is

154
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,180
related to our Type I error rate.

155
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,210
If our t-statistic is less than

156
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:37,325
negative two or greater than two,

157
00:06:37,325 --> 00:06:40,160
then the corresponding
p-value is less than 0.05

158
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,070
and we will reject
the null hypothesis,

159
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,620
because all of these
t-statistics are

160
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:48,770
extremely rare when the
null hypothesis is true.

161
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:52,190
They only occur in five
percent of studies.

162
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:55,070
In other words, our sample
mean is far enough away

163
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:57,595
from the null hypothesis
for the population mean,

164
00:06:57,595 --> 00:07:00,605
that we must reject
the null hypothesis.

165
00:07:00,605 --> 00:07:02,390
So moving back to our example,

166
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:04,445
looking at the mean
number of curious teeth,

167
00:07:04,445 --> 00:07:06,140
in children living in poverty,

168
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,760
recall that the null stated that

169
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,215
the average number of teeth
was four in the population.

170
00:07:11,215 --> 00:07:14,060
Imagine that we collected a
sample of 25 children and

171
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,835
got a sample mean of 6.7 teeth,

172
00:07:16,835 --> 00:07:18,925
with a standard deviation of 10,

173
00:07:18,925 --> 00:07:21,495
from these data and
this null hypothesis,

174
00:07:21,495 --> 00:07:22,915
we compute a t-statistic

175
00:07:22,915 --> 00:07:24,290
which again looks
at the difference

176
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:27,170
between the population
mean and the sample mean,

177
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:29,810
relative to the standard
error of the mean giving

178
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:32,995
me a t-statistic of 1.35.

179
00:07:32,995 --> 00:07:36,320
Now we have to decide if 1.35 is

180
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,995
enough evidence for me to
reject the null hypothesis.

181
00:07:39,995 --> 00:07:42,470
So we return to our
normal distribution

182
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:44,720
with a mean of zero and a
standard deviation of one.

183
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,200
We determine how
much area lies to

184
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:52,640
the right of 1.35 and to
the left of negative 1.35.

185
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,530
Again, this is the
distribution of

186
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:58,040
all t-statistics that would
occur if the null is true.

187
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,320
So therefore, my result is one of

188
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,990
the 18 percent of
studies that would

189
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:05,585
occur when the null
hypothesis is true.

190
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:09,455
This is too large for
me to reject the null.

191
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:11,660
I want my data to only

192
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:14,030
occur five percent
or less of the time,

193
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,650
I want it to be rare.

194
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:17,420
So in this case,

195
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:21,095
my data do not reject
the null hypothesis.

196
00:08:21,095 --> 00:08:23,240
In contrast, suppose I had

197
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,639
the same sample mean and
sample standard deviation,

198
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:27,200
but the study was much larger.

199
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,390
In this case, I got
a hundred children.

200
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:32,300
In this case my
t-statistic changes,

201
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,100
where the square root of 25 now

202
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,145
becomes the square root of 100.

203
00:08:36,145 --> 00:08:39,675
That now leads to a
t-statistic of 2.7,

204
00:08:39,675 --> 00:08:41,945
and you can see from the
picture on the right,

205
00:08:41,945 --> 00:08:44,180
that the area to
the right of 2.7,

206
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,530
and the left of negative

207
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:49,135
2.7 is only one
percent of studies.

208
00:08:49,135 --> 00:08:52,090
Again, if the null
hypothesis is true,

209
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:54,695
my study or more extreme studies

210
00:08:54,695 --> 00:08:57,035
would only occur one
percent of times,

211
00:08:57,035 --> 00:08:59,390
that is rare enough
for me to believe that

212
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:01,800
my data do not support
the null and therefore,

213
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,170
I'll reject the null hypothesis.

214
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:06,560
Now, there are
numerous fallacies and

215
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,320
hypothesis testing that
you should be aware of.

216
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,225
The first, is that if you
fail to reject the null,

217
00:09:13,225 --> 00:09:14,850
some people say that,

218
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:17,430
that means that the
null must be true.

219
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:20,120
Although, these two statements
are subtly different,

220
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,950
it is a crucial conclusion to not

221
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:24,530
make in statistical
hypothesis testing.

222
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:27,170
So we may not have
accepted the alternative

223
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:30,140
simply because we don't
have enough evidence,

224
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,705
specifically the sample
size is too small.

225
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:34,490
Again, in my previous example,

226
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,935
recall that when we
only had 25 children,

227
00:09:36,935 --> 00:09:38,535
we did not reject the null.

228
00:09:38,535 --> 00:09:40,220
But once we had enough data and

229
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,930
had a 100 children in our study,

230
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:44,315
we were able to reject the null.

231
00:09:44,315 --> 00:09:47,260
The second fallacy, is
that the p-value is

232
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:50,260
the probability that the
null hypothesis is true.

233
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,880
The p-value is not

234
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,685
a description of how true
the null hypothesis is.

235
00:09:54,685 --> 00:09:56,980
Instead it is a probability about

236
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:00,595
how much the data conflict
with the null hypothesis.

237
00:10:00,595 --> 00:10:04,340
The third fallacy, is that
a p-value less than 0.5,

238
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:07,820
always proves that the
alternative is true.

239
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:11,170
That is not correct because
the p-value is simply

240
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:12,910
a measure of the strength of

241
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:15,730
evidence for the truth
of the alternative.

242
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,440
As I've emphasized earlier,

243
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,660
you can still reach
the wrong decision

244
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,615
with a p-value less than 0.5.

245
00:10:22,615 --> 00:10:24,370
The fourth fallacy, is that

246
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:27,260
small p-values indicate
large signals.

247
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:30,080
This is not true because the
p-value says nothing about

248
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,230
the absolute magnitude of
the signal or the effect.

249
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:35,120
Instead the p-value summarizes

250
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,530
the magnitude of that effect

251
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:40,595
relative to the variability
from study to study.

252
00:10:40,595 --> 00:10:42,965
Next, one may conclude that data

253
00:10:42,965 --> 00:10:45,935
show their theory to
be false or true.

254
00:10:45,935 --> 00:10:48,770
That is not correct because
data can at best serve to

255
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:52,295
bolster or refute a theory
or claim that you have.

256
00:10:52,295 --> 00:10:54,974
But you can never be
100 percent convinced,

257
00:10:54,974 --> 00:10:57,620
that you know the true answer.

258
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:00,710
Last, it is not true to stay if

259
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:03,080
that statistical significance
implies that you have

260
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,840
scientific or public
health importance.

261
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,540
Statistical significance
is very different from

262
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:11,710
practical or clinical importance.

263
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,490
So at this point,

264
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:15,260
we now have all
the foundations in

265
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:18,050
place to begin actually
analyzing data

266
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:19,820
and to begin to use
those data to make

267
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:23,320
conclusions about the population
from which they came.

268
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:27,050
However, as we discussed
earlier in this course,

269
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:28,820
how we choose to analyze our data

270
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:31,190
varies by the type of
data that we have.

271
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,050
Whether we have a
continuous measure,

272
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:34,430
a categorical measure,

273
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:36,590
or a binary measure determines

274
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:39,005
how we might choose to
analyze those data.

275
00:11:39,005 --> 00:11:41,030
Therefore, the remainder
of this course,

276
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:43,670
examines statistical
hypothesis testing for

277
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,260
the several types
of data that you

278
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,540
will encounter in public health.
