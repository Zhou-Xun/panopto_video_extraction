1
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:10,060
After watching this video,

2
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:11,200
you will be able to use

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,455
PROC MI to perform
multiple imputation.

4
00:00:14,455 --> 00:00:17,635
Remember that we mentioned
in the previous video

5
00:00:17,635 --> 00:00:20,515
that multiple imputation
requires three steps.

6
00:00:20,515 --> 00:00:23,050
First, impute using PROC MI,

7
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:24,760
then do the analysis,

8
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,470
doing the appropriate PROC,

9
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:29,725
and then combine the results
with PROC MIANALYZE.

10
00:00:29,725 --> 00:00:31,420
In this video, we are going to

11
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,225
see the first step using PROC MI.

12
00:00:34,225 --> 00:00:36,370
Now we are going back to

13
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,945
our old case-control study

14
00:00:37,945 --> 00:00:39,760
of diet and myocardial
infarction.

15
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,635
We are going to check
the association between

16
00:00:41,635 --> 00:00:44,775
alpha-linolenic acid and
MI as you did before.

17
00:00:44,775 --> 00:00:46,824
But this time, our
main confounder,

18
00:00:46,824 --> 00:00:48,685
income has missing data.

19
00:00:48,685 --> 00:00:50,570
For the sake of simplicity,

20
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:52,265
we're using only one confounder,

21
00:00:52,265 --> 00:00:54,230
but you could run
multiple imputation with

22
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:56,810
many variables that
have missing data.

23
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:58,850
Also, we are going to
assume that missing

24
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,100
in income are missing at random,

25
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,445
so multiple imputation
is appropriate.

26
00:01:03,445 --> 00:01:05,600
Although it may not be the case,

27
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,450
but we will ignore that.

28
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:09,750
Let's take a look at the data.

29
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,420
These are the first
10 observations.

30
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,625
We have the ID number as usual.

31
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:16,725
MI is the case-control status,

32
00:01:16,725 --> 00:01:18,990
one for cases and
zero for controls.

33
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,020
Matching is the
matching variable.

34
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:24,040
Don't forget, this is a
match case-control study,

35
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,440
and P3 is alpha-linoleic
acid, our main exposure.

36
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,180
Now note income here,

37
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,555
our main confounder
that has missing.

38
00:01:31,555 --> 00:01:34,060
We also do have a few
more variables in

39
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,970
the dataset that can help
us to impute income,

40
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:38,800
such as sex, age,

41
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,990
education, and living
in a rural area.

42
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:46,155
First step is to use PROC
MI to impute our missing.

43
00:01:46,155 --> 00:01:48,765
Note that the PROC MI statement

44
00:01:48,765 --> 00:01:51,300
has the data equals
to TEMP.MISSING.

45
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,245
That is our original data
with missing values,

46
00:01:54,245 --> 00:01:57,435
and then it has out equals OUTMI,

47
00:01:57,435 --> 00:01:59,670
which will be our output dataset.

48
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,115
This will be a unique
dataset containing

49
00:02:02,115 --> 00:02:05,635
25 copies of your data
with imputed values.

50
00:02:05,635 --> 00:02:08,005
Note that 25 is the default,

51
00:02:08,005 --> 00:02:09,850
but you can modify that number.

52
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,780
Then you have a random seed,

53
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:14,560
and I'll talk about that later.

54
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,180
Then among the many
options that you can have,

55
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,810
I added minimum
equals zero to make

56
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:23,095
sure that income won't be
imputed as a negative value.

57
00:02:23,095 --> 00:02:24,900
Means you can be in
in read numbers,

58
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,040
but your income should always
at least zero or higher.

59
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,140
Then in the VAR statement,

60
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,970
I added all the variables that

61
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:34,100
I will include in
my iteration model,

62
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,005
including the outcome and

63
00:02:36,005 --> 00:02:37,760
all the variables
that I think will

64
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,235
help to impute
income such as sex,

65
00:02:40,235 --> 00:02:42,955
age, education and rural area.

66
00:02:42,955 --> 00:02:45,755
Finally, in the MCMC statement,

67
00:02:45,755 --> 00:02:48,800
we are using a Markov
chain Monte Carlo method,

68
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,980
which is pretty standard
for multiple imputation.

69
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,320
Some of the assumptions
that this method

70
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,295
requires are that the missing
are missing at random,

71
00:02:57,295 --> 00:03:00,300
and that they follow a
multivariate normal distribution.

72
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,730
There are many other

73
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:03,440
important things to
take into account,

74
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,849
like the missing pattern,

75
00:03:04,849 --> 00:03:06,905
and many other options
that SAS offers.

76
00:03:06,905 --> 00:03:09,090
But those are beyond the
scope of this course.

77
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:11,800
I only want to give
you some general idea.

78
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,705
For the future, if you
don't know, ask for help.

79
00:03:15,705 --> 00:03:17,060
There will always be

80
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,540
someone around you
who will know more.

81
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,675
I mentioned the seed before.

82
00:03:21,675 --> 00:03:24,255
How do you choose a seed
for multiple imputation?

83
00:03:24,255 --> 00:03:25,995
Well, you can choose any number.

84
00:03:25,995 --> 00:03:27,420
If you don't choose a number,

85
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,390
SAS actually will still initiate

86
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:32,255
the algorithm in a more or
less pseudo random way.

87
00:03:32,255 --> 00:03:35,450
The only purpose of adding
a seed number it is so you

88
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:39,100
can replicate your results
every time you run your code.

89
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,135
So by having the
same seed number,

90
00:03:41,135 --> 00:03:43,325
the results will
always be the same;

91
00:03:43,325 --> 00:03:44,975
otherwise, they will slightly

92
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:47,290
change every time
you run your code.

93
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:50,405
This is some of the code
that you get with PROC MI.

94
00:03:50,405 --> 00:03:51,950
You have two options here

95
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:54,095
because you only have
missing in income.

96
00:03:54,095 --> 00:03:58,175
Group 1 is all people who
don't have any missing value,

97
00:03:58,175 --> 00:04:01,150
and Group 2 are those
who have income missing.

98
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,970
Note the differences in means

99
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:04,860
and proportions by
in missing pattern.

100
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,230
For example, you have

101
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:07,340
a higher percentage of

102
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,230
females in the
missing income group,

103
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:10,705
and they are also older,

104
00:04:10,705 --> 00:04:12,600
and with less years of education

105
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,295
are more from the rural area.

106
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:17,390
In a way seeing differences
here is good because it's

107
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,890
telling you that those variables

108
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:20,980
are going to help
you to impute well.

109
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,850
Other things in the SAS output

110
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:24,410
you can ignore because actually

111
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:26,900
the most important part
of these PROC is not

112
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:30,340
the output but the output
dataset that you get.

113
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,130
This is what you get from

114
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:34,250
one original dataset
with missing values,

115
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:37,920
you're going to get a unique
dataset called OUTMI,

116
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,895
that is actually 25
datasets piled together.

117
00:04:41,895 --> 00:04:44,145
You will get a variable called

118
00:04:44,145 --> 00:04:47,960
_imputation_ that goes from 1-25,

119
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,355
so you can identify
each imputed dataset.

120
00:04:51,355 --> 00:04:53,235
So you don't need to do this,

121
00:04:53,235 --> 00:04:54,870
but if you do a PROC MEANS in

122
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:57,450
the imputed dataset for
the variable income,

123
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:00,865
and then you use the
_imputation_variable

124
00:05:00,865 --> 00:05:02,195
in the class statement,

125
00:05:02,195 --> 00:05:03,660
you can see that now,

126
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,580
you don't have any
missing anymore.

127
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,920
The mean income is slightly
different in each dataset,

128
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,015
although clearly
very close because

129
00:05:11,015 --> 00:05:13,445
each dataset gets
different imputations.

130
00:05:13,445 --> 00:05:16,130
Note also that I set
the minimum option to

131
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:19,705
zero to avoid negative
values in income.

132
00:05:19,705 --> 00:05:22,015
In summary, in this video,

133
00:05:22,015 --> 00:05:24,789
we use PROC MI to perform
multiple imputation.

134
00:05:24,789 --> 00:05:26,155
In the next video,

135
00:05:26,155 --> 00:05:28,980
we will continue with an
example in SAS analyzing

136
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,690
the imputed datasets and using

137
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:33,888
PROC MIANALYZE to
combine the estimates.
