1
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:09,630
Uh, but that you had a chance to prepare also for the midterm.

2
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:15,870
Um, and today we will discuss randomized trials.

3
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:23,269
So, um. Again to situate ourselves.

4
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:36,350
We have gone through all the observational study designs that we were going to review, and today we would focus on experimental designs.

5
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:44,420
And more specifically, we will discuss randomized trials. Now, there is a bit of a disclosure here.

6
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:53,090
You know, it's a very vast area that of randomized trials and there are full courses and randomized trials in the summer session

7
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:59,870
would be already we actually offer two courses and in the studies department here they also offered many courses,

8
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:05,840
you know, the more advanced level. So I can only, as they say, scratch the surface.

9
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:15,319
And and during these, you know, our 20 minutes, I did prepare to fill out because I find quite fascinating.

10
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:26,060
I may not be able to go through everything, but because of that, also, I thought I would give you or begin with the the scope of the essence, right.

11
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:35,210
So that at least you you can identify the key things you really, really need to know about randomized trials and you have to learn.

12
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,950
And I will try my best to go through those few key points.

13
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:47,840
And if they cannot cover everything else, well, at least you know, you'll have it there sort of for your own preference.

14
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,810
And if you become. Really. Curious.

15
00:01:52,530 --> 00:02:00,220
Would do some reading on your own. Yes, I need. Well, yes, it is included in the exam.

16
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:05,370
Yes. So pay attention. Focus.

17
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:10,840
All right. So what was the essence?

18
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:24,310
Randomized trials are close cohort studies in which the exposure is actively assigned by the investigator using a random method.

19
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:31,600
Right. So the main difference between randomized trials and the close cohort studies we have been looking at is that.

20
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:42,740
In those close cohort studies, the investigator only observed measure the exposure status that each person had in randomized trials.

21
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:50,270
The investigator actively assigns exposure and uses a random method.

22
00:02:54,700 --> 00:03:02,320
What does what is the effect of of randomization when randomized trials are considered the gold standard?

23
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,720
Of making consulting firms. Why?

24
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:13,010
Because randomization guarantees exchange ability between exposure groups.

25
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:18,470
In other words, randomization, if you think of it in terms of a that which we will go through,

26
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:28,220
removes any potential incoming arrows into the exposure from variables that are also causes of the outcome.

27
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:37,630
So by doing that, by removing that incoming error, owing to the exposure, there is exchange ability between exposure groups.

28
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:43,910
Okay. What measures do we use in randomized trials?

29
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:53,360
Well, by virtue of being close cohort studies, we use exactly the same measures as we do in cohort studies, in observational studies.

30
00:03:54,080 --> 00:04:03,210
So if. For measures of frequency or occurrence, we use risk, kaplan-meier risk and rates.

31
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:08,080
In cohort studies. We can also use them in randomized trials.

32
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:16,880
Then recall measures of association is how we relate those measures of frequency to make calls relevant.

33
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:24,250
Right. So formations, measures of association, we use the same as in close quarters then.

34
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:28,480
So if your measure of frequency is risk or cumulative incidence,

35
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:33,559
your measure of association in a random cell is going to be cumulative incidence ratio

36
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,120
of your in the multiplicative scale or difference if you are in the editing scale.

37
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:48,280
And the one interesting terminology issue here is that because we are in the context of randomized trials,

38
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:53,710
measures of association can also be called measures of effect.

39
00:04:54,430 --> 00:05:01,270
So you have leeway to use the word effect if you are dealing with a randomized trial.

40
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:09,620
There are two ways to analyze the data from a randomized trial.

41
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:17,070
One way is called intent to treat. That way.

42
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:24,740
Or to to go to use that strategy for the analysis of a randomized trial.

43
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:34,370
The definition of exposure on your dataset corresponds to the exposure that was randomly assigned to everybody at the beginning of the trial.

44
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,980
In other words, the result of that was going. Right.

45
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:44,100
So the fact that there's one one God assigned to treatment,

46
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:48,510
a person to watch over the same two Jim and a three go the same treatment be

47
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:56,910
that variable a b is going to be the exposure variable you use in the analysis.

48
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,590
That's called intent to treat.

49
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:08,080
Intent to treat is the way to analyze trials that is consistent with the randomization assumption and is the preferred way.

50
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:17,250
The estimates of the effect you get from using the intend to treat approach may be conservative.

51
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:21,770
That means may be less than the actual effect really is.

52
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,930
And we hope to get to a reason.

53
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:34,990
But they don't have any other biases. The other way to analyze randomized trials is none intend to treat.

54
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:38,920
And the difference between the two is that none intend to treat.

55
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:42,850
You use a different type of exposure via.

56
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:53,250
You decide not to use the random assignment as your exposure variable or you.

57
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:58,860
Remove people from those who had originally randomized.

58
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,620
Those approaches, they intend to train approaches.

59
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:12,470
We'll bring you to a situation in which you are no longer analyzing the trial as if it were a trial.

60
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:17,060
You are going to be analyzing it as if it was an observational study.

61
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:28,010
And because of that, that type of analysis non intend to treat is open to all the biases that you can have in an observational study.

62
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:33,790
Okay. So what you need to know about these?

63
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,909
If you are presented, let's say, with a prompt, with an abstract,

64
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:44,770
or if you are reading a paper, you should be able to find out how was the trial analyzed?

65
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:52,090
Was it intent to treat or was it non intent to treat because the consequences on the estimate of effect will be deferred.

66
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:02,660
And finally. Randomized trials are typically conducted in super selected samples.

67
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:08,770
Because, you know, they are usually volunteers and not everybody.

68
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:16,060
Very, very few people of a general target population is willing to volunteer into a randomized trial.

69
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,550
You know, this is just how it is.

70
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:30,790
Now, the fact that the trial is conducted in a super selected sample doesn't mean that the estimates of effect from the trial are biased.

71
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:35,250
If the trial is well-conducted, those estimates are not biased.

72
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:38,130
They have a limitation,

73
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:49,610
which is that they may not be transportable or generalizable to other populations that US investigators may have wanted to generalize them to.

74
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:55,970
They may not apply. You know, a trial conducted in.

75
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:03,330
People of one gender. Those results may not be biased.

76
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:09,420
They may be correct, but they may not be transportable to people from a different gender.

77
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:20,610
Okay. So there is a difference between bias, which is getting the wrong answer and applying some results to a different population.

78
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:27,480
There is a difference. Results from a well-conducted trial are not bias per say.

79
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:37,410
The images not be generalizable or transport to another population that's not represented by the people who participated in the trial.

80
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:43,820
Is that relatively straightforward, those pointers.

81
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:50,530
Okay. So so focusing on those and that's what you really need to know about, right?

82
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:58,230
For now, we'll get. You want to leave, not just your company.

83
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:03,479
So this is an outline of what we will discuss. The definition we gave already.

84
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:12,330
So we'll go quickly through it. Then we'll I'll describe some historical landmarks and some different ways of classifying trials.

85
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:21,450
We will discuss the implications of randomization with the, you know, nice that which I already told you, but we will go through that.

86
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,560
And then some examples on how to use those measures of effect.

87
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:31,630
So again, in a randomized trial, you can see effect instead of association.

88
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:39,900
Um, we will go through those analytic strategies briefly and then we will discuss some.

89
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:45,110
Issues around the scope and spatial considerations because that is the other things.

90
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:51,140
Randomized trials. Randomized trials imply interventions on humans.

91
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:59,010
It is a completely different game. There are there are many important considerations related to protection of humans.

92
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:00,560
All right.

93
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:09,320
So the definition, as we said, they are close studies in which the investigator assigns the exposure level to participants in a random manner.

94
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,590
Now some historical landmarks.

95
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:22,450
So it turns out the very first experiments really in humans that we have notice of were in the field of of nutrition, nutritional immunology.

96
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:33,920
They were diet related trials. And the first one we have notice of is from the sixth century before the Comunita, right after King Nebuchadnezzar,

97
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:43,370
the second from Babylon, invaded Jerusalem and destroyed Solomon's Temple, or, you know, the first temple.

98
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:57,500
Wait a minute, Dutch. And. Also laid siege to the city of Jerusalem and took prisoner a few aristocrats courtesans.

99
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:06,620
Israelites and took them back to Babylon to teach them the ways of the Babylonian God.

100
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:10,070
So he was interested in assimilation.

101
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,360
He was trying to assimilate. Resistance is futile.

102
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:22,430
Or so he thought. And as part of that assimilation process of the courtesans,

103
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:32,960
he was trying to convince them to change many of their habits and, you know, cultural uses and some of them related to diet.

104
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:40,890
And he basically wanted them to adapt to the diet of the Babylonians.

105
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:46,880
So these are the four courtesans that were being sort of enticed into.

106
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:56,930
Changing their diet and the local diet consisted basically of meat and white Babylonian.

107
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:04,940
But the Israelites had very strict precepts of what they could eat and what they couldn't from, you know, cultural, religious reasons, etc.

108
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:10,640
So they said no. Instead of us adopting the diet right away, we proposed that.

109
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:20,840
You conduct an experiment and actually let us. Continue with our regular diet, which is, you know, consistent with the present.

110
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:23,300
In that case, it was pulses and water.

111
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:33,590
Pulses are basically legumes, you know, like lentils and beans and that delicious, delicious and very healthy stuff.

112
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:38,180
And then we will continue with that for about ten days.

113
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:46,660
And at the end of ten days, we will see what happens. So this is a summary of of of the study.

114
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:51,500
So the population is these four kids, you know, courtesans, aristocratic Israelites.

115
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:56,420
We don't know. They really they control the size of the control group.

116
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:59,060
The treatment was policies and whatever, you know,

117
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:05,270
the diet that they continued on and the control intervention would be, let's call it the Nebuchadnezzar diet.

118
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:11,180
And why? The length of follow up was ten days. They said, let us have our own diet for ten days.

119
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:14,180
And and the outcome was the countenances.

120
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,370
You know, what they countenance is. Leslie continues.

121
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:24,930
Nicole. Exactly how your face looks.

122
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:33,710
So the results were that the countenances were fatter and fatter in flesh among treated children versus those in the control day.

123
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:41,510
So because of the results of the experiment, they were allowed to continue having their own day.

124
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:50,960
Now, this study has received some some criticism, but mainly that the publication really was not peer review.

125
00:14:53,460 --> 00:15:04,580
And if you if you are into actually this this story, part of it was famously and further immortalized by Giuseppe Verdi.

126
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:12,750
I don't know if there is an opera aficionado, but part of the story is told in a in a beautiful opera by Verdi.

127
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:18,980
Anybody knows what's the name of the opera. Now.

128
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,340
Bukele. So as a beautiful choir of the Hebrew state.

129
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:28,210
So, um, but fast forward to the common era.

130
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:34,320
18th century, the British Navy.

131
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:41,580
I had a terrible problem. You know, they had been at war with everybody, with with Spain, with France, with their mothers.

132
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:54,540
And the problem was that the mortality of the sailors in long trips around the world was as high as 70% while they were on their ships.

133
00:15:56,670 --> 00:16:03,000
And actually, you know, there is some historians have made the calculations to genealogy historians and.

134
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:11,500
That mortality was higher than the deaths caused by the Spanish and the French armadas together.

135
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:18,500
And the sailors were dying from a disease called scurvy.

136
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:23,389
That actually is a disease related to a nutritional deficiency.

137
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:27,650
But at the time, they had no idea. Now, there had been some suggestions that.

138
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:36,640
Supplementing the diet of people at sea for long times with citrus fruits might help prevent that from scurvy,

139
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:49,240
but nobody had really implemented this or had systematically looked into this until in 1747, a Scottish surgeon, James Lind.

140
00:16:50,600 --> 00:17:02,960
This guy who was serving in a in a British ship called the Salisbury and was patrolling the Bay of Biscay between Spain and.

141
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:09,480
And Britain. Decided to run an experiment.

142
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:15,780
So two months after the Salisbury sale, people started to get sick.

143
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:28,920
And then he took 12 sailors and divided them into six groups and gave each of the six groups some supplement to their diet.

144
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,610
So, you know, I always forget all the different treatments.

145
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:44,420
But one was cyber, the other was, uh, vitriol, which is pretty much sulfuric acid.

146
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:49,010
The other was a pint of. Sea water.

147
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:58,480
I know there was vinegar. In Group five was two oranges and a line every day.

148
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:09,159
You know, there's the most famous and important group and group six was a spicy paste with barley water,

149
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:12,940
which sounds awfully similar to what they we would know as beer.

150
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:16,930
But I mean, it may not have been beer, barley, water.

151
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:31,520
So after about only six days, they had to stop the experiment because they ran out of they actually they ran out of oranges and and limes.

152
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:41,209
But by the time by day six, one of the sailors who had been assigned to that group was already up and around and fit for duty.

153
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:48,230
And the other was getting better. And there was only a report of an improvement in another of the groups that he was in as dramatic.

154
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:56,630
So these was the first sort of known experiment in humans in the modern era.

155
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:08,720
Now, it was not randomized. But it did demonstrate that indeed, even without people knowing that GAVI was caused by deficiency of vitamin C,

156
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:13,910
you know, they had a way to prevent this disease.

157
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:22,730
And if you read into it is extremely interesting because the implementation of him is, you know, you say parallel things really haven't changed much,

158
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:31,850
even though you have the evidence implementing it across the Navy where it took over 100 and over 100 years for sure.

159
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:42,060
So anyway it's interesting he's you know there are some modern features of trials are actually of of relatively.

160
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:53,730
Recent development. So randomization itself was only discovered in 1926 by Ronald Fisher.

161
00:19:55,470 --> 00:20:03,620
Anybody acquainted with Ronald Fisher's study? So it was a great, you know, British statistician he invented.

162
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:12,260
Have you heard about the distribution ANOVA analysis of variance the student's T test.

163
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:19,340
So he made really seminal contributions to statistics at the beginning of the century.

164
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:27,710
He also had a very dark side to him because he was also known to be an eugenicist.

165
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:38,690
So, um, so, yeah. So he's, he's his contributions are sort of marred somehow by, by that.

166
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:43,610
But, and he also discovered randomization. But interestingly enough,

167
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:52,549
it was in doing experiments in humans at the time he was actually helping with

168
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:59,390
agricultural experiments and people were interested to know which types of,

169
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:05,720
let's say irrigation regimes were better for certain plants or other plants.

170
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:15,049
So he realized that he could randomize different plots to different irrigation strategies and in that way,

171
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:18,380
you know, get a sense of the causal effect of.

172
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:30,540
Of them. So then the the concept of placebo, which is an inert substance, but that resembles the intervention in every possible way.

173
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:37,490
Otherwise, to avoid, you know, the sort of psychological effects of being paid attention to, um,

174
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:47,860
was incorporated by even some point in 1933 in the studies of angina pectoris, they were dealing with many, many possible treatments.

175
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:51,880
And then very intelligently they said, you know, we really need to.

176
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:58,370
Somehow do away with the psychological effect of these patients being given different things,

177
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:02,719
and then they invented the the placebo and then double blinding,

178
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:12,630
which is masking the identity of who's getting what in terms of regiment was invented by gold in 1937.

179
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:26,000
Also in the studies of angina factories and the effect of some things like theobromine, which is in chocolate and amino feeling, which is.

180
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:30,310
Yeah. Well, I think it was used later on for.

181
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:35,270
Bronchospasm was indeed. The doctors would correct me.

182
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:45,210
All right. Now, as for the classification, there are many ways to classify trials.

183
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:55,710
And I wrote you here a few. The first is by face, and you may have heard about this in the context of COVID vaccine, etc.

184
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:59,830
Did you hear about clinical phase three?

185
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:08,650
This is a phase three trial and so on. So all in phases before 301 and two are not.

186
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:17,480
Aimed to actually examine the causal effect superiority of a given treatment.

187
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:29,170
Only Phase three is the stage at which you want to compare the efficacy of when you intervention against typically what's already being done.

188
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:34,690
So typically you want to know whether something is better than what you already have.

189
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:39,130
And Phase three studies need to be randomized,

190
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:48,340
blinded and controlled controlled means with the group to compare against usually a placebo if there is nothing better already in use.

191
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:54,010
And blinded means that neither the investigators nor the participants should know what they are getting.

192
00:23:54,580 --> 00:24:03,270
Okay. And then these forest studies actually are also very helpful and interesting.

193
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:07,740
But they are conducted post-marketing after you have.

194
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:15,950
You have begun widespread of use of of whatever you were.

195
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:20,980
Testing, soft aid is FDA approved, etc.

196
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:33,850
Investigators will put together the data sets from the trials, and they usually the goal of Phase four studies is to identify adverse effects.

197
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:41,860
That may be rare, but that may be serious, and that cannot be identified in a single study because the sample size would be too small.

198
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:49,740
There is a famous example of. Often inside.

199
00:24:52,230 --> 00:25:01,559
But now is old and I'm all to some forgetting it was it was cardio toxic.

200
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:13,680
I think it was original by Pfizer. And it was removed from the market after reports from Phase four studies that discovered it was killing people.

201
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:21,570
Did the doctors or anybody else in pharmacology remember this case of M.S. and Non-steroidal?

202
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:26,300
Matter where to go. I don't.

203
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:34,260
Yeah. It was very famous and it was, you know, widely used.

204
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:45,660
Anyway, apologies for blanking, but it is a real relatively recent example of of the usefulness of these pooled analysis of large deficits.

205
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:51,819
All right. You can also classify these studies by design.

206
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:56,620
And there are many ways of of running or designing a trial.

207
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:05,140
I guess the simplest and the one that we have in mind and will be working through is that the independent groups or parallel

208
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:13,420
trial in which you have one intervention compared against another or a placebo if there is no known already intervention.

209
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:17,890
And the two groups of course run in parallel.

210
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,110
They are randomized at the same time,

211
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:31,990
etc. There is a type of independent parallel design that the factorial designs in which you can test more than one intervention at the same time.

212
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:40,450
An example is if you have treatments A and B, you can have four different groups.

213
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:42,980
One group received treatment.

214
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:53,920
A Another group received treatment by another group receives both treatments, and the last group doesn't receive anything, just a placebo.

215
00:26:53,950 --> 00:27:00,819
Most like this design is also advantages because it allows you to examine what

216
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:05,740
we will study next week is called interactions between the two treatments.

217
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:12,150
Factorial. And you can also examine the individual effects of each trip.

218
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:25,130
So they are a little bit more cost effective. There are crossover studies in which people are randomized actually to both interventions.

219
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:34,190
But what's also randomize is the order in which they receive both interventions because midway through the trial they switch, they crossover.

220
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,450
Okay. And the methods there are different.

221
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:43,980
The statistical considerations are also different, but we will really not let on this.

222
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:52,770
And then, you know, this is relatively new. Now, there are adaptive trials in which as the trial proceeds,

223
00:27:53,070 --> 00:28:04,260
investigators are able to change the sample size or change the the proportion of people assigned to each regiment,

224
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:11,250
etc., depending on the information that's being fed back to them by the trial itself.

225
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:17,790
Uh, and again, for, for the sake of this lecture, we will just focus on fixed trials,

226
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:24,840
which is you designed your trial at the beginning and you follow through the protocol until the right.

227
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:33,990
Another classification is by the type of comparison groups and the type of inference you want to make.

228
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:42,450
So most trials, let's say the classic trials of COVID vaccine are virtual superiority trials.

229
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:49,930
So. Typically there is no known treatment or preventive intervention in this case.

230
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:56,350
And you really want to know whether what you came up with is superior to whatever they may be, right?

231
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:00,040
In this case, nothing. So that's an obvious superiority trial.

232
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:09,600
But there are also equivalence trials in which you may come up with a new intervention, which, you know,

233
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:15,550
it may not be better than what's already in place to treat that specific condition or to prevent that condition.

234
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:22,540
But it might have some advantages in terms of safety or ease of administration or cost, etc.

235
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:29,950
So obviously in the pharma and the pharmaceutical industry, they are very common because they come up with new molecules all the time that,

236
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:36,520
you know, make you want a little bit better or maybe cheaper or maybe you have a better dosage regimen to the right equivalent strength.

237
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:43,150
And then you also have noninferiority trials in which the new agent you want to test,

238
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:48,850
you sort of know is not going to be better, but you hope is not going to be much worse.

239
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:54,010
So, again, you know, they are common in the in the pharmaceutical industry.

240
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:59,290
And obviously there might be sort of marketing motivations behind them, but they do exist.

241
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:09,250
And the statistical considerations, again, all of them may differ, but for the purpose of this lecture, we focus on superiority trials.

242
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:20,190
Another classification is by the unit of randomization and I think at the lecture I explained it or classified the study designs.

243
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:28,530
I may have mentioned that you in trials, in experiments you can randomize individuals, but you can also randomize groups.

244
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:36,149
And we will go through one example hopefully we have and so the first day but individual trials and

245
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:41,360
when you randomize groups of people to the same intervention the whole group that will cluster dress.

246
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:48,870
Okay. All right. No implications of randomization.

247
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:56,820
First thing. Your seatbelts. So.

248
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:07,400
The implication of randomization. Is that you achieve marginal exchange ability.

249
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:15,520
In other words, it resembles a counterfactual experiment in which you pass the whole population,

250
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:21,160
both treated and untreated, through the time machine under each possible treatment.

251
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:28,180
And you obtain an estimate that has a causal interpretation without assumptions.

252
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:35,150
That is why it is the gold standard for causality. How does this happen?

253
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:41,530
This happens because randomization removes all incoming arrows into the exposure

254
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:46,780
from known or unknown independent predictors of the outcome or common causes.

255
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:53,100
And this is illustrated in this that. So.

256
00:31:54,550 --> 00:32:00,550
When you find that there is no error between L and independent predictor of the outcome,

257
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:08,920
a cause of the outcome and a the exposure, chances are this that represents a randomized trial.

258
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:17,530
Because if there was an error from L into a randomization has removed that error.

259
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:26,170
So the distribution of L is equal on average between groups of eight.

260
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:36,540
Groups of 18 exposed and unexposed. So exposed and unexposed will have on average the same values of L.

261
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:44,760
Therefore, they are exchangeable with each other. With respect to L and that wonderful thing happens because of randomization.

262
00:32:46,680 --> 00:33:05,320
You're still with me. Now, the important thing here and you know, from a practical perspective, really an application is this.

263
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:14,290
It removes all incoming arrows from known or unknown causes of the outcome.

264
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:22,300
Which means. Was the role of prior knowledge in this case.

265
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:36,380
Sorry. Your name is Millie. Right if randomization removes all incoming arrows from known or unknown causes of the outcome.

266
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:48,650
I think it is pretty dramatic. And I ask you, because I know you are very keen on this council, I am very happy about that.

267
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:57,170
But if randomization removes incoming arrows into the exposure from known or unknown.

268
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:05,120
Because of the outcome. You don't need any prior causal knowledge to make causal inference.

269
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:10,920
You don't need to know that, Gene.

270
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:18,479
Number these from this chromosome is a cause of the outcome that might be unevenly distributed between exposed tonight.

271
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:25,830
Exposed. You don't need to know you don't care because the distribution of that gene on average will be the same.

272
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:32,360
So that's that's pretty cool. Powerful stuff not.

273
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:37,160
Very, very powerful. All right. Any questions on this, please?

274
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:46,960
This is the mechanism. How randomization works and ensures exchange ability.

275
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:54,230
Okay. Morris. Okay.

276
00:34:55,920 --> 00:35:02,430
So yeah, this is what I was sort of being a bit dramatic about, but I do feel like, you know, excited about this theory.

277
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:08,420
You can estimate causation, causal effects without any prior knowledge.

278
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:17,670
It's very ironic. You know it, right? And this is this is an example from a real life experiment.

279
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:22,210
So this was a study of micronutrient supplementation.

280
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:34,200
So some investigators thought that, you know, babies 1 to 2 years of age were living in areas where there was a lot of malaria,

281
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:40,050
were anemic, anemic, meaning they had low hemoglobin levels because malaria causes anemia.

282
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:47,520
So what do you. Because they lose iron, right? So what do you do if some babies are losing iron to malaria?

283
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:52,240
Well, you should give them. All right. But nobody has actually tested this.

284
00:35:52,370 --> 00:36:00,820
So so these guys decided to do a trial and they had three groups, three intervention groups.

285
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:07,989
They randomized a bunch of babies from the island of Zanzibar off the coast of mainland Tanzania,

286
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:11,260
in Zanzibar, which is part of Tanzania, into three groups.

287
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:17,650
One group received iron and folic acid sort of, you know, drops perhaps every day.

288
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:23,980
The other group received item folic acid and zinc. These are all these are micronutrients.

289
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:30,069
So we all need this stuff. And if you are losing more of one of them, but you need more of it.

290
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:33,970
Right. So that's what these guys were trying to. That was true.

291
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:44,290
And if third group received placebo meaning so drops that they stayed equally as fully as the others but did not have any effects.

292
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:51,040
Then they sort of it's it's a very metallic state in my youth.

293
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,130
I run a trail of zinc one day and.

294
00:36:55,230 --> 00:37:00,060
It was impossible to mask the placebo because.

295
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:09,760
Uh, it just stays horrible. So, uh, the manufacturers of the product came up with a brilliant idea, which was.

296
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:13,570
Let's add metallic taste to the placebos. Yes.

297
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,380
So then, of course, we had lack of compliance across the board.

298
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:26,560
But anyway, the idea here is that, you know, it was a very large trial.

299
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:35,970
So I don't want you to trace. 24,000 kids or something, lots of babies.

300
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:45,479
And what you see here is the distribution of some potential known causes of the outcome.

301
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:54,600
The outcome actually was the primary outcome was mortality such as age, which is mean age in months.

302
00:37:54,690 --> 00:38:02,430
And you can see is almost identical right across the three groups, the percentage of boys in each group.

303
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:08,230
Almost the same. The employment of the father.

304
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:16,300
Almost was the same of the mother. I mean, you can think of any stranger, you know?

305
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:21,900
Free world is valuable and they will be equally distributed.

306
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:32,390
On average. So when they say the distribution of L variables is the same across exposure groups, this is what I'm talking about.

307
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:40,820
These are potential variables. And on average they are equally distributed.

308
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:48,620
Between the randomized groups. How is that code? Exchange ability.

309
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:54,500
So these three groups that exchangeable with each other with respect to these

310
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:58,940
variables because the distribution of these variables on average is the same.

311
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:01,320
Across the three groups.

312
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:11,190
Therefore, if you make comparisons between the groups, well, I guess again the placebo you the answer that you get is causal period.

313
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:22,730
Nice. The distribution of the first letter of the first name of each participant.

314
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:30,459
It's going to be the same, even though it's totally relevant by the distribution of genes of any other,

315
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:33,220
you know, risk factors for mortality is going to be the same.

316
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:38,980
So the only effect that you will see in the comparison is the effect of these interventions.

317
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:47,060
So how do we measure that? As I said before, you use the same measures as those cards that.

318
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:53,530
So. You know, if you have dichotomous outcomes, you can use.

319
00:39:54,640 --> 00:40:00,160
The ratio in the multiplicative scale when you can use the difference in that.

320
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:05,820
Additive. And, you know, I have the interpretation here.

321
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:12,630
Some people call this the colossal cumulative incidence rate.

322
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:21,590
Or the causal cumulative incidence difference, the causal relative causal weight causal, because we are in the context of a randomized trial.

323
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:30,020
Right. As opposed to the associational measures in observational studies.

324
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:42,120
There is one new measure that you may have seen here and may be interested in in the context of of randomized trials.

325
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:49,540
You can estimate also these numbers is called the number needed to treat or MN and t is pretty common in clinical practice.

326
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:56,650
And the definition of these number is basically minus one divided by the cumulative incidence difference.

327
00:40:56,830 --> 00:41:07,240
That's how you calculate. The interpretation of this number, which again, is helpful in in decision making, is we need to treat these many people.

328
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:13,360
The result of this operation to prevent or cause one event.

329
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:19,950
You remember I told you you use the additive scale when you are interested in counts.

330
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:26,440
How many lives can you save is a really good example of that mission because basically you

331
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:32,680
are using the negative inverse of the military science difference to make those decisions.

332
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:38,070
How many people will we need to treat to prevent one case of whatever it is?

333
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:50,070
I'm interested. Okay. You can also use rate base differences if you have personal time and you know as a close call your typical you have something.

334
00:41:52,330 --> 00:41:55,690
And they you know, the interpretation is causal as well.

335
00:41:55,930 --> 00:42:00,460
Some times they are called the causal incidence rate difference rate ratio.

336
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:07,090
And if you have continuous outcomes which are somehow neglected, and I think wrongly so,

337
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:14,350
you have to estimate that between groups difference in change from baseline to the end of follow up.

338
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:21,360
And we will do an example. We go through a numerical example to try to make this clear.

339
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:27,930
These are their data. You see a real study published in The Lancet.

340
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:36,640
Not too shabby. And here I brought you the number randomized in each group.

341
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,479
They tried to make it the same.

342
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:46,240
And, you know, it's a huge strength. Close to 24,000 leads.

343
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:54,320
These are detail years of follow up. So originally I think they were.

344
00:42:56,330 --> 00:43:04,730
Trying to follow them up for two years. But these shows that they were followed really for a little over a year.

345
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:14,810
More or less right. These are the number of deaths in each group during follow up from the time of randomization to the end of follow up.

346
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:20,040
This is the number of malaria admissions to hospital.

347
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:27,060
So how many times or how many malaria hospitalizations there were in each group?

348
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:34,410
And these are continuous variables. These is the hemoglobin level at baseline at the time of randomization.

349
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:39,240
And this is the hemoglobin level at the time of the end of follow up.

350
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:45,930
Let's say we wanted to estimate the effect of this intervention on mortality.

351
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:56,110
Right. That's. So I know you went through a really cool exercise last lap on which measure to use.

352
00:43:56,120 --> 00:44:00,770
Right. Um, so for mortality, well, we have a number of options.

353
00:44:00,950 --> 00:44:09,190
Sometimes we. We can't resort to Kaplan Kaplan-Meier risk because it's an event that may happen to everybody.

354
00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:18,040
But do we expect death to happen to all babies 12 to 24 months of age?

355
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:25,130
We better not. We better not because, you know, we are in the baby saving business.

356
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:30,860
So. So that's you know, that's one consideration.

357
00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:38,300
The other is that. This is a close cohort and follow up is an island and anybody been to Zanzibar.

358
00:44:39,970 --> 00:44:48,490
Beautiful but is an island. So people really you know, and mobility there out of the island is very, very limited.

359
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:54,190
So in a way, it's a captive population. So follow up was complete.

360
00:44:55,260 --> 00:45:00,290
No losses to follow. Competing risks is a problem for all cause mortality.

361
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:06,440
No. Nothing out compete death.

362
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:18,590
Right. So we can use risk. Because, you know, I guess the conditions are made for risk and the risk itself is relatively low.

363
00:45:20,270 --> 00:45:25,280
So I am here presenting you with the cumulative incidence for each group.

364
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:31,580
The number of deaths divided by everybody at risk at the beginning of follow up for about a year.

365
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:36,380
So you can see these percentages.

366
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:45,620
And I also bring you the cumulative incidence ratio, taking the placebo group as the reference of these risks divided by this risk.

367
00:45:45,950 --> 00:45:49,490
This one gives this number and this one divided by this gives this number.

368
00:45:51,600 --> 00:46:00,390
You can also estimate the cumulative incidence difference in the usual way we would and now we can estimate the number needed to treat.

369
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:07,950
Right. So who would like to interpret the number needed to treat?

370
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:31,720
Just one other time, please. Come on, guys.

371
00:46:31,930 --> 00:46:38,630
You just do it. Just look up the previous slide and just. You have to plug in a number that.

372
00:46:47,590 --> 00:47:03,940
My right. Okay.

373
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:12,930
Everybody agrees with that interpretation. Okay.

374
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:35,430
Set. 49. Not that any from any cause.

375
00:47:37,810 --> 00:47:41,080
So are you. Are you are you Anastasia?

376
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:45,330
Right. Are you doubting about Brian's interpretation?

377
00:47:48,290 --> 00:47:52,100
You want to. You want to do this? Agree. I know. Help us out here.

378
00:48:05,470 --> 00:48:09,640
I think you have a point and you have one way to to put it.

379
00:48:10,210 --> 00:48:16,330
I have a more cynical way to put it. Look, these numbers should not be negative.

380
00:48:18,390 --> 00:48:26,070
So the interpretation of these numbers cynically is you need to treat 399 babies to kill one.

381
00:48:28,930 --> 00:48:33,490
Yes. Look at him. Yeah.

382
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:38,090
It's terrible. Look at look at the look at the is.

383
00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:44,500
The iris or even there rings. Maybe this is what Anastasia was trying to get at.

384
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:53,470
Look where the risk of mortality was higher. In the active treatment groups in this group, it was 1.9.

385
00:48:53,490 --> 00:48:56,760
This group was 1.8. In this group was 1.6.

386
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:06,780
So the intervention killed babies. And this is why this study could not.

387
00:49:08,510 --> 00:49:15,290
I grew, they all follow up. It was intended we had to stop it because some babies were laying there.

388
00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:35,380
Yes. But that won't make you any friends, especially at a certain school of public health whose motto is saving lives millions at a time.

389
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:40,360
Think the motto went wrong in this case.

390
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:47,100
No. Why so? It is kind of interesting because I mean, this is shocking, of course.

391
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:55,049
And these these sent shockwaves through the Asian community, you know, through the international health community.

392
00:49:55,050 --> 00:50:02,790
Whatever was the first thing you have to do as an investigator when you find something like this.

393
00:50:04,850 --> 00:50:09,950
Okay. Well, get this continuing. But what else? This is.

394
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:18,760
Well, discontinuity treatment. Yeah. I mean, you know, discontinue everything in the trial except one thing,

395
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:28,720
which is your data analysis and what should be your priority in the data analysis if you find that that your intervention is killing babies.

396
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:37,770
Yes. Why? Why did this kill babies?

397
00:50:38,550 --> 00:50:47,980
So. In doing that, the investigators looked at malaria admissions and here the metric is the incidence rate.

398
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:51,790
Why? Because malaria. What type of outcome is malady?

399
00:50:51,790 --> 00:50:58,300
Any malaria ologist in the room? Or just some malaria aficionado?

400
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:05,710
Or somebody who's gotten malaria is a recurrent outcome, you know?

401
00:51:06,250 --> 00:51:10,420
And, you know, some of you may be from Africa or have lived there.

402
00:51:10,930 --> 00:51:14,530
You get malaria very, very repeatedly.

403
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:18,760
You could. Is there any story?

404
00:51:19,330 --> 00:51:24,880
So this so one baby could have more than one admission into hospital for malaria.

405
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:29,950
And here we are not counting the number of babies. We are counting the number of admissions.

406
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:35,130
So it's a recurrent event and therefore, we need to use race. Look what happened.

407
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:40,490
Incidence rate, racial indifference. So indeed.

408
00:51:40,790 --> 00:51:46,970
Well, it seems that this intervention was killing babies possibly from Malawi.

409
00:51:47,330 --> 00:51:53,600
It's quite bizarre because at least at the very least, they were getting more admitted to hospital with malaria.

410
00:51:53,960 --> 00:52:00,080
And if, again, if any of you has this type of experience. You know, I guess.

411
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:04,840
As people who get molested repeatedly may build up some immunity.

412
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:10,600
But if you end up in hospital with malaria, you are very sick.

413
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:15,850
These are typically complicated cases of malaria, cerebral malaria.

414
00:52:17,950 --> 00:52:22,090
So. Yeah. And there is a whole set of more.

415
00:52:23,670 --> 00:52:32,790
I don't know how we how do we do nutrition science type of discussion here, but I'm going to skip it in the interest of time.

416
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:39,540
I mean, why were babies slain? And the reasons are they to me, very stupid.

417
00:52:39,550 --> 00:52:43,380
But, you know, so what was the effect on hemoglobin?

418
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:50,639
Because, again, you know, if you give certain if you give iron to babies who are anemic,

419
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:53,820
will, you know, your hemoglobin levels should increase, right.

420
00:52:55,600 --> 00:53:06,820
So to estimate that effect, you need to first calculate the change in minimum global levels from baseline to the end of follow up.

421
00:53:07,570 --> 00:53:13,030
So this is what we are doing here. The change in this group was an average of two grams per liter.

422
00:53:13,450 --> 00:53:17,620
The change in this group was an average of three, and in this group was an average of one.

423
00:53:18,790 --> 00:53:23,410
And then you estimate the difference in change. Setting one group as the reference.

424
00:53:23,650 --> 00:53:32,570
So let's just set this as the reference. And then so two minus one is going to be one and three minus one is going to be two.

425
00:53:32,590 --> 00:53:41,320
So there was a positive effect on hemoglobin in two of the well in the two items that the example.

426
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,030
Okay. Any questions on measures of effect?

427
00:53:49,290 --> 00:53:53,280
The only new thing really was the. Number needed to trade.

428
00:53:53,880 --> 00:54:02,850
And the fact that in the context of a trial, you can call them measures of effect in instead of measures of association sort of confidence.

429
00:54:04,170 --> 00:54:08,120
Right. Now. What are the analytic strategies?

430
00:54:09,930 --> 00:54:14,860
Which I said is also something you need to. No.

431
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:21,250
Understand. If everything worked.

432
00:54:22,370 --> 00:54:25,560
Pristinely. In an intervention. A study.

433
00:54:28,710 --> 00:54:34,140
This is what would happen at this time you need which is randomization at the very

434
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:39,840
first time you need the investigator decides randomly who's going to get what,

435
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:48,410
right. So this first person was assigned to being exposed, let's say, to receiving an active intervention.

436
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:52,420
Same for the second, the third one. Good.

437
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:55,660
Assigned to receiving a placebo. Right. Unexposed.

438
00:54:57,990 --> 00:55:05,030
And solar. So if things weren't always so nicely, this is how my schematic would be.

439
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:14,240
This person who was assigned to being exposed to receive an active treatment would show at every single person then unique as being exposed.

440
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:19,310
Right. And as receiving that actual with me, you know, taking it themselves or something.

441
00:55:20,490 --> 00:55:25,590
And this person who was assigned to placebo also has always been taking a placebo.

442
00:55:25,830 --> 00:55:29,070
Right. That's that's in ideal circumstances.

443
00:55:30,830 --> 00:55:34,160
But what if what if that's if that's the case?

444
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:43,090
The only way to analyze this data is by the strategy we call intend to treat.

445
00:55:45,170 --> 00:55:54,560
Because our intention to treat work perfectly and everybody took exactly what we intended them to take by chance.

446
00:55:54,800 --> 00:56:02,900
But they did okay. And again, this is the simplest way of analyzing the data.

447
00:56:03,770 --> 00:56:07,820
Your analysis exposure to variable is going to be equal to.

448
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:14,450
This. The first. They knew when they were randomized.

449
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:18,050
So the exposure is nothing but the treatment assignment.

450
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:31,610
It assumes that the exposure is actually fixed in that people will always take what they were assigned to.

451
00:56:32,390 --> 00:56:37,629
They will never switch. So that that means that a fixed exposure.

452
00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:42,610
Right. It ignores the actual duration of follow up.

453
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:47,130
Yes. Conventional. You don't. You don't care if.

454
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:56,560
If you know. This person, for example, was lost to follow up before finishing.

455
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:02,379
You just assume it was an average duration and. Would be Europe Minister.

456
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:12,580
Vienna. Follow up, EU-Canada. So basically you assume that this person would have been exposed for the full duration of follow up.

457
00:57:13,870 --> 00:57:20,100
Even if you didn't see that the. Now.

458
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:27,150
If you do that again, you will get. A measure that has a causal interpretation.

459
00:57:27,990 --> 00:57:33,300
Now that measure is likely to be conservative.

460
00:57:33,810 --> 00:57:38,280
That means the number you get, the cumulative incidence ratio you get.

461
00:57:40,510 --> 00:57:46,510
Is closer to one meaning no association than the actual effect.

462
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:54,550
Maybe. And we will see why later.

463
00:57:56,810 --> 00:57:59,510
The advantage, though, is that there are no other biases.

464
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:10,240
So in a way, I guess, you know, if you want to prevent disease, I guess being conservative is not too bad because you can say, well, at worst.

465
00:58:11,590 --> 00:58:17,330
This is how my intervention works. In reality, it might even be better, right?

466
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:21,010
But at worst, this is how it works. And there are no other biases.

467
00:58:23,330 --> 00:58:28,010
This type of approach should not involve adjustment.

468
00:58:29,810 --> 00:58:33,020
Meaning modeling or stratification.

469
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:38,020
We will establish a judgment starting next week or two weeks from today.

470
00:58:39,070 --> 00:58:43,600
But. I mean, you know what? Jasmine is in general modeling.

471
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:51,750
We get justice for. So if you are reading a trial that declares as the primary.

472
00:58:53,950 --> 00:58:58,210
Strategic as the primary analytic strategy they intend to treat.

473
00:58:58,750 --> 00:59:02,560
And then you find adjusted estimates.

474
00:59:04,090 --> 00:59:10,180
Those guys didn't take six hundreds or even maybe five or three, whatever.

475
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:14,840
You should not adjust.

476
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:24,290
Because while you adjust, if anything you are adjusting for you is equally distributed between your groups, you have exchange ability.

477
00:59:26,820 --> 00:59:30,570
Okay. No.

478
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:35,260
In real life. In real life, this is actually what happens.

479
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:44,710
You know, let's say if the the intervention was an active but with a pill with an active ingredient, then.

480
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:52,790
The control was a placebo or nothing. This person, perhaps this day for God's.

481
00:59:54,020 --> 01:00:01,820
To take the pill and maybe. Was, in fact, unexposed for that time, unique.

482
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:12,630
This person might have gotten the pill. This happens a lot again in in nutrition trials of fats like.

483
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:17,230
Vitamin D, the latest fad. So.

484
01:00:18,790 --> 01:00:25,750
A person was assigned to placebo in a vitamin D trial but heard the news that vitamin D is great for you.

485
01:00:26,650 --> 01:00:29,860
So is it. Hmm. Maybe I should take a little vitamin D.

486
01:00:31,620 --> 01:00:35,060
Right. And you may or may not know.

487
01:00:36,290 --> 01:00:39,530
That problem is is called lack of compliance.

488
01:00:40,810 --> 01:00:44,060
Lack of compliance. People are not complying.

489
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:47,830
People are making their treatment.

490
01:00:49,030 --> 01:00:52,150
Different than you assign them to.

491
01:00:55,920 --> 01:01:04,830
And what's the effect of that noncompliance with the causal effect you want to estimate this is what is likely to happen.

492
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:16,250
Assume that the treatment actually has an effect. You know, let's say in the vitamin D trial, your outcome is vitamin D levels in blood.

493
01:01:17,150 --> 01:01:22,670
So if you take vitamin D, your levels in blood are going to increase, just for sure.

494
01:01:24,820 --> 01:01:26,979
So if the ordinance was in effect,

495
01:01:26,980 --> 01:01:37,120
the benefits and the outcome among the treated will be less evident even if people assigned to vitamin D stop taking vitamin D.

496
01:01:37,150 --> 01:01:40,990
Right. So the vitamin D levels in blood will not increase as much as they should.

497
01:01:42,930 --> 01:01:47,280
Yes, because they are not taking as much as they were originally assigned to.

498
01:01:47,460 --> 01:01:49,350
They have skipped some days. Right.

499
01:01:52,210 --> 01:02:01,040
How about among people who were assigned to placebo to know vitamin D if they hear in the news that vitamin D is great and they take vitamin D?

500
01:02:01,060 --> 01:02:08,260
What's going to happen? Right.

501
01:02:08,270 --> 01:02:13,000
So the non-traded should have vitamin D levels like these, but they can then use that.

502
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:17,230
I mean, this is great. And they decide to take some. They will go up.

503
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:25,630
So in fact, the believe the outcome levels will become more similar between treated and untreated

504
01:02:25,630 --> 01:02:29,740
because the levels for treated will go down and the levels for untreated may go up.

505
01:02:30,610 --> 01:02:42,600
Right. And then if the original difference, if everybody had been taken, that was, let's say, ten nanomoles per liter.

506
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:50,320
And then in the three that some took place and went down and the untreated took more.

507
01:02:51,130 --> 01:02:56,020
And when that was the difference, it's going to be now it's a five or three.

508
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:00,880
So he's closer. To no effect.

509
01:03:02,870 --> 01:03:13,320
It's closer to north. In the indented approach, you will see the three or five difference.

510
01:03:15,410 --> 01:03:18,080
Because this is how people behaved in reality.

511
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:25,460
And you assumed that they had not changed because you took the original assignment at randomization as your exposure, right?

512
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:30,500
So you will see the three or the five. You will see the watered down effect.

513
01:03:32,190 --> 01:03:37,920
But in reality, had they both taken what they were supposed to be, friends would have been more.

514
01:03:38,340 --> 01:03:42,390
This is why they intend to tweet. Estimates are conservative.

515
01:03:43,630 --> 01:03:49,930
They tend to give you the idea that the treatment is less effective than it really is in real life.

516
01:03:50,380 --> 01:03:55,060
If everybody actually complies with. That lately.

517
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:12,550
Here with respect to treatment means with respect to being treated or not treated.

518
01:04:14,860 --> 01:04:19,650
I was wondering why. Because they become similar.

519
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:29,610
Well, because you may have a point that they become similar with respect to the outcome between the treated and the untreated, if you like.

520
01:04:31,170 --> 01:04:37,470
Yeah, but sometimes they're not treated. Could also be noncompliant if they take on treatment.

521
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:48,170
Yeah, that may happen. I guess, you know, it won't happen in studies of things that are not yet available like like COVID vaccine.

522
01:04:48,170 --> 01:04:54,740
You know, when when those studies were running, nobody who was assigned to the placebo would go and get a COVID vaccine.

523
01:04:55,370 --> 01:04:59,990
Well, maybe they could get an order from a different pharmaceutical company, but.

524
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:07,780
Yeah. So as opposed to that, some people say, well, you know,

525
01:05:07,780 --> 01:05:16,719
if we wanted to actually estimate the true effect that then animals that maybe we could move away from the intent to treat,

526
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:20,350
approach and use a non intent to treat approach.

527
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:26,790
So there are two types of non intent to treat approaches to analyze data from a randomized trial.

528
01:05:28,060 --> 01:05:33,640
They are the better protocol approach and the as treated approach.

529
01:05:35,340 --> 01:05:37,230
In the per protocol approach.

530
01:05:39,390 --> 01:05:52,740
Analysts will exclude from the analysis people who they consider non-compliant according to some relatively arbitrary rules they may want to apply.

531
01:05:53,940 --> 01:05:57,149
So every trial needs a measure of compliance.

532
01:05:57,150 --> 01:06:03,420
You know, in the vitamin D example, which is pretty handy if you are giving people vitamin D capsules.

533
01:06:04,140 --> 01:06:07,740
One measure of compliance could be every ten days an interim visit.

534
01:06:07,740 --> 01:06:17,090
When you check on people, you ask them to bring back the the bottle of of capsules and you count the remaining capsules.

535
01:06:18,030 --> 01:06:27,569
So the capsules that that have disappeared can be used as a measure of how much intervention the person actually took.

536
01:06:27,570 --> 01:06:41,070
What was the compliance? So some analysts might say, okay, if a person, anybody who brings that bottle 50% full,

537
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:47,640
I'm going to consider them as noncompliance and then I'm going to remove them from my analysis.

538
01:06:48,740 --> 01:06:54,320
That person is implementing a protocol analytical strategy.

539
01:06:57,390 --> 01:07:01,140
Um. No. No, not really.

540
01:07:01,830 --> 01:07:12,900
No. Is use exclusion. So if you had 200 participants in your trial originally and you find out that 20 were noncompliant by some criteria,

541
01:07:13,350 --> 01:07:17,009
you decide to exclude them from the analysis and then your dataset is going to be one.

542
01:07:17,010 --> 01:07:19,170
Had any of the complainers?

543
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:32,340
Now the other approach is to say way, how about instead of using this exposure, what I intended to give people and I intend to use,

544
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:40,230
let me use the measure of effect or one measure of effect or one measure of compliance.

545
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:42,980
As my exposure.

546
01:07:43,850 --> 01:07:57,920
So instead of excluding those 20 people who returned the bottles 50% full, let me use the percentage of pills on everybody's bottle as my exposure.

547
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:04,930
Regardless of whether they were in the intervention or the placebo group.

548
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:14,140
But engineers know. Is that clear?

549
01:08:14,410 --> 01:08:28,830
But what I'm trying to say. Individual because because this is sort of a data set type of manipulation for each person.

550
01:08:28,830 --> 01:08:32,970
You have to decide a new exposure level.

551
01:08:33,780 --> 01:08:39,570
And the proposition in this case is to use, let's say, the number of pills that they took.

552
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:46,470
So some people who might have been assigned to, let's say, the intervention.

553
01:08:47,650 --> 01:08:50,110
If they appear with very low compliance,

554
01:08:50,410 --> 01:08:59,230
they might actually be classified as if they had not been given the active intervention because they just took too few pills.

555
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:09,750
Right. So just using the actual. Treatment taken the amount of treatment taken as your exposure.

556
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:21,680
Yes. Yes. That's at the very end of the analytic stage.

557
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:38,620
Excellent question. Is this something planned or is this something that happens sort of post hoc?

558
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:43,000
I would say in most situations is the latter.

559
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:49,600
Because typically when you begin a plan, a randomized trial,

560
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:58,270
you expect high compliance and any study section will force you to implement measures to enhance compliance, etc.

561
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:08,530
From a practical point of view, so it's something that's done sometimes just because, hey, we had a problem here, we had lots of noncompliance.

562
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:16,630
What do we do? Well, and noncompliance will probably even cause your effect not to be zero.

563
01:10:18,290 --> 01:10:24,710
And that won't make it to the Lancet. So people will say, okay, let's see what happens if we instead.

564
01:10:26,330 --> 01:10:30,709
Use the actual compliance as as exposure and many trials,

565
01:10:30,710 --> 01:10:37,640
many publications you will see have an initial intent to treat analysis and then have supplementary.

566
01:10:39,910 --> 01:10:43,850
Zero per protocol analysis. I guess, depending on the results.

567
01:10:45,140 --> 01:10:48,900
Great question. Now. There is a problem, though.

568
01:10:49,260 --> 01:11:16,980
Yes. Right?

569
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:23,820
Right. So so the question is, if you are using the actual compliance, let's see, how do you treat that variable?

570
01:11:24,810 --> 01:11:33,150
So typically, people will go beyond that dichotomous scale and might might use different maybe groups you know of,

571
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:38,580
let's say, I don't know one thing people taking very little than people taking a little more.

572
01:11:38,590 --> 01:11:45,600
A little more people taking everything. Yeah. Right?

573
01:11:46,140 --> 01:11:52,950
Right. The interpretation will change depending on your analytic strategy and how you treat your exposure right while you have lots of freedom,

574
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:56,610
how to treat it. And typically you want to look for more richness.

575
01:11:58,310 --> 01:12:05,730
But there is a problem. Which is that once you leave, they intend to trade university.

576
01:12:06,150 --> 01:12:10,260
You are no longer analyzing a randomized trial.

577
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:15,300
You are analyzing an observational study. Why?

578
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:26,910
Because. There are incoming hearings into what people actually took or not.

579
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:33,050
That may be variables that also predict the outcome.

580
01:12:35,390 --> 01:12:39,240
So we will we will not get into those details here.

581
01:12:39,260 --> 01:12:42,020
Maybe we will go back when we study those specific buyers.

582
01:12:42,020 --> 01:12:51,770
But this protocol analysis is susceptible to a bias called selection bias, because you are excluding people who did not comply.

583
01:12:51,770 --> 01:12:57,320
And the reasons why they did not comply may be related both to the treatment and the.

584
01:12:59,820 --> 01:13:07,250
And as treated. Is susceptible of non exchange ability confounding.

585
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:18,920
Why? Because there were no forces into the randomized variable, but there are forces into how much of the randomized variable people in reality take.

586
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:26,620
And those forces might also cause the outcome. Therefore, you have a backdrop.

587
01:13:30,140 --> 01:13:41,350
I've been to banks. All right. After a bit of cherry picking here because we are running out of time, but I'll make sure to cover.

588
01:13:44,220 --> 01:13:49,459
What I wanted to. Which is this fear not.

589
01:13:49,460 --> 01:13:53,420
I mean, it looks like all these guys keeping everything good. No, it's all right.

590
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:59,830
Okay. So. I won't. I won't squeeze you and nothing that hasn't been covered and discussed.

591
01:14:00,190 --> 01:14:06,280
Fear not. Just enjoy the. Different people enjoy different things.

592
01:14:06,700 --> 01:14:14,280
So it's not think. At trial really any of them a logic study but more so trials.

593
01:14:15,570 --> 01:14:19,470
Trials are usually conducted in super selective populations.

594
01:14:20,340 --> 01:14:26,100
Right. So you may want to test an intervention that can be generalizable to the most.

595
01:14:28,310 --> 01:14:31,610
Most possible people. But in reality,

596
01:14:31,610 --> 01:14:40,819
that doesn't happen because the people who volunteer to participate in a trial may be very few and may have specific

597
01:14:40,820 --> 01:14:45,920
reasons to participate in trials and make them different from those who don't want to participate in trial.

598
01:14:47,210 --> 01:14:52,970
So, you know, the trials at the medical school, who are participants in those trials?

599
01:14:54,790 --> 01:14:58,360
Medical students. Yes, at schools of public health.

600
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:02,950
If immunology students. I was a patient. I was there.

601
01:15:02,950 --> 01:15:03,520
I was then.

602
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:12,250
I was a participant in a few trials myself, you know, when I was when I was a student also because, you know, some extra very much needed cash.

603
01:15:13,060 --> 01:15:20,050
Um, and changed really though the study is terrible because they should have brought them up to

604
01:15:20,060 --> 01:15:26,440
the air because they never pay me what they promised and they subjected me to terrible,

605
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:31,270
terrible things. I had to I had to drink Kool-Aid every day.

606
01:15:32,410 --> 01:15:36,160
As the first thing I had for like two weeks.

607
01:15:39,170 --> 01:15:49,880
And then give them my block. All right. So these people are not representative of the general target population.

608
01:15:50,450 --> 01:15:58,310
Typically, you have usually a general population that you wish you could generalize your results to.

609
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:00,880
And then you have to apply eligibility criteria.

610
01:16:00,890 --> 01:16:09,170
You know, if you are testing an intervention that works or works on something that happens to people of certain age or certain gender,

611
01:16:09,170 --> 01:16:15,950
etc., you start narrowing down your possible participants the pool of participants.

612
01:16:16,430 --> 01:16:19,909
Then you finally identify them and you send them letters of invitation.

613
01:16:19,910 --> 01:16:23,600
Or, you know, you post ads in the metro cities that have metro.

614
01:16:24,850 --> 01:16:31,780
And finally, you hope that some people will go back and unrolled it so that this study sample,

615
01:16:31,780 --> 01:16:39,520
which may be very different from this population during your study, let's say successfully, and you get an effect.

616
01:16:40,900 --> 01:16:52,060
Here. Question is, is that effect biased because it was conducted in a super selected population?

617
01:16:53,590 --> 01:16:57,550
It is not biased. First, it is not biased.

618
01:16:57,880 --> 01:16:59,440
If the trial is conducted properly,

619
01:17:00,490 --> 01:17:11,350
it simply may only apply to people who have the same characteristics of those who decided to participate in jury study.

620
01:17:12,670 --> 01:17:20,260
So there is a difference between bias and general ability or transportable transport ability.

621
01:17:20,260 --> 01:17:28,570
And it is the same I mean, being able to transport my ten nanomoles per liter from my trial into the general population,

622
01:17:28,900 --> 01:17:34,129
that may not be possible because the population may be very different from the people in whom.

623
01:17:34,130 --> 01:17:42,730
Michael Myers. Yes.

624
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:49,600
Yeah. These are different things and at least for the next.

625
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:55,600
Eight weeks or so. You better believe me. Okay.

626
01:17:56,780 --> 01:18:02,830
The. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But, you know, I try not to read crappy papers, but sometimes it's kind of.

627
01:18:04,230 --> 01:18:13,680
Yeah. Absolutely. So please, a non-representative sample does not result in biased estimate of effect necessarily.

628
01:18:14,770 --> 01:18:18,340
Or it is not because he's not a representative something.

629
01:18:20,230 --> 01:18:26,080
Mind you, very important. This only applies to randomized trials.

630
01:18:27,780 --> 01:18:34,200
We will go through a full session in other designs where this may not be the case.

631
01:18:34,470 --> 01:18:39,480
So you have to put I don't know if maybe the examples you are referring to, Maria, are from Nonrandomized.

632
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:42,570
Right. But this only applies to randomized.

633
01:18:43,830 --> 01:18:49,900
Important footnote there. All right.

634
01:18:50,810 --> 01:18:54,490
It is interesting that any questions?

635
01:19:05,080 --> 01:19:09,620
Speechless. Well, let's see of the progress report.

636
01:19:09,620 --> 01:19:15,660
What we need to salvage. Well, I think this is important.

637
01:19:16,290 --> 01:19:22,990
Let's talk about the limitations of front. They are not available for oil exposures.

638
01:19:24,190 --> 01:19:29,920
In fact, for very, very few, I would say fewer than 1%.

639
01:19:30,340 --> 01:19:34,560
What we are interested in in the female. They are very costly, of course.

640
01:19:34,580 --> 01:19:47,390
They are time consuming. They are up into some bias that proper of this type of study know lack of compliance those to follow up.

641
01:19:49,230 --> 01:19:57,540
There is an issue of timeliness or futility. Let's say in the example of don't supplements in Zanzibar babies.
