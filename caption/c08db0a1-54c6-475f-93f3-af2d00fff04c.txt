1
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:32,000
Okay. Today, we're going to talk about vitamin D and immune function.

2
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:35,690
How many of you have heard anything about this topic?

3
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:45,940
A little bit. Yeah. You know, I just think that it's interesting and controversial.

4
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:49,540
And we're going to go over just the big picture today.

5
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:54,190
And then at the end of the lecture, I'll focus on tuberculosis,

6
00:00:54,340 --> 00:01:03,520
because this is where a lot of what we've learned from research on immune function in vitamin D has come from.

7
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:11,840
So this is for you, for those of you who took micronutrients last semester.

8
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:18,320
But how do you get vitamin D? You get it from exposure to sunlight and you get it from your diet.

9
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:28,220
So it's the UVB light from the sunlight that actually causes a conversion of a precursor in your skin.

10
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:38,780
The seven day hydroxy cholesterol to be converted to another precursor prebiotic three that in the presence of heat,

11
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:42,380
is further converted to vitamin D three.

12
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:46,010
But it's still not the active form of the vitamin.

13
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:54,680
And you'll also see vitamin D3 described in terms of it acting like a hormone.

14
00:01:54,890 --> 00:02:00,920
Okay. So it's a micronutrient and a hormone. And how do you get it from your diet?

15
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:06,590
Well, there are some natural sources, such as from fish, fatty fish, you know,

16
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:17,030
and it's also present in dairy foods, milk, cheese due to supplementation.

17
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:28,910
So the precursor vitamin D3 for in case of a dietary form, D2 or D3 is taken up in your blood.

18
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:33,170
And because it's lipid soluble, it needs to be carried.

19
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:42,950
And it does this by being down to a carrier protein that there there's been a vitamin D binding protein being described.

20
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:52,280
There is a vitamin D can also bind to lipoproteins and be transported throughout the body through these carrier mechanisms.

21
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:58,640
It's circulation, your blood, and it reaches your liver.

22
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:10,400
And then the liver you have this enzyme, 25 hydroxylase, and it's this enzyme that can provide the first hydroxylase reaction,

23
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:16,700
giving you 25 hydroxy vitamin D, and this circulates in your blood.

24
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:29,270
It gets to the kidney that has this enzyme, the one hydroxylase enzyme that can give you the active form of the hormone here.

25
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:39,110
125 DI hydroxy vitamin D, that's the active form and it has many different functions.

26
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:47,100
The classical functions are those related to vitamin D and bone health, bone and calcium homeostasis.

27
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:52,430
So let's look at this side of the diagram first.

28
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:58,310
So in regard to bone formation,

29
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:10,399
so you have this interaction between osteoblasts and osteoblasts and vitamin D can preserve the bone in terms of the

30
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:19,130
amount of calcium phosphate that is present in the bone by inhibiting the activity or the action of the osteo class,

31
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:31,460
which degrade the bone and liberates calcium and hydrogen phosphate from the bone to increase phosphorus and calcium levels in the blood.

32
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:39,350
Okay. Vitamin D prevents that from occurring so it helps maintain bone calcium.

33
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:45,920
Right? In opposition to that, you have parathyroid hormone.

34
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:55,130
And when calcium levels decline to a certain degree, parathyroid hormone is produced by the parathyroid glands.

35
00:04:55,940 --> 00:05:02,569
And this has an effect on the osteoblasts and it actually has the reverse effect

36
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:06,650
that it can activate the osteoblasts so that there's more calcium release.

37
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:20,420
To normalize blood calcium levels. So the other thing that vitamin D does is it increases absorption of calcium from the gut in the small intestine,

38
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:24,320
giving you more calcium, more phosphate absorption.

39
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:27,090
Another way to increase blood calcium.

40
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:38,360
Now, parathyroid hormone acts by inhibiting the conversion of the precursor forms of vitamin D to the active form.

41
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:48,990
And then here are some breakdown. Products of 25 HYDROXYLASE is a metabolizing enzyme that's activated and increases,

42
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:54,050
you know, in response to increases in the active form of vitamin D.

43
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:59,150
So it kind of shuts down its own synthesis and you excrete this through the urine.

44
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:08,420
So this is the dynamic interplay between vitamin D and parathyroid hormone and the regulation of blood calcium.

45
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:27,260
Okay. So in regard to exposure to UVB from from sunlight,

46
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:37,820
this the availability of sunlight to do this if you live in the upper regions of the globe is compromised.

47
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:50,750
And the point at which this becomes an issue is if you're living above the 37th parallel, so your exposure to UVB radiation is compromised,

48
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:58,340
especially in the winter months, because of that reduction in the amount of sun that you're exposed to.

49
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:06,770
Okay. And to add to that, if you're covering your skin with clothes and because it's cold outside, right,

50
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:21,200
and it's cloudy like it is in Michigan, your ability to produce the active form of the vitamin is substantially reduced as a consequence.

51
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:27,590
Now, vitamin D is a fat soluble vitamin C, you can store it in lipids.

52
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:34,610
And so it has a longer half life than than water soluble micronutrients.

53
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:42,470
But in terms of your ability to get enough vitamin D from sunlight exposure, it's compromised in the winter months.

54
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:51,620
You live above this 37 parallel. So this is a this is a hot topic.

55
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:57,140
It's an area of controversy for a number of reasons. And I'm going to walk through this really slowly.

56
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:03,290
So when you say someone has a vitamin D deficiency,

57
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:11,540
you have to look very carefully about what they mean about that in terms of the level of vitamin D in their blood.

58
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:22,460
So we're talking now specifically about the precursor, the 25 hydroxy vitamin D that you actually measure and a serum sample.

59
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:36,990
The optimal levels of vitamin D in terms of what's been shown to promote bone health is based on this number here,

60
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:43,470
30 to 32 nanograms for AML or 75 to 80 nanometer.

61
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:56,840
Right. The optimal level. And if you're exposed to sunlight for 10 to 15 minutes a day, not in the wintertime.

62
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:05,570
And if you live in the northern latitudes a few times a week, this is enough to get you enough vitamin D circulating in your body.

63
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:17,800
So when we talk about inadequate amounts of vitamin D, it depends on another number of things.

64
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:25,480
So physiologically, we talk about calcium levels and calcium homeostasis,

65
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:31,090
but I'm going to first talk here about the concepts of insufficiency and deficiency.

66
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:37,030
So when you say somebody has an insufficient amount of vitamin D,

67
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:46,630
you're saying that the level of vitamin D 25 hydroxy vitamin D is below the threshold, less than 25 nanograms for Miller.

68
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:51,940
15 animal. Or if you say that somebody has a vitamin D deficiency,

69
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:59,830
that means that they're 25 hydroxy vitamin D is less than eight nanograms for animal or less than 20 NANOMOLES.

70
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:05,300
That's an important distinction. Physiologically.

71
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:16,070
So physiologically, if you go below this level of deficiency, you'll start to see significant manifestations.

72
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:21,050
So in children, you're going to see the appearance of rickets.

73
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,640
And I'll show you what that looks like in children here in a moment.

74
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:36,990
And adults. Adults who have vitamin D deficiency will develop a condition called off stimulation.

75
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:41,190
And this is essentially a reduction in bone density.

76
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:50,010
So the bone becomes becomes more porous and it weakens as a consequence of this.

77
00:10:51,360 --> 00:11:02,040
And then another condition can arise with chronic vitamin D deficiency is a condition called osteoporosis,

78
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:10,140
where you're actually losing bone mass as a consequence of having the calcium pull from a bulk of calcium

79
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:17,160
phosphate being pulled from the bone for a long period of time in response to a vitamin D deficiency.

80
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:23,220
And this can be accelerated in the elderly, particularly in women.

81
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:28,140
Estrogen is thought to be protective against these responses.

82
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:47,060
So I mentioned that the parathyroid hormone and vitamin D have this interaction and that when vitamin D levels are high,

83
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:53,750
it's going to inhibit parathyroid hormone because blood calcium levels are this certain level.

84
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:59,960
But when blood calcium levels start to reach a certain threshold, then we will see an increase in parathyroid.

85
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:10,970
So when we reach the level of vitamin D that is equivalent to 12 nanograms AL or 30 Anna Molar.

86
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:18,960
This is correlated with parathyroid hormone levels and intestinal calcium intake or uptake, I should say.

87
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:25,070
So perhaps somewhere in between here insufficiency the deficiency,

88
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:32,150
we'll start to see changes in blood hormones that of things that are known to regulate blood calcium.

89
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:39,430
So these are really important distinctions when we say you have a vitamin D deficiency.

90
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:48,820
To someone and the question arises if you have a deficiency, but will supplementation make a difference?

91
00:12:49,690 --> 00:13:00,370
But before we get into addressing that question, I'm going to talk first of all about the idea of vitamin D deficiency based on different cut points.

92
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:12,640
So if we looked at the population in the United States and we consider different thresholds, you find that in regard to vitamin D deficiency,

93
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:21,520
and we're talking about everyone here that has a level of vitamin D now that's below 30 NANOMOLES.

94
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:25,930
It's a relatively small percentage. It's 5.9%.

95
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:33,670
But if we make that adjustment to saying, okay, deficiency is less than 40 nanomoles,

96
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,540
well, then we're talking about 13% of the population, not twice as much.

97
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:47,260
But if we set the threshold at 15 animals, which we would classically call this insufficiency, that's 24% of the population.

98
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:58,030
Okay. So when you hear people throw around numbers of such and such percentage of the population in the United States has a vitamin D deficiency.

99
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:01,629
The question you need to ask next is what's the threshold?

100
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:16,890
Which threshold are you using? So using this cut off a third animal or looking at different ethnic, popular,

101
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:21,180
ethnic, racial and ethnic populations, you see some striking differences.

102
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:30,120
So this is coming from a paper published in the journal Nutrition in 2016.

103
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:37,110
Based on NHANES data now, which is non-Hispanic black population at 24%,

104
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:45,900
that population has less than 13 animal or vitamin D circulating in their blood.

105
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:56,370
And it's a higher level of pigmentation in their skin that's thought to be responsible for this reduced level of vitamin D.

106
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:59,370
And there are probably other factors as well.

107
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:11,760
Another group is Hispanics, 6.4% that that are below the threshold and then nonwhite Hispanic, about 2.3%.

108
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:18,450
And this is everyone. Okay. The numbers are a little bit different when you're looking at just children or the elderly.

109
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:23,639
But this this is the this is all age groups.

110
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:36,900
And I'm showing you data here for. So this analysis suggests that by like the region in the U.S., this yes, it's a really important question.

111
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:44,310
This is during the months of the year when sunlight is people are exposed to sunlight.

112
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,820
When we look at other times of the year, like in the wintertime, the values might be a little bit different.

113
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:56,310
So that's another important consideration of one. These this is taken.

114
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:14,020
So. I'm going to talk about risk factors next.

115
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,200
And there are quite a few lack of sun exposure.

116
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:32,770
And again, that depends on the latitude that you live and whether or not you cover up a certain part of part of your skin with the clothing.

117
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:42,460
There are certain groups of individuals because of cultural and religious practices, cover up every part of their skin.

118
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:49,840
And because of that, they're going to have less exposure to sunlight and lower levels of vitamin D.

119
00:16:53,240 --> 00:17:03,230
And the elderly, because not only do they have a tendency to cover up their skin temperature issues,

120
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:11,690
want to keep warm, their ability to convert to seven hydroxy vitamin D, enough of that in the skin.

121
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:17,990
Two The precursor levels are the precursor of the the vitamin that's diminished.

122
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:24,690
So that declines with age. Support health status.

123
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:33,330
If you have liver or kidney disease, it's going to reduce your ability to convert the precursor vitamin D to the active forms.

124
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:50,100
If you have diseases that affect the absorption of micronutrients from your gut, and if you have an issue with the secretion of bile into your gut,

125
00:17:50,850 --> 00:18:00,420
which is going to limit the absorption of lipid soluble nutrients, this is going to result in lower circulating vitamin D levels in your body.

126
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:11,480
If you abstained from milk, especially in the wintertime, this puts you at a higher risk.

127
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:20,959
So milk and dairy products there, this is a daily consumption if you absorb, but if you abstain from it daily.

128
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:26,180
So this is one microgram per 100 grams of dairy products.

129
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:36,440
This is the level of supplementation the US again, if you live in above 37 north latitude age,

130
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:40,700
as I mentioned, you have a reduced ability to convert the precursor.

131
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:54,080
You don't have as much precursor in your skin. If you have highly pigmented skin, there's less UVB that is activating that.

132
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,290
The enzymes that convert the precursor.

133
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:06,530
And people who are avoiding dairy foods or who are vegans, they're going to be at a higher risk.

134
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:15,950
There are many, many different kinds of formulations of plant based milks that have been supplemented with vitamin D.

135
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:21,440
So this is a way to get a sufficient amount of dietary vitamin D from those types of sources.

136
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:28,610
People who don't have a college education.

137
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:32,720
Perhaps these are individuals in a lower socioeconomic class.

138
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:41,270
This is this is a risk factor for vitamin D deficiency and then obesity.

139
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:46,280
So why would this happen? It has to do with the sequestration of lipids.

140
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:54,920
So if you have more stored lipids than vitamin D, it's going to be partitioned throughout that lipid in your body.

141
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:59,780
And as a consequence, the levels of circulating vitamin D will be lower.

142
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,530
There's an association between lower vitamin D levels and hypertension.

143
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:20,500
And offhand, I don't understand the association, but it's a risk factor having low HDL cholesterol.

144
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:25,870
So lipoproteins, transport, lipid soluble vitamins.

145
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:31,410
And perhaps this is why you would see a vitamin D deficiency in this particular state.

146
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:42,620
Okay. So we supplement food in North America, dairy products with vitamin D to prevent rickets.

147
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:51,500
So this is a 12 year old child. And this is a a case study taken from the New England Journal of Medicine 2013.

148
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:57,620
We're still seeing cases of vitamin D deficiency.

149
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:07,370
This particular child had that condition that the biliary dyskinesia, that that is why this child has rickets anyhow.

150
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:13,310
But notice the child is his gut, isn't his bull leg.

151
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:16,550
It would be bowlegged. But look at there, look at his hands, ankles.

152
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:27,709
There's soft tissue and the the ankles as a consequence, they don't have they're not able to stand up straight.

153
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:34,400
Their leg has that ankle now. It folds and and that's how this child is that has the ability to stand.

154
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:43,429
So it's this lack of maturation of the bone in this child that has caused this

155
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:46,640
condition because they're not absorbing enough vitamin D from their gut,

156
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:58,490
because the bile is not being produced and what's not it's not getting into the small intestine, allowing this to absorb lipid soluble vitamins.

157
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:07,640
So this child was put on vitamin D and calcium supplements.

158
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:17,900
And this is a child after the treatment. And you see that the issues related to the ankle bones have have result.

159
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:23,840
There were some surgeries done to correct the spinal abnormalities.

160
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,680
So one of the things that I didn't mention here was there was some scoliosis.

161
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:33,980
So this child had spinal fusion done, too, to kind of straighten up her back.

162
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:40,580
And then she also had surgery done on her knees to correct that both leg in this.

163
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:45,830
But you can see that it's still a little bit still apparently in this particular right leg.

164
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:53,300
So you still see rickets in children, especially in developing countries.

165
00:22:54,470 --> 00:23:10,280
So the prevalence of rickets in children was very high before vitamin D was supplemented and in dairy products, U.S. and other countries.

166
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:22,250
So in the 19th century, for example, it was very common for children have rickets, especially in northern climates such as the United Kingdom.

167
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:37,530
So in response to all of the information we've been hearing about vitamin D and vitamin D deficiency and lots of things,

168
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:46,080
you can buy these vitamin D supplements anywhere and you'll see different dosages.

169
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:50,390
This particular package here is a mega dose of vitamin D.

170
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:57,540
So this is 5000 international units, 125 micrograms.

171
00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:06,180
This is a whopping dose of vitamin D and in terms of conversion of units.

172
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:13,110
So one international unit is equivalent to 0.0 to 5 micrograms.

173
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:24,660
So this is a very high dose, the RDA for this and in terms of micrograms per day in international units is 15 to 20,

174
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:28,140
which is about 600 to 800 international units.

175
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:38,550
So you'll often see the value of 600 international units are 5015 micrograms a day for everyone and pregnant women.

176
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:41,910
And in other instances, you'll see a higher dosage.

177
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:52,080
So that's the amount that's recommended. And if you take one of these tablets here that so it's much, much higher than what you actually need.

178
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:59,910
So if you have higher levels of the precursors, this is the precursor now.

179
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:09,780
What do you think happens to it? You take it higher levels for your youth and store that you can you can store it.

180
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:13,530
But will you will that be converted to to more active form?

181
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:18,000
But the one for me was it will be excreted.

182
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:22,650
Some of it will be excreted. But if you're. Yes.

183
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:26,730
But there's also the danger of vitamin D toxicity.

184
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:33,210
And it's more common now than it ever was because of this kind of dosage.

185
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:37,950
So because it's lipid soluble and it's going to stay around for a while,

186
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:46,140
you can develop a turtle bones as a consequence of maintaining high levels of vitamin D as a consequence.

187
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:55,920
So this is that if you're not exposed to skin, you could take the supplement.

188
00:25:57,630 --> 00:26:02,610
Foods are fortified with vitamin D, especially breakfast cereals and dairy products.

189
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:12,840
And this was incredible in terms of it reducing the prevalence of rickets in the United States.

190
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,270
And I can't give you a quote numbers here,

191
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:25,260
but this was a dramatic improvement in public health when this use of vitamin D for milk, for example, was used.

192
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:31,500
So the supplements in 28% of the US population takes vitamin D supplements.

193
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:39,500
So it comes in the form of 400 to 5000 international units in terms of their dosing.

194
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:51,020
And so I talk to you primarily about the classical functions, physiologic functions of vitamin D,

195
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:59,570
but you've also heard in the news lots of other lots of other information regarding its non-classical effects,

196
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:05,150
and that has to do with its use as a way to prevent certain diseases.

197
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:12,680
And when you look at these studies, they include things like all kinds of cancers,

198
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:19,550
cardiovascular disease, bone fractures, diabetes, depression, multiple sclerosis.

199
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:26,810
All of these conditions are associated with vitamin D deficiency.

200
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,530
And because of this,

201
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:42,710
a number of physicians have jumped on the bandwagon of vitamin D supplementation and supplementation along with vitamin D with calcium as well.

202
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:51,350
So why do you think that this practice started?

203
00:27:53,000 --> 00:28:03,770
And is there a real connection here between vitamin D deficiency and diseases like cancer, cardiovascular disease, bone fractures and so on?

204
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:17,590
So if you're older, it's as you get older, you're more susceptible to these types of diseases.

205
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:23,370
Right. And when you get older, you have less of a tendency to get out, go outside,

206
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:29,460
and you might have other chronic issues that prevent you from getting enough sunlight.

207
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:38,670
Right. So associated with that is lower vitamin A, lower vitamin D levels.

208
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:44,160
And this particular population also has these types of conditions.

209
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:48,510
Right. Multiple sclerosis affects the young as well as the old.

210
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:51,900
And that's another topic that I'll touch on a little bit later.

211
00:28:52,380 --> 00:29:00,690
But because of this association, it was assumed that, oh, it's the vitamin D deficiency that's responsible for these consequences.

212
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:05,790
There have been studies looking at vitamin D deficiency,

213
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:12,600
lifelong vitamin D deficiency and susceptibility to cancer, certain types of colon cancer, for example.

214
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:26,219
And those studies have been done in animal models, and they show a benefit and a lifelong vitamin D deficiency and cancer in animal models.

215
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:33,000
But in human studies where you're looking at a large population, you give the vitamin D supplements and you follow them for a long period of time.

216
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:41,130
We're not finding a significant benefit of the vitamin D supplementation in preventing cancer and other things that have mentioned here.

217
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:45,270
Have you talked about this in the vitamins and minerals class?

218
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:50,440
If you did, you don't remember. Is that what you're thinking? Yeah.

219
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:54,900
Okay. Do you want to talk about it to my kids?

220
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:58,990
About, like, chronic diseases? Okay.

221
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:15,940
All right. Okay. All right. So in The New York Times in 2018, this article came out and it discussed vitamin D supplementation.

222
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:23,290
And there was a physician at Boston University Medical Center who was kind of

223
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:28,360
the pioneer behind the effort to get everybody to take vitamin D supplements.

224
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:40,790
So his name was Michael Holick, and he was looking at data, large population data and Haines data,

225
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:47,630
and he noticed that there was lower vitamin D levels in people who had these chronic diseases.

226
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:56,690
Okay. So he came up with the conclusion that high vitamin D that's responsible for these problems.

227
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:08,030
So only if people got enough vitamin D, we could prevent and treat people with these conditions with extra vitamin D in it and it will work.

228
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:13,580
Right. Well, this is one man's opinion.

229
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:21,230
And he was able to become the chair of the Endocrine Society's Committee on Vitamin D in 2011.

230
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:38,300
And because of that position that he had, he, with his committee, came up with this recommendation that the minimum level of vitamin D in blood.

231
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:47,600
Okay, this is the vitamin D3, but this is the precursor of the 25 hydroxy should be 35 nanograms per hour, 75 and over.

232
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:53,300
And anything below this would indicate a vitamin D deficiency.

233
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:03,320
Okay. So the Endocrine Society is very influential in terms of clinical practice.

234
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:13,580
When they come up with a recommendation, it can become the standard of care for the greater population.

235
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:26,719
Okay. So based on this recommendation, a lot of things happened in terms of assessment of vitamin D,

236
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,170
supplementation of vitamin C, sorry, vitamin D and so on.

237
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:37,040
But one of the things you have to do when you serve on one of these committees is to disclose your conflicts.

238
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:43,130
How many of you have taken a short course on conflict of interest?

239
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:49,860
Generally, did you have to take a conflict of interest? I think it was like, Oh, really?

240
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:58,520
Yeah. Yeah. So the first thing you need to do, if you are receiving proceeds that exceed a certain dollar value, it's $5,000 a year.

241
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:08,630
Or if your assets are more than 5% invested in a particular company, that could make it could make vitamin D supplements, for example.

242
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:19,370
You need to disclose that interest. And it turns out that this guy, Michael Holick, had a significant conflict of interest.

243
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:32,620
So between 2013 and 2017, he received $163,000 from drug companies that made vitamin D supplements.

244
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:48,760
He also was getting $12,000 a year for companies that provided the analysis, the equipment, the reagents to assess vitamin D levels.

245
00:33:50,050 --> 00:34:01,780
And it gets worse. He also received $150,000 from the companies that make the tanning beds as well.

246
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:08,350
And then he had he had written books on vitamin D and health and disease.

247
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:12,430
And I'm not sure if anybody knows how much that amounted to.

248
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:15,340
So he had a significant conflict of interest.

249
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:24,670
Now, that should have entered into the decision of the Endocrine Society's threshold of vitamin D levels.

250
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:38,260
So there he is. There he is with the tanning bed that we know is this is a significant threat to skin cancer.

251
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:48,010
So over and over again, if you look at people who are exposed to UV radiation from the sun or from tanning beds,

252
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:53,890
you see a significant increase in skin cancer. And this guy was promoting this practice.

253
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:00,690
So this was kind of a scam. And as a consequence.

254
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:12,460
He was able to get Medicare now to fund a routine basis, vitamin D assessments.

255
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:31,130
So she if you had an individual who had a level of vitamin D now that was below this 25 to 35, 30 nanograms threshold,

256
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:44,780
they were diagnosed with vitamin D insufficiency and they were given vitamin D and calcium supplements to address this.

257
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:48,770
For the most part,

258
00:35:49,380 --> 00:36:00,830
the amount of dosage of vitamin D and calcium that was given or that is recommended to address this is much is not 5000 international units a day.

259
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:13,520
It's below that threshold. The recommended supplementation is not been shown to be harmful, but not been shown to be beneficial either.

260
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:25,770
So if you look at large longitudinal studies in regard to the prevention or treatment of cancer,

261
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:32,320
hip fractures, cardiovascular disease, you find that there's really no benefit to this practice.

262
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:43,260
And as a consequence of this and even before this, this is 2010.

263
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:45,090
This is before this guy became chair.

264
00:36:46,260 --> 00:37:00,480
It was known for a very long time that providing vitamin D supplements to individuals with normal levels of vitamin D at the 20 Nandigram parameter,

265
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:05,370
this is what they were calling this. The normal level wasn't beneficial.

266
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:16,440
So we're kind of revisiting areas of controversy with this claim that vitamin D is going to prevent all of these diseases.

267
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:20,129
2010. Institute of Medicine. So there's no benefit.

268
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:26,730
And then this guy comes along, changes the threshold, recommends this item in mean he has a conflict of interest.

269
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:32,100
And we discover, again, that this supplementation practice really doesn't do anything.

270
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:41,620
Okay. So so far we've been talking about the classical effects of vitamin D.

271
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:48,130
And when you hear classical effects of vitamin D, you think bone health, bone marrow homeostasis.

272
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:56,260
And when we talk about non-classical effects, we're talking about other things such as prevention of cancer,

273
00:37:56,260 --> 00:38:04,090
its effect in hypertension, neurological effects, and specifically about the effect of vitamin D in immune function.

274
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:21,850
All right. So I think in the very beginning of today's talk, I mentioned that vitamin D has to be activated and it's hydroxylase in the liver,

275
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:32,170
the precursor is and that it goes to the kidney and it's gets this second hydroxylase and step word immune cells come into play.

276
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:36,190
Do immune cells contain these vitamin D metabolizing enzymes?

277
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:39,430
Well,

278
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:57,100
the established effect of vitamin D is based on the ability of the vitamin here to be recognized and to bind to its membrane bound vitamin D receptor.

279
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:02,260
Okay. So this is the classical pathway now.

280
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:08,650
So the vitamin D receptor. Excuse me.

281
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:27,410
Oh, moves from the cytoplasm to the nucleus where it forms this complex with the retinoid retinoic acid receptor,

282
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:36,740
which is also the cytosolic, uh, transcription factor.

283
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:44,510
And it binds to an area of the DNA that controls and drives gene transcription.

284
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:49,800
So once this club got this complexes formed,

285
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:59,850
you get binding to the vitamin D response elements and an increase in a number of genes that play a role in the action of vitamin D.

286
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:11,740
What is been claimed and now is very still very controversial is this non genomic effect of vitamin D.

287
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:17,410
So there have been a number of reports in the literature and I'm not sure where this science

288
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:23,410
is or if there's anything related to this non genomic or hypothesized effects of vitamin D.

289
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:35,350
So at one time there was some experiments that had shown evidence of a non genomic activity of vitamin D,

290
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:43,150
so it would bind to some receptor, a G protein coupled receptor of some sort that would activate intracellular signaling cascades.

291
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:49,060
And perhaps there was crosstalk between the classical and the non-classical pathways.

292
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:57,610
This is highly controversial. So if you run into papers and publications that talk about this, well, that's not been well received.

293
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:07,850
Now I'm going to focus on the ability of the immune cells now to metabolize vitamin D.

294
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:14,060
So in this particular figure you're seeing, you know, you're exposed to radiation.

295
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:17,780
The skin has this precursor.

296
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:22,310
The seven hydroxy cholesterol is converted to vitamin D3.

297
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:32,660
And you can get that from your diet and that is hydroxylase in the liver and that circulates in your blood and it's taken up by your immune cells.

298
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:47,959
In addition, here's a dendritic cell or a macrophage, and it has this enzyme, this 25 hydroxylase adherence referred to as just to be more confusing.

299
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:57,770
It's referred to as cytochrome p450 2781, which is essentially the enzyme that adds the first hydroxyl group to the vitamin D.

300
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:03,560
So this can be used internally in the cell.

301
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:16,730
And the formation of this precursor to the 25 hydroxy form can, through a paraffin effect, affect other immune cells.

302
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:18,740
And shown here is a tier of these cell.

303
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:34,610
Within the macrophage per dendritic cell, you have this capacity to convert this precursor to the active form which is taken into the nucleus,

304
00:42:34,610 --> 00:42:45,290
and you get the binding to the vitamin D receptor response element and you get that the the increase in things that affect immune function.

305
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:49,790
The same thing can happen in the beer, the t cell.

306
00:42:52,640 --> 00:43:02,240
But there can be different consequences of this in terms of the vitamin D and its effects on myeloid cells,

307
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:07,130
macrophages and dendritic cells, and in lymphocytes, the BS and B and T cells.

308
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:19,870
So the first two cell types here, the monocytes, macrophages and the dendritic cells,

309
00:43:19,870 --> 00:43:30,430
they have this vitamin D receptor and that vitamin D receptor is upregulated when these cells see something that activates these toll like receptors.

310
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:39,280
Toll like receptor is a receptor that recognizes lipopolysaccharide and the surface of bacteria.

311
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:47,010
So the cell becomes activated and that signaling cascade occurs.

312
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:54,670
And one of the things that occurs as a consequence of that signaling cascade is an upregulation of the vitamin D receptor.

313
00:43:56,500 --> 00:44:07,030
And and in the in the presence of vitamin D, you get an activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

314
00:44:07,870 --> 00:44:14,350
You get a proliferation of these cell types and you get the production of this antimicrobial peptide.

315
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:22,120
Capital aside, remember we talked about antimicrobial peptides when we're talking about vitamin A in the beginning of the semester.

316
00:44:23,290 --> 00:44:34,240
And then, as I mentioned, you get an increase in the vitamin D receptor expression and the enzyme that converts the precursor to the active form.

317
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,530
So that's what happens in macrophages and monocytes.

318
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:46,360
And the antigen presenting cell, you get a kind of a different scenario, but it's something that would promote host effects.

319
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:56,709
So in the dendritic cells, you get different responses in the presence of vitamin D and actually reduces maturation.

320
00:44:56,710 --> 00:45:07,840
It reduces MHC Class two presentation and markers of dendritic cell maturation less

321
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:15,380
about 12 and an increase in I'll ten not ten is an anti inflammatory cytokine.

322
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:20,770
So it's cell type specific in terms of the effects that it can have.

323
00:45:23,450 --> 00:45:33,589
So what that I'll tend does in other cytokines that are produced by these dendritic cells in the presence

324
00:45:33,590 --> 00:45:45,380
of vitamin D is that it inhibits ath1 cell response and it promotes a T regulatory cell response.

325
00:45:46,370 --> 00:45:55,970
So in the lymphocytes, you see another effect that it seem to be very different than in the macrophages, in the monocytes.

326
00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:07,130
So there's this indirect effect of vitamin D on these cell types, you know, and here's what you see.

327
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:17,930
So and the T cells, the effector or the memory T cells, there's less pro-inflammatory cytokines production that the CD8 positive T cells,

328
00:46:17,930 --> 00:46:23,209
their cytotoxicity, their ability to kill infected cells and kill cancer cells.

329
00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:28,670
Well, that goes down, actually. And there's less proliferation of these cells in the presence of vitamin D,

330
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:38,540
and it changes the ratio of CD4 to CD8 cells and it promotes anti-inflammatory cytokines for and I.

331
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:45,320
Okay. And then you get an increase in the t, t, r one or two t regulatory cell production.

332
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:55,790
And so there's this kind of anti inflammatory effect in the T cells, which is different than what you saw in the macrophages.

333
00:46:57,580 --> 00:47:04,930
And the B-cells or the antibody secreting cells a SC is there.

334
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:13,840
They proliferate more slowly, but their production of the globulin slows down and the cells don't differentiate as much.

335
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:25,240
You get an increase in the vitamin D receptor here and you get an increase in the enzyme that inactivates the active form of vitamin D at 2041,

336
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:28,660
the cytochrome p450 2041.

337
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:37,239
So depending on the cell type, you have different effects of vitamin D making its role in infectious disease.

338
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:42,040
Very confusing. And other types of immune responses.

339
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:56,090
So most of the studies that we've seen that have focused on Vitamin D and that have received a lot of press,

340
00:47:57,590 --> 00:48:03,380
have been on the effect of vitamin D in macrophages and monocytes.

341
00:48:03,830 --> 00:48:11,180
It's mainly the stimulatory and infectious disease and in particular, tuberculosis,

342
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:14,720
which I'm going to talk a bit about here as we go through today's talk.

343
00:48:16,370 --> 00:48:21,650
But in terms of adaptive immune responses, it seems to be suppressive in adaptive immunity.

344
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:30,830
And so dendritic cells and being t cells, it seems seems to suppress their immunologic functions.

345
00:48:33,050 --> 00:48:41,150
So I mentioned earlier that there was considerable interest in using vitamin D to treat autoimmune diseases like.

346
00:48:41,510 --> 00:48:48,000
Um. Um, um. And it's escaping my mind.

347
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:51,480
I just. I just thought about it. I'm having a senior moment.

348
00:48:53,010 --> 00:48:56,400
Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease that affects the nerves.

349
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:03,750
And there had been considerable interest in using supplemental vitamin D to to suppress that.

350
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:13,260
So there have been a number of papers looking at vitamin D supplementation to suppress autoimmune function.

351
00:49:13,830 --> 00:49:19,770
So here's a couple of papers that were published in high impact journals.

352
00:49:21,150 --> 00:49:23,340
So experimental autoimmune is a philosophy.

353
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:33,959
This is a mouse model for mice have been shown to cause CD4+ T cell a pertussis and these particular CD4 t cells were

354
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:43,650
making cytokines that were promoting this this autoimmune response against the nerves in these animals causing mice.

355
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:55,470
Also, there has been interest in treating people with vitamin D to suppress autoimmunity in type one diabetes.

356
00:49:57,030 --> 00:50:01,200
So another high impact journal Journal of Immunology.

357
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:07,950
So they're finding that in supplemental doses of vitamin D inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokines,

358
00:50:07,950 --> 00:50:11,880
production and T-cell recruitment to the islets of the pancreas.

359
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:19,000
And I believe these studies were done in the non-obese, non-obese diabetic mouse.

360
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:25,770
So in those mice, they have a tendency to develop type one diabetes.

361
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:35,670
And in this particular paper, they were able to delay the onset of diabetes, type one diabetes, by giving them supplemental doses of vitamin D.

362
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:43,350
Studies in humans, longitudinal studies using the same strategy have not been shown to be effective.

363
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:48,260
Okay. Now, let's.

364
00:50:48,780 --> 00:51:01,380
Let's take a step back here and and look at some historical events that have led to the idea that vitamin D is important in infectious diseases.

365
00:51:03,530 --> 00:51:14,570
So for centuries, a disease caused cancer that was called consumption because your body was consumed by the disease and you would waste away.

366
00:51:16,290 --> 00:51:20,840
What took a heavy toll on people's lives?

367
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:27,169
So particularly in parts of the country that were above this 37th parallel,

368
00:51:27,170 --> 00:51:33,560
but you could get TB if you lived anywhere that it's more common in areas where they received plenty of sunlight.

369
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:43,520
So in the 19th century in New England, the disease was kind of romanticized for some reason.

370
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:55,280
So when somebody had consumption or tuberculosis, the modern way we refer to this now, they developed a flushing of the cheeks.

371
00:51:55,760 --> 00:52:03,560
Their eyes were still bright. They lost their appetite and they coughed all the time.

372
00:52:03,590 --> 00:52:11,420
And they would cough up white phlegm and literally pieces of their lung and often blood associated with that.

373
00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:18,380
And if you had this disease, you knew you're going to die from it.

374
00:52:18,590 --> 00:52:26,990
So there was this resignation associated with this, that your death was unavoidable and it was dreaded.

375
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:34,790
And then at the same time, it was romanticized, and the victim slowly and gracefully faded away,

376
00:52:34,790 --> 00:52:43,010
transcending their corporal body, their immortal soul shining through because of this appearance of their bright eyes.

377
00:52:44,270 --> 00:52:51,500
And famous people died of tuberculosis in this particular time period.

378
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:56,810
Henry Thoreau died of tuberculosis at the age of 44.

379
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:04,370
The guy who wrote on lots of books in this transcendent,

380
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:12,020
transcendent transcendentalism movement on Walden Pond, he died of tuberculosis at the age of 44.

381
00:53:15,830 --> 00:53:21,930
So in reality, so tuberculosis was called consumption in the 19th century.

382
00:53:21,950 --> 00:53:26,420
It killed an awful lot of people in New England, particularly in the Boston area.

383
00:53:26,750 --> 00:53:34,100
So people are crowded together and it disproportionately affected the poor more often than the wealthy.

384
00:53:34,490 --> 00:53:41,210
Women more often than men. But people of all ages and anybody could fall victim to the disease.

385
00:53:43,070 --> 00:53:47,660
But it was more prevalent among young adults, and it cut their lives short.

386
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:51,980
People in the prime of their lives often died of tuberculosis.

387
00:53:54,810 --> 00:54:05,940
So why do you think that it was prominent in the city and in particularly the Boston area?

388
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:10,380
Why do you think it was more common than better than other parts of the world?

389
00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:22,660
And why the poor? Why were they disproportionately affected? This has to do with the environment.

390
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:27,170
Yeah. I mean, it wasn't just the congested city.

391
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:33,310
I feel that very close to people. Yeah. Yeah. So you get more people per household and people are living close together.

392
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:40,780
So with the infectious disease, there's greater risk of transmissibility, especially with a respiratory pathogen.

393
00:54:41,410 --> 00:54:44,970
Okay. So.

394
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:55,930
The connection between consumption being caused by an infectious disease was not an accepted theory.

395
00:54:56,380 --> 00:55:00,910
Right. This was crazy. Talk to people of this time.

396
00:55:01,570 --> 00:55:09,580
So the zeitgeist, we talked about the zeitgeist before that guys dictated that this time that it was bad living conditions.

397
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:13,840
It was the foul air that caused tuberculosis, their consumption.

398
00:55:14,890 --> 00:55:20,350
That was the that was the thinking back then. And it wasn't until this guy came along.

399
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:24,880
Anton Delamar I think the how do you pronounce his name?

400
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:29,770
He was a physician with the French army.

401
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:37,120
And as you can imagine, soldiers were housed and grouped together in high densities.

402
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:41,140
And tuberculosis was very common.

403
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:47,560
So you saw a lot of soldiers succumbing to tuberculosis during this time in particular.

404
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:55,630
And he is the one who figured out that consumption didn't contain tuberculosis,

405
00:55:55,840 --> 00:56:01,510
started to call it a little bit later, were caused by an infectious, contagious infectious disease.

406
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:11,650
All right. So he did some experiments with people who were or and he looked at rabbits in particular.

407
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:20,980
And he he proved that one rabbit that had tuberculosis could infect another rabbit living in close proximity.

408
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:29,800
Right. But his findings were largely ignored by the medical community.

409
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:44,410
And this idea that tuberculosis or consumption was caused by the foul air fouled living conditions continued to be that the dominant theory.

410
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:51,370
And it wasn't to Robert cock came along in 1882 and he is the one who actually

411
00:56:51,370 --> 00:56:57,820
isolated the infective the agent that caused tuberculosis mycobacterium tuberculosis.

412
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:06,100
He also demonstrated that other diseases like anthrax were caused by bacteria.

413
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:10,540
So this was in 1882.

414
00:57:10,750 --> 00:57:19,780
And at this particular time it was accepted that this disease was caused by bacteria and it was a contagious disease.

415
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:26,620
So you had to isolate people who had tuberculosis to prevent that from infecting other people.

416
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:38,080
So after 1882, before the use of antimicrobial agents, the way to deal with this was prevention.

417
00:57:39,130 --> 00:57:46,000
So public health efforts were focused on preventing people who had TB and infecting other people.

418
00:57:47,110 --> 00:57:52,270
And a way to do this is to stop people from spitting on the sidewalk.

419
00:57:54,130 --> 00:58:00,070
Everybody spat in the sidewalk. People still do it today. But in those days, if you chew tobacco, you were spitting all the time.

420
00:58:00,490 --> 00:58:05,260
All right. A lot of people chew tobacco. A lot of people spat in the sidewalk for various reasons.

421
00:58:06,070 --> 00:58:13,240
One of the public health efforts to stop TB was to get people to stop spitting and eliminating spittoons,

422
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:19,120
perhaps in restaurants and bars and hotel rooms and so on, in hotel lobbies and so on.

423
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:31,869
And then you would also have when I've seen posters like this and it named the infected agent of tuberculosis,

424
00:58:31,870 --> 00:58:40,690
and this is a baby with a with a don't kiss me on its bib because this is a way to infect a child with tuberculosis.

425
00:58:41,350 --> 00:58:48,040
So this kind of thing was advertised to prevent the spread of this type of disease.

426
00:58:48,850 --> 00:58:57,310
And then you had the the origins of the American Lung Association and Prevention of Tuberculosis.

427
00:58:57,910 --> 00:59:06,549
So you would buy what were known as Christmas SEALs that would provide money to what was the American

428
00:59:06,550 --> 00:59:13,630
Lung Association so that they can promote these practices to prevent tuberculosis from spreading.

429
00:59:13,930 --> 00:59:21,040
So you would take that Christmas seal and you would put it on a Christmas present as a way to promote public health efforts.

430
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:30,280
And here's a man pushing the door, preventing from tuberculosis, from coming into the house and infecting the women here who are hiding behind it.

431
00:59:30,670 --> 00:59:41,650
Okay. So that's how tuberculosis was dealt with to prevent it from happening that to begin with by not spitting,

432
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:46,270
not kissing babies and not letting it in your house.

433
00:59:49,630 --> 01:00:01,540
So some of the ideas that we have in terms of preventing tuberculosis and treating it came from this guy name Edward Livingston.

434
01:00:01,540 --> 01:00:04,810
Trudeau and there's a picture of him right here.

435
01:00:05,470 --> 01:00:13,180
He was a physician in New York City, and he decided to become a physician because his brother died of tuberculosis.

436
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:20,230
And at this time, they knew that tuberculosis was an infectious disease.

437
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:26,290
They knew that it was caused by bacteria, but they had no idea how to treat it.

438
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:38,920
So while this guy was practicing medicine in New York City, he acquired tuberculosis and he came down with the disease.

439
01:00:41,740 --> 01:00:54,820
Excuse me. And he decided he was going to live the rest of his life in upstate New York, in the Adirondacks.

440
01:00:56,170 --> 01:01:02,530
This is a remote region of New York state that is beautiful and mountainous and secluded.

441
01:01:03,430 --> 01:01:06,010
And people spent an awful lot of time outdoors.

442
01:01:06,730 --> 01:01:15,400
And he went to his little red cottage in upstate New York, and he decided that's where he was going to spend the rest of his life.

443
01:01:15,430 --> 01:01:18,670
So this is a young man in his twenties or thirties when this happened.

444
01:01:20,230 --> 01:01:30,850
But instead of dying, he got healthier. He he focused on two things improving his diet and exercise and being outside.

445
01:01:32,050 --> 01:01:38,140
And lo and behold, he recovered. He became well and didn't die.

446
01:01:38,770 --> 01:01:48,790
And based on this experience, he was the guy who started this sanatorium movement where you would take people who had tuberculosis

447
01:01:49,450 --> 01:01:54,999
and you would remove them and bring them to areas of the country that were kind of isolated.

448
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:59,230
So you couldn't infect other people, but you would expose people to sunlight.

449
01:01:59,890 --> 01:02:05,410
And then as they started to feel better, you know, you would provide them with good nutrition.

450
01:02:05,710 --> 01:02:11,070
And what they called good nutrition back in those days was giving them milk four times a day.

451
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:14,920
And this is before milk was supplemented with vitamin D. Okay.

452
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:17,200
So these are some of the practices that are going on at time.

453
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:26,620
And here's a bunch of people who have tuberculosis and who've gone to a sanatorium and they're outside and they're being exposed to sunlight.

454
01:02:27,220 --> 01:02:30,730
All right. All times of the year, whether it was summer or winter,

455
01:02:30,730 --> 01:02:37,690
they were going to go outside and have this exposure to sunlight in this in this particular place.

456
01:02:39,580 --> 01:02:43,060
So the sanatorium in Saranac Lake, actually in New York,

457
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:52,300
developed into this big complex of 22 separate buildings or dormitories, and they had free medical care.

458
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:58,930
And people who couldn't afford housing were charged a very low rate for their rent

459
01:02:59,290 --> 01:03:03,250
so that they could go and recover from diverting losses in this particular place.

460
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:10,690
And a lot of people recovered and this practice was copied all over the country.

461
01:03:11,890 --> 01:03:20,890
In fact, just about every state had a tuberculosis sanatorium, including Michigan and more than one of them.

462
01:03:21,220 --> 01:03:34,650
And there is a place that is now a park in Northville, Michigan, that was once a TB sanatorium, and I can't remember the name of the park.

463
01:03:34,660 --> 01:03:42,410
It's a place where a lot of people go to go mountain biking. I can't remember the name of that park anyhow.

464
01:03:44,010 --> 01:03:50,040
Everybody. Every state replicated this model too, because there were lots of people who had tuberculosis.

465
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:58,079
All right. So what's tuberculosis? It's caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

466
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:02,520
Is it the bacteria? It infects the lungs.

467
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:11,760
And you have two different forms. You have a latent form of infection, an active disease or the active tuberculosis.

468
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:19,930
Can other can also affect other organs and tissues the skin, the kidneys, the spine and your brain as well.

469
01:04:22,330 --> 01:04:31,210
And the way you acquire a tuberculosis infection is you are in close proximity to somebody who has the disease.

470
01:04:31,570 --> 01:04:33,760
Just like any respiratory tract infection.

471
01:04:34,030 --> 01:04:44,290
You inhale the lipid, the liquid droplets that they exhale, and you acquire the infection, or they're coughing or even talking or singing.

472
01:04:44,530 --> 01:04:55,540
People got together and watched a course or were actively engaged in saying this is another way to get respiratory tract infection like TB.

473
01:04:57,470 --> 01:05:02,750
So you think about this in terms of, oh, that's the olden times disease.

474
01:05:03,140 --> 01:05:07,070
We don't have to worry about tuberculosis anymore. Well, that's not the truth at all.

475
01:05:08,060 --> 01:05:14,550
So this is a map of the world from a publication in 2016.

476
01:05:14,570 --> 01:05:18,600
Tuberculosis looking at the global incidence of active TB.

477
01:05:18,620 --> 01:05:27,949
This is pulmonary next to pulmonary. The darker the green and darker gray colors correspond to the higher prevalence or incidence.

478
01:05:27,950 --> 01:05:36,140
Actually since this incident active TB North America very low 0 to 9.9 cases per 100,000.

479
01:05:36,530 --> 01:05:43,370
But in other countries it's much, much higher, particularly in Africa, sub-Saharan Africa,

480
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:57,370
the in South Africa, in Burma, in Indonesia, we have much higher incidence of tuberculosis.

481
01:05:57,380 --> 01:06:04,160
North Korea is another hotspot. And these darker green areas, you have a higher incidence as well.

482
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:11,660
So it's a modern disease as well. Here are some key facts about tuberculosis.

483
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:19,100
It's the 13th leading cause of death worldwide. And this is from the most recent data that I could find.

484
01:06:19,430 --> 01:06:21,990
And the World Health Organization website.

485
01:06:23,940 --> 01:06:37,160
It's 10 million people fell ill from tuberculosis and about 25% of the world's population has a TB infection and they don't know it.

486
01:06:37,340 --> 01:06:45,079
So this is an estimate. One and a half million people die of tuberculosis every year.

487
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:55,740
It's preventable. It's treatable with antibiotics, people who most often die from tuberculosis or those who are immune compromised.

488
01:06:55,760 --> 01:07:04,850
So people who all have HIV, this is the leading cause of death for people who have HIV to over 200,000 deaths per year.

489
01:07:07,930 --> 01:07:12,490
95% of the TV TB deaths occur in low and middle income nations.

490
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:20,020
And it if it has, it disproportionately affects people by race and ethnicity.

491
01:07:22,540 --> 01:07:32,350
And in terms of where you might find these, there are 64% of all TB cases can be found in these eight different countries Bangladesh,

492
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:38,230
India, Indonesia, China, the Philippines, Pakistan, Nigeria, South Africa.

493
01:07:38,590 --> 01:07:43,720
And then you saw some other countries that were disproportionately affected by TB as well.

494
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:54,100
1.1 million children become ill with TB every year and about a quarter of a million die each year from TB.

495
01:07:55,120 --> 01:08:01,540
And as I said, you can prevent TB and you can treat it with antibiotics.

496
01:08:02,170 --> 01:08:11,410
But because of the problem of people not taking their medication, all of it, they develop resistant strains.

497
01:08:13,030 --> 01:08:24,370
And it there are about 600,000 new cases of resistance to the first line treatment.

498
01:08:25,420 --> 01:08:33,370
Your samples for rifampicin, which is the drug that she used to treat tuberculosis.

499
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:37,060
It's now ineffective in these individuals,

500
01:08:38,410 --> 01:08:46,810
and it's because they either have a drug resistant strain or they haven't taken the entire course of the drug after they've been infected.

501
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:56,770
And through the World Health Organization, through TB for prevention methods.

502
01:08:57,580 --> 01:09:07,330
It's been estimated that between 2020 20, 60 million, 66 million lives have been saved through diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis.

503
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:19,030
So who's at risk? It mostly affects adults in the productive years of people who are active at all.

504
01:09:19,030 --> 01:09:25,000
Age groups are at risk. 95% of the cases and deaths are in developing countries.

505
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:30,370
People who are HIV infected are 18 times more at risk.

506
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:38,080
And then you have a greater risk of having a TB infection if you're immune suppressed.

507
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:46,750
So you find that people who experience undernutrition or malnutrition are more susceptible to the miraculous.

508
01:09:47,830 --> 01:09:53,680
And, you know, 1.9 million new cases of TB can be attributed to malnutrition.

509
01:09:54,610 --> 01:10:00,580
And then there are other diseases like alcoholism or now referred to as alcohol use disorder.

510
01:10:02,650 --> 01:10:06,820
So these are estimated new cases, three quarters of a million new cases.

511
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:11,670
Tobacco smoking, about three quarters of a million new cases.

512
01:10:11,670 --> 01:10:20,290
That is attributed to tobacco smoke. And then people who have diabetes are at a greater risk for tuberculosis as well.

513
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:26,950
So there's a spectrum of tuberculosis.

514
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:33,010
There's you can anybody can get exposed to tuberculosis.

515
01:10:33,430 --> 01:10:40,510
And if your immune system is healthy, you can clear it. Diagnosing tuberculosis is challenging.

516
01:10:41,830 --> 01:10:45,580
And there have been other methods that have been used to diagnose it.

517
01:10:45,580 --> 01:10:48,790
None of them are 100% effective.

518
01:10:49,630 --> 01:10:57,060
So you have here a tuberculin skin test and then you have that interferon gamma really fascinating.

519
01:10:57,790 --> 01:11:06,700
And then you have culture where they take a sample of the secretion of tissue, of blood.

520
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:12,970
Now they can have you cough up sputum and they can look for the organism in that.

521
01:11:13,990 --> 01:11:19,690
And so these are four different methods that are used to diagnose tuberculosis.

522
01:11:20,380 --> 01:11:25,930
And there's also a chest X-ray that's used to identify a granuloma, which is shown here.

523
01:11:26,620 --> 01:11:29,890
And I'll explain exactly what's in that granuloma here in a minute.

524
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:37,990
So here's the infection is eliminated with innate immune response.

525
01:11:38,470 --> 01:11:44,410
So all of these things will be negative with acquired immune response where you've

526
01:11:44,410 --> 01:11:48,970
gotten the infection and it's taken you a bit longer to clear the infection.

527
01:11:49,540 --> 01:11:57,460
And in that case, you might have a positive test for the the skin test and the interferon gamma react release assay.

528
01:11:57,820 --> 01:12:02,380
But you'll have none of these tests being indicative of an infection.

529
01:12:04,060 --> 01:12:11,860
And then you have people who have what's known as latent TB, where that infection has been walled off within a tissue.

530
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:15,160
In this case, in your lungs, it's there.

531
01:12:15,370 --> 01:12:25,359
And you may or may not be positive, but you don't have an illness that the infection is causing you any harm.

532
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:35,020
At this particular statement, it's in the latent phase. So you might have positive skin test and a positive and test and you might even show up.

533
01:12:35,830 --> 01:12:44,230
Had a granulomas in a chest x ray. That's why when you have a tuberculin skin test, the next thing and it's positive,

534
01:12:44,770 --> 01:12:48,670
the next thing that they do is they send you off to get a chest x ray to look for these.

535
01:12:49,870 --> 01:12:57,700
Okay, so here's subclinical and accurate TB and here's the colors here are getting more red.

536
01:12:57,790 --> 01:13:01,149
So you have a positive skin test intermittently.

537
01:13:01,150 --> 01:13:07,750
Positive cultures sporadically are usually negative in terms of the smear and some mild symptoms.

538
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:13,300
And then they can start you on treatment here when you start to develop symptoms.

539
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:15,580
And then in terms of active TB,

540
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:24,040
all of these things are positive now and you're going to be on perhaps a multi-drug therapy now to treat this condition.

541
01:13:27,860 --> 01:13:36,500
Most people are cured of tuberculosis, but people who have that drug resistant strain that the drug treatment might be infected.

542
01:13:36,860 --> 01:13:47,900
So how does this happen? Well, here's the here's the progression here from being infected and clearing it to developing these granulomas.

543
01:13:48,950 --> 01:13:53,780
So you've had all these things through exposure of droplets in the air.

544
01:13:54,500 --> 01:14:02,209
You have immune cells now within the alveolar and lung that take up these bacteria and they drain and

545
01:14:02,210 --> 01:14:13,550
to assist lymph nodes and your immune system kind of walls off these organisms into this granuloma.

546
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:25,370
And it's essentially a concentration of immune cells within the parenchyma of the lungs that contains all kinds of immune cells,

547
01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:28,790
macrophages negative cells and T cells and B cells.

548
01:14:29,540 --> 01:14:33,770
And it's a way of sealing off the infection from the rest of your body.

549
01:14:34,910 --> 01:14:38,290
And in this way, someone might not have any symptoms.

550
01:14:38,300 --> 01:14:46,160
They might show positive test, but they may not. Now, you can get many granulomas forming within your lungs,

551
01:14:46,490 --> 01:14:56,120
and it isn't until you have the lysis or I shouldn't say lysis that that the loss of

552
01:14:56,120 --> 01:15:01,340
contain within the granuloma that you start to develop the symptoms of the infection.

553
01:15:01,820 --> 01:15:03,110
And that's what's happening here.

554
01:15:05,330 --> 01:15:16,360
Gets into your blood is circulates in the rest of your body, and it can affect all the different lymph nodes within your lungs as a consequence.

555
01:15:19,020 --> 01:15:26,400
So how do you defend yourself against this? Well, one of the ways is through macrophages that become activated.

556
01:15:27,210 --> 01:15:34,530
And you have a number of intracellular signaling events that involve vitamin D.

557
01:15:35,610 --> 01:15:40,649
So here's tuberculosis getting into the phagosome and here's an activation of

558
01:15:40,650 --> 01:15:47,640
intracellular signaling events that lead to an upregulation of the vitamin D receptor,

559
01:15:48,360 --> 01:16:01,470
that lead to an increase in antimicrobial peptides that contribute to killing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in these cells.

560
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:09,930
Okay, so it's the toll like receptor that becomes activated and recognizes TB.

561
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:17,730
And this is what initiates the events that lead to host defense mechanisms.

562
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:24,510
And the activation of these toll receptors ultimately results in these antimicrobial peptides,

563
01:16:24,990 --> 01:16:33,690
not other things like Dr. Dioxide being produced that kill the bacteria within the artifact of the lysosome.

564
01:16:35,580 --> 01:16:41,070
All right. So the next time we meet, we're going to be talking about this paper after the break.

565
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:46,320
This is an old paper, 2006, but it's a classic paper.

566
01:16:47,070 --> 01:16:55,110
It looks at vitamin D and antimicrobial host defense against tuberculosis.

567
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:58,559
And it's a relatively short paper,

568
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:09,570
but it was one of the first papers to clearly demonstrate the importance of vitamin D and host events against tuberculosis.

569
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:14,640
Okay. All right. I will see you next time.

570
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:20,250
Uh, not next. Yeah, be next Thursday.

571
01:17:20,250 --> 01:17:25,229
Next Thursday, right after the break. Okay, everybody get through the quiz.

572
01:17:25,230 --> 01:17:29,310
Are most of you? Did you get it already? Okay. All right.

573
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:32,970
That's good. That's great. Thank you.

574
01:17:33,450 --> 01:17:33,930
Welcome.
