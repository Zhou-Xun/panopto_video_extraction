1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:13,560
Actually, I don't know. I know it's not an easy thing.

2
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:27,030
Like, every time I try to lecture, I must say that I think she was very hurt.

3
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:34,600
So that's all I got to. Oh, is it?

4
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:41,030
I know. I was saying. Yeah, I thought she was there.

5
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:45,840
Like work, all that chatting Australia.

6
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,060
So I guess it's good to know who you are.

7
00:00:52,110 --> 00:01:00,970
Oh, yeah. I mean, I don't even know.

8
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:18,060
I don't think it matters where I was like I was, you know,

9
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:39,120
I know the actual interviews the going to do and I don't even know what side you should watch because I was like,

10
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:45,040
Oh, you mean, how did you get involved?

11
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:51,570
I have no such thing.

12
00:01:51,590 --> 00:02:01,760
Like, I mean, I think I got it.

13
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:39,150
Yeah. I mean, it's like, what do you do you think about, you know, like you guys, like, I mean, I just don't appreciate how much you feel.

14
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:48,930
Like 70 bucks. Yeah. Yeah, that's reporting in progress.

15
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:54,690
Yeah. Yeah.

16
00:02:55,290 --> 00:03:01,980
And I would change the name for that. Something else to work on it together.

17
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:20,280
Like, I like to have, like, signs and clubs and you know, we have like, Angela Lansbury.

18
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:30,809
Yeah, I remember those. Oh, I didn't know she would send her.

19
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:45,710
Oh, my gosh. I mean, seem like they were all mine and I can't seem to remember I had to go see them, right.

20
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:51,630
Yeah. No, I had it in person to first semester last year for the second semester. Oh yeah.

21
00:03:53,530 --> 00:04:03,330
Yeah. Well she was one of those two guys.

22
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:10,430
I don't know.

23
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:16,560
I don't I saw the like the last one.

24
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:22,120
I was like, okay, yeah. Right. Now, what about fall shoot?

25
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:33,480
Okay. Morning, everybody. And then we're going to continue our conversation on I'm serious analysis.

26
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:43,500
And if you remember, we have been talking about stationery, pens, you know, and let me refresh your memory.

27
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:54,480
What we have been talking about stationery, consumerism and now the new ponytail I love.

28
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:10,890
So what we want to know, we spend a little more.

29
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:21,370
We've been saying that that in order to forecast TIME series,

30
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:30,850
what we want to do in this class and leads is to learn doctrines from the parts of the Time series and extrapolate those patterns into the future.

31
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:35,530
And we have created intensities into groups.

32
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:45,820
One is a stationary time series where the mean is constant, relatively constant, standard deviation is relatively constant and known.

33
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:52,389
Stationary time series does seem to have friends or be annoyed that the standard

34
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:58,660
deviation is only the variability is is not constant is waiting for regions.

35
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:12,190
Finally now in in essence really we are going to focus on having driven or not to be finding stationary stationary things in this five.

36
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:20,410
So what you do when you have A and B, the first thing you do is block the time series.

37
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:26,750
Right? And you decide whether he's stationary or not.

38
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:42,170
If you decide that it is stationary, they say, okay, I think I can see a 33 horizontal line going across the time series is from wages up and down.

39
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:52,250
And I of really I'm going to call this stationary I don't think thing why did I start that imitation is pretty much false here.

40
00:06:53,390 --> 00:07:04,970
So I'm going to declare that series stationary and then I am going to form cos I'm asking you is using two types of techniques.

41
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:14,390
They are basically movie maverick is what we're going to do and what we're gonna try to do is take a chunk

42
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:21,950
of observations and average the observation in order to get rid of the noise and then forecast the future.

43
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:35,090
But as we discussed this in class, we are going to classify these types of movie mavericks into two main ones.

44
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:54,710
One is going to be the weighted moving averages moving up, and the weighted moving average of four is in order to forecast the universe.

45
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:01,160
They say that you want to forecast plus one.

46
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:10,879
Do you think the weighted average of several observations of the pattern in the past so you're going

47
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:29,090
to go w one times observation of IP laws w two times of the observation time t minus one was done,

48
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:33,920
done, done as many observations in the past as you decide is necessary.

49
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:40,100
And then you fix those weights depending on the time series something is were huge.

50
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:47,180
So that's one that's one way that we get start, you know, forecasting a stationary time series.

51
00:08:47,180 --> 00:09:03,200
So I recommend that when you start these beside the weighted average peak to either four or five periods for P for PD of the weighted moving

52
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:11,750
average or five good weighted moving up for a five period weighted moving average is going to be very cumbersome if you don't have a sail.

53
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,260
Right.

54
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:22,790
But with that, if you have a long enough series and you think that that that will help you come this time of four or five, you got to see how it goes.

55
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,740
So let's say that eventually we start to start.

56
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:39,130
We've seen four or five.

57
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:43,850
If you wait, it won't be hours.

58
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:49,750
And then what is that you're going to do? You are going to optimize that way.

59
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:58,660
So remember that we have to make sure to figure out whether those workouts we're actually accurate or not.

60
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:04,020
One is that means wherever and we have been using a lot here.

61
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:10,630
The other one, we haven't used that much and it's just for your reference is called the mean absolutely deviation,

62
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:18,429
which instead of taking the square of the inverse of often if we're cast an

63
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:23,620
average then we just think the absolute value of the average and average them.

64
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:37,000
So they mean wherever here would say that I'm I'm forecasting this ten series and this is a forecasting time series.

65
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,980
I would say, okay, I want to forecast and these the next one is going to be here.

66
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:50,350
That's my forecast. But then I capture the observation and the real observation columns here.

67
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:59,140
So that's right. And then I do the same thing for even the ones in the past, like our radius here.

68
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:05,530
And so we occur here.

69
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:10,120
They correspond to observation. I.

70
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:19,600
T i. So what I'm going to do in order to get the total measure of either name and compute the means,

71
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:27,520
whatever would be in me now sort of deviation, that means we're always going to be.

72
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:45,730
With some of the observations on time he didn't want us and he.

73
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:58,300
Right. And that's going to be from t you want to you know from be equal to what whatever observation you have for Costello right.

74
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:09,850
Let's say he won three one depending on what is the first four guys that you have or two whatever.

75
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:19,490
Right. And then you square all these errors and then you divide by in which is the ends.

76
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:28,020
And then this is being a number of observation for which you have broadcast us in here.

77
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:31,860
Right. So this is your means. Where? Here.

78
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:53,230
There is another one that we haven't used much, which is the mean arsenal deviation.

79
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:06,929
The meeting? Absolutely. The engagement is simply the same theme, the same summation of the issues,

80
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:15,920
1 to 1 or whatever deliveries that you have before forecast cash and then instead of the square of their

81
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:26,880
erm we take the absolute value of their observation of the most important city and they divide it.

82
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:30,330
The total number of observations for which we have forecast we present.

83
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:40,190
So the average in. Absolutely.

84
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:45,660
We. All right.

85
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:49,750
So what do we do with this particularly?

86
00:13:49,750 --> 00:14:00,160
We've been using these one compute that means we're at or for a day you're five or four people will weed out

87
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:09,970
averages you sober and optimize their weight you minimize the means what they and then you get the best weights.

88
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:32,190
And it's going to be w1aw2, two, three, four, five, five.

89
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:39,440
And then that's the meeting when you want to what what you have done is minimize the image.

90
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:43,920
See just this way.

91
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:50,520
So suppose for example, that remember that it was most out of line.

92
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:56,460
I suppose for example line you get the weights like this is.

93
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:14,580
In the space here. Let's say that nobody who would be one is equal 2.7 W two is equal to 2.2 and nobody with three.

94
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:26,850
Is it. 12.00.9.

95
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:33,900
Now let's say. .07.

96
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:43,460
Right. And then w four easy 12103.

97
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,710
Right. And so things are two one.

98
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:51,030
And then you say, okay, this is my period moving average.

99
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:56,580
But, but you look at their weights and you say, well, this is almost going nothing, right?

100
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:04,560
Because it's very small. So should I keep the .03 or should I re optimize my weight?

101
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:08,070
You're using a3b and moving averages over to you.

102
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:17,790
But you what you want to do is having a less cold or some model for that because you are going to be using

103
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:23,310
fewer observations in order to take the average in forecast the future when you use calibrate model.

104
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:32,280
So in cases where there is a very minuscule weight at the end, I would recommend that you say,

105
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:36,340
okay, let me get rid of those weights and then let me start now.

106
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:40,770
Then I would repeat your movie. Now, weight day, weight turbulence stayed pretty much the same.

107
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:44,640
This is going to be just to leave it with nothing.

108
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:57,420
And there is no heart rule and all of that is you have to be because your forecasts are going to need to win them over.

109
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:02,190
You know that you need for 1% or 2%.

110
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:11,540
It's not going to make any difference. So in this case, you can decide and say, hey, I want my form.

111
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:17,460
You know, I weights or I want to get better.

112
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:24,030
I would say in a more parsimonious model with your free weights.

113
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:31,139
And then for guys with that, know that in practice this is what you evaluate in practices in that exam.

114
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:37,830
I will tell you exactly what to do, so don't worry about it. So I'm going to say it's going to be involved in how we do.

115
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:52,630
Or you think it will be not wrong to choose between the two based on them and see if and you won't have any in any ambiguity you the past is okay.

116
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:55,919
So you do your weighted moving average.

117
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:07,200
Then what is that your generic thing you're going to do is that you are going to show it's moving to the same time series and one initial smoothing.

118
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:30,990
Okay. And it's potential it's moving if you remember that they forecast at time he lost one is equal to alpha.

119
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:41,670
That was the observation at 90 Romans why Microsoft's five times the workforce

120
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:49,890
of 90 and and so therefore Cassa time the estate is what you forecasted for

121
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:58,379
video dad he was saying say well you know last you know last period I forecast

122
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:04,830
for these you know I was in they say that imperial ten and imperial ten.

123
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:09,600
I forecast three things in for.

124
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:21,600
Either. Immediate ten.

125
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:39,060
Thank you for that. 411 And let's say that for video 11 you forecasted three things right here and that says three things.

126
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:44,530
Ten might be running out of ten. Yeah.

127
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:55,980
And then. And then I get an observation.

128
00:19:55,980 --> 00:20:00,420
Seven for the cash. And they might learn cash here.

129
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:11,730
I would like to look at the three. And then suppose that I just wait over the period 11 and I get three.

130
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:21,360
That's my observation. So I made a mistake because things even I need to remember now what I'm going to do is I am going to

131
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:29,790
produce that work for Video 12 and I'm going to work out so well using these two numbers 30 and the 36.

132
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:38,970
And I'm going to apply a weight to the most recent observation, which is this is 30 and that weight is going to be 12 alpha.

133
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:45,800
And if you say it is a weight problem for anyone, let's say that my alpha I'm correcting.

134
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:54,210
I am I'm giving the most recent observation a weight of point said if the alpha is equal in points and.

135
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:04,120
So if I see that, I'm going to say, okay, what is my forecast for Haiti?

136
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:08,290
Well, I'm always going to be three times between seven.

137
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:21,820
Laws. One might not solve how we could actually the Times Day forecast would be 33 times why Microsoft had weakest point three.

138
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:44,180
So that's going to be 2.1 I'm sorry, 21 and this is 83, 99, 108.

139
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:48,140
Right. So is it 10.83?

140
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:58,360
And then this is 31.80.

141
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:14,800
So now my forecast for period 12 is going to be 31 and 31.8.

142
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:19,770
Yeah, I mean, this is close to the installation line and then I keep doing that.

143
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:26,109
I keep moving on. So I do the same thing with my series.

144
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:36,999
So I wait. I use the weighted moving average and I use exponential smoothing because I can I cannot find a good comparison

145
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,979
between the weighted moving average and the exponential moving because there's potential is moving.

146
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:47,470
The weights change all the time and this is a definite pattern.

147
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:51,240
So the weights in the weight of moving average can be dozen.

148
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:57,670
They don't have to be ordered, so you don't have to have the highest weight, you know.

149
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:04,660
And they pointed to the most recent observation. But in any potential movement, you do have the highest,

150
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:12,520
the largest we applied to the most recent observations of the order are declining below the weights in an exponential fashion.

151
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:16,120
So that's why there is very specific structure.

152
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,830
And so we apply both.

153
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:35,180
And then you take a look at what is the MSE with the you'll figure it will be an average your your weight think moving average averages.

154
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:39,880
What is the MSE with the exponential smoothing.

155
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:52,880
And and then you pick the one with the smallest missing.

156
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:56,230
And that's how you use to forecast. That is the MCU.

157
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:03,360
That's why it's a great the algorithm I'm going to name next week.

158
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:13,860
I'm going to upload it in forecasting on the same template where it's more of a template

159
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:18,900
because it's kind of a program that individual reason can scale for three days.

160
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:22,950
And I might go as I used to forecast for you.

161
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:33,710
I, I'm going to see they because this is theirs now I want to see and they allow me just do it either for you so you can see there a constant,

162
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:41,219
which is pretty much what we have to be looking at right now, send that.

163
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:50,550
And then it also contains of things for among station any time series but station any time series is pretty much the same thing.

164
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:52,760
So I'm going to give that for use for the company.

165
00:24:54,560 --> 00:25:07,670
How, how is is it was used I, I know it was used for several years because that's what the introduction and training did to forecasting for humans.

166
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:16,290
They even want a package that you could buy this year and give you a forecast because they wanted to understand the

167
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:24,930
process and be able to go to each hospital and talk to the managers of insurance and say Why this is bad for you,

168
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:27,330
this is how what we are doing,

169
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:36,690
etc. So they had those build some confidence and tried it instead of just a black box and say This is what you're looking for.

170
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:48,479
And so that helped. A lot can be spent thinking four years, getting information,

171
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:58,470
comparing information when what they were forecasting versus what they were observing and also being how they made sure of that.

172
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,190
Or if you they optimized the way they held the whole nine year.

173
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:28,090
Right. And they were able to demonstrate that most cases for the peace process perform what you see them and that's okay so I that.

174
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:40,250
Okay so next so you know what we are doing with stationary and time series.

175
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:48,510
So today we are going to start talking about non stationary time series and those non stationary time series activities with.

176
00:26:48,920 --> 00:27:01,860
And so the train company going outward all day, we initiate non stationary time series,

177
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:13,740
our time series in which they have every time you think of something like that.

178
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:27,260
If you isolate any tea, these cannot be thought of as a random variable that is identically listed in the

179
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:35,240
order of P through the order of variables are different in stationary time series.

180
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:43,159
At any point t i you come to think about the observation being a random

181
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:50,600
variable that is identically distributed to all the variables in the next week.

182
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:55,219
If you want a very loose parent, they might not be independent,

183
00:27:55,220 --> 00:28:05,690
but they are identical twins that mean they have the same mean then the same second bombing and the whole nine yards in non stationary time series.

184
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:08,749
You cannot say the same thing, right? So this is a trend.

185
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:12,920
This in you sense that the variability change will vary.

186
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:17,570
You cannot claim identical distribution.

187
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:29,359
And so what we are going to do is use techniques that will look at the most basic fact of those time series,

188
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:40,220
which is I am trying to take the trend out and deal with the rest like we did with the know stationary time series.

189
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:52,610
All right. So let me. Let me, you know, go back to the exponential modeling.

190
00:28:53,150 --> 00:29:04,639
And so you can see, you know, what it is that we're doing with exponential moving and see how we can translate exponential is moving into in a more

191
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:12,200
complex is potential moving that we're going to use for for non stationary time series so for exponential moving.

192
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:22,990
We have. Therefore, we suppose that this is time and every time it is.

193
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:26,590
And then we have made a forecast for not time.

194
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:38,340
And this is my forecast. And then I collect the real observation in time and I see that I have an error.

195
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:51,310
Right? And then I'm going to now say and these are the that we use over that we always cure some of this then.

196
00:29:51,320 --> 00:30:03,580
But this is up. We are we are at we are actually going to say, okay, I have a forecast here and I have an observation.

197
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:07,600
And this observation, of course, contains error terms, right?

198
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:13,270
So I'm thinking that this is coming from the stationary time series that is just flat.

199
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:25,270
And I'm trying to figure it out what I mean. But I am not going to be able to get that flat because there is some fluctuation so matter.

200
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:34,810
So I also know that these number are here, which is what I forecasted before containment or center of the forecast.

201
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:38,290
So I'm not going to believe that this is the truth.

202
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:45,580
I'm not going to believe that this is the mean that through me, because this thing or at least contains error.

203
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:51,310
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to filter those two values.

204
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:58,790
I'm going to combine them. I'm going to say, okay, this is what I thought the Time series were.

205
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:02,530
This is what I thought was going to be, which is the forecast.

206
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:05,830
This is what I am. It is.

207
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:16,480
And I want this to average. I'm going to get a weighted average between the two to figure out where is the best estimate for that time series.

208
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:31,660
And and then you do when you do it and you know how I didn't tell you that before I will simply obviate that that you know that fair.

209
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:37,660
But what you do is when you have these two observations, you say, okay,

210
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:46,240
I am going to call where I feel the time series is some place in the middle or some place in between the two.

211
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:53,800
I'm going to call that at the Base of the Time series, the base the at time peak.

212
00:31:54,490 --> 00:32:05,560
And that is going to be. Of time my observation at 20 floors, one minus alpha.

213
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:13,360
I'm still forecast on P.A. I this is what I'm going to do.

214
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:19,570
I'm going to think where I see the Time series and where I thought the currency was going to be.

215
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:26,829
And I'm going to feel 32 and I'm going to say, you know, I think that the real observation,

216
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:34,209
the mean of these time series is going to be I and then why is that?

217
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:38,440
And what is going to be my best for account spot on a stationary time series.

218
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:46,060
Then I'm just going to repeat that meaning I'm going to say, here is where you're going to be next time.

219
00:32:46,720 --> 00:33:03,100
And that's why we say that the forecast to lose one is seen one to alpha and observation and one minus alpha and the forecast.

220
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:06,370
And I and you simply,

221
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:12,069
you know ignore that that before but this is what we do with your field that those

222
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:17,830
two observations that will say okay it's not you know it's not ten is not 12,

223
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:22,090
it's 11. And then I'm going to forecast 11 for the next four.

224
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:31,270
The next stop is normal. Now, what would happen if I do the same thing?

225
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:36,999
But they see these trends. What do you think I do?

226
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,530
The field drawing. I do, the insight I get.

227
00:33:52,320 --> 00:34:03,780
And. It was permanent.

228
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:13,400
So, so. So Z is it is it is easier.

229
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:20,820
I have my forecast. I have my observation.

230
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:26,900
I just went with the field. So this is the forecast.

231
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:31,190
These is AT&T. This is the observation. AT&T.

232
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:37,490
And then I use Alpha to get my base gate and these numbers here.

233
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:47,560
You know, no one is messing with me.

234
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:21,990
And. Right.

235
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:28,260
So. So he is going to be.

236
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:43,900
Their dad is going to. I'm going to pull that in this time.

237
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:49,049
Right. And now I want to extrapolate into the future.

238
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:53,730
If this is a stationary time series, I hope you'll say the.

239
00:35:54,570 --> 00:36:02,010
You say, okay, whatever base is right now, that's going to be my forecast for the next period.

240
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:05,880
But if this is a trend, what would I do?

241
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:11,150
And you simply extrapolate the trend from that place.

242
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:15,960
Right. So I need to know where is this time series coming from?

243
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:23,219
Maybe the Time series is coming from here and say, Well, okay, now I feel good, this whole summation.

244
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:29,490
So the next observation, the next forecast, the 1 billion people, PLOS One.

245
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:37,830
Then forecast immediately plus one instead of going flat.

246
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:49,920
It is going to be in this direction. And then I'm going to forecast here and this is going to be my forecast opinion team +11.

247
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:58,270
And then once I have my forecast opinion people in plus one, I get my observation.

248
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:02,120
I am my observation is the phase here.

249
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:06,500
And then I apply the same thing I do. Okay.

250
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:11,270
Now I just think between these two and now, my base.

251
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:26,980
I might just between the two and now my bass is over here.

252
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:38,110
I, I need my bases over here. I'm going to walk past, depending on the terrain that I have over here and so on and so.

253
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:44,200
And that's the difference between having a stationary time series and non stationary time.

254
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:51,490
Now we are going to do exactly the same exponential smoothing that we did before.

255
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:59,350
But instead of repeating that dot, I just meant to forecast the future,

256
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:07,010
we are going to incorporate the trend of the Time series, so we are going to use two exponential as one.

257
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:18,450
Sometimes this is called the double exponential moving and imagine and general, we know these as they hold momentum they holds mental.

258
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:26,440
This is a double exponential smoothing because we are using an exponential moving to figure out where the time series is,

259
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:32,860
what that base is, that filter and another one to figure out where that trend is going.

260
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:40,720
Okay. So what is the tendency of the Time series to go up or down from one video to the next?

261
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:49,480
So I'm going to give you the. Equations for the double exponential moving.

262
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:56,380
And it's not. So you need to understand them so that you don't have to memorize them.

263
00:38:56,830 --> 00:39:02,620
And we all know how you can still do that, but you need to understand what it is that we are trying to do.

264
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:07,120
So I'm going to get the three basic forecasts.

265
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:12,990
Make them its own mechanism to work out using the holds.

266
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:18,130
Mental and mental is appropriate.

267
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:21,940
When we have theories, we have. Right.

268
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:36,630
So what? We are going to do something. But I'll be looking at the series over here.

269
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:43,230
We're going to try to approximate that. Obviously, we can figure out what it is and then catch you before it goes too far.

270
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:48,060
So this is going to be sort of a day for us.

271
00:39:51,010 --> 00:40:02,260
I feel he lost a kidney. So people don't want people to think that the sport is equal to the base.

272
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:11,720
Idiot he. Last time I.

273
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:46,450
I'm sorry. I guess it takes a long time to get the processor.

274
00:40:53,040 --> 00:41:03,340
All right. So let me go back here to this is equal to the base opinion he.

275
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:12,530
Many times they train at opportunity.

276
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:21,860
What I mean trend is the tendency of the time series to grow or to decline from one year to the next.

277
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:25,580
So these is something that we're going to find out.

278
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:30,980
That's the Base of the Time series that they feel that they're still observation and deferred counts.

279
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:37,240
And this is another element that we're going to find out.

280
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:46,370
And this is also where I feel very bad between the tendency that we see growing right now and

281
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:54,319
the tendency that we saw that we have seen in the past from sadly like an exponential smoothing,

282
00:41:54,320 --> 00:42:09,740
but exponential trends with, you know, a the number of that the number of of how much value the time series gains from one thing to the next.

283
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:13,540
That's it. Right. So this is the first equation.

284
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:21,650
The second equation is, you know, how to find the base, the base of the time series.

285
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:31,100
Is it fun to all of? Observation and times of the.

286
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:35,870
So one way to solve salsa.

287
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:44,140
I'm staying for guys, the network guys.

288
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:50,270
You know, we have already found that four come from the previous equation.

289
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:58,310
And finally, there's one thing that we don't know yet here, and that is the trend.

290
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:01,490
Right. So how do we get this trend? The trend?

291
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:06,870
A penalty is equal to.

292
00:43:07,350 --> 00:43:12,000
And then we are going to use another moving post and we have to use a weight

293
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:17,850
alpha to weigh the most reasonable summation versus observation of the past.

294
00:43:18,210 --> 00:43:22,190
Now we're going to use another weight, which is the data weight.

295
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:30,990
We know another number between zero and one that is going to weight the most recent pending to

296
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:40,410
grow the most recent growth versus the growth that we saw in the previous in the previous time.

297
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:48,710
So this is going to be better. Times.

298
00:43:51,150 --> 00:44:03,450
Then the growth that we observe in this period, which is the base time T minus the base IPD of T minus one.

299
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:17,940
Plus one minus bank that. It's time period, you might as well.

300
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:22,800
Those are the three equations of the field.

301
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:27,059
Of the holes men take, he said.

302
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:33,630
Double exponential smoothing. Because here you're using exponential moving to field three.

303
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:38,040
The observation was to filter pieces that weren't constant.

304
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:43,170
He said, My observation, I'm going on field, you know, the noise of calcium agents and the forecast.

305
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:51,090
And I combine them into one thing. That is my correction.

306
00:44:51,330 --> 00:44:59,910
If you're one of my oh my. And then I do the same thing with the trend and the trend is, okay,

307
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:08,850
what is the how many Hispanics I'm expecting that time series to grow on to next period?

308
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:16,139
Well, I'm going to perform a weighted average between this bench that I saw growing these period,

309
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:20,040
which is the difference between the base now and the year before.

310
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:32,640
Multiply times that way that I assigned to the most recent trend plus one minus bed that times the trend that I saw last time right exactly the same.

311
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:40,920
And now that I have that base of the trend, I simply forecast for the vineyard people of one people to proceed to perform.

312
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:48,660
The only thing that I need to do is if I am in your 20 and I want to forecasting at 25,

313
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:59,040
then I think that base and then I the trend for the year 26 and then the training game for the 2010 training game for the 28.

314
00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:06,610
So I will simply keep having the time until I get a new observation that allows me to compute.

315
00:46:06,610 --> 00:46:15,960
Then you go, okay, this is more cumbersome that, you know, talking about this is more cumbersome than what really is.

316
00:46:16,350 --> 00:46:20,160
So let's actually do an exercise.

317
00:46:20,170 --> 00:46:29,310
So we're going to start by, you know, solving our homework.

318
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:41,990
Homework number two. And this is going to be a problem, 11.9 and 11.9, they all their problems.

319
00:46:41,990 --> 00:46:49,370
We can do them in on Thursday, but 11.9 is a whole lot better.

320
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:56,750
And at the same time, a series that we've been using so far is small business, right.

321
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:10,620
So if you want to see what it says. He says use momentum to create a model that minimizes they may see for days.

322
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:14,460
I said we sold them to determine the ultimate values of that.

323
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:20,909
What are the optimal lines of their preferred line graph comparing the predictions from old methods

324
00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:26,540
versus the original data and what are the forecast for the next two years using the technique?

325
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:30,780
So let's actually go back to.

326
00:47:38,830 --> 00:47:42,220
They want to.

327
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:50,640
We have the kind of cities that we've seen for over one.

328
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:07,910
So now I am going to copy this data into a news you.

329
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:26,150
He told me that. And then I'm going, I'm told that problem.

330
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:46,250
1149. So what should a one way know on my mind that I'm going to do a double potential as a whole

331
00:48:47,570 --> 00:48:54,700
and then I am going to eat if I do that for one exponential moving for a simple explanation,

332
00:48:54,800 --> 00:49:08,060
moving expenses were stationary. Then I would be using multiple tools because now I have, you know, the trend and the and the level two to figure it.

333
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:14,260
So therefore, I'm going to be using two weights, one and another one my whole life.

334
00:49:14,270 --> 00:49:17,929
They are both weights are independent.

335
00:49:17,930 --> 00:49:21,680
They must be between zero and one. What they don't have quadruple one.

336
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:34,110
They are doing two different things right so that only one and they or that one is going to that and I'm going to create I'm going to make up.

337
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:41,120
So number one three for all of up and then point nine for Vega.

338
00:49:41,450 --> 00:50:01,680
I don't have to go out line. Let's see if if I if I can half name the cells appropriately so I'm going to see.

339
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:09,900
I already have Alpha from the Blue Eyes from another worksheet.

340
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:20,310
So how about if we leave that on here and then I'm going to delete them and see this for me?

341
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:29,190
You probably don't have anything because you send me a spreadsheet, but because I'm using the same one that I use for more.

342
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:35,980
Number one, I already have created for you in both names, so I'm going to ignore all of that.

343
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:47,360
And then I'm, of course, going to have a messy. And now I can simply name those sales.

344
00:50:47,390 --> 00:50:56,630
I'll probably name and see. So one way is going to be going into the name box and say, I'll find out here.

345
00:50:57,260 --> 00:51:06,350
I hear a name and see here. Another way would be just to highlight all these numbers and then go into them

346
00:51:06,350 --> 00:51:13,500
and then define they go through formula and then define name and then use that.

347
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:18,800
Sorry. So I know not defining create name from selection.

348
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:28,370
So I already selected these block. I want to create the name from selection and the labels are on the left column thinking, okay,

349
00:51:28,610 --> 00:51:33,800
so that means that these sales are going to be all of these sales is going to go,

350
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:39,240
that this sale is going to go and then see those labels on the left call.

351
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:49,770
All right. So now in order to perform the filter, they can double exponential smoothing.

352
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:53,899
I am going to keep track of several columns.

353
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:57,440
The first columns going to be the Base of the time series.

354
00:52:02,250 --> 00:52:15,040
This ain't going to be the train series or the end in Z of a time series to grow in one that for a one time period.

355
00:52:16,290 --> 00:52:36,710
And then I'm going to forecast that 19. Now what is in in order to to start the healing there?

356
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:40,130
I mean, they've informed us here. Right.

357
00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:49,590
Because then they can find out what the bank is and then I can just make computations about the brain and so on and so forth.

358
00:52:49,610 --> 00:52:58,040
So what I'm going to do is in the first row and when I make some assumptions.

359
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:09,860
So the first assumption is that I don't have any observational error on the on the first, second on the first observation.

360
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:19,790
So that means that the base is exactly where the sales you know, the observation told me that would make me do anything.

361
00:53:21,530 --> 00:53:28,400
The first trend is, you know, the how much is the time series going to grow from now?

362
00:53:29,930 --> 00:53:34,440
And I don't know, because this is the first time that I look at the Time series.

363
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:38,750
So what I'm going to be doing in this case is make, you know, some time.

364
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:48,520
We usually there are different ways in which you can initialize the train, one way to put a zero right and you would have zero.

365
00:53:48,530 --> 00:53:53,960
The effect of that zero is going to disappear very rapidly depending on the Time series,

366
00:53:54,410 --> 00:54:04,750
but it's not going to be affecting too much your or your real forecast if you have you know, it doesn't seem to have seen absurd time length.

367
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:08,510
There are other ways to initialize that.

368
00:54:09,110 --> 00:54:18,500
A, that time is just taking a look at the first two observations and compute that and you know, like you can make the difference between the two.

369
00:54:20,030 --> 00:54:30,140
Again, if you handle in a time series of enough length, that initial assumption, if you want,

370
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:38,720
is going to be something your made sense very ill effect of of any initial assumption is going to disappear pretty rapidly.

371
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:43,400
So now let's let's use the.

372
00:54:47,890 --> 00:54:55,530
I'm going to use the convention. I'm going to start this at zero for now.

373
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:10,060
Right. So now I got the forecast now period number two and I'm going to forecast period number two because I say okay in video.

374
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:17,760
Number one, my observations were this is this is really what the Time series is to 83.

375
00:55:18,030 --> 00:55:24,980
And the Time series is is going to grow zero two, you know, over and over one period today.

376
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:30,600
So therefore, my forecast is going to be in to 83.

377
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:36,060
Then I have here across the trend that in this case is zero.

378
00:55:36,390 --> 00:55:38,630
So I have to weigh easily, right?

379
00:55:39,330 --> 00:55:49,230
So this case is like having an exponential smoothing with no, you know, the old stationary time series is going to be the same way.

380
00:55:49,470 --> 00:55:56,110
So I think basis 23 and my forecast is going to be 83 is not right now.

381
00:55:56,550 --> 00:56:08,070
I am going now that I have these to 83 and let me make sure that you understand that this is these are forecasts that they forecast,

382
00:56:08,070 --> 00:56:13,310
but they are not the same at these observations itself.

383
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:20,480
Q So I want to I'm looking at 28.

384
00:56:20,490 --> 00:56:30,719
This is where I just got I observed what I had forecasted 23 So I need to field 30 the noise that I have at,

385
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:34,680
in, in the observation and the anchor that I have in my forecast.

386
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:45,629
Right. So I'm going to combine those 228 and 23 using this way of and so if you remember

387
00:56:45,630 --> 00:56:50,620
the first exponential smoothing and this case for the base is going to be of.

388
00:56:53,250 --> 00:57:00,060
Find my sales. Time to lose my mind minus.

389
00:57:04,450 --> 00:57:10,340
Forecast time to. So this is the base.

390
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:15,760
This is what I think the Times is, is at that point.

391
00:57:15,770 --> 00:57:20,430
So I eliminated. I'm trying to get rid of the noise of the observation.

392
00:57:20,450 --> 00:57:27,940
I'm trying to get the rate of the forecasting error that I have accumulated, you know, with my thinking.

393
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:35,020
All right, so let me. You.

394
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:48,230
I know now that train, what is going to be the tendency of that time is to crawl from one vehicle to the next.

395
00:57:48,830 --> 00:57:55,130
Well, that's what I'm going to compute the train to remember that the train is.

396
00:57:57,810 --> 00:58:02,580
Better times.

397
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:10,740
The absurd trend right now and the observed trend is my base now, minus the base.

398
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:14,310
Last time I saw is 25. -23.

399
00:58:14,430 --> 00:58:20,370
So from one, from opinion one to period two, the dynamics grew two units.

400
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:23,820
So that's what they that's the train that I'm observing now.

401
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:33,060
And then I'm going to wait that time. Spend 25 miles and.

402
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:56,980
Four. And then plus one minus eight times the previous trend and the previous trend, we decided that was zero but is already there.

403
00:58:56,980 --> 00:59:01,570
And in period one, the three.

404
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:06,410
Right. So is in the three. Yeah.

405
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:13,850
Yeah. So better times managing the observed trend plus one minus.

406
00:59:13,850 --> 00:59:17,000
Best of times, the previous three. So.

407
00:59:18,010 --> 00:59:21,880
So. So I computed the trend to be 1.35.

408
00:59:21,890 --> 00:59:35,470
So two times point three. And so those are two times .90 times point one.

409
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:38,660
Right. And so I get that one setting.

410
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:49,490
Right. This is not exactly true.

411
00:59:50,130 --> 00:59:56,310
This is this is his realm. All right, so now I can.

412
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:07,490
I can produce the forecast for Pinot three just by writing this one.

413
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:13,010
So now I have to 85 to 86.

414
01:00:13,340 --> 01:00:22,190
Like that's going to be my forecast. Hello.

415
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:35,549
And then I, I got this observation 336 And then I just I'm going to compute a new base,

416
01:00:35,550 --> 01:00:41,730
which is how five times this observation blows my mind off of point seven forecast.

417
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:46,320
And then I'm going to get three or one, right?

418
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:51,840
And now that I have made three or one, then I'm going to compute my new trend.

419
01:00:52,170 --> 01:01:02,400
A new trend is going to be that that point nine times the difference between these 221 -25 plus one minus business times,

420
01:01:03,270 --> 01:01:06,470
which is point one times these past three.

421
01:01:06,690 --> 01:01:13,500
Right. And in this case, now I'm going to get a new trend equal to 14.89.

422
01:01:13,620 --> 01:01:22,610
Let me standardize the trend to 29.

423
01:01:26,090 --> 01:01:32,239
Okay. So now right after after saying after the second one, I have a copy of this for me.

424
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:45,760
Back down so I can copy. And what I want to do is that with all 4.3.9, I want to give the MSE.

425
01:01:46,420 --> 01:01:50,230
And then I'm going to draw. Okay. So what is my MSE?

426
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:22,390
The image is equal to the song you have to download to be dragged down minus y squared parentheses and then I am going to compare sales with forecast.

427
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:36,110
Wouldn't. And they're going to do by the by the count of the phone calls.

428
01:02:40,510 --> 01:02:45,390
And I get nine 84.92.

429
01:02:45,990 --> 01:02:54,300
No need to eat a lot of these 799, 89, 85.

430
01:02:56,220 --> 01:03:02,040
Now let's see how how these look. I am going to four.

431
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:10,010
I'm going. My time here is a little in search.

432
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:27,890
It's why. For a year now.

433
01:03:28,270 --> 01:03:31,820
You've served one year.

434
01:03:34,850 --> 01:03:54,830
I think. Oh I don't need the of.

435
01:03:55,500 --> 01:04:02,210
Actually I need the sales forecast that.

436
01:04:10,070 --> 01:04:27,440
That being said, it was my no worries that I would run into maybe a problem with that statement based on.

437
01:04:28,190 --> 01:04:42,800
What do you see here? The the blue is the original data and the red is the it is is the forecast.

438
01:04:43,010 --> 01:04:52,729
Right. So if you see how I used our forecasting modeling, then is going to a john and then getting better.

439
01:04:52,730 --> 01:04:57,950
But then the time series change trends and then then the forecast trends.

440
01:04:57,950 --> 01:05:04,400
We're just doing the best they can and remember that we have an optimize alpha.

441
01:05:04,410 --> 01:05:15,140
I'm betting you saw me and he has created better and different scale so I'm going to down to.

442
01:05:19,050 --> 01:05:29,730
You can see the difference between the two. That's deceptive work, just trying to catch up with intensity.

443
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:34,830
And what I'm going to do now is I'm going to minimize the limits.

444
01:05:35,220 --> 01:05:42,630
I see how better that red line approaches the blue line.

445
01:05:43,170 --> 01:05:47,670
So I'm going to go into the data in silver.

446
01:05:48,570 --> 01:05:53,670
And what we want is to minimize image, see.

447
01:05:58,290 --> 01:06:01,730
A changing of the law.

448
01:06:03,910 --> 01:06:13,560
Oh, great. I'm going and I'm going to on and then I need to put out I mean,

449
01:06:13,570 --> 01:06:27,540
I'm going to do this when I'm going to when I able and then I'm going to say that they have to be less than or equal to one independently.

450
01:06:27,550 --> 01:06:33,910
And I think that's because these will make them greater zero.

451
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:42,010
I want to minimize the ABC, so see how much better.

452
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:47,910
No fun, because this is not that this is not a difficult time.

453
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:56,770
Series two to format is a little bit difficult to imagine, but one thing has kind of been a constant trend.

454
01:06:57,400 --> 01:07:03,490
They are holds is all women very well what is happening with these things.

455
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:14,280
So I got i'll find one and bet that it wasn't two point 3 p.m. so it's following the times.

456
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:20,210
It's following the the observation very closely. That means that observation doesn't have a lot of noise.

457
01:07:21,580 --> 01:07:24,850
Why do alpha and beta need to be less than one?

458
01:07:25,570 --> 01:07:35,380
Don't. Those are the things. Okay, so if alpha was greater than one, we would be forecasting like coding for growth.

459
01:07:35,710 --> 01:07:38,800
Yes. So I thought that's what the trend is doing.

460
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:47,740
So you'll be overcompensated. Right. So so the trend is covering for the world for like just general expected growth.

461
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:56,080
But then if we did some program or some policy change where we like, well, we hope and think that it will grow by 25%.

462
01:07:56,500 --> 01:08:00,250
We would want it to be like alpha plus 2.25.

463
01:08:00,670 --> 01:08:04,810
Yeah. So you can, you can push shocks a little bit to tell you a little bit.

464
01:08:06,970 --> 01:08:14,920
Can you go hover over the MSI formula and see.

465
01:08:21,810 --> 01:08:36,060
I'm sorry. The.

466
01:08:44,860 --> 01:08:53,740
Here. The Great.

467
01:08:56,910 --> 01:09:09,430
Yours do. Oh. It's.

468
01:09:18,140 --> 01:09:21,370
Oh, good. So let me tell you this.

469
01:09:21,370 --> 01:09:34,460
So that what is interesting here now is that I'm going to forecast this day, let's say that I want to forecast period 2021 to 25.

470
01:09:40,830 --> 01:09:46,020
And what if these were an extension of any time series?

471
01:09:46,410 --> 01:09:59,160
What I would be doing is, is just figuring out what is the last base in this case is going to be 552 and that will be that would be my forecast.

472
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:04,080
And then I will just keep hoping that I need to find 62.

473
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:08,040
So it's going to be it would be a flat forecast here, but this is not a stationary.

474
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:17,160
And I know that the last tendency to at all of that and this is the last thing was 1142.

475
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:26,100
So the last time I look at the Time series with with new data, the Time series grew 11.42 units per one minute.

476
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:32,160
So this is what I'm going to do. I'm going to keep adding at 11.2.

477
01:10:32,730 --> 01:10:37,050
And so that's why you remembered a formula that says K Times.

478
01:10:37,780 --> 01:10:42,540
The last trend is one times, the threat two times and so on.

479
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:51,180
So in essence, what I'm doing is going to be the first one is simply the phase most of the time.

480
01:10:51,240 --> 01:11:01,880
So that's my 53. The central one is going to be the base times, twice the three, the third what it's going to be the phase times three times,

481
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:06,749
and the next one is going to be being poor times the time, right?

482
01:11:06,750 --> 01:11:14,820
So I'm just simply adding two units and it's easier for me to program this or to

483
01:11:15,090 --> 01:11:22,229
integrate these by looking at the last words on these columns and that that trend,

484
01:11:22,230 --> 01:11:36,420
that last trend that I'm going to be adding in a new log that that I will use.

485
01:11:47,150 --> 01:11:51,910
And that's how it does. Those are my words that if you want to see how you course,

486
01:11:52,010 --> 01:12:03,740
it's going to be a straight line trend and you simply want to add those points to the work that.

487
01:12:06,010 --> 01:12:12,820
We're going to be activating the graph in spatial.

488
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:20,920
And these are going to be lines and column categories in the first column.

489
01:12:21,100 --> 01:12:27,860
And so in the end, just simply just extrapolating the trend, that's.

490
01:12:35,900 --> 01:12:43,140
You showed up for 20 seconds, period just over a month.

491
01:12:48,670 --> 01:12:53,900
The two countries.

492
01:12:58,660 --> 01:13:10,180
Simply adding the last thing. If when I got an extra observation in period 21, then I'm going to use the base.

493
01:13:10,690 --> 01:13:14,570
I'm going to read you better and better when you start working.

494
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:23,540
And so I'm going to redo my forecast for the new 22 zero.

495
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:55,700
This nomination. This press conference is going to.

496
01:14:05,660 --> 01:14:08,940
So you're in control? Yeah.

497
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:25,620
Okay. Thank you. So now if let's say that in the year 21, you get another observation and I'm making this up, right?

498
01:14:25,620 --> 01:14:31,590
So I'm going to get ten and another observation and that observation is, let's say 580.

499
01:14:33,090 --> 01:14:44,190
So you get five and 80 here. And the question is, you know, how how you are going to proceed?

500
01:14:44,190 --> 01:14:47,760
Well, you need to compute the base and the trend, right.

501
01:14:48,090 --> 01:14:59,900
So because that 580 is this now I'm giving you information to get something more than five this time to an 11, 14 to 18 weeks.

502
01:15:01,170 --> 01:15:12,780
I made some friends and now we get to 580, 1365 and remember, it's, it's going to be 580 because otherwise it would be one, but it's not.

503
01:15:13,410 --> 01:15:23,490
And now what I'm going to be doing is. This case is going to be the.

504
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:33,049
At least he's going to need one so that now that this is fine, 94 because 85,

505
01:15:33,050 --> 01:15:44,330
80 and 1365 and then for video, 23, 24 and 25, I'll be the last observation.

506
01:15:44,330 --> 01:15:53,570
The last word got lost in that. And that is 1365 in this case, which I love.

507
01:15:54,110 --> 01:16:03,409
And that piece is going to be when. I might be informed that some of these forecasts are new because now I have a new

508
01:16:03,410 --> 01:16:14,450
observation of 580 video 21 and these is a new observation here in opinion 22.

509
01:16:15,020 --> 01:16:18,290
Then I will be redoing these for.

510
01:16:27,370 --> 01:16:41,520
Just. Just. I okay with practice.

511
01:16:42,030 --> 01:16:46,650
There's a little bit more that's that's called momentum.

512
01:16:47,060 --> 01:16:52,170
And this is what we've been doing. And then, you know, you showed a formula for the 594.

513
01:16:52,230 --> 01:16:59,640
It's like road 24 and you kind of.

514
01:17:02,610 --> 01:17:12,839
So the base proves that, right? So remember, what we want to do is just go to the end where you don't have morning any more observations.

515
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:16,050
And that's the last based on the last time that you had.

516
01:17:16,470 --> 01:17:17,820
And if you want to forecast,

517
01:17:17,820 --> 01:17:26,910
this is why you would need to start pulling the last page closed in trend is when one forecast ahead data flows the trend is to forecast

518
01:17:27,730 --> 01:17:37,770
to 23 forecasting and that's if you don't have any new information they would not be something medium that you get a new information,

519
01:17:37,770 --> 01:17:43,500
another observation. Then you can compute your last base, your last three forecast.

520
01:17:52,340 --> 01:18:01,750
You. Yeah.

521
01:18:08,260 --> 01:18:11,860
This is a this is one that I made.

522
01:18:11,860 --> 01:18:15,330
All right. If I babies are going to believe God.

523
01:18:16,810 --> 01:18:33,310
I'm Gideon, 21, and I'm going to redo a heart in the end before he is able to do them in 22,

524
01:18:33,310 --> 01:18:45,580
which is the last train with you there, because we should we should have whatever we had before.

525
01:18:47,230 --> 01:18:56,890
So the whole exercise, just ask for it to forecast, period 21 and 22.

526
01:18:57,160 --> 01:19:01,390
I just extended that a little bit so you can see, you know what?

527
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:06,480
You know how they forecast will like in case of friends.

528
01:19:07,410 --> 01:19:17,219
So those is actually an interesting methodology because if you have a time series that meanders,

529
01:19:17,220 --> 01:19:25,440
that changes trend and these forecasting techniques will be able to figure out that changing trend.

530
01:19:25,770 --> 01:19:30,420
And then I just done forecast locally where we want to be.

531
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:36,599
So you don't have to have a lot of memory about that.

532
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:42,060
So it's not that a very consistent pattern in the past in terms of trend.

533
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:50,430
Do you have like in this case, but it will adjust if they suddenly you start changing trends.

534
01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:55,920
So it depends on your of find and then you can modify that.

535
01:19:56,160 --> 01:20:02,760
We'll optimize the better. That's another point that I wanted to add.

536
01:20:02,810 --> 01:20:10,680
Sometimes you have a time series that is so large that you don't want to lose a lot of observations in the past,

537
01:20:10,860 --> 01:20:20,680
all the alterations in the past to optimize. They wait for the outcome before the parameters because they may not be relevant to what's happening now.

538
01:20:21,030 --> 01:20:30,750
So if you have 20 years of data, you know, and your nature of has given change in 20 years and you have monthly data,

539
01:20:32,220 --> 01:20:35,670
then why do you have to go back to 20 years?

540
01:20:35,670 --> 01:20:43,470
Is probably the last five or ten years we'll be able to forecast what's going on now.

541
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:48,970
So it depends on your knowledge of the business of accommodating, you know,

542
01:20:49,020 --> 01:20:54,870
observations in the past and your usually, you know, forecasting their, you know,

543
01:20:57,510 --> 01:21:01,799
demand of the certain demands of save time for all the different kind of services

544
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:08,460
that I and other people don't require request any more than the old nature of,

545
01:21:09,060 --> 01:21:18,870
you know, how we approach to services change. So right to use that data over into forecasting futures doesn't make sense right?

546
01:21:19,270 --> 01:21:26,580
So simply look at. So that's what a knowledge of when you are doing this important thing to say.

547
01:21:27,570 --> 01:21:31,200
I'm going to use only the last seven years,

548
01:21:31,530 --> 01:21:41,130
ten years or five years because this is what is relevant right now in order to forecast in the future that you will learn.

549
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:50,520
So next time we're going to practice a little bit more HALTZMAN Phillip,

550
01:21:50,850 --> 01:21:56,020
and then we're going to start doing that and forecasting and using refrigeration.

551
01:21:56,070 --> 01:21:59,010
And you'll see why that,

552
01:21:59,010 --> 01:22:14,940
I think regression or cleaning of refrigeration and some statistical power for some time in the morning and the time being up to now,

553
01:22:14,940 --> 01:22:23,540
even if it's only in it. Have to with number two.

554
01:22:24,810 --> 01:22:29,250
So it's not great. But, you know, it would be great if you try to solve it.

555
01:22:34,680 --> 01:22:39,470
I have a few brownies in my office for before this would be to pick them up.

556
01:22:39,870 --> 01:22:49,230
So I'll be hearing about it from one.

557
01:22:53,660 --> 01:22:56,850
I know. And understanding. Yeah.

558
01:22:59,270 --> 01:23:06,630
I don't like that, I suppose.

559
01:23:06,930 --> 01:23:12,780
Oh yeah. Whatever they don't like.

560
01:23:19,670 --> 01:23:36,930
And I don't think you should. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, right.

561
01:23:37,020 --> 01:23:40,120
That's right. It's way too much, so.

562
01:23:42,390 --> 01:23:47,190
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

563
01:23:50,690 --> 01:24:20,130
But I mean, I think that's, you know, I don't think can say oh yeah, you know I think yeah, yeah.

564
01:24:22,430 --> 01:24:32,920
I think it's a good idea, I don't know.

565
01:24:40,150 --> 01:24:57,090
But I think it's more important that you're doing what you're.
