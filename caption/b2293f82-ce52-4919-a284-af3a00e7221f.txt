1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:09,710
Somebody like you might find results wanting that same year.

2
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:27,850
Boy this know it looks like a lot of your significant other new home values have good health and education.

3
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:35,570
But you like it's.

4
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:44,010
Good morning, everyone. Here's something that makes you just, like, nice.

5
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:57,230
So today we have guest presenter Jan Nord has been visiting this class for a number of years to to prevent presents.

6
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:06,030
And I can see where the things Jen is going to be presenting on safe food handling

7
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:13,290
and is a senior environmental health safety specialist here at the university.

8
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:21,690
And her presentation is always walk out with Clough as well as a little bit of.

9
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,410
Food. Apprehension doesn't last long, but we'll talk about it after.

10
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:33,680
So I'm pleased to introduce Jen. Thank you so much for coming, Jen, after Jen's presentation.

11
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:38,960
We'll see if there's any time. I don't need much time, but I might have a few announcements.

12
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:43,700
Otherwise, we'll just touch base. Next Monday I'll be presenting next Monday.

13
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:48,500
We'll pick up with food labeling, which Janine covered on Monday.

14
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,300
Thank you. Thank you, Susan. Thank you, everyone, for having me joining us today.

15
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:00,379
I really appreciate it. I do work here for the University of Michigan.

16
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,450
And about 25 years ago,

17
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:10,609
I started here in Washtenaw County as a sanatoria environmental health specialist at the Washtenaw County Health Department doing soils work.

18
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:20,570
And then I moved on to food and then moved to the U.S., to Anchorage up in Alaska and did some food and plan review.

19
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:24,340
So sanatorium up there for a few years. I wanted to go to grad school, so I came back.

20
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:31,020
The U of M, got a job here, graduated from the School of Public Health, and I decided to stay.

21
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:37,310
So I like it a lot here and I enjoyed that you allowed me to come speak to you, so thank you.

22
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:45,560
Okay, so let's just get to the basics. Start off all of that smattering of history here.

23
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:52,700
So I think we started in this country not long ago, but it was a lot, you know,

24
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:57,079
it was like it's been a long road to get all of the rules in place that we

25
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:02,750
need and all of the pieces and parts and to keep our food as safe as possible.

26
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:10,370
And Abraham Lincoln in 1862 found the USDA, but not a whole lot happened.

27
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:20,600
You know, there were some food safety champions out there early, right around the turn of the century, around 1900, that other turn of the century.

28
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:27,590
And then, you know, not much really happened until the jungle was written by Upton Sinclair in 1905.

29
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:30,650
So for those of you who have read The Jungle,

30
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:35,930
you know how horrific the descriptions of the food production were that they

31
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:40,820
would put a sweep up at rats in their feces and put them into your sausage and,

32
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,069
you know, sell it as the specialty meat.

33
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:51,500
And I mean, it just goes on and on and that that just that disgusting food that they were providing to people and how dangerous it was.

34
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:56,600
And I think the most interesting part is it really, you know, the jungle, I think,

35
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:01,790
really went ahead and put such a light on the food safety aspect of this.

36
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:08,630
Whereas I think his real goal, Upton Sinclair, was to talk about the, you know, health and safety of the workers,

37
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:16,459
not that he was trying to hide the food safety, but it really took that that hurt took to convinced Theodore Roosevelt,

38
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:25,520
President Roosevelt, to go ahead and pass the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act and the Federal Meat Inspection Act to try and prevent,

39
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:33,709
you know, adulterated means from being produced, mislabeled products from crossing state lines, those types of things.

40
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:38,880
And then as time went on, 1927, the FDA finally formed again.

41
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:45,440
And then in 1942, the beginnings of the CDC for human attempts to stop malaria.

42
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:52,209
The FDA versus the USDA. You know, we hear these things.

43
00:04:52,210 --> 00:05:00,280
We don't know exactly who does what. Think of it as USDA handles a lot of onsite meat inspection.

44
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:08,160
So if they're going to go ahead and work with the meat, cook the meat, make a product with the meat, chop it up, grind it, something like that.

45
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:16,060
USDA is going to be there. Their food safety inspection service is going to be there every day onsite monitoring the activities that occur.

46
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:24,730
FDA is a little more hands off. They might not come into your facility for about ten years, you know, once every ten years.

47
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:28,120
So you could be shipping food across state lines.

48
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:34,570
You know, you've written up your food safety program, but you may not receive that that inspection that you would get.

49
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:41,470
And that oversight that you would get, like the USDA. So for some reason, that is the way they have developed and evolved.

50
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,360
That's always been a bit of a struggle,

51
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:55,450
and that's why they went ahead and tried to sort of normalize and get everything more equitable in the 2011 Food Safety Modernization Act.

52
00:05:55,450 --> 00:06:02,200
And that is still coming into play. There's still many things and guidelines that are they're working through with that Food Safety Modernization Act.

53
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:08,830
It's not quite complete yet, but they are working on trying to make our food as safe as possible.

54
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:16,720
So that's the feds. When we talk about the state and local, at least here in Michigan, and it's different in other states,

55
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:22,360
but here in Michigan, it's divided out in terms of safety and regulatory aspects.

56
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:29,620
It's going to be the state inspectors are going to go to your grocery stores, your food processors, your dairies.

57
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:37,630
All of those are places where they have large volumes of food that is not meant for media consumption on site.

58
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:41,290
Right. So they're the ones that handle all of that.

59
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:47,200
They follow the same rules that that the local health inspectors follow.

60
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:52,600
They may even have some extra guidelines that they have to follow as well, because that food is going to be shipped interstate sometimes.

61
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:56,620
Right. So they'll have some some also some other rules to follow.

62
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:04,419
Local health departments handle anything that's going to be going to where you're going to eat the food outside a restaurant school,

63
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:09,340
a daycare center, and they'll go out and inspect twice a year, typically for the locals.

64
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:15,340
So I think that's interesting. So if you go in a restaurant, you're going to go ahead and you're going to get in because you know,

65
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:18,850
you're going to go to a place that's been inspected twice a year.

66
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:25,360
However, you can buy, you know, canned goods that are inspected once every ten years.

67
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,940
And I do I find that very interesting and very confusing to me because things can can and do go wrong.

68
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,919
So. A little more about the regulatory oversight.

69
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:44,540
The public health code in Michigan does require that, you know, hospitals and nursing homes are inspected once every three years.

70
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:53,710
Okay. But CMS, which handles Medicare and Medicaid services there, they do require an inspection every nine, 15 months.

71
00:07:53,720 --> 00:08:01,600
So assumes that that federal money coming in requires that they meet certain standards and the inspection comes in a little bit more frequently.

72
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:10,660
So when it comes to hospitals and nursing homes, if those food service facilities are serving only the patients,

73
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:19,840
then they would be covered by CMS and the public health code and they will not see a local regulatory inspector or a, you know, inspector.

74
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:27,940
But if they serve to the patients and to the public, then you will see a level of inspection there also.

75
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:31,300
And I'll tell you all of those, because some of you may go into this field,

76
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:37,780
I see a lot of people going into, you know, nursing homes, dietitians, nursing homes and hospitals.

77
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:43,360
So, you know, you've kind of got the regulatory background.

78
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:51,910
But how if the locals at the county level are handling all of the food, why does the University of Michigan have their own health inspector?

79
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,870
Why am I here? There's actually three of us now. There needs to be two.

80
00:08:55,870 --> 00:09:00,160
There's three of us now. And we are here all because of Michigan.

81
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,240
Okay. So how is Michigan football? They touch everything.

82
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:13,419
So back in the late sixties or early seventies, the Michigan football was kind of a stadium, had, you know, still tens of thousands of people.

83
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:21,040
I don't know how many. And the food vendor would go ahead and prepare food in VATS and again on Friday,

84
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:26,320
cook up the hotdogs, wrap them up in a little bit of oil or in paper, whatever they did,

85
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,729
put them in cardboard boxes and set them on the countertop of each concession stand

86
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:36,090
and walk away until Saturday so they could be sitting there for over 24 hours.

87
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:42,940
So finally someone noticed this was happening and they said, Who better to do something about this?

88
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,990
And and there was a big Hollywood hullabaloo.

89
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:53,480
And the health department came in and said, basically, we can't be here all of the time.

90
00:09:53,480 --> 00:10:01,360
We can't be on campus all the time to help out the university. And the university decided they really wanted more, you know, boots on the ground,

91
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,050
so to speak, more people here to go ahead and make sure that things went safe.

92
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:10,809
So that's why I'm here. Part of my job is to go ahead and inspect every football game.

93
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:15,700
I've been doing it for the last 20 years, go around and inspect all the food at the football games.

94
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:20,559
And I will tell you, the press box for you is pretty nice if you get it up.

95
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,990
There it is. But, you know, that's that's the best part at the end.

96
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:32,979
But, you know, it's a lot of work before you also, you know, we do some consulting work.

97
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:38,350
So let's say Michigan Dining, they used to have a little food vendor unit here.

98
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:43,210
We would consult with them on, you know, who to purchase food from so that they, you know,

99
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:50,800
they don't run into purchasing food from an unsafe supplier or what kind of equipment to purchase that type of thing.

100
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:54,040
So there's a lot of, you know, consulting that goes in,

101
00:10:54,220 --> 00:11:00,760
just a lot of extra work that we would do that a local health department would not provide for the university.

102
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,030
So that's why we're here. Okay.

103
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:09,909
So yeah, just quick question. First of all, you deserve to be in the press box at for all that work.

104
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:14,680
Thank you. But do you guys get started the day before a football game?

105
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:24,159
And often we do. So what happens is now that back in the day, they didn't have a kitchen at the football stadium and then in 2010,

106
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,400
they renovated and they they built an actual kitchen.

107
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:30,220
Okay. So before it was like a temporary food, you know,

108
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:37,360
you go to a county fair or something like that and they'll have they bring in like water that they can use as a hand-washing station.

109
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:43,640
And then they'll bring in, you know, you know, barbecues and that type of thing to cook.

110
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:48,250
So it was there wasn't anything the day before, you know.

111
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:53,740
And so, I mean, there was because they were never putting in it, but there was no infrastructure in place.

112
00:11:54,070 --> 00:12:01,450
So, yes, we do go in the day before, especially the beginning of the season, mostly because if you've been at the football stadium,

113
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:08,620
you know, they have all of those little concession stands underneath the football stadium and they're kind of dark and scary looking.

114
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:12,760
And they we have to confirm that they've been cleaned before.

115
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,450
Any, you know, anyone arrives the next day to go ahead and start cooking. Right.

116
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,279
They haven't been touched since the spring game. And then that's six months ago.

117
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:26,740
And they were only you know, that was only once in the last six months. So, you know, in the day before, make sure everything's okay.

118
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:32,740
But the nice thing is now they have that that giant commissary kitchen at the football stadium and.

119
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:40,549
They also have one over at the Chrysler Center where they can go ahead and prepare foods in advance and pass them out to the concession stands,

120
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:44,210
which they've never had in the past. So we have to go over there a couple of days.

121
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:51,070
Yeah. So pre harvest food safety.

122
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:51,590
This is,

123
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:58,550
this is where it's at and we don't I don't think we do enough pre harvest food safety in our country we focus really on post-harvest food safety.

124
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,530
So previous food safety has a goal to prevent the contamination in the first place.

125
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:12,950
I mean, this seems like the gold standard, right? This is what we want. Let's go ahead and prevent food from becoming contaminated before we eat it.

126
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:18,500
So this would be considered things like if you had your growing vegetables, right, and you're going to sell them,

127
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:23,000
you want to go ahead and make sure that you have the worker hygiene in place,

128
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,459
that and you have restrooms for them to use and some for them to wash their hands.

129
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:34,100
You don't want people to relieve themselves in, you know, the actual fields while they're there collecting food.

130
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:38,420
You want them to be able to wash their hands. This is always a problem if you don't have that.

131
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:45,139
They can't work all day under those conditions. Right. You also want to worry about irrigation water safety.

132
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:48,620
Okay. So is the water safe to drink?

133
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:55,310
These have been contaminated. Has it been tested? Do we know? Is there some sort of a, you know, cattle,

134
00:13:55,730 --> 00:14:02,750
cattle feeding operation of stream and you're pulling your water from the river directly and, you know, you haven't checked it.

135
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:09,200
So this is important. The irrigation water, also how the irrigation water is applied to the produce.

136
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:16,379
Are you using the overhead sprinklers which allow the water to go ahead and potentially contaminate the food?

137
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:20,330
Or are you using drip irrigation right down there at the ground level so that it

138
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:23,600
wouldn't necessarily touch the leaves of the products that you would go ahead and eat?

139
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,739
So these are things we're concerned about dairy. You worry about the health of it.

140
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:33,860
How are they cleaning? You know, they're cleaning the gutters before they go ahead and not the cow.

141
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:41,659
This is huge. Yes. Yes. You can potentially go ahead and pasteurize, you know, a lot of things that might be in that milk.

142
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:47,600
But you have to make sure you go ahead and clean that cow because utter before you milk the cow.

143
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:52,100
So those are the types of things that we do worry about in pre harvest food safety.

144
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:56,690
Some countries really have focused in and honed in on that.

145
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:00,050
And the classic example that you'll always hear is Denmark.

146
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:10,790
Denmark has done a fantastic job in reducing salmonella in their in their poultry in their in their poultry, in in their in their pork.

147
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,800
So in the poultry flocks, they they do things that were unheard of here in this country.

148
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:22,490
They will go ahead. And, you know, the test, the poultry that they have in the chicken house and in the you know,

149
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:28,000
in the queue for whatever they'll test them for salmonella, you know, if none of them have salmonella, great,

150
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:33,440
they can go ahead and be harvested and then they will still because they could they're not testing all of them.

151
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:36,980
They will still go ahead after they harvested all the poultry.

152
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:42,530
They will thoroughly clean that particular coop and wait.

153
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:48,439
They will give it time before they bring in another flock of chickens, which is in this country.

154
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:56,930
It's turnover after turnover. So, you know, the rules that Denmark has put in place for the pre harvest food safety are huge.

155
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:02,239
And I think that, you know, we could learn a few things from them in this country.

156
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:07,819
Instead we will go ahead and assume that poultry is contaminated.

157
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:17,660
That is postharvest and food safety. We're going to assume that the food is contaminated and then we'll either wash it or cook it and try and,

158
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:21,950
you know, kill anything that might be in there and protect it at that point in time.

159
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:31,280
Protect, you know, us at that point in time. So that's how we handle our poultry in this country, is that post-harvest food safety.

160
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:38,780
And we go ahead and we look at we look at, you know, cooking them to proper temperatures.

161
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:42,680
That's that's how we would handle that, holding that chicken and proper temperatures.

162
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:51,589
So we worry about cross-contamination, also, those types of things for post-harvest food safety, which is these chemicals to sanitize surfaces.

163
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:57,080
So if you have that chicken down, we're going to assume that any time you put a chicken down on a cutting board,

164
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,969
that cutting board is now contaminated.

165
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:04,670
And you're going to have to go ahead and wash your hands and sanitize it prior to using that cutting board for anything else.

166
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:09,130
Right. Also your hands. We have to worry about your hands. Always, never, never for each hands.

167
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:15,570
Um, and then but however, this makes it difficult because the only one that,

168
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:23,670
that we really don't have a good handle on for post-harvest food safety is fruits and vegetables because we have no step.

169
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:33,740
Okay. I'm going to pop over, keep those things in mind as we as we go through this, the 3 hours and the post-harvest food safety.

170
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,420
And you'll be able to kind of look at, you know,

171
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:43,100
what we're talking and kind of evaluate all of the rest that I tell you with those glasses on, so to speak.

172
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:51,860
Foodborne illness outbreaks. So an FBI foodborne illness outbreak is a disease transmitted to people via food.

173
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:56,930
Okay, an FBI outbreak. An outbreak is when you have two or more people.

174
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:57,530
Okay.

175
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:07,680
In and confirming that is an outbreak that someone actually got it from food just require that you go ahead and you know you do an investigation,

176
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:15,650
you get some epidemiological links, you take some environmental samples or maybe some clinical samples, that type of thing.

177
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:24,169
So and it's always to it's it's almost always to with the rare exception of that, you have one person who is botulism because that's pretty rare.

178
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:32,180
It's not really naturally occurring. That's really the only way to get botulism in their food or a chemical or toxin poisoning.

179
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,799
Those can also be one person. We can go ahead and identify that as a foodborne illness.

180
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:41,030
Right. Who in the room has had a foodborne illness before?

181
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:46,100
Okay. Who's had a doctor tell you you've had a foodborne illness before?

182
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:57,190
Okay. Did your doctor also then go ahead and take samples and tell you what organism you had to make by saying, Oh, my poisoning.

183
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:01,900
Okay. So that's rare. Most of the time I will ask the room.

184
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:11,800
And we rarely, you know, because these are often short lived illnesses, we don't actually test to find out what happened.

185
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:18,070
Was yours short lived or. I don't. I was like seven really right past.

186
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:24,730
Okay. And so I was at Beaumont. And I think at that time, they still do have a CDC person on staff there.

187
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:28,690
Oh, I was tested. Oh, really? Oh, that's interesting.

188
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:32,320
Yeah. Okay. So, I mean, I if I resource, you know.

189
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:39,919
Yes, I chocolate. It's on this week and I'm just I'm 51.

190
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:45,110
So this was a few years ago. I think it's interesting especially to try to be like, Oh, and it has Sanders hot fudge on it.

191
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:49,550
I'm like, Oh, that's really interesting.

192
00:19:50,360 --> 00:20:00,470
No. Okay, what I'm saying. So it's not like your favorite holiday dishonors that, I guess not for Sanders for you.

193
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:07,550
Okay. So there is, you know, a big burden of foodborne illness in this country.

194
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:13,940
You know, I mean, we've heard the perfect example over here when we were hospitalized or at least we went to the emergency room,

195
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:19,460
you know, and we do see, you know, one in six Americans will get sick each year.

196
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:25,519
128,000 are hospitalized and 3000 will die of food borne diseases.

197
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,160
And that is that's, you know, far too many.

198
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:33,410
You know, we need to try and reduce this as much as possible.

199
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:41,660
Go ahead. A question on that. Is there any research like for countries like Denmark that prioritize pre harvest safety?

200
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:48,590
Do they see I mean, Denmark's different than the U.S. in a lot of ways, but do they see any difference in food borne related deaths?

201
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:53,840
I can answer. I'm sure there is, and I have not read that particular portion.

202
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,100
But I can tell you that Denmark,

203
00:20:55,100 --> 00:21:04,100
the reason Denmark went ahead and prioritized their pre harvest food safety was because they were having a lot of deaths due to salmonella poisoning.

204
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:06,200
And so they went ahead and other things.

205
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:13,879
But they can they have been able to prove that they're pre harvest food safety practices have saved many, many lives over there.

206
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:19,520
And I'm sure there is some research out there comparing the, you know, Denmark, the incidence in Denmark in the United States.

207
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,360
But I don't I don't have it. It's an interesting question.

208
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:35,750
The burden of foodborne illness, billions of dollars, health care costs, you know, lost productivity, but loss of consumer confidence, that's huge.

209
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:39,920
That happens all of the time. So the best example is churches that happened.

210
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:44,720
Churches had restaurants all over the country. They're kind of on their way out anyway a little bit.

211
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:53,390
You know, they've been around for a while, but they purchased some green onions from, I think, Mexico or South America somewhere.

212
00:21:53,750 --> 00:22:00,799
And these green onions had hepatitis A and then people got ill because they were chopping the green onions and using them as a garnish.

213
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:10,460
And then, you know, you eat the garnish, right? So, I mean, it's a green onions you can and then on you know, I think only only one person died.

214
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:13,610
I think that number I'm a little hazy on.

215
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:19,370
But, you know, they were, you know, causing illnesses all over the country and cheeses went out of business.

216
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:24,799
They still have their their salsa and chips, but they those restaurants are longer that I'm aware of.

217
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:30,500
I think they're completely gone now. So what makes our food unsafe?

218
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:37,220
Biological contaminants. Okay. So there's a lot of components that make our food unsafe.

219
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:42,680
And biological contaminants are a huge portion excuse me that we worry about.

220
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,690
There are more than 30 known pathogens,

221
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:52,670
but we do divide up the contaminants that make our food unsafe into three different groups biological, chemical and physical.

222
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:56,690
Okay. Personally, I think the biological are the most fun.

223
00:22:56,690 --> 00:23:00,319
You know, your infectious diseases, they're they're fun to study. They're interesting.

224
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,930
You know, they seem to pop up when you least expect them.

225
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:11,480
But, you know, chemical chemical poisonings can be can cause, you know, just as much pain, suffering and death, there's no doubt.

226
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:17,000
And, you know, physical and, you know, physical items are frightening.

227
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:25,100
And I'm not sure on in terms of what the numbers are for, you know, physical items being found in food, excuse me.

228
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:30,800
But yes, it is is frightening to find that entire dead bird in your bag.

229
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,680
Pretty much lettuce for sure. Excuse me.

230
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:44,150
Okay, so the biological contaminants we have divided into four groups bacteria, parasites, virus and fungi.

231
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:55,790
And we see here that the number one cause of poor analysis in this country is a virus.

232
00:23:55,790 --> 00:24:00,920
Okay. And that's norovirus. We've all heard of it. You know, we all know about norovirus.

233
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:04,400
And then the next four are all bacteria.

234
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:09,080
So it is mostly norovirus is over 50%.

235
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:14,809
And then salmonella, you know, one we're worried about with our chicken and other things.

236
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:18,020
And salmonella is also extremely persistent in the environment.

237
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:25,549
And so that's why, you know, that we get that those numbers as high as we do so.

238
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:30,170
And then Clostridium perfringens, campylobacter and staph aureus.

239
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:35,530
Okay, Nora. And that picture is disgusting.

240
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:40,190
I'm true. It is very accurate because you are right.

241
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:45,320
If you ever had a norovirus or had norovirus, it is horrific.

242
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:53,990
It's a huge and short list and self-limiting, thank goodness, because it is it's it's pretty painful.

243
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:58,370
We get one just one or two outbreaks here on campus every year.

244
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:02,240
We had a teeny tiny one last year.

245
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:09,680
We didn't have any that we were aware of the year before. And I'm afraid we're in for a doozy this year.

246
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:13,490
My fear, because, you know, and it's kind of the way it goes.

247
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:17,350
You know, we had a couple of easy years and then bam, something did happen.

248
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:28,380
So. 2016 here on campus, we had the norovirus outbreak in South Quad where we had, you know, untold numbers of people that got ill.

249
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:34,010
Okay. Not even sure how many numerous student athletes.

250
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:37,940
I think over 50 student athletes got sick. People were complaining.

251
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:45,170
It was all, I think on, oh, it was going to be a very dangerous day.

252
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,930
And it happened on February 14 and 15.

253
00:25:51,470 --> 00:26:04,040
So we are we never found the actual cause, but it was people living around South Quad, you know, in our going to South Quad to eat food.

254
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:08,030
You know, norovirus can be spread more than simply in food.

255
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:12,710
Right. So you can you can get touching surfaces and you can go ahead and get it.

256
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:22,250
You know, person to person, that type of thing. But these people, most people got ill right at one time, which tends to implicate the food.

257
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:36,670
So let's see, we had 50 let's see, 50% of all foodborne illnesses for norovirus, 5 billion infectious doses per gram, stool at peak, viral shedding.

258
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:44,750
That's why it's so infectious. So one person, I mean, you know, had the potential to infect 5 million different people.

259
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:49,010
One person does. So, I mean, obviously, you're not going to have that kind of reach.

260
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:54,110
You don't have 5 billion friends. But, you know, there is that possibility.

261
00:26:54,200 --> 00:27:00,709
Okay. My my favorite example, I like to use some norovirus examples for a fever.

262
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:06,050
One is we had a caterer come to campus and really nice lady.

263
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:06,440
I knew.

264
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:18,050
I knew her from when I worked at the county and she was preparing food for like it was a group of medical school employees at the medical school.

265
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:24,200
They all got sick at the same time. So we looked at the caterer, went and talked to the caterer, and she said, No, I'm not sick.

266
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:29,030
I haven't been sick. And then we said, okay, okay. She said, You know, we said, how about your family?

267
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:32,750
Well, my my son has been sick and. Well, how old's your son?

268
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:36,080
He's like he's like one. Okay.

269
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:41,690
So is he still in diapers? Yeah. Okay. Get a stool sample.

270
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:46,760
Can you bring in a dirty diaper? And she did. And it was from her son.

271
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:55,790
So her son, who, you know, is sick, she was either asymptomatic and shedding viral particles,

272
00:27:55,790 --> 00:28:00,709
you know, and when she prepared food, either she didn't wear gloves, should wash your hands properly.

273
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:09,380
We aren't sure. Or she was, you know, intermittently, you know, preparing food and maybe not in it.

274
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:16,730
Maybe she was preparing food at home. We don't know. Instead of that, you know, at the licensed kitchen and then she was the only employee.

275
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:21,260
So she food take care of her son. And then that's how everyone got sick.

276
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:25,820
So that was like 15 years ago here on campus. But it was pretty it was pretty horrific.

277
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:31,200
Can you imagine? I can't do them bacteria.

278
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:36,510
So bacteria can can go ahead and cause people to be ill.

279
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:41,790
You know, that's this is our one, again, our biological contaminant,

280
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:47,189
because people to be ill through a foodborne infection, which is where the bacteria reproduce in your intestinal tract,

281
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:56,069
such as salmonella and intoxication, where the bacteria produce a toxin and the toxin is consumed and the toxin mediated

282
00:28:56,070 --> 00:29:01,850
infection with the bacteria produce toxins while they're in your intestinal tract.

283
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:06,330
So just kind of in different ways. Bacteria as adapts to cause illness.

284
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:13,260
Yes. I'm sorry. I just want to go back to the norovirus. So when you find the culprit is what do you just say?

285
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:18,240
Like, hey, that was like, what are you training or I mean,

286
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:24,320
training and and some sensitivity because they're when you find out who did it, they're very upset.

287
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:27,840
Right. I mean, they no one wants to cause an illness.

288
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:37,600
No one wants to do that. And sometimes, you know, they're just devastated that they cause, you know, a large outbreak or even a small outbreak.

289
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:40,980
So but it's significantly we focus on training.

290
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:46,440
You know, employee health is key. You know, if you're sick, you cannot come.

291
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:50,670
You cannot come to work. You need to report that you are have vomiting and diarrhea.

292
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:54,270
And if your boss tries to make you come to work, you shouldn't, you know, not I mean,

293
00:29:54,540 --> 00:30:00,570
this is one of the biggest problems in the food industry is not everyone has paid sick days.

294
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:10,350
So they will either try and come to work or let's say they they say they want to stay at home and their bosses like, no, we need you.

295
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:18,390
You have to come in. So it's it's a big problem. So training for our management, training for the employees, that's the biggest key.

296
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:26,820
We try not to focus on punishment. But yeah, there's there's now, however, some of the type of a.

297
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:32,750
Deliberate contamination, even by an employee, would be a different story.

298
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:40,460
That would be a criminal act. And we would have to go ahead and try and pursue some type of, you know.

299
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:44,390
You know, we would have to pursue that criminally. So.

300
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:50,410
All right. Bacteria.

301
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:56,270
Bacteria. They survive and thrive through fat.

302
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:59,570
Tom, that's the acronym. And this is huge.

303
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:05,300
So this is why everyone remembers it. This is the way they teach it in service.

304
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:09,470
Of course, if you haven't had a certificate, say, of course yet, this is what they teach you.

305
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:16,400
Bacteria need food and you know, they love protein, carbs, that type of thing.

306
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:19,820
They like acidity. Excuse me.

307
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:24,740
So neutral to let a slightly acidic page is perfect for them.

308
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:32,929
They like time. They need some time to reproduce. So some of them are really quick and they'll double in 20 minutes.

309
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:41,540
Others take more time. They need the proper temperature, which is between 45 to 41 degrees Fahrenheit and 135 degrees Fahrenheit.

310
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:52,610
What our body temperature is right in the middle of that, right smack dab in the middle where bacteria love to reproduce on that oxygen.

311
00:31:53,480 --> 00:32:01,700
So some bacteria love oxygen. Some prefer in anaerobic environments such as Clostridium botulinum and moisture.

312
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:10,010
So let's say with the moisture, you know, like our bread is not is the moisture has been picked out of it.

313
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:13,160
And so that is their main food safety.

314
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:18,080
Action on bread. There's not enough moisture to allow the bacteria to to grow.

315
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:25,510
And so that's why you can develop the counter. A good example of bacteria.

316
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:29,680
Salmonella is you know, we talk about Typhoid Mary.

317
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:35,680
And if you know the story of Typhoid Mary, she was a cook for a family, I think, out on Long Island.

318
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:43,240
And oh, thank you so, so much. I did try to go buy one at the little and it's gone.

319
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:52,420
Yeah, that's fine. So Sue is always you're so very humble, Typhoid Mary.

320
00:32:53,080 --> 00:33:00,010
So she was a cook on Long Island and many of the family members got, you know, became ill.

321
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:03,670
The bottom was the soft clam. So she was cooking. It was not the soft clams.

322
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:14,020
There was a like a chemical, chemical, sanitary engineer that kind of kind of figured out that it might be Mary.

323
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:19,509
And he started stalking her. Yeah, he did.

324
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:22,780
And he followed her around. She was told not to cook anymore, and she kept cooking.

325
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:33,270
So they locked her up for a while, and they took like 160 some stool samples and 120 of those stool samples where, you know,

326
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:40,570
over a course of years, like two years while she was locked up and then there were 120 of those samples were positive for salmonella.

327
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,680
She never cleared the bacteria. She was a carrier her whole life.

328
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:50,680
And she she just didn't believe it. She would just keep going around and and, you know, cooking for people and making them ill.

329
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:54,970
Now, salmonella is very persistent. People can you can carry it.

330
00:33:55,300 --> 00:34:05,490
And, you know, the asymptomatic carriers, we had a similar situation here in Kalamazoo, and it went on for about ten years.

331
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:10,840
Didn't happen all the time. People didn't get all the sick. We have a lot of you know, it's sick as often.

332
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:15,190
We have a lot of procedures in place, handwashing, gloves, those types of things.

333
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:21,139
But they did have fun eventually figure out it was this facility.

334
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:24,700
It took a lot of sleuthing and whole genome sequencing.

335
00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:33,040
And this they found that four employees were carriers and there are also was some environmental

336
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:38,469
contamination that was persistent within the facility that they could not sanitize,

337
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:47,140
disinfect, get rid of it. They couldn't they eventually had to close it down and just completely remove all of the equipment and throw it away.

338
00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:55,450
You know, it was that pervasive. And so, yes, the environment of the salmonella is still a tough one.

339
00:34:55,450 --> 00:35:00,250
It can remain in soil, I think, for up to two years. So that's a that's a tough one.

340
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:06,160
Um, okay. So let's see.

341
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:12,790
So we had a situation here in Washtenaw County. I would like to use the what the examples from what I can find.

342
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:20,860
We had a couple that went to Kroger and they purchased some salmon, some fresh salmon,

343
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:26,200
and they were going to have some sushi near, I think it's called sushi and they went had it coming up.

344
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:29,829
They ate some it was delicious. They put it in refrigerator.

345
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:33,370
They checked that in two days later and it had worms growing it.

346
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:40,719
Right. So that's never a good sign. They went to the doctor, they said, you know, hey, can we get some sort of medication?

347
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:44,200
They both took an anti-parasitic, the husband.

348
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:49,510
It worked for him, but unfortunately the wife was not so lucky.

349
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:58,180
And she did get these classic symptoms of, you know, so the the in a success, you know,

350
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:05,440
the these nematodes that in a second I'm not sure how to pronounce it these parasites got the

351
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:09,729
classic simple symptoms where they're in your throat and you and you try and cough them up.

352
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:12,780
And I cannot imagine how horrible and constant.

353
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:17,679
Oh, that must've been terrible. So this is huge.

354
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:21,870
This is, this is now pre harvest.

355
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:30,280
There's nothing you could do pre harvest for fish, right? There's nothing you can do post harvest for fish in this case is freezing.

356
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:38,350
So we try and kill off these parasites by freezing the fish and going ahead and freezing it for a certain amount of time,

357
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:42,880
their time and temperature regulations in our food code that require that frozen.

358
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:50,320
So if you eat sushi at a restaurant or get it from a grocery store or something like that here in Michigan, you should not run into this problem.

359
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:55,840
But it's one of those situations where don't make it at home because you may not make it currently.

360
00:36:56,050 --> 00:37:10,840
So moving on to chemical contamination, so of our three types of contamination, biological, chemical and physical chemical can be pretty severe.

361
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:20,110
So back in 1973, there was a chemical company in Michigan that produced both a fire retardant or.

362
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:30,650
Fire suppressant. And they also produced a nutritional supplement for cattle feed and other product or other animal products.

363
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:39,049
So producing chemicals and food right there in the same building they did not have, they ran out of the proper sacks.

364
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:49,310
They put those animal feeds in sacks and they ran out of the proper sacks for those and, you know, for the fire retardant.

365
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:58,070
And then they used the animal sacks for the fire retardant, which then got shipped to the feed stores, then was distributed throughout the state.

366
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:06,650
And I mean, it was it was pretty horrific. They ended up they put down thousands of cows in the state of Michigan.

367
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:14,180
There were you know, they they pretty much said in most of the state of Michigan, you know, were consuming beef at that point in time.

368
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:18,560
You received some of that product was their assumption at that point in time.

369
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:25,940
And then I think that there are ongoing studies to see if that did persist and was passed down to children,

370
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:35,870
you know, here in the state of Michigan as well. So I think it is also a Superfund site now, but that was just a huge, huge mistake.

371
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:39,680
And it was simply a labeling issue, you know, and end up keeping things separate.

372
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:53,239
Um, another huge chemical contamination and this one resulted in the death of 47 people was, um, sodium chloride, was confused for powdered milk.

373
00:38:53,240 --> 00:39:02,320
And then in the production of eggs in an, a Oregon State hospital like a mental institution that they had back in the freezer,

374
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:11,120
what they did was they sent a student or a one of the patients downstairs to the store room, and it wasn't properly labeled down there.

375
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:15,919
They grabbed something that looked like powdered milk and it was actually sodium fluoride.

376
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,760
47 people died. You know, hundreds were were injured.

377
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:28,120
It was pretty, pretty horrific incident. So labeling is the key when it comes to any of your products in your facility.

378
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:33,500
Make sure that you go ahead and label your products and keep them labeled.

379
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:40,790
So physical contamination, you know, bandages, you find those in food all the time, received complaints about that.

380
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:44,660
These are all things that we would see.

381
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:53,660
I mean, the rat I've never run into that one, but I have we have had a bag of spinach that was delivered on campus,

382
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:58,520
pre-washed, triple washed with the debt burden at one time. So this stuff happens.

383
00:39:58,850 --> 00:40:03,020
So you look at your food, you have to make sure it's don't assume that it's safe.

384
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:08,720
Always contaminated food.

385
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:16,310
Vehicles responsible for foodborne illness. Poultry is responsible for a lot of foodborne illnesses.

386
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:22,640
So as well as the degree, those are your skills going to be.

387
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:30,049
It used to we had a lot of big concerns for beef back in the day but I would say and and pork butt pork

388
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:35,270
they've done a lot with pre harvest food safety beef they've done a lot with post-harvest food safety.

389
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:40,970
Go ahead and protect us beef. They they really have done wonders on that.

390
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:46,069
So I think we've answered this question already. Why are we so concerned about leafy greens?

391
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:49,610
There is no there is no kill. Stop. This is the most frightening thing.

392
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:55,100
I mean, it's there's really nothing you can do to fully protect yourself.

393
00:40:55,190 --> 00:41:00,390
Okay. Buy from an approved supplier.

394
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:04,570
That is about all you can do is make sure you purchase from approved suppliers.

395
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:12,870
When it comes to leafy greens so you can wash the product, but you don't know that, you know, you can't necessarily get it all either.

396
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:19,950
So this is an example of, you know, what happens to leafy greens.

397
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:24,929
They are harvesting there. There are leafy greens of some sort.

398
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:28,460
Out of doses are romaine or what? Yeah, that's romaine. Okay.

399
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:32,850
So they're you know, they're all covered up there. You know, everything looks safe.

400
00:41:32,850 --> 00:41:38,100
But they cut the they cut them right in the field and they put them right on the truck and then go straight to your grocery store.

401
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:44,880
Okay. Our main and seems to be the one that is implicated in a lot of food borne illnesses.

402
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:55,080
And I'm not sure why they've done studies on that and know that there are reasons, but I don't have that answer on the top of my head.

403
00:41:55,770 --> 00:42:04,020
This is also the water supply that they used to produce that romaine out in the because the Yuma Valley or Yuma,

404
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:07,290
Yuma, Arizona, I guess Salinas Valley in California. Yuma, Arizona.

405
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:14,129
This is the water source. And, you know, they there are potential cattle feeding operations nearby.

406
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:20,100
There are cattle feeding operations nearby that could potentially go ahead and affect the water source, which is a huge problem as well.

407
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:32,780
Excuse me. There are five risk factors for unsafe food.

408
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:40,130
So when you are working in a food facility, let's say if you're a dietitian that does something like that.

409
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:45,150
These are things that you should consider for your patients.

410
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:49,630
Okay. And also just for yourself.

411
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:57,340
So, you know, anytime you're dealing with your patients, if you're purchasing food from unsafe suppliers, that is a hazard.

412
00:42:57,370 --> 00:43:04,040
So unsafe suppliers are people who don't have any regulatory oversight.

413
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:15,729
Um, you know, and then what you want is someone with regulatory, like regulatory oversight of food safety plans in place, which is huge.

414
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:23,350
And that's one of the things that the 2011 2011 food business covered.

415
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:25,810
They wanted to make sure everyone had food safety plan in place.

416
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:33,820
Even smaller producers that may have trouble with that, they want to buy, you know, may have trouble having enough employees.

417
00:43:34,090 --> 00:43:38,380
They still needed to have a food safety plan in place. They also need traceability.

418
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:41,050
So where did the food come from? Where did it go to?

419
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:49,360
You know, you need to make sure that that the food can be tracked down and removed from the store shelf if it's found to be a problem.

420
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:54,310
A good example of this is country gardens. Did anyone hear what happened in country gardens recently?

421
00:43:55,060 --> 00:44:00,760
Okay, so they provide country gardens here in Homer, Michigan, which I'm not even sure where that's at,

422
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:11,080
but they provide leafy greens and other products, other vegetable products to grocery stores in the area, bushes here in Washington County.

423
00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:17,110
Well, last month, Bushes and any of the other providers that were purchasing from country gardens

424
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:22,390
had to go ahead and pull everything off the shelves because country gardens,

425
00:44:23,350 --> 00:44:26,319
they had to pull their country gardens products off the shelves because country

426
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:33,870
gardens had spilled a bunch of human waste in their product and still harvest.

427
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:42,860
Not really sure. And the details are hazy. Doesn't make sense to me why you would continue to harvest at that point.

428
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:51,490
But yeah, so they had they had apparently if you had a house, but you know, you had to make sure your house doesn't leak into that field.

429
00:44:51,510 --> 00:44:56,320
So that's why you want to have recall and traceability.

430
00:44:56,590 --> 00:44:59,620
They were able to pull those products off the market right away.

431
00:44:59,890 --> 00:45:04,240
And even though country gardens is small, but they did have you know,

432
00:45:04,330 --> 00:45:08,200
they didn't know where their products went and they were able to to pull those items.

433
00:45:08,210 --> 00:45:14,170
You must have allergen labeling and make sure that there is no mistake.

434
00:45:14,370 --> 00:45:21,760
Okay. So allergens are huge. We you know, we don't we're really we've been building it up the last ten years in food safety.

435
00:45:22,030 --> 00:45:28,450
But we need to make sure we're listing all those allergens on the product safe food supplier.

436
00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:32,250
We'll also have someone who comes in and doesn't third party it.

437
00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:43,150
So that would be like produce. So prior to 2011, produce suppliers were not required to have a third party audit.

438
00:45:43,390 --> 00:45:50,290
Some of them did the larger like your dole and your fresh express they would purchase replaces that would have a third party on it,

439
00:45:50,290 --> 00:46:00,280
but not all of them. So the third party audit will come in and look at food pre harvest food safety aspects to make sure you're safe.

440
00:46:00,790 --> 00:46:07,239
So and the other the second of the fifth of the five items that the CDC has

441
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:12,580
identified as necessary to protect your food is proper food something temperatures.

442
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:17,200
So you cook your food, the proper types measure up to the metal step thermometer.

443
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:22,690
And, you know, depending on what you're cooking, you know, they have to cook it to a higher temp or a lower temp.

444
00:46:23,050 --> 00:46:33,130
So, you know, chicken, poultry, because it has so many known contaminants is is cooked the highest temperature required, which is 165 degrees.

445
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:40,930
Vegetables would be 135 degrees. Meat is usually in between depending on how it's cut and whole muscle meat.

446
00:46:41,230 --> 00:46:43,930
You don't have to cook it as much because it's not going to have contamination.

447
00:46:43,930 --> 00:46:48,040
But contamination on meat generally comes during the slaughter process.

448
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:55,090
If there were any sort of the intestines or or anything like that that were nicked in could have gotten,

449
00:46:56,110 --> 00:47:01,080
you know, any bacteria onto the meat, then the meat can become contaminated.

450
00:47:01,090 --> 00:47:05,020
Right? So if it's a whole muscle meat, you you wash it off,

451
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:11,829
they put some acidified chloride on there and they kill whatever's on the surface and then we test safe.

452
00:47:11,830 --> 00:47:18,399
But if you start writing the meat out, you know, you inject it with something, then anything was on the outside.

453
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:22,360
Went to the inside. I know. Makes laundry right inside almost.

454
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:29,170
So you will eat again today.

455
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:36,370
All right. So holding to the proper temperatures.

456
00:47:36,370 --> 00:47:40,660
Okay. Oh, I love a good buffet, even though I know better.

457
00:47:42,550 --> 00:47:46,380
So you have to start to say the Whole Foods have to stay cold.

458
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:53,370
It's that simple. So if you go somewhere and they're not doing that, it's take a pause.

459
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:57,970
Okay. Now, it's a short time period. It's less than 4 hours.

460
00:47:57,970 --> 00:48:03,070
It's considered safe. Problem is, you don't always know when, who, how, where.

461
00:48:03,310 --> 00:48:07,050
So you know. You know, you go to a wedding buffet.

462
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:10,840
That's one thing they pointed out and you see it going out. You see it coming back.

463
00:48:11,530 --> 00:48:18,040
You go to a restaurant. I would not eat at a restaurant filled with contaminated equipment.

464
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:25,630
This is the third item we need to make sure our contaminated equipment is clean.

465
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:30,520
This is huge. This is such a huge problem. You need to wash runs and sanitize.

466
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:34,239
Wash gets rid of the bacteria. Well, you know, get rid of the bacteria.

467
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:40,059
But the grunge, the grime, the dirt, the rust, the whatever, but the sanitizing really kills the bacteria.

468
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:45,760
Right. There's like a five log reduction required by sanitization, either with chemicals or heat.

469
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:54,520
Very simple. It's just a process that we have to do. And I think more and more of us are doing that now in our kitchens than ever before,

470
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:59,500
which is great, you know, wiping down our kitchen sinks and door handles and that type of thing.

471
00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:04,720
Contaminated equipment. This is a good example of contaminated equipment.

472
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:11,319
This is pretty famous. This is this design of a slicer was ubiquitous.

473
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:17,379
It was everywhere. Okay. And then they realized if you took off the handle, you could see the underside of the handle.

474
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:24,850
There is all that grunge there. The design was all wrong and it was there was no seal and there was no protected.

475
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:30,610
So items would go in and then you couldn't wash it, wouldn't wash it routinely.

476
00:49:31,190 --> 00:49:38,019
So the classic example is there was a deli where I think about 35 people got sick and what happened

477
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:45,100
over a period of months because they would wash and sanitize the equipment at the end of the night.

478
00:49:45,430 --> 00:49:51,430
And then the next day they'd come in, you know, and if you wash and sanitize equipment,

479
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:56,650
it will drip when you're done and then it just sort of drops, right?

480
00:49:56,650 --> 00:50:00,790
And if you walk, you walk away. It drips a little. It dries well.

481
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:06,490
They make the cuts of meat the next day. Whatever landed in that drain dripping with it contaminated.

482
00:50:06,490 --> 00:50:10,570
And then first people wait that they would get, you know, salmonella poisoning.

483
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:15,790
So, yeah, it's just that's I mean, these are the weird things that can happen.

484
00:50:16,970 --> 00:50:21,590
So. Got it. Got to get that equipment clear and you have to make sure the equipment can be cleaned.

485
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:28,760
So if you have equipment that seems like it cannot be properly cleaned, there should not be equipment that should be in your facility.

486
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:39,370
Okay. For personal hygiene, you want to make sure that you don't have pizza made by this guy.

487
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:44,070
Okay. Is that those hands are not something you want touching your dough.

488
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:50,080
You need to go ahead and make sure that people wash their hands, wash their hand, wash their hands and wear the gloves.

489
00:50:51,430 --> 00:50:55,740
So your hand contact is prohibited. Don't abuse the gloves.

490
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:57,490
The gloves are hugely important.

491
00:50:57,820 --> 00:51:03,910
But I find it all the time where people will start to go into the bathroom with their gloves still on or they're eating.

492
00:51:03,910 --> 00:51:07,960
You know, they've gone to their lunch. Now they're sitting down and they're eating with their gloves on.

493
00:51:08,530 --> 00:51:12,820
Gloves are not there to protect them. They're there to protect us.

494
00:51:13,210 --> 00:51:22,600
So, you know, there are a lot of rules set in place, but managerial control can help to go ahead and prevent those types of accidents from happening.

495
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:26,140
We talked a little bit about employee health before.

496
00:51:27,550 --> 00:51:35,560
This is one of the huge items that, you know, with norovirus, I think we really, really, really have to focus on on employee health.

497
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:44,020
So, you know, restricting employees that are sick with a sore throat and a fever, excluding them if they are vomiting, diarrhea,

498
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:53,650
jaundice, norovirus, shigella, shiga toxin producing E coli, hepatitis A and some of the salmonella, both a seminal result.

499
00:51:54,310 --> 00:51:57,850
So those are huge problems. Okay.

500
00:51:59,430 --> 00:52:06,240
Is local food safer? Well, that's debatable.

501
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:10,970
This is a cider house in Michigan.

502
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:15,000
Or it was. And this is what it looked like.

503
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:22,380
So this is why we have rules in place. Some of our smaller operators have to do it all.

504
00:52:23,070 --> 00:52:26,740
You know, they have to they have to be their own marketing.

505
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:30,500
They have to be their own labor.

506
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:33,780
They have to be the person who does every single item.

507
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:37,560
And food safety and sometimes food safety ends up last.

508
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:46,290
So this is why we have these rules, so we can go ahead and prevent things from getting out of control, such as this particular Cider House.

509
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:55,230
And here's another example of a local food up in Anchorage in 2005 and 2008.

510
00:52:55,650 --> 00:53:01,770
They had a they had their Grumpy's next to this nice sanctuary for Sandhill Cranes.

511
00:53:01,770 --> 00:53:07,710
The cranes loved it as they could come in and eat the peas, and then they would go ahead and go back to their little sanctuary.

512
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:12,060
It was, you know, it's a win win, right? But not actually.

513
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:15,240
And so what happened was they had the peas.

514
00:53:15,990 --> 00:53:21,059
They didn't label them. You know, they didn't label all of the bags properly,

515
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:27,780
saying the peas had because the people were eating the peas raw and they were contaminated with campylobacter.

516
00:53:28,050 --> 00:53:37,720
And so they did it. And they were also washing the peas, small local provider washing the peas without chlorine in the water.

517
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:41,700
And that chlorine in the water is not to sanitize the peas,

518
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:49,290
but it is to go ahead and try and prevent the water from growing more bacteria once the bacteria gets in there.

519
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:55,950
So the wash water eventually became, you know, contaminated and and were,

520
00:53:55,950 --> 00:54:00,270
you know, would continue to become more contaminated without that chlorine in it.

521
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:09,180
They were able to use molecular subtype and figure out what happened and go ahead and correct all of the defaults.

522
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:17,070
And I'm happy to say that this pea farm and operator is still in operation and they have made many changes.

523
00:54:18,330 --> 00:54:24,400
Okay. Intentional contamination once again here in Washtenaw County.

524
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:28,970
This my favorite. This gentleman was walking around.

525
00:54:28,990 --> 00:54:35,190
You probably heard the story a couple of years ago, maybe five years ago, walking around and spraying a mixture of water hand sanitizer.

526
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:40,680
And I think it was rat poison on the salad bars at Whole Foods admirers around town.

527
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:45,290
So they did prosecute him.

528
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:49,710
They found him. But I mean, it went to multiple locations. And this is this is a problem.

529
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:58,799
You know, we have people that are for some reason going out and, you know, going ahead and potentially contaminating things.

530
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:06,510
He was prosecuted. But I mean, they many of these people have some sort of a an ulterior motive in mind.

531
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:14,670
And if you go ahead and if you've seen any of the documentaries, there's numerous documentaries on the Russian issue out in Oregon.

532
00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:19,680
And I think Netflix had the most recent one and that one had great reviews.

533
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:27,139
The Russians. She they went ahead and they they also poisoned salad bars.

534
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:32,110
But with salmonella. And I think they had like 750 people get sick.

535
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:35,370
They were attempting to overthrow that tab. Yeah, go ahead.

536
00:55:35,930 --> 00:55:44,659
Oh, I just thought, like, why are like buffet style and salad bars allowed if you can't you can't control for

537
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:51,020
people also following proper hygiene when they get food and that and alcohol issue,

538
00:55:51,050 --> 00:56:00,800
too. Yes, it is. Public health is not 100% safety.

539
00:56:01,310 --> 00:56:10,820
Okay. Our health also takes into mind culture and practices of your particular, you know, your particular community.

540
00:56:11,270 --> 00:56:23,000
And food is a huge part of that. So it is you know, we have with face, you know, in our in our personal parties and that type of thing.

541
00:56:23,450 --> 00:56:27,800
And it's just kind of an extension, I believe, of that.

542
00:56:28,730 --> 00:56:33,320
I buffets did obviously go away during this whole event and I think a few of them have come back.

543
00:56:33,530 --> 00:56:38,450
But it is it is a safety issue. It can be contaminated, though, right?

544
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:43,399
You know, right in the factory, too. So, you know, you have a good point, though.

545
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:49,700
I mean, it seems. Go ahead. And do they figure out why he was contaminated, the salad bars?

546
00:56:50,510 --> 00:56:53,990
Oh, yeah. The Russian issue. Yeah. So sorry about that.

547
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:57,350
Um, I need to drink water myself. Just perfect time.

548
00:56:57,510 --> 00:57:03,050
You know, the Russian is. She was contaminating the salad bars because they wanted to take over the local government,

549
00:57:03,530 --> 00:57:11,389
and they wanted to go ahead and make everyone sick and take over the government, you know, because people wouldn't be able to vote.

550
00:57:11,390 --> 00:57:16,670
And then all of the Russian issues followers would go in and vote their people into the local government.

551
00:57:16,950 --> 00:57:20,480
It did not end up working, but yeah, it was. Yeah.

552
00:57:20,690 --> 00:57:28,399
So that was that was actual bioterrorism in an attempt to take over government, which is pretty spectacular.

553
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:31,950
Just think about it. Okay.

554
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:36,670
But to speak to your question about why do we feel sorry?

555
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:47,989
Why do we allow people to go ahead and. It is still a virus and I don't know, 100%.

556
00:57:47,990 --> 00:57:55,070
No, but I think you have patients do what you can.

557
00:57:55,610 --> 00:58:00,750
Maybe don't go ahead and do that. But yeah, I mean, that gentleman did do that.

558
00:58:00,770 --> 00:58:11,270
I have I have seen people reach into the salad bar and grab the food with their fingers or, you know, I mean, the utensil is it's right there.

559
00:58:11,610 --> 00:58:17,990
I think you just. So I don't I don't understand that aspect of of what people are thinking.

560
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:23,020
That seems pretty deliberate, but it could. Honest to God happen.

561
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:27,360
I don't see that actually happening. So that's all I have today.

562
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:33,360
Crazy. Okay. Any more questions?

563
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:40,000
Go ahead. So for like smaller produce companies like you were talking about.

564
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:46,139
Is there any government support for them to focus on food safety from that?

565
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:50,910
Just like a I mean, obviously, food safety is a fake production.

566
00:58:51,510 --> 00:58:56,790
Is there any sort of like tax benefits or financial support?

567
00:58:57,060 --> 00:59:02,430
There are some supports out there. So the local extension office will provide training.

568
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:05,470
There's a lot of groups that do provide training on food safety.

569
00:59:05,490 --> 00:59:11,730
They will help you go ahead and get together your your your plan, your food safety program.

570
00:59:12,030 --> 00:59:21,509
There are groups that have combined to go ahead and have like group gap, good agricultural practices.

571
00:59:21,510 --> 00:59:30,389
They will they will combine together and help each other, like the campus farm works at a group situation with other groups,

572
00:59:30,390 --> 00:59:39,810
other farms, so that they can different costs and not have to pay thousands of dollars for inspections each year, that type of thing.

573
00:59:40,110 --> 00:59:46,410
So there are methods out there, and I'm sure there are grants also.

574
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:53,040
But yeah, but once you become a little bit larger farm, some of those start to fall away, you know,

575
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:59,580
depending on, you know, how much they divide up by, how much gross you have in product each year.

576
00:59:59,580 --> 01:00:02,909
It just seems a little bit more of like Monopoly style.

577
01:00:02,910 --> 01:00:09,270
That's why we have so few larger products that it is.

578
01:00:09,270 --> 01:00:16,379
And it also it makes it easier to just do one crop as well, you know,

579
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:21,180
as opposed to numerous crops because one crop is easier to manage on a food safety plan,

580
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:26,100
even though when it comes to the environment, that may not be the best route to travel.

581
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:35,070
But so sustainability and food safety has to work really hard to work hand in hand because,

582
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:40,049
you know, if you just follow the rules on each one, then they don't seem to mesh.

583
01:00:40,050 --> 01:00:43,860
So it does take a lot of work and effort to make those two work together.

584
01:00:44,730 --> 01:00:50,900
Go ahead. So this may be a silly question, but I was a personal trainer and so most of my clients would tell me that they'd get their like

585
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:56,160
fresh produce from Amish markets and we would have one like not too far from where I live.

586
01:00:57,120 --> 01:01:00,989
Do you know what the regulatory processes are like selling mushrooms?

587
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:09,460
Are they similar to like regular? Because I know like they, I don't know, they just have like a different means of like some of these.

588
01:01:09,660 --> 01:01:15,840
So, you know, if they're going to sell to, you know, they're going to follow all of the laws, right?

589
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:21,010
So if they're going to sell to, you know. You know, grocery stores or anything like that.

590
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:28,250
They're going to have to go ahead and make the grocery store a separate requirements and then the laws that are required otherwise.

591
01:01:28,270 --> 01:01:35,170
So like I said before, it's a it's based on how much money they make.

592
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:42,610
So, you know, the smaller producers don't have as many regulatory requirements to follow.

593
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:46,730
They just, you know, they just don't. And then as they get larger and larger, they do.

594
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:54,040
So the Amish would fall under that same guideline. Now, when you when you go to a farmer's market, then you also have to go ahead.

595
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:58,300
And if you're producing something, you have to be inspected.

596
01:01:58,690 --> 01:02:00,760
You know, farmer's markets at what as well.

597
01:02:01,030 --> 01:02:07,509
If they're, say, producing chickens, you know, they're going to have to meet the requirements for, you know, eggs or something like that.

598
01:02:07,510 --> 01:02:13,240
And so, again, it would be the same type of requirements. Yes, go ahead.

599
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:26,280
Why do you think that there isn't sort of more focus on post harvest and why has it been changed if we've seen, you know, like the issues like this?

600
01:02:28,180 --> 01:02:39,790
Well, I think that I really honestly think that it was a struggle to get food safety into our culture,

601
01:02:39,970 --> 01:02:42,470
you know, into our food products in the first place.

602
01:02:42,490 --> 01:02:52,810
And it's I think that that's where the focus came in initially and then back in, you know, what, 1906 or whatever when when they created those laws.

603
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:57,790
That's where the focus was. That's where the power was, and that's where they knew that they could control it.

604
01:02:58,120 --> 01:03:00,670
And I think that that's where the focus has remained.

605
01:03:00,970 --> 01:03:10,240
I also think that there's a lot of lobbying on the part of the producers to go ahead and continue to keep status quo, you know,

606
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:19,330
because they can save a lot of money by keeping things the way that they are rather than having to incorporate these changes that are very costly.

607
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:28,599
You know, these food safety changes, like, you know, having only, you know, 14 flocks a year instead of 24 flocks,

608
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:35,530
you know, a year because they have to, you know, clean the coop, you know, clean the coop and leave it empty for a while.

609
01:03:35,530 --> 01:03:43,629
And all of those things that it was all cost money and it's just cheaper for them to go ahead and have someone else to worry about on the other end.

610
01:03:43,630 --> 01:03:47,770
On the post-harvest. Yes.

611
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:56,610
I also have a question regarding the post-harvest of vegetables, because I have because you said that there is no kill stuff after the post harvest.

612
01:03:56,910 --> 01:04:05,040
But because I have worked in the food factory in China who produces the salads and sandwiches for 7-Eleven stores,

613
01:04:05,370 --> 01:04:14,540
and they would use the sodium hypochlorite account to sanitize the vegetables before they make up the sandwiches.

614
01:04:14,550 --> 01:04:18,660
So do people do that too in the US?

615
01:04:19,290 --> 01:04:22,980
Well, they will they will use some of that. But there's a concern there.

616
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:25,139
And well and it's it's true.

617
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:33,870
It doesn't always work because of all the notes and crannies and you know, and in a vegetable, you can't get every surface right.

618
01:04:34,650 --> 01:04:38,780
I mean, unless you're talking about a practice that I'm unaware of.

619
01:04:38,790 --> 01:04:42,270
So they're using that. They're using bleach, sodium hypochlorite.

620
01:04:42,310 --> 01:04:45,420
Right. And they're, you know, they're using it in the wash water.

621
01:04:45,630 --> 01:04:51,810
Yeah. Yeah. So they. Yeah. So they. They can't kill everything on the fruits and vegetables because they they've tried.

622
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:54,059
And so they do use it.

623
01:04:54,060 --> 01:05:02,190
It is required in the post-harvest to go ahead and wash with that, you know, and stuff, but it just doesn't kill everything and that's the problem.

624
01:05:02,370 --> 01:05:06,870
But I think that we see more of our larger produce outbreaks in situations like the

625
01:05:06,870 --> 01:05:13,290
Romaine pictures I showed you where there is obviously no requirement for using that.

626
01:05:13,650 --> 01:05:17,250
So are you using the bleach to wash with because they're not washing it?

627
01:05:17,250 --> 01:05:22,470
So in the U.S. they don't wash all lettuce that's produced and sold.

628
01:05:22,740 --> 01:05:26,820
Sometimes they leave that to the consumer to go ahead and do that or the restaurant to do that.

629
01:05:27,330 --> 01:05:29,530
Thank you. That's interesting. Thank you for telling me.

630
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:38,040
So I know with like medications, like medical devices, if they're starting to have problems, they don't have to issue a recall.

631
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:42,020
They can just quietly fall on the shelves. Is that true?

632
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:46,350
The food industry, too, are any required when you find a problem to actually make a public recall?

633
01:05:47,010 --> 01:05:50,730
I don't know the answer to that. That's a very good question.

634
01:05:51,390 --> 01:05:54,540
I, I am not aware.

635
01:05:54,540 --> 01:06:02,010
I think that they I think that it's pretty well watched. And I'm not sure that they would necessarily get away with a quiet recall.

636
01:06:03,130 --> 01:06:06,610
But so what's interesting, though, about the metaphor.

637
01:06:06,850 --> 01:06:09,040
So do they quietly pull those?

638
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:16,140
Let's say they went Tylenol when they had to I to find me back in the 1980s, like Johnson Johnson's first thing was like,

639
01:06:16,150 --> 01:06:21,010
we'll just quietly pull that off the shelves just in case there's a problem that's our fault.

640
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:27,640
Without benefits, instead of actually an issue, they had to publicly make a statement, but they're not wired.

641
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:32,320
Oh do you? It's pretty self. Okay.

642
01:06:33,060 --> 01:06:42,240
So I know that prior to the 2011 Food Safety Modernization Act, there was a lot of issues because I don't think the FDA could require.

643
01:06:42,420 --> 01:06:46,470
Right. You know, similar to that, they couldn't require anyone to pull anything off.

644
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:51,000
And then now they can require but they use that sparingly.

645
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:59,940
So I feel like FDA, I mean, they're the ones that monitor all of the, you know, medical equipment and stuff also.

646
01:06:59,950 --> 01:07:07,109
So I feel like they there's enough watchdogs out there watching it happen.

647
01:07:07,110 --> 01:07:11,040
But I don't know. Here's the question I can ask.

648
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:16,679
Janine was one of our listeners was an avid nutritionals and she works with the FDA.

649
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:26,130
And I thought I remember her saying on Monday that now the FDA has the capability to issue mandates, you know, mandatory recalls.

650
01:07:26,370 --> 01:07:30,840
But I have to I'll reach out to her and just ask you, what is clarity on?

651
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:39,000
Yeah, I'd love to hear that because I think that was one of the big issues is FDA just didn't have the muscle to be able to do that.

652
01:07:39,340 --> 01:07:46,170
You said it was you know, they had to say to the companies, you need to cut the company so long.

653
01:07:46,420 --> 01:07:51,260
I think this is interchange that has gotten off the board, right?

654
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:54,660
Yeah. Yeah. Because it's it's been a very slow change.

655
01:07:54,770 --> 01:07:59,040
Yes. Thank you, everyone. I just have one more question.

656
01:07:59,550 --> 01:08:03,390
Just this is a fun question. What's like the worst thing you've ever seen?

657
01:08:06,330 --> 01:08:12,080
Please tell us about it. Well, I'm trying to think and I'm I'm at a loss.

658
01:08:12,090 --> 01:08:15,420
Oh, I remember now. No, it was not.

659
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:19,590
No. So and I mean, it was just I guess it just grossed me out.

660
01:08:19,590 --> 01:08:24,480
It was an awful lot of pain. I had a couple of things, you know,

661
01:08:26,730 --> 01:08:35,610
but the one that grossed me out the most was I walked into the cutting counter and grocery store right out of state.

662
01:08:35,620 --> 01:08:41,399
I was working in Alaska and I walk into it and I walk in there and I and I tell the gentleman, I'm like, Hi, I'm your health inspector.

663
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:44,160
I'm here to inspect the case, his finger on his nose,

664
01:08:44,490 --> 01:08:49,629
and he leans over the garbage can and he doesn't snot rocket right into the garbage right in front of me.

665
01:08:49,630 --> 01:08:54,720
He did it in the garbage. I know it stands up and he, like, grabs his equipment to go back to work.

666
01:08:54,720 --> 01:09:00,420
And I'm like, I know this is now a cancer, but no, that reminds me of one that was even worse.

667
01:09:00,930 --> 01:09:06,600
So this is art fair walking around an art fair here in town.

668
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:12,450
And this guy, you know, he was he was working in the tent and he's, you know, he's chopping vegetables and all this stuff.

669
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:14,790
And I have to go do some other tents.

670
01:09:14,790 --> 01:09:22,199
And I come back and he's taken his break and I walk by and he's got his fingers so far up his nose, he was scratching his brain.

671
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:26,879
And I'm like, I'm horrified. There's tissues nearby, his awareness, his everything.

672
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:30,990
I still got everything on all of his, you know, as his apron, the whole deal.

673
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:36,340
I was, you know, oh, just £20.

674
01:09:36,450 --> 01:09:42,560
So yeah. Yeah. Know all the for that one.

675
01:09:42,990 --> 01:09:45,450
Anyway, so it's time to take a quick question.

676
01:09:45,570 --> 01:09:56,150
When you and dining has been collaborating with local farmers, were you involved in, say, harvest from the farm how to and dining heavily?

677
01:09:56,160 --> 01:10:03,719
I was very heavily involved with that. So when I'm dining first wanted to purchase from local suppliers,

678
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:09,930
they went ahead and they they initially initiated and said, we're going to buy from, you know, this guy.

679
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:18,719
This guy showed up with like 30 boxes and dirty boots and he's walking through their, you know, through their dining halls with all this stuff.

680
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:21,780
And they said, this is working for us. Right.

681
01:10:21,780 --> 01:10:22,920
You know, they they told me about it.

682
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:30,660
So we put together a group and we decided, you know, we looked at all of the regulations and in which there weren't any at that point in time.

683
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:34,920
And we went out and we looked at the farms that we were potentially purchasing from.

684
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:38,909
And there was, you know, one strawberry farm that didn't have any work for anyone to wash their hands.

685
01:10:38,910 --> 01:10:43,170
After they used to use the Port of Johnson thing, they were gone.

686
01:10:44,130 --> 01:10:48,570
And then we went ahead and talked to the state of Michigan about this good agricultural practices.

687
01:10:48,990 --> 01:10:58,140
And that's how we learned. We wanted to go ahead and require, you know, these third party audits that did look at worker health, safety,

688
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:07,590
that looked at the irrigation and the soil amendments that were being put in place would require that they get this third party audit each year.

689
01:11:07,770 --> 01:11:12,569
We received the results of that and they passed their third party audit each year.

690
01:11:12,570 --> 01:11:18,060
So they cannot sell for the sale to the university if they do not do mine.

691
01:11:18,330 --> 01:11:21,390
Yeah, they do not do those things. So yes, absolutely.

692
01:11:21,630 --> 01:11:25,650
I would think that would be a motivating factor. It is an it isn't.

693
01:11:25,650 --> 01:11:28,800
So it's telling on the size of. Yes. The exact.

694
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:33,790
We have a couple of a couple of farmers that started with us and looking at this farm as well.

695
01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:39,100
So we have lesser the lesser apples out in Chelsea.

696
01:11:39,430 --> 01:11:45,280
They've been with us for, you know, ten or 15 years. And, you know, then getting their third party outs and doing this also,

697
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:53,440
it's how this shows up and how well they're introducing leafy greens and melons and all sorts of stuff for us for years and years and years, you know.

698
01:11:53,710 --> 01:12:01,530
So and then the campus farm came along a little bit more recently, and they have also been you know, they're in that group camp where they,

699
01:12:01,540 --> 01:12:06,399
you know, they go ahead and have others come in and help them with their get audits and everything.

700
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:10,540
But yeah, so it's it's been a process for all of us to learn.

701
01:12:10,930 --> 01:12:14,169
There's just so much more to it that, you know, it's,

702
01:12:14,170 --> 01:12:21,639
it's and it's easier just to go buy from a Cisco or one of these large production

703
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:26,770
companies than it is to go ahead and and try and work with these smaller farmers.

704
01:12:26,770 --> 01:12:35,050
So it's really been a process for em dining to retrain all of their, you know, ordering staff and everyone to work with these smaller groups.

705
01:12:36,110 --> 01:12:46,209
But it's been worth it. It has been. It just goes to show, you know, you in discussions of, oh, why can't we just collaborate with local farmers?

706
01:12:46,210 --> 01:12:54,190
And this is a great illustration or of why it's far more complicated in to than just saying, sure,

707
01:12:54,730 --> 01:13:02,290
we'll buy from so-and-so and yeah, it is it's extremely it's it's it's it's really great on the surface.

708
01:13:02,290 --> 01:13:05,979
It does take a lot of work to try, you know, because we have to meet their needs to,

709
01:13:05,980 --> 01:13:11,110
we have to purchase food when it's, you know, fresh and available.

710
01:13:11,410 --> 01:13:17,379
Well, we don't have students on campus that, you know, so, you know, we they may not be a good waring.

711
01:13:17,380 --> 01:13:20,510
We may not be a good fit for them either. Okay.

712
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:35,920
All right. Thanks. Okay.

713
01:13:37,150 --> 01:13:44,500
Just very quickly, I hope you're getting started looking for health statistics again.

714
01:13:45,770 --> 01:13:52,479
But if you haven't started looking for health statistics, there's the set of slides all under course resources,

715
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:57,970
a set of slides, and next to it text about where the accompanying Panopto recording is.

716
01:13:58,810 --> 01:14:06,790
At the end of the week, I will post a set of slides and an accompanying Panopto for looking for nutrition stats.

717
01:14:07,180 --> 01:14:14,290
That's there's not there's not a lot. So that's going to be a very small component of your report.

718
01:14:14,650 --> 01:14:27,670
So I will be here for five, 10 minutes if anybody has questions of any aspect of your report, U.S. Census Bureau help and so forth.

719
01:14:27,870 --> 01:14:32,139
Okay. Because of the time I'm going to wait till Monday,

720
01:14:32,140 --> 01:14:40,600
there are a few sort of overarching themes that Liz and I saw with the background section that I just want to go over,

721
01:14:41,380 --> 01:14:47,950
as well as with the drafts that you submitted. Just some pointers to elevate your writing.

722
01:14:47,950 --> 01:14:57,280
All of you as professionals, you will want to spend the next few years elevating your writing, right, just to further that professional skill set.

723
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:03,999
So Liz spent quite a bit of time providing your feedback and I tried to do that on your drafts,

724
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:12,520
and I'm going to share sort of what we sort of saw that will help you skill sets, right?

725
01:15:12,610 --> 01:15:16,989
So I'll do that on Monday and maybe a little bit on Wednesday.

726
01:15:16,990 --> 01:15:20,180
So I don't overload you too much yet.

727
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:25,240
Have a great rest of the week. Yeah, I will see you on Monday with food labeling.

728
01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:34,317
That not here. I will say, I think.
