1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:07,710
So I think, although I may be very wrong, that we might we may end early today.

2
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:15,420
But don't quote me on that, because the in-class activity actually tends to take a little bit of time.

3
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:21,060
We're not going to do quite the whole thing today because some of the study designs haven't been presented yet.

4
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,920
So we'll see how that goes. All right.

5
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:31,980
So we've been talking about case control studies and now we're going to go into the different case control designs that we have.

6
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:38,310
So the one that we've kind of we've seen already throughout this lecture is called the Cumulative Case Control Study.

7
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:47,820
Controls are selected from the proportion of the population that remains disease free at that being,

8
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:55,530
you know, at the time that you're knowing the cases. It violates the study based principle that controls are not at risk of getting the disease.

9
00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:02,790
And we'll show that in the diagram in just a second. This is the most common case control design prior to 1970.

10
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:07,530
So when you if you reading older papers, they probably won't call it a cumulative case control.

11
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:10,649
In fact, newer papers may not call it a cumulative case control either.

12
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,610
So you have to pay a lot of attention to how they tell you that they're enrolling cases.

13
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:19,700
But, you know, this was almost exclusively used prior to 1917.

14
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:28,320
And we start seeing these other case control designs come. In this case, control design is still very commonly used and outbreak situations.

15
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:35,460
If you read a lot of the very early sars-cov2 to literature, you'll see a lot of cumulative case controls occurring at that time.

16
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:41,250
So this is what it looks like, right? We've got kind of our hypothetical cohort.

17
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:48,389
All these figures are from schooling and we need to own our tissue and put down there.

18
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:57,110
But I do not. But you've got this hypothetical cohort, but we're enrolling our cases at this point in time, basically a single point in time.

19
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,300
It's not just incident cases, which is prevalent cases. Right.

20
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:06,720
And at that same time, we enrolled the controls because we're enrolling the controls here, they can't become cases.

21
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:14,880
Right. Because you're kind of into your study right there. Cumulative case control designs have this kind of rare disease assumption.

22
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:26,500
So. Basically kind of saying that the odds ratio is going to approximate the relative risk if the disease is rare.

23
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:33,550
So here kind of remember, we are collecting from what we're going to go through why that's the case.

24
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:36,940
But remember, we're selecting from this like hypothetical cohort, right?

25
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,370
So here we've got this kind of total people that we're selecting B and D from.

26
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:45,700
But this is like what we actually have in a case control study.

27
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:54,220
So we're selecting our controls as some fraction of the overall kind of hypothetical cohort.

28
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:04,680
So basically, B, there's some fraction of this total number, minus eight, right?

29
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:11,259
Because our cases are not eligible to be controlled. And then D is a fraction of N zero.

30
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:19,750
The person time of the unexposed minus C right is once again are our cases can become controls in this in the setup.

31
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:26,440
All right. So the odds ratio here is going to approximate the relative risk when the disease is rare,

32
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:32,320
a fraction of the exposed and not exposed control groups for the first year.

33
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:38,270
Oh, there we go. Okay. All right.

34
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:45,209
So we've got a fraction of the exposed and unexposed group controls are selected as the cases.

35
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:57,570
Right. So it's just some fraction of, as I said, in one minus a right that's going to give us B and then a fraction of it in zero -0 cases

36
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:05,190
that's going to give us D so we get this a over in one minus A and C over in zero minus C.

37
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:16,020
So if cases have the disease is relatively rare, we're getting approximately a over in one over C over and zero.

38
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:22,229
Right. Do you see that it is actually quite small compared to the overall population.

39
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:32,220
The same thing with C thus so provides a reasonable approximation to the ratio, provided the proportions falling ill in each exposure group are low.

40
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:37,980
I would say generally kind of less than 20%. Some some of the text you'll see them say less than 10%.

41
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,950
Any questions about the cumulative case control? Okay.

42
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:51,960
And that's the one when people think of case control studies, that's immediately what people tend to think of,

43
00:04:53,400 --> 00:05:01,680
not done as commonly anymore, because there are there are certain issues with it, including that it violates the study based principle.

44
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,059
Right. All right.

45
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:11,940
So the density case control controls are a sample of individuals who are at risk for the disease at the time each case develops the disease.

46
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,220
So this is there's two ways to select cases here.

47
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:22,640
So incidence density sampling or risk sampling?

48
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:28,010
Well, so if you think about this, number one, if you downloaded the slides yesterday,

49
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:37,430
they look a little bit different because I was actually kind of using incidence density sampling and research sampling in interchangeably in a way,

50
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:47,180
but they're not really interchangeable, although the textbooks aren't super clear on the differences between the two and some.

51
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:55,010
Some use one terminology or the other, basically for the same sampling scheme, but there there is actually a kind of a specified difference.

52
00:05:55,340 --> 00:06:04,600
So. This is my version for.

53
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:19,100
Oh, it says version four, but it doesn't have my new slides. I'm sorry if you change it to, like, version five.

54
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,549
And I sent you a new one this morning. Remember you said.

55
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,400
Got it. Yeah. Sorry. That's not this one.

56
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:37,110
Okay, we're going to take a mini break for a second and get the right slides up and you a class activity folder.

57
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:38,280
All right.

58
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:50,820
And in the meantime, I'm going to hang out the in-class activity and you can get started if you want on the cohort studies on this activity.

59
00:06:53,880 --> 00:07:00,420
It should have to like colorful slides that differentiate risk sampling incidents, density sampling.

60
00:07:05,270 --> 00:08:05,160
Otherwise I can draw them. But I'm not very. It's.

61
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:27,970
So this is actually a test question when you're a student student and figure out what you actually do when you're doing class activity.

62
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:55,260
The Government decides not to do the cohorts anyways, so go ahead and do the retrospective and prospective cohort studies.

63
00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:01,680
Obviously there's some of these like the asked. You should wait until after the lecture.

64
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:13,900
So. Yeah.

65
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:28,319
I probably forgot to rename it. Sorry about that. Oh, you know, I know what happened was I had made a version for you.

66
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:34,260
Sent me a version for. Oh, I combined them. I don't know.

67
00:11:55,080 --> 00:12:01,200
All right. We'll go ahead and get started, but we'll have more time once they go through all the case control studies to work on this.

68
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:09,999
G. Okay. So density case control studies, so incidence density sampling.

69
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,979
And I would say this is something that like I started to see a little bit more of but still

70
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:21,790
is not that common in individuals that later becomes cases can be selected as controls.

71
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,070
Individuals are sampled with replacement, meaning they can be selected as a control more than once.

72
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:31,960
And it's a weighted random sample with individuals weighted by their person time.

73
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:39,580
So here we have a drawing very similar to what we've seen earlier in the class.

74
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:47,890
Right. For individuals. So the circles here are the cases. We're selecting two controls per case in this particular drawing.

75
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:54,760
And what you'll notice is for each case, we're selecting two controls versus being selected at random points in time.

76
00:12:55,450 --> 00:13:04,529
And we're only selecting from individuals that are currently in health care, actually selecting from everybody.

77
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:09,160
But anyways, it's it's kind of weighted based on the person time that they've contributed to the cohort study.

78
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:12,910
Okay. So that's incidence density sampling.

79
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:15,760
So somebody can be selected here as a control,

80
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:22,930
even though they were no longer in this kind of hypothetical in this cohort at the time that the case occurred.

81
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:26,840
And that's in contrast to risk set sampling. All right.

82
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:33,820
So respect set sampling is what you'll normally see or mostly see when when you see these density case control studies.

83
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:40,960
I was actually when I learned this, I was told that this was like the only way to do it, essentially.

84
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,180
But it is not. All right. So in respect sampling rate, we've got our cases occurring.

85
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:51,580
And at the time that the case occurs, you are enrolling a control.

86
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,820
At that same time, those controls are therefore matched on time.

87
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:02,290
Right. Which wasn't happening in that incidence density sampling.

88
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:06,790
You can do risk sampling in a dynamic population as well.

89
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:14,349
Right. So we've got our new members coming in annual enrolled cases at the controls.

90
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:24,640
At the same time, we're sampling like kind of in the very, very traditional manner.

91
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:31,720
Controls are going to be matched both on calendar time and the duration of follow up that they have.

92
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:39,639
Right. However, what you will often see is they're actually just matched on calendar time and then

93
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:43,480
people will age match them because this doesn't have to be done inside a cohort,

94
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,899
right? It's kind of done inside of a hypothetical cohort.

95
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:52,000
And then, of course, you're not following people for the same amount of time. So you match on age and you match on calendar time.

96
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:56,380
And that's you're roughly matching on the amount of follow up times since somebody at birth

97
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:04,570
with age controls may later develop the disease in this case will be both a control and a case.

98
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:11,290
You don't get rid of them as a control, and controls may be selected more than once as control.

99
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:14,470
So very similar to the incidence density sampling in that.

100
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:21,070
So here's risk sampling with that same sort of diagram just to differentiate between insurance company.

101
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,940
So here, right, we've got that those same cases are occurring,

102
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:33,220
but this time the controls are selected from everybody who is in the cohort at the time that the case occurs.

103
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:40,620
I have a question. Yes. Your slapping controls more than one time.

104
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:45,620
This would be a situation in which, like the disease onset would be relatively short.

105
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,129
I'm just like thinking like a cancer study.

106
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:54,350
Like why once you select a control? Like, why would you select them again?

107
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:01,760
Because it's than you're getting it proportionate to the amount of person time that they're contributing.

108
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:11,450
Right. That's why. But I guess, like typically when you ask folks about cancer exposure, it's like, you know,

109
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:17,419
like it would it changed their sort of response and it wouldn't change between the time that they're selected and control.

110
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:23,360
Like when to like asking about, well, Japan's like they may have started smoking, they may be doing all kinds of different things.

111
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,080
They actually couldn't change it. It depends on what the exposure it is that you're looking at.

112
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,620
Right. There are a lot of exposures that do change over time.

113
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:35,570
And even if there's exposures don't change, you can still in these designs,

114
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:39,770
a feature of it that has to be there is that you can re select the controls again.

115
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:44,660
So controls are always samples with replacement and.

116
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:53,830
So here's an example of a density case control study.

117
00:16:54,460 --> 00:17:00,460
So low to moderate alcohol consumption and breast cancer risk by age 50 years among women in Germany.

118
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:12,670
So cases were 706 were 736 case women whose breast cancer had been newly diagnosed in 1992 to 1995.

119
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:20,500
And then the controls are 1381 residents and age matched controls.

120
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:25,270
Right. And they're getting selected at the same time that each case emerged.

121
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:32,149
So we've got that time matched or the age matching, right?

122
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:38,780
And then we've got the calendar time match because they're your as soon as you identify the case,

123
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:44,090
you want to identify them rapidly and roll out right away and select your controls.

124
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,380
People think they're doing density case control studies sometimes,

125
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:52,730
but they aren't very good at actually rolling out to get their controls because

126
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:57,170
it's more expensive to like do that for recruitment over a longer period of time.

127
00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:00,200
So this is really common in infectious diseases.

128
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:10,639
And and, you know, for any exposures that are time varying or if there's a seasonality to things that can be extremely problematic,

129
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:16,280
you really want those controls to be enrolled. Answer your questions at the same time that the cases occurred.

130
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,910
But it does depend on your main your exposures that you're looking at,

131
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:24,050
but not just your exposure of interest rate, any confounders that you want to include as well.

132
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:29,660
Okay, here's another example.

133
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:34,910
Densification drop controls were selected from random lists of residents supplied by the population.

134
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:42,709
Registries for every recruited patient to controls matched according to exact age in the study region were immediately contacted by letter.

135
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:46,820
I think this is from that other paper from the last example right here.

136
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:51,470
Right. And so just kind of when you're reading a paper, they won't necessarily tell you,

137
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:56,930
you know, this is a density case control study using preset sampling.

138
00:18:56,930 --> 00:19:03,920
Right? So you have to be able to read through it. This one did have it in the title, but read through it and actually pick out those pieces.

139
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:11,510
And sometimes they will tell you this is a, you know, some other study and you read it and you're like, oh, no, this is not a cohort, right?

140
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:15,260
Like you are selecting people based on the outcome of interest.

141
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:25,820
So it's important that you're able to pick out those aspects in manuscripts that will tell you what the design is and how,

142
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:30,140
you know, what individuals were included for this, how controls were selected.

143
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:40,280
All right. So one of the nice things about the density case control study design is that the odds ratio is actually going to approximate the IDR.

144
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,170
Some textbooks will say that you can actually just report in IDR.

145
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,850
There was certainly a period of time where that was super common in the literature.

146
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:54,800
Like what? Like when I was doing my Ph.D., which was between 2005 and 2009,

147
00:19:55,010 --> 00:20:00,500
you see a lot of studies report like this, density case control studies would report an IDR.

148
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,010
They were calculating a moderate ratio, but saying it was an IDR.

149
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:10,160
Obviously, that can become very confusing when you're reading the literature, right, because you're like, wait a minute.

150
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:17,180
But like you're reporting a measure from a cohort study, not one that we would normally get with a case control study.

151
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:24,140
All right. So the primary goal and I'm going to go through why the odds ratio approximates the ideal.

152
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:31,910
The primary goal in case control studies is that the exposure distribution in the controls is the same as the source population.

153
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:34,670
Right. We want to do that for all case control studies.

154
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:42,950
So here we kind of we've got this is our cohort, this is our table from our case control study, right?

155
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:54,979
So it B over D is is equal to person time exposed divided by person type unexposed or if the ratio is the same,

156
00:20:54,980 --> 00:21:02,030
should be over person time exposure is equal to d over person time unexposed.

157
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:09,290
Then you can get this control sampling rate, right? So we get b over person time one exposure sorry.

158
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:18,409
And over time unexposed are the control sampling rate for this study design we use our and this is in modern EPA.

159
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:25,940
I'm trying to use their standard note of nature. So the number of control selected per unit of person time is basically what that is.

160
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:32,510
Right. So it then the distribution of the exposure in the controls is,

161
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:38,330
is going to be representative of the distribution of the exposure in the cohort person time.

162
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:53,450
All right. So remember, the incidence density is going to be equal to exposed individuals a over person.

163
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:57,170
The cases over the person time and the exposed individuals, the exposed cases,

164
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:05,930
the incidence density in the unexposed individuals is going to be the number of cases of unexposed individuals divided by the person.

165
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:08,750
Time in the unexposed should all look familiar.

166
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:21,970
So you can use these pseudo rates A over B and C over D as kind of substitutions, and we'll go through how how we do that.

167
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:25,340
So one thing to note, the pseudo rates have no interpretation on their own,

168
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:30,800
but if we know the sampling rate, then we can do some things with them, right?

169
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:39,920
If the sampling rate is so, if we know the sampling rate, you can actually calculate out the and the incidence density, the actual rates.

170
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:44,810
Right. If you don't have the sampling rate, this is still useful.

171
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:48,950
And the reason for that is we're going to just do a little bit of a math trick here.

172
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,850
We're going to divide by the person unexposed and multiply by the person time exposed.

173
00:22:53,180 --> 00:23:00,230
Doing the same thing here for DX. Right. We're dividing by the person time unexposed and multiplying by the person time exposed.

174
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:02,840
Obviously these would just cancel out. Right. Which is why we can do that.

175
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:08,540
And what you see is we get this B over person time exposed and D over person time unexposed.

176
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:13,100
Right. Which I already told you. Last slide is our rate, the sampling rate.

177
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:27,320
So we've got a the number of exposed cases divided by the sampling rate times the person time exposed divided by C divided by our times,

178
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:32,850
the person time unexposed. Right, the sampling rate for for the first time unexposed.

179
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:40,400
So we end up as the sampling is the same, we end up with a over person time exposed divided by C over person time unexposed.

180
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:44,120
What is that formula? The air.

181
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:48,220
Right. That's the formula for the I.D. Your. Okay.

182
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:57,520
So if the ratio of the shooter rates for the exposed in the exposed is going to be an estimate of the IDR provided,

183
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,610
the control sampling rate is independent of exposure.

184
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:06,250
Right. And remember, that's one of the things that we have to do for our case control study is make sure that the control

185
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:10,780
sampling rate is independent of exposure because we're already selecting them on the are their outcome.

186
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,100
We absolutely do not want to be also selecting them based on their exposure.

187
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:23,720
Right. Ah cancels out maverick or cancels out and we end up with the IDR.

188
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:32,720
So this is why the odds ratio here A over B, over C, over D is approximately equal to the ADR.

189
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:46,680
Okay. So with density sampling or risk sampling, the lower the odds ratio approximates the IDR.

190
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:50,400
So with no rare disease assumption needed.

191
00:24:55,780 --> 00:25:01,450
And I already mentioned this verbally. But if the sampling rates are now, and if you happen to know your sampling rates,

192
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:09,009
then you can actually calculate out the person time and the exposed group and the person time,

193
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:15,700
the unexposed group, which means you can actually get to the incidence density or the incidence in this population.

194
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:30,060
All right. So that is an incidence density, high density case control study.

195
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:36,660
So we've got a a nested case control study.

196
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:42,870
Nested case control study is going to be a density case control study that's nested inside of a cohort study.

197
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:49,440
Controls are going to be a random sample of individuals remaining in the cohort at the time that the case occurs,

198
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:59,610
which is risk sampling or selected from all cohort participants and weighted by disease free person time incidence density sampling.

199
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:03,659
Right can be done either way. It's going to require a matched analysis, right?

200
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:09,870
Because we're matching people on time and we're picking out one or more controls per individual case.

201
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:16,290
We will go over matched analysis later. Right. But you need to remember that it requires a match analysis.

202
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:19,530
Now, just don't have to know how to do that. All right.

203
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:29,040
So here's an example of a nested case control study. Risk factors for skin cancers, a nested case control study within the nurses health study.

204
00:26:30,120 --> 00:27:09,479
I'll give you a second to read this out loud to you. And this study should sound familiar, right?

205
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:13,050
Because it's one of the studies I went over earlier.

206
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:43,050
And I believe constitutional susceptibility there is like asking about how well you can

207
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:50,459
essentially another might be this paper or maybe another paper that goes into more detail,

208
00:27:50,460 --> 00:28:00,240
which is really interesting because people will change their answer about how well they can like kind of pre and post the skin cancer diagnosis.

209
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:05,910
Right. So they'll perceive they'll they'll they'll say they exam better before they have a

210
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:11,460
skin cancer diagnosis and then will will report lower tanning ability afterwards,

211
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:17,520
which is, I guess not surprising but interesting.

212
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:24,680
All right. So why perform a case control study inside a cohort?

213
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:28,670
Well, there are lots of reasons to do this right.

214
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:36,110
We might do it because usually because additional information that was not obtained or measured for the whole cohort is needed.

215
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:40,820
So exposure assessment is expensive. We don't want to do it on everybody.

216
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:48,649
It doesn't make sense to do it on everybody. Right. When we've got bank samples that can be tested.

217
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:50,570
Right, because if we can't go back to those samples.

218
00:28:52,340 --> 00:29:01,010
And it also might be because there are really labor intensive data collection activities such as data abstraction for medical or occupational records.

219
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:09,140
And you don't really need everybody in the cohort. Right? You can get enough power by just selecting a certain number of controls per case.

220
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:17,390
The other reason to do this, which is not up here, but like we've done it several times recently and I have a new appreciation for it,

221
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:25,849
is if you for some reason need to march very firmly on time or on a lot or or you would

222
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:31,460
have to adjust for a lot of different factors would be super complicated to do so.

223
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:36,700
In that case, you might choose to do a nested case control study.

224
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:40,940
So one of the one of the reasons we did this one time was that although, you know,

225
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:45,770
you've probably heard at some point that if you get flu, you're you could be predisposed to pneumonia.

226
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:48,920
Right. This is kind of like a a fact in my field, at least,

227
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:58,190
nobody had actually ever looked at to really figure out or how long is that time period, actually.

228
00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:02,210
Right. Like when, you know, for how long are you at increased risk of pneumonia?

229
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:08,080
The problem is that the seasonality of influenza and the seasonality of pneumonia are very similar,

230
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:13,160
you know, so you need to like deal with that correlation and it as well.

231
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:16,100
And so we, we ended up doing a nested case control study for that.

232
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:21,649
Another reason we did it one time, which was not that we had to go back to a bunch of samples.

233
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:28,049
We actually had all the data, right? So we tried doing it in like kind of age, just analyzing the cohort.

234
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:30,950
And then we tried some modeling and we tried all kinds of things.

235
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,460
And then I actually just I was like, Why don't you just do a nested case control study?

236
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:43,280
Like, these are all like, from the stag. It's like pretty complicated, all the things that we want to match on.

237
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:47,540
It was for dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue or severe dengue.

238
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:53,030
Right. So when you get dengue fever, once you get sick quite often, but not that sick.

239
00:30:53,030 --> 00:31:00,620
But the second time or third time you get dengue fever, there can be something called antibody dependent enhancement where your antibodies,

240
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:09,110
in fact don't protect you, your preexisting antibodies to the other type of dengue, but put you at risk for hemorrhaging going into shock and death.

241
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:16,310
And we wanted to look at, is there a level of antibodies where you're at higher risk rate?

242
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:24,260
Because then theoretically, you could test people and say, like, oh, you should be okay, versus like you're at high risk because what happens?

243
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:28,969
So after the disease in children in a lot of settings and as a parent you know

244
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:33,620
your kid's really sick and then their fever breaks and they seem better,

245
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:39,140
you know, and you're feeling great about it. And then they go to bed and you go in in the morning and you can't wake them up.

246
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:47,000
Right. Because that the severe dengue and going into shock, all of that stuff tends to happen after the fever breaks.

247
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:51,380
Once the kids start to look like they're feeling better and then adults as well.

248
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:58,430
Right. And so having some sort of test that could tell you who was at heightened risk would be would be very valuable.

249
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:08,660
But anyways, there were so many factors that we had to take into account timing, the sequence of dengue, the spacing between them,

250
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:13,760
all of these things that the only way we could figure out to do it was actually to do a

251
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:20,510
match analysis for your matching on a lot of different factors and doing case control study.

252
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:26,030
So there can be other reasons for doing these as well. And you'll see them sometimes in the literature.

253
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:33,020
There's always a preference in a cohort study if you have all the data to use all the data, right.

254
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:38,900
But there can be reasons that that's really not possible with the methods we have right now,

255
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:42,690
or at least the methods we were able to use at the time and had knowledge of.

256
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:55,550
All right. So case cohort studies, a case cohort study controls are randomly selected from a defined cohort with which the study began.

257
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:03,620
Controls are not going to be individually matched to cases, so you don't have to do a matched analysis, but it is a different type of analysis.

258
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:10,700
You can calculate incidence rates because you've got the sampling fraction, because you determine that at the beginning of the study.

259
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:18,680
And it's especially valuable when the exposure is difficult or expensive to assess, for example, a genetic exposure.

260
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:25,610
One note in all of the textbooks I recommended in the readings.

261
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:35,090
This is called a case cohort study. Recently, there's been a little bit of a move to call this a case based design.

262
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:44,870
And when they talk about a case court, the individuals who call this that have a different design that they're talking about with a case cohort study,

263
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:47,290
we are not going to go into that other situation.

264
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:53,660
So for the purposes of this class, which I think a majority of the field still agrees on, this is a case cohort study.

265
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:58,010
This matches what are in the various textbooks for this class.

266
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,780
All right. So a case cohort study. Right.

267
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:10,729
We've got our cases that emerge in the cohort are controls, are enrolled, you know, are selected from everybody.

268
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:14,870
That was at the beginning of the cohort. Right.

269
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:25,330
So controls in case cohort designs, they can become cases and they can serve as a control group for different sets of cases.

270
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:28,430
So different outcomes. That's a big plus of this design.

271
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:33,560
You can select them immediately at the start of a study. It's another big plus.

272
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:43,820
The same set of controls can be used if followed up. Time is extended so you don't have to go back and and select a new set of controls and you can

273
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:50,000
calculate the prevalence of exposures because they're representative of the entire population.

274
00:34:50,630 --> 00:35:02,810
Tyer cohort. So in a case cohort study, the odds ratio is going to approximate the cumulative incidence ratio here once again.

275
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:06,260
Right. We have our our table for.

276
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:17,110
For a cohort study this time when no account with count data so that we would calculate cumulative incidence rate for that.

277
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:23,390
The cumulative incidence and the exposed is the disease exposed divided by the total person,

278
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:29,389
total number of persons exposed and the cumulative incidence in the unexposed is the

279
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:36,320
disease is the disease unexposed divided by the total number of persons unexposed.

280
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:44,030
Our objective is to select controls that b over in one is equal to D over in zero,

281
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:49,280
meaning that we are not doing something differential by exposure status, right?

282
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:59,419
So we're not selecting on exposure once again. So we can use the frequencies of exposure to unexposed controls as substitutes

283
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:03,080
for the actual denominator of the incidence proportion to obtain pseudo risks.

284
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:10,850
So here we have our pseudo risk again, right? A, over B, over C, over D once again, they're going to have no interpretation on their own.

285
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:23,750
However, if the sampling fraction is known, then B over F is equal to the the so this is the sampling fraction for the controls is equal to the number

286
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:31,040
of persons exposed and d divided by the sampling fraction is equal to the the number of persons unexposed.

287
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,010
So we're basically we're just going to do the same math tricks as before.

288
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:43,850
Right? But now we're using count data, right? So we've got our pseudo rate here.

289
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:52,070
This is our odds ratio, right? We've now divided and multiplied by the number of persons exposed for the exposed cases.

290
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:57,890
For the unexposed cases, we are dividing and multiplying by the number of persons unexposed.

291
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:04,370
This is that sampling fraction which we now call F to call it something different.

292
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:12,679
Right. And that's the same nomenclature you'll see. And Rothman in modern epi is 210 lashes.

293
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:22,909
Now, the first one was actually not called long but in modern epi so we get this a over the sampling fraction times

294
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:29,930
the number of persons exposed divided by C over the sampling production times the number of persons unexposed.

295
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:35,389
Once again that sampling fraction will cancel out and we end up with a over the

296
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:39,020
number of persons exposed divided by C over the number of persons unexposed.

297
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:45,740
And you should hopefully at this point recognize that as the incidence ratio, right?

298
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:50,569
So the ratio of the pseudo risks, A over B or C,

299
00:37:50,570 --> 00:38:00,080
over D for the exposed and unexposed is an estimate of the C.A.R. provided the control sampling fraction is independent of exposure.

300
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:06,880
All right. So benefits of a case cohort study.

301
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:11,100
It allows for the analysis of time. You haven't matched on it.

302
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:19,540
Right. And we can't do it in the other in the risk sampling because we matched on time, the odds ratio approximates the C.A.R.

303
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:24,009
There's no rare disease assumption that's needed like you would in the cumulative

304
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:29,380
case control and then controls can be used for multiple case control studies.

305
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:34,659
So that's why you'll see this done in a lot of really large cohorts when they're looking at genetic factors.

306
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:42,250
Right. Because if you're going to do us on a set of controls, be really nice to use them for a variety of different diseases.

307
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:48,880
The disadvantage of a case cohort study is the overlap between case and control groups.

308
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:55,240
And because of that, you're going to need more controls than in designs where a control cannot become a case.

309
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,780
So a summary of our case control designs.

310
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:06,759
We've got our cumulative design right. That's where we're enrolling the cases and the controls basically at one time.

311
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:14,260
And the odds ratio is going to be approximately equal to the relative risk with the rare disease assumption.

312
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:27,430
And so that's either the IDR or the CR here, the CAIR, sorry, a density case control study, the density sampling typically risk.

313
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:32,680
Typically, you will see risk set sampling. The odds ratio is going to estimate.

314
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:41,740
The IDR is called a nested case control study when it's inside of the cohort study and in that case

315
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:48,670
cohort study a sample of all who are work members and then the odds ratio is going to estimate the C,

316
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:54,850
I, r c here.

317
00:39:55,690 --> 00:40:01,900
And you go ahead and read through this example and then tell me what type of study it is.

318
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:51,970
So what type of study is this? You should be able to tell from that abstract.

319
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:59,140
You will get more experience doing so. But everybody's just staring.

320
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:03,490
I guess I'm staring at you. So. Fair enough. All right. What kind of study?

321
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:06,880
Case control. Right? Some sort of case control. Can we all agree on that?

322
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:13,750
Yeah. What type of case control do you think it is? Yeah, it's identity theft control.

323
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:18,710
How can you tell? Who controls the financials?

324
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:24,680
Yeah, exactly. That's finance. It's right there. Right. The controls are selected at the time that each case occurred.

325
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:30,740
When you read this, particularly on exam, just when you read papers to start to underline those things,

326
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:37,700
to kind of pick out those major facts that you need to remember and you need to know to be able to evaluate the study.

327
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,660
All right. So density case control study.

328
00:41:41,930 --> 00:42:45,760
What about this one? Opinions on what type of study.

329
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:53,390
Is case covered? Yep. How can you tell?

330
00:42:56,050 --> 00:42:59,080
The cases right here. Yeah.

331
00:42:59,970 --> 00:43:04,629
Yeah, exactly. So they've got the cases right here.

332
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:07,300
Which safety and deaths, those are their cases.

333
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:11,870
So they've got two different outcomes that they're looking at or they might be combining them together into something more severe.

334
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:19,180
Right through 1993. And then they took a random sample of 900 subjects from the cohort.

335
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:23,050
What do you think they did that? I mean, they recorded this for everybody.

336
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:44,100
Because it was such a huge takeover. My guess is that these rhythm strips and I did read this paper a little while ago and I picked it out,

337
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:50,740
probably had to be read by a physician and maybe had to be read by several people.

338
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:56,309
Like a lot a lot of times what you'll do in studies and, you know, look for x rays for something like this, right?

339
00:43:56,310 --> 00:44:02,580
Where there can be differences of opinions on it. You'll have two people read it.

340
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:06,959
And if they have, if they come up with different answers, then you have a third person who comes in.

341
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:11,250
Right. So my guess is it's probably really labor intensive.

342
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:21,010
So what is there a relative effect measure here that kind of just side effect measure?

343
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:39,390
It's relatively good here. It's going to be the O.R., right?

344
00:44:40,730 --> 00:44:45,889
And it's going to estimate the sea air. So we do want it to or is estimating something else in this class.

345
00:44:45,890 --> 00:44:49,940
We want you to say that what it what it is estimating. All right.

346
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:58,040
Last but not least, the case crossover study.

347
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:07,220
So the case crossover study is going to be a study a case only study cases at another time point service, their own controls.

348
00:45:08,450 --> 00:45:14,660
It's appropriate when a brief exposure causes a transient rise in risk of a rare outcome.

349
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:24,489
That's when you'll see this the study design used. So a case crossover study will compare the exposure status of a case immediately

350
00:45:24,490 --> 00:45:29,530
before the occurrence to the exposure status at some point from a prior time.

351
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:33,670
Occasionally you'll actually see them go forward to, but typically it's before.

352
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:39,579
So an example of that is the average level of exposure during the previous year could be the day before.

353
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:47,440
There are all kinds of time periods that you can choose really depends on on what your exposure is that

354
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:53,410
you're looking at and how much access to data you have and how concerned you are about recall bias.

355
00:45:54,640 --> 00:46:00,370
This is going to represent a really special form of matching where the cases serve as their own controls.

356
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:07,150
So here's an example of some options for case crossover design.

357
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:13,180
So here we have an injury occurring here match, and there they're selecting a period.

358
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:20,140
So they look at the what the person was doing 10 minutes before the time period, from 10 minutes before to up until the injury occurred.

359
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:26,710
And then they look at what the individual was doing 70 to 60 minutes before the injury occurred.

360
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:30,760
Right. Or you can do this in to one point match.

361
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:34,149
So here we're looking at this 10 minutes before the injury occurred or during which the

362
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:41,800
injury occurred and going to wall to pull points in that past in a little more than an hour.

363
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:48,160
Another way to do it is to do an unusual frequency, right?

364
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:54,639
So here once again, the ten minute time point. But now they've looked at the usual frequency during the past month.

365
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,380
How often when they're doing it.

366
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:08,460
So case crossover assumptions, diseases don't the disease doesn't have an undiagnosed stage that affects the exposure of interest.

367
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:12,940
Right. And the exposure does not have a cumulative effect.

368
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:20,890
This design is not appropriate when either one of those situations is true or you think it's possible that they may be true.

369
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:26,829
So here's a good example of a of a case crossover studies,

370
00:47:26,830 --> 00:47:32,080
the role of mobile phones in motor vehicle crashes resulting in hospital attendance, case crossover study.

371
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:39,010
So from that title, you immediately know what their main exposure, right,

372
00:47:39,310 --> 00:47:42,520
exposure to mobile phones that they'll probably look at it a few different ways.

373
00:47:43,090 --> 00:47:47,470
Their outcome is a motor vehicle crash resulting in a hospital attendance rate.

374
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:52,679
And at least they're telling you this is a case crossover design study.

375
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:59,110
You don't necessarily believe that. Make sure once you read through how they designed that, you agree with that in the design.

376
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:11,050
So main outcome measure drivers of mobile phone app the estimated value of cash and on trips at the same time of day in the week before the crash.

377
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:21,879
So they were looking at trips the same time of day in the week before the crash, interviews with the drivers in hospital and phone companies.

378
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:28,640
Records were used to assess their exposure. All right.

379
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:35,370
So that is it for our case control design. So are there any any questions?

380
00:48:40,230 --> 00:48:45,420
Okay. So we will take a ten minute break and we're going to do the in-class activity.

381
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:48,240
It is your choice if you stay for the in-class activity or not.

382
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:55,320
But I do recommend that you make sure that you do this whole activity and Katie and I will be staying for it.

383
00:48:56,190 --> 00:49:01,110
But people can kind of choose what they want to do with the next the next hour.
