1
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:08,250
Our world.

2
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:27,160
But I tell everybody, it seems like we had some changes to our set up here now that we are missing some here as we go for now.

3
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:33,640
All right. How's your week starting and how's it going so far?

4
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:39,240
Oh, well, I hope so. All right.

5
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:43,630
So welcome to Week six. I will start with some announcements.

6
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:51,340
Talk about a plan for today, which is primarily we are going to cover chronic disease surveillance and then we

7
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:59,170
will make time for groups to work on that project if they have any tests remaining.

8
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:09,340
So as a start for our Quiz three, which is our final quiz is due on Friday at 1159.

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:20,080
The final project is also due at that time and you will upload your group assignment to canvas by 1159 on Friday.

10
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,350
So Quiz three will include content from weeks five, six and seven.

11
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,830
And we're going back to the format of what we have.

12
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:37,210
What was once is going to be true for us and multiple choice formats and just a few updates.

13
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:42,190
So we had a chance. You and I had a chance to meet.

14
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:47,590
We have a weekly meetings after the class.

15
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:56,410
So you saw that Thursday and we got a chance to discuss based on the questions that you all have been asking about the final project.

16
00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:05,980
So there was a common questions about the two additional questions that we're asking you to identify

17
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:13,060
whether those questions need to be restricted to the topic that are associated with the article.

18
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:17,200
I used to like that or what I can be anything. So in this case is okay.

19
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:23,379
It can be any topic related to the data set that you're proposing and for which we're going to

20
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:28,810
be able to analyze those research questions based on the data set that you're referring to,

21
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:38,460
any question about this particular question. So we expanded to include any topic that will be applicable to the data set.

22
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:51,740
And then just so we are familiar with the final article that you've selected I know doing plus that they were able to kind of take a look,

23
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:58,160
give your approval to say whatever, okay. But please go ahead and email your final article to us.

24
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:07,700
Even though you are doing that, the instructions will still stand when you need to upload your final article to the canvas, say.

25
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:16,820
And then the other question there seem to be coming up is what do you need to keep the promise in your final project?

26
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:20,240
It's helpful to do so,

27
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:31,820
and because that gives us an opportunity to ensure that that particular section of text is referring to that the preceding prompts,

28
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:36,590
because it is kind of retained in a term paper format.

29
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:40,610
You might have certain content at different points in the paper.

30
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:42,560
It might be a little bit difficult to track.

31
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:50,809
And then for you, it makes it easier to know that you are addressing all the expectations related to that person in that particular section.

32
00:03:50,810 --> 00:04:01,280
So it's going to be helpful to you to keep the promise in the paper that you submit or the submission.

33
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:09,110
And then one other item that I don't have yet on the announcements, I've gotten some inquiries about extra credit,

34
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:16,790
so I'm considering that and I will let you all know by email sometime over the weekend.

35
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:25,189
So between beginning Friday to any time during the weekend, I will let you know which way this is going to go.

36
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:30,110
And if it's yes, I will send the extra credit to you at that time.

37
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:40,350
Any questions? All right.

38
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:45,240
So when he was diagnosed with cancer. Chronic disease surveillance.

39
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:48,840
And then you can work on your good project after that.

40
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:57,140
So we're going to start with population based registries.

41
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:03,680
So when you get population based registries, what do you think of and what do you think is included?

42
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:08,300
Well, we consider establishing a population based registry.

43
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:28,929
Maybe we're going to be collecting data. Any other thoughts?

44
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:36,590
The unknown. All right.

45
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:44,030
So a population based registry contains records for people diagnosed with a specific type of disease.

46
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:49,790
The key distinction here is that they live in a defined geographic region.

47
00:05:50,480 --> 00:06:02,300
So based on this, what do you think would be a distinction or a similarity between a population based registry in a clinical hospital based registry?

48
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:23,600
Within an outside. Yes.

49
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:32,500
Thank you. So the population based registry will include information about people going to that clinic or the hospital in question.

50
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:42,190
The flip side to that is that clinic or hospital based registry will only have information

51
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:48,010
on the cases that go to that particular clinic or that particular hospital for treatment,

52
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:57,940
whereas the population based registry. Once you're in a geographical defined area, what do you get treated with in that area?

53
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:03,070
And not every item will be made to get information on the outcome of interest.

54
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:10,390
So there's this active process where case is identified using so many different methods.

55
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:21,850
So examples include end stage renal disease, you have HIV aids, and then you have cancer, which is what we're going to talk about primarily today.

56
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:29,830
Some of the features and some of the factors that make population based registry data.

57
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:45,460
Not quite easy, but at least obtainable is that some of these conditions are treated in specific locations, specified hospitals or specific centers.

58
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:53,890
So is is is a whole lot easier to identify these specific centers and try to collect information on these outcomes,

59
00:07:54,250 --> 00:08:01,120
rather than trying to go to every clinic, every health center and every hospital to collect information for something,

60
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:06,100
for example, heart disease where you can be treated in so many different settings.

61
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,160
So the surveillance,

62
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:24,320
epidemiology and end result SERE was established by the National Center Cancer Center by an act so the National Cancer Act of 1971.

63
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:30,319
And the goal was really to strengthen the National Cancer Institute in terms of the data

64
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:36,770
that we're collecting and in terms of understanding outcomes associated with cancer.

65
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:50,090
So see started in 1973 and continue to collect very useful data in terms of cancer incidence, mortality and survival in the U.S.

66
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:58,230
So the program originally started with a select few locations.

67
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:09,630
So you see we include Connecticut, Iowa, New Mexico, Utah, Hawaii, Detroit, some locations in California and in Puerto Rico.

68
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:16,200
So Adore Detroit was one of the locations that started in this program.

69
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:27,660
You are still able to collect some information on Detroit based on existing data, but Detroit is no longer an active site.

70
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:32,460
So Detroit. Sorry, we had a chance to just run to one.

71
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:45,420
Oh, okay. Thank you. So some of the existing databases have data for Detroit, but Detroit is no longer actively followed.

72
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:51,870
So if you go to the CFA site, you will see we've made some changes, particularly last November.

73
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:56,400
They made some changes, especially as it relates to how the databases are grouped.

74
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:06,719
The original sites and then subsequent sites were selected based on the population subgroups that were in those regions.

75
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:12,780
So they could have a nice mix of the populations and subgroups in the U.S. and

76
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:16,710
then also the ability of this locations to maintain a high quality registry.

77
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:22,320
So you'll see when I show the groupings that locations were identical written.

78
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:34,320
So in 1974 you had New Orleans that all of New Orleans was at 1977, but then between 74,

79
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:40,810
75, you also had locations in Atlanta, places in Georgia were also added.

80
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:43,110
So there's this nice balance between urban,

81
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:52,020
rural and then also a nice distribution to be able to collect the population subgroups that are representative of the United States.

82
00:10:55,470 --> 00:11:01,950
So Cyr, based on the 2020 data, covers around 35% of the U.S. population.

83
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:09,930
So many that other agencies or other groups that are collecting cancer coverage data in the U.S.

84
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:16,350
So the based on the 2020 data, you have around 30% African-Americans.

85
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:29,940
So included in that coverage area, around 44%, Hispanics, around 58% Asian and then around 32% white.

86
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:39,180
So keep in mind that this is population based. So the regions for which the Seer have selected to be their registry areas.

87
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:46,320
The goal is to collect all of the cases in that particular area, regardless of whether they get here in that area or not.

88
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:53,550
Because it does sometimes, depending on where people live, they might go to a different area to get that treatment,

89
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:59,340
either because of a better hospital or because maybe they have family members who can then take care of them.

90
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,950
So there are multiple reasons why we should be commended.

91
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:09,180
The area that we were originally diagnosed in, but the population based registry will attempt to collect information on this individual.

92
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:19,470
So currently the database has over 10 million records and around 600,000 new records every year.

93
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:30,700
So the CIA groups you have the CIA nine and includes cases from 1975 to the current data year.

94
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:41,590
So based on the new groupings, if you go to the site, you will see that CIA now is now CIA eight see it, 13 is now six war.

95
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:53,680
But then if you look at existing records, I think publications, they will refer to them as these groupings because this was in effect until last fall.

96
00:12:55,700 --> 00:13:02,330
So all of these, the first three have been reduced by one except for CA 21, which is now SEER 22.

97
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:08,900
So maybe that particular group has 22 registries including.

98
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:19,390
So who is who? Can you see the data? The data are available for anyone to use with some conditions.

99
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:24,050
So one example will be that you will not make an attempt to identify an individual.

100
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:34,850
So the data idea identified in I mean, just looking at the data from it would be almost impossible to identify anybody in the dataset.

101
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:42,320
But there is this rule saying that no attempt should be made to identify individuals.

102
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:47,330
The data will be used for research and statistical reporting only,

103
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:55,790
and then no specific outcomes will be presented by hospitals or compared across hospitals.

104
00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:02,870
Why do you think that this is an important condition that would be helpful to meeting?

105
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:29,490
Any thoughts? Well, guess. So the data this here they are collected based on relationship with the registry staff and staff members

106
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:36,120
from these different centers that provide information about who's been diagnosed with a cancer.

107
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:49,680
So there's this cardio working relationship with these individuals and trying to report data by hospital, especially if is not favorable.

108
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:58,320
You can imagine those centers might not want to make their facilities available for data to be used, but they need to be reported.

109
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:06,240
So the goal of actually getting information on cancer incidence, cancer survival rate and cancer mortality,

110
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:13,230
it trumps the need to be particular about which hospital you have higher cancer deaths.

111
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,270
So that's just to keep the ability to have data ongoing.

112
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:25,680
What would be another reason for which this is not even going to be a useful comparison across locations?

113
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:46,520
So one example could be some centers actually see more severe cases, cases where people have more severe disease or advanced stages of their cancer.

114
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:54,410
So those individuals tend to go to those specialty hospitals where they have a lot of specialty specialists on board.

115
00:15:55,100 --> 00:16:07,040
Now, because you have more people who are severely ill go into those centers, the mortality rate is going to be higher at those locations.

116
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:14,360
And the mortality rate being higher has nothing to do with the fact that they're getting poor here or inadequate here.

117
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:18,170
It's just that you have sicker individuals going to those locations.

118
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:29,210
So trying to compare cancer is it is not cancer is sort of cancer mortality across hospitals, we'll all put it in context, can be misleading.

119
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:36,470
So this is one reason that is not even going to be helpful to compare cancer mortality across the patients.

120
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:45,620
So what types of data collected? You have a range and a web of data collected from the medical record.

121
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:53,120
So you have information on demographics, you have a unique identifier as a Social Security number,

122
00:16:53,120 --> 00:17:00,259
and then you have other identifiers or name, date of birth, clinical information.

123
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:07,070
So the primary side of the tumor, the stage and everything related to that cancer, you get information on that.

124
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,809
You also get information on the first course of treatment in this follow up and then the medical identifier.

125
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:18,230
So the hospital, the surgeon, and then the final acquisition.

126
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:26,330
So you have a wealth of data, everything that you can possibly think about related to that person, cancer from when they were diagnosed.

127
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:31,819
Going forward, you have information on that. What we seem to be missing some key information.

128
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:40,459
So as epidemiologists, we're always looking not only to describe data and to report incidents and trends over time,

129
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:45,800
but we also are interested in looking at associations between exposures and outcome.

130
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:50,710
So based on that, we're missing very important information.

131
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,129
Are we, as epidemiologists,

132
00:17:52,130 --> 00:18:01,340
will like to have what sorts of data or what types of data that you think we're missing from this rich source of cancer information?

133
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:20,180
We're missing a lot of information on exposure.

134
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:28,640
So we have information on cancer diagnosis, treatment outcome.

135
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:32,060
So a lot of information specifically related to the cancer.

136
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:40,459
But we as epidemiologists want to be able to understand what were some of the risk factors leading to that person developing cancer.

137
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:44,270
And none of that is available on this website.

138
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:52,400
So in addition to the cancer data that we have in the U.S.,

139
00:18:52,430 --> 00:19:00,350
in addition to collecting population based registries, there's also the national program of cancer registries.

140
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:06,800
That program is sponsored by the National Center for Disease Control and Prevention,

141
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:16,700
and it provides funding for every state, in every territory to collect data to complement what SEER is collecting.

142
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:28,040
So SEER and the National Program of Cancer Registry together cover around 96% of the population for the cancer data that we have in the U.S.

143
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:33,950
So very comprehensive coverage in terms of how we cover the.

144
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:45,180
So I would take a quick moment. So you have an opportunity to go to the site to go to.

145
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:49,680
If you do a quick Google search and then search here.

146
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:58,620
You should be able to get the registry. And so you just have a quick moment to understand what sorts of data are available.

147
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:03,690
And some of the quick data that you can get from the site.

148
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:17,970
So if you go to see here and if you just look around on the site, you should be able to find see a explorer with statistics for 2019 right here.

149
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:24,330
You still can get it from other places, but this is what you can get.

150
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:35,040
And then this takes you to an interactive page where you can, if you're interested in any cancer, look at the stats,

151
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:40,350
for example, incidence or mortality, or they may be prevalence related to some of these cancers.

152
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:53,950
So based on that, you are going to generate two plus one is age adjusted incidence rate of breast cancer in white and black women.

153
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:59,710
And then the second one is age adjusted mortality rates of breast cancer in white black women.

154
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:14,280
So from here you can go to the cancer that you're interested in and you can just do overall breast rather than a specific type.

155
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:25,200
If you go here, you go there long term trips, and then you can collect information on rates.

156
00:21:29,860 --> 00:22:08,659
I think this could. Okay.

157
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:15,480
So after you do the incidence, then the next step will be to do mortality.

158
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:28,550
So if you come to this side of the screen, you can say select mortality and you should be able to generate a figure for the mortality rate.

159
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:53,440
So based on what you were able to generate or you can look on the screen up here, I have the incidence rate to that and it talks about what you see.

160
00:22:53,650 --> 00:23:02,350
Anybody would like to take an and attempt to explain or describe what the rates are telling us over time.

161
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:34,900
Between white and black women. Before that it was not.

162
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:52,100
Thank you. So I'm hoping I heard you correctly that there appears to be an increase it's way 1984 and 2004.

163
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:56,600
But it appeared to be different for white women compared to black.

164
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:01,320
And that's something similar. Okay. So we see.

165
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:06,610
Thank you. We see that across all of these years.

166
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:18,320
So at the bottom on the x axis, we had the diagnosis and then on the Y axis, we have the rate per 100,000 that across almost all of the timeframes.

167
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:27,800
That's why we may have a higher incidence of breast cancer compared to African-American women.

168
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:36,650
There are different patterns over time, like changes in the pattern that are now reflected across groups like you mentioned.

169
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:46,070
But it's interesting that these rates continue to be different across groups without any crossover,

170
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:51,380
with white women having a higher rate across the entire period.

171
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:56,000
Now, if we switch that to mortality rate.

172
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:08,430
Let's take a look at the graph. Again, we have the debt on the x axis and then on the Y axis, we have rates per 100,000.

173
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:20,520
So anybody want to give you a try in terms of explaining what this graph is telling us in terms of mortality, breast cancer related mortality?

174
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:43,080
So we see that over time as one early period, that mortality was higher among white females.

175
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:50,520
But then after that, idle white females had a higher incidence rate.

176
00:25:51,000 --> 00:26:00,780
We see that mortality is higher among African-American females rather than what you would expect with the associated incidence rate.

177
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:10,530
So and this pattern has remained constant over time, except for, you know, the period before 1980 where it was flipped.

178
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:16,110
So we see also from here that there's a general downward trend, which is good.

179
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:30,520
But the difference beginning from around 1995, 1992 and 1993, the gap between white and black mortality rates have remained constant over time.

180
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:38,550
Even though there's this general downward trend. So what would be some of the reasons for which we have a higher incidence among.

181
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:45,890
Caucasian women. But a higher mortality rate among African-American men.

182
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:56,910
Yes. Okay.

183
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:57,600
Thank you.

184
00:26:57,630 --> 00:27:05,940
So sometimes you have a situation where you have more aggressive cancers diagnosed among African-American women compared to Caucasian women.

185
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:09,929
So meaning that's associated with higher mortality. Yes, I know.

186
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:14,770
Somebody had a had. Yes. Okay.

187
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:16,250
So screening rates could be different.

188
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:26,520
So we know screening has the advantage of helping people identify cases early on in the early identify a breast cancer case or most cancers,

189
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:32,610
you are able to be more successful in treating any other factors.

190
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,420
Access to care. Yeah.

191
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:43,580
Thank you. So access to care could be a factor in this.

192
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:55,519
You know, sometimes you have people who do not make it to the hospital for screening or for other preventive purposes until they have symptoms.

193
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:59,450
And we know that with cancer with symptoms,

194
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:07,310
many most likely are diseases a little more advanced compared to how they'd be identified by screening where you had no symptoms.

195
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:15,650
So just a number of reasons why that could shed some light on why we are seeing these differences.

196
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,640
And although we have the trend for going downhill,

197
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:28,370
there's still some disparities here that need to be addressed because the difference

198
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:33,710
between the rates between the two groups seem to be close over a very long period of time.

199
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:42,440
So that was just an exercise to give you a sense of the types of data available and that

200
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:47,960
you can go and explore any cancer that you're interested in just using these resources.

201
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:10,450
So we heard a quick overview of the sources of information related to cancer in the U.S., but there are also global sources of cancer information.

202
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:16,450
So there are two main ones operated by the International Agency for Research on Cancer.

203
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:20,410
The first one is cancer incidence in five continents.

204
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:32,260
And the second one is global care. So you might be wondering, why is this organization running two databases on cancer or cancer information?

205
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:41,350
The Global Cam project actually works to estimate cancer incidence compared to the.

206
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:51,120
The cancer incidence on five continents where they're using up to date data registries,

207
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:57,359
where they are certain of the type of information and the quality of the information collected for global cancer.

208
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,250
Using multiple resources,

209
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:12,690
with multiple confidence that the data are collected in a way that could be comparable to what you find in the cancer incidence on five continents.

210
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:20,160
So the global can they're using counts, they're using data collected from a clinic.

211
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:24,460
Keep in mind, when we're doing a population based, we are collecting all cases.

212
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:30,360
Clinics, we know we're not collecting everything. We're just collecting all of those individuals that come to that particular location.

213
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:38,850
So they are collecting all of those different points to be able to estimate cancer incidence, cancer mortality in those different regions.

214
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:47,670
In some instances, they might even use information from a different country, like a neighboring country, to estimate cancer incidence in that region.

215
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:56,430
So as you can imagine, the data in the cancer incidence on five continents would be a little bit more accurate

216
00:30:56,430 --> 00:31:03,030
and really reflecting the cancer story for those regions compared to the global care.

217
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:07,950
And is and this is not to say that this is not important or helpful information,

218
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:11,549
but we just need to understand when we're using these data how they are

219
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:15,960
different and some of the potential limitations associated with these datasets.

220
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:21,360
There's a website here you can go in and you can use the interactive tool just to

221
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:27,540
see cancer incidence across the world and the different types of cancer incidence.

222
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,030
Information immortality are available.

223
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:43,300
So this is just a map from that source where you have the estimate, the age, standardized rates of incidence cases for both sexes.

224
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:47,280
You can look at it data by sex, you can look at it data by cancer type.

225
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:54,290
But this is for all cancers, excluding melanoma worldwide.

226
00:31:54,990 --> 00:32:06,899
So you can see the the different color coded regions where you have the estimates for cancer for these different regions.

227
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:10,980
And then there are some regions where you just have no data or it's just not applicable.

228
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:22,520
And this map just shows you cancer coverage, registration of cancer coverage worldwide around 2000.

229
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:25,290
So the estimated percent of the population cover,

230
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:34,530
you can see it varies widely across regions with the North American continent reporting around 1990 9%.

231
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:38,940
And then for some regions where you have as low as 7%.

232
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:43,020
So similar to the registrations of birth and death.

233
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:50,970
As we talk about when we talk about it as data, you have similar situation where you have varying coverage across parts of the world.

234
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:59,890
It incorporates by the totality data. This is based on information form or data bank.

235
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:07,320
Again, you see great differences across the regions for incorporation of more targeted data.

236
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:16,860
Any question about cancer data, U.S. space or global information?

237
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:23,850
Okay. So let's talk briefly about the Medicare program.

238
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:34,700
So the Medicare program itself, one federally funded health insurance plan that's restricted to qualifying elders.

239
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:41,510
Many people who are 65 and older or for select individuals who have a disability.

240
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:49,670
So 97% of persons who are 65 or older eligible for Medicare.

241
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:57,019
So this is a great data base that we can use to then understand the existing

242
00:33:57,020 --> 00:34:03,320
database that we have for cancer incidence and cancer survival on the topic.

243
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:08,390
Well, keep in mind that Medicare is not one of the databases we've covered.

244
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:11,600
Well, we're representing the entire U.S. population.

245
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:19,610
This data set is restricted to individuals 65 and older or individuals who have a disability, who are eligible for the.

246
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:26,390
So the Medicare data are data that results from claims.

247
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:35,240
So when people go to a clinic or they go to a hospital for a procedure, there are claims that are associated with each visit.

248
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:46,309
From those visits, you have data about the date of the visit, the procedure, the diagnosis, how much was paid by Medicare.

249
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:55,940
And those are considered administrative data bases. And you can get a wealth of data from this process where the primary goal is to

250
00:34:55,940 --> 00:35:01,730
really document what was covered and how much was paid by the Medicare program.

251
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:13,130
So for the Medicare data availability, some of the data sets are not individual level data, and those are available publicly,

252
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:25,220
but other types of data are limited and the identifiable data can be ordered if you pay for them, but they are identical.

253
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:31,700
So it's a little bit different from what we saw for the census data, what we saw for the National Vital Statistics data.

254
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:39,769
So birth and death and also what you can get for the DHS data for Medicare.

255
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:44,510
The files are there, but you have to pay a fee to be able to access the individual level data.

256
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:56,090
So the CRM, Medicare linked data gives you this opportunity to link the Medicare data set with the ACA data set.

257
00:35:56,510 --> 00:36:01,070
And then with that, you are then able to have some information about exposures.

258
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:12,500
You are then able to find information about behavioral factors that you may associate with cancer incidence, cancer survival and then also mortality.

259
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:15,470
But other than that, if you're just using Seer,

260
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:24,550
you're using Seer to just talk about cancer patterns without the necessary information to help you understand relationships between exposure.

261
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:36,920
So this is a paper I was published that gives information about the different files that you can use for the ACA Medicare data files.

262
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:44,300
Of course, the data have been ongoing, so you have more recent years now available.

263
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:52,850
But if you're looking at ACA medical care data files, you have a file that's just restricted to the ACA cancer cases.

264
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:59,749
And then you have other files that give you information about a random sample of Medicare

265
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:06,620
recipients and then also the specific files associated with either a hospital visit,

266
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:10,250
a doctor's visit or maybe some outpatient procedure.

267
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:18,629
So the variables from these different files, you can get one record per hospital,

268
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:25,380
state emissions discharge date and all of the diagnoses associated with that particular visit.

269
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:34,440
You can have a procedure list that you can have up to six listed with these dates associated with those procedures.

270
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:44,020
So they carry a file which is also the physician or supplier of the Part B, Medicare Part B.

271
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:47,620
You also have information on the date of the visit.

272
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:54,250
The services include a diagnosis associated and then the provider information.

273
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:04,050
And then you could do either all patient cleans depending on what your research question is and what type of data you're looking for.

274
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:08,629
You have all of these sources for which you can get data similar to the previous two files,

275
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:12,660
so you can get information on the dates, the diagnosis and procedures.

276
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:17,280
And then in this case, if the surgery that you get information on the particular surgeon, it was done.

277
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:32,850
So we have all of this research information that we can use when we want to understand things about cancer incidence and subsequent outcomes.

278
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:38,780
So we have a spectrum of support that we can get from the Medicare funds.

279
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:46,080
Keep in mind that some of the data that we are able to get from Medicare will still be limited.

280
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:55,320
There's always no substitute for collecting information directly from individuals about a research question you are interested in.

281
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:01,440
And that advantages of having assisting an available data set that you can use.

282
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:08,850
Limitations are also associated with those data sets because then they would not collect primarily for your research question.

283
00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:14,220
So you might be able to get some information about lifestyle factors.

284
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:18,840
But you'll see that depending on what type of information you're collecting,

285
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:28,229
you have very reliability about the type of data you're collecting because hospital procedures,

286
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:32,850
hospital diagnoses, those are key to the Medicare program.

287
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:42,210
In terms of payment. You can have more reliable information on these data points compared to lifestyle factors.

288
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:49,260
So one example would be if you're collecting information or you want to do something related to obesity,

289
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:55,830
which is, you know, closely associated with some of the known cancers around here,

290
00:39:56,700 --> 00:40:05,460
you see that you might have some people who might have a high BMI,

291
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:11,280
but that information may not be available because the Medicare data set will only

292
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:17,850
have information based on whether that information was related to your visit.

293
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:27,930
So for somebody who might have a high BMI, but not necessarily going for procedure, that information may not be reported in the data.

294
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:35,250
But if somebody had a high BMI and because of that, they were going to get bariatric surgery,

295
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:39,450
then information is going to be reported about that person's obesity status.

296
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:49,770
So using these data, you need to be careful because you might have a small percent of people who are registered in certain factors.

297
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:57,570
But it doesn't mean that those who are not registering those factors, they are not dealing with those factors or they don't have those factors.

298
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:03,090
It's just that the factor was not serious enough to be part of that visit,

299
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:10,680
to be part of the discussion or to be part of the reporting diagnostic support associated with that particular condition.

300
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:15,330
Another factor could be cigaret smoking. So if people smoke.

301
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:20,480
But for that particular visit, the visit had nothing to do with the cigaret smoking status.

302
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:22,620
That information is not going to be reported.

303
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:31,410
So if you're trying to collect information on all those who are smokers to look at how that is associated with a particular cancer,

304
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,730
you might be under estimating in the most smokers and in Medicare data set.

305
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:46,050
Now, if somebody is a smoker and they wanted to get a prescription for a patch to help them stop the smoking habit that is going to be reported,

306
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:51,270
but it's only going to be reported if it's associated with a particular diagnosis.

307
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:58,450
So keep that in mind. So how do you access to see the Medicare data?

308
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,900
So we're talking about publicly available data sets.

309
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:10,629
This particular dataset is not publicly available because we have linked information between the Medicare and the SEER.

310
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:15,220
So you have personally identifiable information on these individuals.

311
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:24,820
So they're not publicly available, but you can submit a request and you have to obtain approval before you are able to access these data.

312
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:30,250
The approval is not ready to say, what are your research question is valid or not?

313
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:37,989
What is more that to get investigators through the process to know these are data that have identifiable

314
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:44,380
information and people need to be mindful in protecting the participants in these datasets.

315
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:52,210
If you want to get data, you have to pay in is around $2,000 for one cancer site,

316
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:57,730
but there's a bulk discount if you wanted to get information from multiple sites.

317
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:06,379
So as you can see, collecting data from Syria and then combining that with Medicare,

318
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:12,500
some of the limitations and they try to understand the data can be really complicated, but it's doable.

319
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:19,340
So if people are interested, you can take a particular training related to the data and then you're going

320
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:23,540
to be able to have a better sense in understanding how to analyze the data.

321
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:29,450
So it's not required that you have to take the training, but in order to understand what you're doing,

322
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:37,460
you need to be able to at least sign up for the training and then learn about how the databases are set up.

323
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:53,670
Any question about. See our Medicare or the global cancer registry before moving to virtual, although scheduled for today.

324
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:02,230
All right. So feel free to work on your group project.

325
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:12,010
I will be around if you have questions and if you are done and you have no other discussions.

326
00:44:12,010 --> 00:44:28,740
We are group members. Feel free to follow. Hold.

327
00:44:35,930 --> 00:44:41,040
That's right. But.

328
00:44:54,800 --> 00:45:13,100
Oh, I see. I have.

329
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:26,660
I. I feel like having.

330
00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:07,790
I.
