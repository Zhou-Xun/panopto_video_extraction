1
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:10,190
I'm going to go and look at the. Okay.

2
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:19,670
Hi, everybody. We're going to go ahead and get started. Welcome back.

3
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:29,989
I hope you had a restful Thanksgiving break and I hope you were able to get have some time to recharge for the remainder of the semester.

4
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:33,800
So welcome back. All right.

5
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:42,649
We are going to start today with some announcements I think is going to be very important to pay

6
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:48,560
close attention to the timing and due dates for some of the announcements associated with today.

7
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:57,830
So the first one is a reminder that three and the final project are due next week by midnight,

8
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:05,510
and then with three will include contents from weeks five, six and seven.

9
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:09,380
And we're going back to the true false multiple choice format.

10
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:17,450
You also have an opportunity for extra credit, and this opens today after class.

11
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,130
So it's a final extra credit opportunity.

12
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:28,670
You can go to the assignments page and you will see the extra credit opportunity and you can decide whether you want to complete it or not.

13
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:35,270
This is due on Friday. So Friday coming up, December 2nd by midnight.

14
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,750
And I encourage you to take a look and consider whether you want to complete it.

15
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:45,200
You might be doing very well now and think maybe you don't need to complete the extra credit.

16
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:54,380
But once the deadline closes, I won't be accepting any requests to complete the extra credit exercise.

17
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,690
So if you want to play this day, I encourage you to complete the exercise.

18
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:06,350
But if you make a decision not to, then is going to have to stay that way after Friday.

19
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:12,530
And so for the extra credit opportunities, really an extension, of course, too.

20
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:17,030
So you will see the same scenarios that you saw on Quest two.

21
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:27,290
And what the exercise is asking you to do is to select one of those scenarios and then create a study that you design

22
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:34,760
and consider all of the data collection challenges and opportunities depending on the scenario you've selected.

23
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,499
That is a rubric.

24
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:45,890
So you can take a look at a rubric and you are so you are fully informed in terms of what we expect for the answers on that extra credit opportunity.

25
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:52,940
As usual, you can always email if you need us to clarify anything related to the extra credit exercise.

26
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:57,290
And then finally for the final project.

27
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:07,910
Just a reminder, once you've narrowed down your article and or most of your email to confirm what are those articles where appropriate,

28
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:12,800
send your final selection to Hanan.

29
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:18,559
So she has a copy of your article for this submission.

30
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:29,120
You still have to add the submission to your exercise, so you are going to upload your final project and your article,

31
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,319
but in the meantime, send the article once you've decided to hire you.

32
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:44,510
And so she has a copy. And then I mentioned this previously, but I want to remind you that you need to keep the prompts in your write up.

33
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:47,960
I know it's easy to think of it as a term paper,

34
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:59,900
but you're you're keeping the promise in the final project will allow you to address all of the expectations that we have for each of those pros.

35
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:07,700
Paying close attention to the rubric. And the rubric is going to tell you exactly for each project what we need you to address.

36
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:14,870
And so keeping that in allows you to address each prompt in all of the components that are needed.

37
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:26,360
Any questions about the announcements for today? So plan for today,

38
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:35,880
we will do a brief overview of chronic disease turbulence in the U.S. and then talk briefly about cancer surveillance on a global scale.

39
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:41,730
And then for the second part of class, you will have an opportunity to continue working on your group project.

40
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:50,400
Like previous classes, if you are already set and you have group members who know exactly what they need to be doing and you don't,

41
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:54,450
you get finished early. You can leave before the rest of the class festival.

42
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:03,100
So we start with cancer registration in the U.S. and then move on to global sources of data.

43
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:16,910
That I. So before we get into the cancer registries that are in the U.S., I want to first focus on what we mean by population based registries.

44
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:23,330
And so the definition is a population based registry contains records for people

45
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,970
diagnosed with a specific type of disease who live within a defined geographic region.

46
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:36,920
And so some of the examples shown here, you see in stage renal disease, HIV, aids and cancer.

47
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,669
And so when we think of a population based registry,

48
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:50,180
we need to think carefully about how the data collected is included in the database and how is it different from other types of registries.

49
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:55,490
So for example, there could be a hospital based registry or clinic based registry.

50
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:05,090
And so for the population based registry, you will have information for everybody in that geographically defined area.

51
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,790
So if the person is diagnosed in, let's say,

52
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:16,519
a geographically defined areas and if a person is diagnosed in Alberta for some reason decide that they want to do that cancer treatment,

53
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:23,480
also, Michigan, that person is going to still be included in the population based registry.

54
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:27,500
But for a clinic based registry, it's a little bit different.

55
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:32,810
So you want to have requisite people who make a decision to go to a particular health center.

56
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:40,670
So if you have a health center in a location and individuals decide this is not the location for me and I want to go somewhere else,

57
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:45,200
they would not be included in a clinic based or hospital based registry.

58
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:52,580
But for the population based registry, if you are in Michigan and you decide to go to Texas to do your treatment,

59
00:06:52,850 --> 00:07:03,650
you will still be counted in that Michigan region registry or the Michigan City or area building population based registry.

60
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:15,200
And some of the factors that make certain diseases more feasible to be included in the population based registry include,

61
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:22,490
for example, if you have a condition that treat at a specialty center, it's easier to capture.

62
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:28,100
All of those cases will be included in the population based registry because you can go straight to their center and then

63
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:36,080
be able to capture information on the cases that are participating in the treatments that are available at that location.

64
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,890
For HIV, AIDS is a little bit different.

65
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:52,490
This requires a laboratory diagnosis, and we know that with a passive surveillance system, you have a lab health center,

66
00:07:52,500 --> 00:08:00,230
a clinic where they're routinely sending information from the clinic, from the lab to the local health department.

67
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:07,910
And because HIV AIDS is a laboratory based diagnosis,

68
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:14,120
you won't have all of those cases coming from that laboratory going to the local health department.

69
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:19,010
And so, by the way, the set up is created.

70
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:27,410
They are able to then document or collect all of the people who are diagnosed with HIV AIDS in a given region.

71
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:38,150
And so so that there are certain characteristics of these conditions that allow a population based registry to be feasible in those areas.

72
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:45,320
Any question on the population based registries? Okay.

73
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:52,910
And so today we'll be talking about the Surveillance, Epidemiology and Resource Seer program.

74
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:58,850
This program came about after the National Cancer Act of 1971.

75
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:05,870
And what this act did actually strengthening the National Cancer Institute to be what we know it to be today.

76
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:10,520
It allowed the institute to be able to receive funding.

77
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:21,650
I allowed the institute to be able to conduct data collection activities to inform us about cancer incidence, cancer prevalence and then also.

78
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:26,940
Survival or are these outcomes associated with? Cancer.

79
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:40,200
So the CFA program officially started in 1973 and the program started with a limited number of sites and those sites have grown over time.

80
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:48,840
So the program initially included places in Connecticut, Iowa, New Mexico, Detroit.

81
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:59,040
Which is important to note that Detroit was part of the original locations, but Detroit is no longer active in the program.

82
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:03,570
So you are still able to get data for Detroit for the previous years.

83
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:13,080
But going forward, Detroit is not included. And so these sites were selected because of the population subgroups that the

84
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:19,260
program needed to be able to be at least representative of the U.S. population.

85
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:25,080
So locations have been added over time. And so you will see see a registry.

86
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:32,250
They have groupings for those different locations being added and we'll cover that in the slides coming up.

87
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:39,530
So you can see this slide just shows locations that were added over time.

88
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:43,970
Again, with with the additional locations being added.

89
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,630
It was still keeping in mind the ability to have a diverse sample in the registry.

90
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:59,300
So this map shows sea level. And at this point, we had 11 sites in the registry at that time.

91
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:04,270
But now it is going to be, I think at 22 it is currently.

92
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:12,890
And then there are certain areas where the registry operates in a certain location.

93
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,909
And then there's another program operated by CDC,

94
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:25,280
which we'll talk about later that also collects information on cancer incidence, cancer prevalence and outcomes.

95
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:33,589
And so there are some places where you have both programs operating in those regions and in other places

96
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:43,370
you have on this year and other times you have the other program collecting data in places across the U.S.

97
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:53,380
So for a CIA program based on 2020 data, this program covers around 35% of the US population.

98
00:11:54,010 --> 00:12:00,670
And within that group you have different breakdown of different subgroups in the population.

99
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:05,530
And so you see for African-Americans, you have around 30% cooperation.

100
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:11,409
For Asians, you have around 57.5%.

101
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:14,590
And then for whites, you have 31.9%.

102
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,680
Again, this is a population based registry.

103
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:23,470
So meaning if they are operating in that area, they are collecting all of the cancer cases in that particular region.

104
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:28,360
This is a huge undertaking and collecting data on a yearly basis.

105
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:37,810
So they have to date more than 10 million cancers with around 600,000 new cases added each year.

106
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:43,650
So. Data collection that's going for this program.

107
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:50,740
So, yes, the list of groupings that I was talking about so far this year, nine,

108
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:58,810
which includes the original cancer site, you have cases that were diagnosed from 1975 to the current data year.

109
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:03,930
If you go to the site now, you will see that they've changed their names.

110
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:08,169
You now see your eight, seer 13 is nine.

111
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:13,630
See it 12. They've made some changes because they've removed Detroit from the data.

112
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:26,620
But what this class and is possible if one of the groups decides to use as a paper or an article that use C data.

113
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:31,750
It's possible you might see your references being CNI rather than C or eight.

114
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:41,440
The new destination is a little bit researched, and so if you have a paper as before 2020, you might have C, r nine, right?

115
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:47,680
And it's year C, it's 1 to 1 is the one that increased.

116
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:55,630
So it's already kind of C at 20. It is now C at 22 because they added two new locations to this grouping.

117
00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:03,850
But you can see from the different groupings that from Seer 30 onward they have expand their races.

118
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:10,690
And so we can see how this ties in to the data from the census that we covered at the beginning of the class.

119
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:22,990
How over time, that's additional information in terms of race or ethnicity that are used in data collection processes.

120
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:28,480
And so you might have different subsets of data when you're collecting data over time.

121
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:36,080
And so what you're seeing see, the data is available for anybody to use.

122
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:39,469
And you will see we'll do a quick exercise just for you.

123
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:51,620
A quick look at the data border, but the conditions set for data usage include that you would not attempt to identify any individual.

124
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:57,920
The data sets do not have any.

125
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:02,300
At least the ones that are publicly available do not have any identifiers.

126
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:11,110
But I think this is just set for people who might be thinking about doing something based on maybe some computer program or so,

127
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:15,770
to just let it be known that no attempt should be made to identify anybody

128
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:20,480
in a data set because it becomes problematic who wants that information out?

129
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:28,490
And then for everybody to have access to that, the data would be used only for research, reporting purposes,

130
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:35,510
and then no specific outcomes will be presented by hospitals or compared across hospitals.

131
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:42,590
And so why do you think that this is important for our ability to have access to these data,

132
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:50,690
not to have any specific outcomes reported by hospitals across hospitals?

133
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:06,480
So consider that we are collecting this data to be able to inform public health practice,

134
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:13,170
to inform where maybe specific needs are in terms of prevention.

135
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:26,980
And then if we start using this information to present cancer incidence or cancer outcome by hospital, it might have a bad outlook for the hospital.

136
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:35,580
Right. So if you have a lot of people dying from a particular cancer that's associated with giving a hospital,

137
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:47,010
then that's bad press for that particular hospital. And part of our ability to get data from these different locations is the relationship

138
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:52,980
between the care program staff and the hospitals that are available in those regions.

139
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:56,820
And so if we are collecting data from the hospital and then publishing,

140
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:06,180
this is the annual report of cancer mortality for U of A, I don't think your mom is going to like that.

141
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:18,030
The second thing about that is that if we're just reporting outcomes by hospital without taking into account who's going to those hospitals,

142
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:23,280
how severe that cancer was by the time they got to those hospitals, it can be misleading.

143
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:33,570
So, for example, you have specialty cancer centers where people go when they have severe disease, aggressive disease or maybe end stage disease.

144
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:41,160
And so you might have a high mortality associated with those centers.

145
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,760
It's not because the centers are not doing what they need to be doing,

146
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:53,070
but it also plays into who's going to those centers, how sick are they, and then how late they're going to be treated.

147
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:59,120
And so trying to present information by hospital can be a little bit misleading.

148
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:09,420
And I and I can see how people could take that information as it's presented and then have a bad press for that particular location.

149
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:17,740
So what types of data collected by this program as expected?

150
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:21,490
We have demographic information. So you have name, date of birth.

151
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,880
Specifically, you have Social Security number.

152
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:32,890
And this is going to be very important when we think about how this data set is linked to the Medicare data set.

153
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:40,720
And then for clinical information, there's detailed information collected on the of the cancer.

154
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:50,610
So this site, the stage diagnostic information, everything that's related to that cancer clinically is collected in this data.

155
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:54,040
There's also information on treatment.

156
00:18:54,490 --> 00:19:03,969
When I was surgery, what I was just chemo, radiation, and then also this information on follow up and their information,

157
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:12,820
then pieces of information also on the location, the treating doctor and then the follow up physician.

158
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:24,429
And so we have a wealth of data in terms of cancer incidence, cancer treatment, sometimes outcome, but we're missing some key information.

159
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:32,960
And so think about this for a minute and let me know your thoughts on what do you think would be missing from this dataset is comprehensive,

160
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:39,220
is missing some valuable information that we need as epidemiologists to study cancer.

161
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:57,210
And if anyone want to try. Like what information get missing.

162
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:07,060
Yes. So. Yes.

163
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:14,290
So we're missing that. But before we get to that point, what would be some of the key information from one of the study?

164
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:18,490
Cancer incidence, cancer prevalence?

165
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:22,270
What would be some of the key information that we need as epidemiologists?

166
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:27,710
What do we primarily do? Yes. A family.

167
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:32,810
Family history would be one. Any other types?

168
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:41,940
So exposure information, so family histories would be considered exposure information.

169
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:49,020
So this data center has a wealth of information on incidence, prevalence, treatment and then outcomes.

170
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:56,170
But what we do primarily epidemiology and we want to understand the relationship between exposure and an outcome.

171
00:20:56,190 --> 00:21:00,030
And this is primarily missing in this particular data set.

172
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,250
They are collecting the data that they need for their program. But for us as epidemiologists,

173
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:12,660
we quickly realize that we don't have information on understanding some of the factors associated with cancer incidence.

174
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:23,180
And then before we move on to the Medicare data set, which will tell us a little bit more about some information on exposure.

175
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:27,320
I want you to be aware of other cancer data resources.

176
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:33,410
So the national program of Cancer Registries is a program run by the CDC.

177
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:42,290
And this program was established in 1992 when it became clear that this year program was not

178
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:48,470
producing enough information to give us a full picture of the story of cancer in the U.S.

179
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:58,310
So we have local data for certain areas and then in certain states, SEER program did not operate in those states.

180
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:05,930
And based on that, we had no local information about cancer incidence prevalence in outcome.

181
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:10,100
So similar to what we had when engaged in.

182
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:17,840
He has representative data on the entire U.S., but we are missing information for local areas.

183
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:24,170
And so just how put first steps in and then gives us information for local, state data.

184
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:32,150
We have the ability with the national program of cancer registries complementing the data collected by SEER.

185
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:42,440
And so together, those two programs provide coverage for around 96% of the population in the U.S. in terms of cancer incidence,

186
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:51,730
prevalence and outcome data. So quickly, we're going to do an exercise.

187
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:56,930
So you have a sense of how the platform looks and how it works.

188
00:22:57,530 --> 00:23:07,490
So take a look at the Sea Explorer. Go to do a quick Google search for your Explorer and you can click Get Started.

189
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:15,950
And we're going to generate two. Plus one would be four age adjusted incidence rates of breast cancer in white and black women.

190
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:22,010
And then the second one would be it adjusted mortality rates of breast cancer in white and black women.

191
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:27,650
And once you generate those plots, take a look at the plots.

192
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:32,540
What do you notice in the plots? How have rates change over time?

193
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:37,280
And then look at the differences between the two groups.

194
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:41,990
So I give you a few minutes to take a little at.

195
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:36,900
So remember, we're doing long term trends. Let me know if you have difficulty finding how to get to the long term trends.

196
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:21,010
Were you able to get to the site and find the information?

197
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:28,810
Okay. So for the incidents, take a quick look and see whether your image looks something like this.

198
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:40,270
Maybe I spend a little bit of 2019, but if it looks something similar to this, it should be fun.

199
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:57,280
Are you also? Let me know if you need help getting to this.

200
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:19,220
If your image goes all the way to 2019, that's fine.

201
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:36,850
My say it 1975 to 2019. That's okay. All right.

202
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:45,380
So let's take a look at what we have on the screen here. So this is long term trends using seer age adjusted incidence rates.

203
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:51,110
I have 1975 to 2018, but you might have up to 2090.

204
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:58,520
And this is by race, ethnicity. And then this is if you select females.

205
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:08,920
So make sure you're selecting females instead of all. Available participants.

206
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:17,720
So somebody like to explain what we see in this first image here.

207
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:32,619
So on the Y axis we have rate per 100,000 and then we had the year of diagnosis.

208
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:39,820
So we have time. Anybody want to give it a try and show us what we're seeing?

209
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:56,730
So I try with the first one and hopefully maybe some of them will try for the difference.

210
00:28:57,330 --> 00:29:06,420
So what we are seeing, we are looking at Asia, just that incidence rate of breast cancer and we are preparing to race there.

211
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:10,640
So we do have black and white individuals, including Hispanics.

212
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,660
And we see over time that.

213
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:26,640
White individuals have had higher breast cancer incidence rates throughout the entire period.

214
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:32,490
Evaluating except for this one point way seemed like it was cool as well as very brief.

215
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:47,730
But across the entire period that's evaluated in this image, we see higher rates of breast cancer among white women and lower rates among black women.

216
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:59,459
We see also that during the earlier period the difference was bigger compared to the latter period.

217
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:10,200
So the last decade or so, the difference has closed a little bit compared to the earlier period, at least up to 2003.

218
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:16,440
And this is consistent over time for the entire time frame.

219
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:23,850
Now, let's look at the age, adjust their mortality rates, comparing the same two groups.

220
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:29,280
And I will give you a moment to process what the image looks like,

221
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:35,339
and I'll ask if somebody would like to explain why what we have on the screen

222
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:39,750
and anybody wants to share their thoughts about why this may be the case.

223
00:30:40,350 --> 00:31:09,230
We have a two year. Anybody would like to try.

224
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:17,410
Yes. So since about. 26.

225
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:34,980
Mortality rate for black women. Thank you.

226
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:40,920
And so you just mentioned the difference in mortality rates.

227
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:53,460
And even though we have a big gap in mortality rates between white and black women, both rates have declined over time.

228
00:31:54,180 --> 00:32:03,750
But we can see the difference between the two groups have remained consistent, even though you have a decline over the last 20 or so years.

229
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:12,840
But isn't it interesting that we start with the incidence rates where you have higher rates among white women,

230
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:19,200
but for mortality rates, you have higher mortality rates among African-American women.

231
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:30,180
I think three or four weeks ago there was a headline primarily highlighting this very same information, I think, on WXYZ.

232
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:35,430
And I thought it was really interesting looking at the data from this site.

233
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:42,389
And so what could possibly be some of the reasons why we are seeing such huge differences in

234
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:49,020
mortality and quite a different picture from what we see for incidence compared to mortality.

235
00:32:49,710 --> 00:33:10,430
Any thoughts on why this could be the case? It's possible that we have people presenting to the health system a little bit with more advanced disease.

236
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:13,040
And so when you have more advanced disease,

237
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:21,990
there's a higher probability that the outcome will be quickly leading to mortality compared to those who are presenting early on.

238
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:27,620
Where in the cancer could be treated and or in some cases go into remission.

239
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:34,000
And some of the factors associated with why people show up a little bit later,

240
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:37,730
then we get to those factors such as the ability to have health coverage.

241
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:44,810
Sometimes you have a situation where people have more aggressive disease and sometimes that can be different by race.

242
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:50,060
But there are just so many factors that could play into why we are seeing such a huge difference

243
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:55,850
between what we see with incidence and what we see when it comes to the mortality rates.

244
00:33:56,810 --> 00:34:03,920
So if you're interested in cancer data, you're free to visit our site and play around with the information.

245
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:07,460
It doesn't have to be breast cancer. It doesn't have to be about females.

246
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:11,780
And you have an opportunity to break that cancer down into.

247
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,490
So even if it's breast cancer,

248
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:22,310
you can break it down by the subtype if you are interested in getting funding information on the different cancers in your body.

249
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:28,520
Any question about using the site or the information presented in these two graphs?

250
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:41,590
And then next, we move on to the sources of cancer information on a global scale.

251
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:47,110
So there are two major sources of cancer information on a global scale.

252
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:53,460
Interestingly, both of those sources, they are run by the same organization.

253
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:57,130
So the International Agency for Research on Cancer.

254
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:02,230
The cancer incidence in five continents.

255
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:11,680
It has data that are reliable and high quality data.

256
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:20,380
And so you will see places like the U.S. will be included in the cancer incidence in five continents dataset.

257
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:27,130
On the other hand, we talk about some places in parts of the world where we don't have reliable data.

258
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:40,510
Last we talk about drugs, where you have less than preferable registration of births and deaths in some parts of the world.

259
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:53,020
And so global can use this what available data for certain parts of the world that are available to generate estimates of cancer incidence,

260
00:35:53,020 --> 00:36:00,940
mortality and prevalence in these locations. And because of the different quality of the data sets that are going into these estimates,

261
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:08,380
they are separate from the ones what we have cancer registry data, or at least more reliable data.

262
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:14,440
So you have an opportunity if you go to this link.

263
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:17,110
We're not going to do that in class today.

264
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:23,440
But if you have time and you're interested in cancer incidence, you can take a look at this interactive tool.

265
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:27,430
You are able to look at data for cancer incidence,

266
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:35,620
cancer prevalence and mortality associated with different types of cancer for many parts of the world.

267
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:41,410
And this is very useful information where you have an interactive tool that you can generate maps,

268
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:46,150
you can generate a table for information that you might be interested in.

269
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:50,260
So I encourage you to take a look if you are interested in cancer data.

270
00:36:51,700 --> 00:37:01,930
So this is one image from that site and it has estimated age standardized rates of incidence, both sexes.

271
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:05,650
You can break the data down by sex. You can do age groups.

272
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:09,730
It's just very interactive. And I encourage you to take a look if you have time.

273
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:13,540
And so we we have different rates.

274
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:26,620
And you had this legend here to let you know which areas have information on rates and the rates that are different based on lower or lighter colors.

275
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:31,720
Some areas you still have no data. And so don't be surprised if you see no data.

276
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:41,870
So cancel coverage in terms of registration or why we see that in North America, we have very high coverage.

277
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:48,230
Other parts of the world, you have a very different story in terms of cancer registration.

278
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:54,580
The estimated 8% of the population covered. You're seeing up here around 2000.

279
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:59,540
You see South America, you have about 13%.

280
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:07,760
Africa, you have 7.9%. So very different coverage across certain parts of the world.

281
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:15,740
And which makes sense when you think about the cancer incidence in five continents versus the global can

282
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:22,460
because imagine combining these two data sets where you have very different coverage could be very misleading.

283
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:30,209
And then for cancer mortality, you have coverage where North America,

284
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:39,000
you have 100% in other parts of the world, you have very different coverage in terms of cancer mortality.

285
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:48,490
Any question about that brief overview of sources for global cancer data.

286
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:55,450
But next to a movie on the Medicare program.

287
00:38:57,340 --> 00:39:03,400
And we are talking about Medicare because we are then going to be talking about the Medicare linkage,

288
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:13,480
which allows us to have information on a subset of the population to then understand some of the risk factors associated with cancer incidence.

289
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:25,420
So the Medicare program is a federally funded health insurance plan for individuals who are 65 and older and also for individuals who are disabled.

290
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:33,400
And so 95% of persons who are 65 and older are eligible for the Medicare program.

291
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:41,510
So the Medicare program, they collect data based on what the program is all about.

292
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:46,130
Keep in mind, the program is not intended for public health research,

293
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:52,340
but we are able to use it because we have this rich source of data similar to some of the data sets we've covered.

294
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:58,730
They are not primarily intended for public health purposes, but we are able to use the data.

295
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:04,490
And so primarily Medicare data really is an administrative data set.

296
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:15,260
It's primarily intended to process Medicare claims and to do that information session about including diagnosis,

297
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:21,980
the date of service, where the service was done need to be included in the administrative data set.

298
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:25,390
And so the hospital clinic visit,

299
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:32,180
outpatient tests are all part of the information you need that will be in the bill that will be submitted to the Medicare program.

300
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:40,140
So far, the Medicare data said some of the data available publicly.

301
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:47,250
So if you're looking for information on hospitals, nursing homes, providers, you can find this information publicly.

302
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:55,290
But data that include individual information, they are not publicly available, but you can still access them.

303
00:40:56,040 --> 00:41:01,500
Of course, you have to pay a fee for the data, but you are able to access those data for your research.

304
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:13,020
So this year, Medicare linked data allows us to combine to link SEER data with Medicare data.

305
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:16,020
And what this allows us to do,

306
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:26,160
it allows us to then have some information about what are some of the factors that people have before being diagnosed with a given cancer.

307
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:33,090
And with that, we then have information now to understand risk factors associated with cancer incidence.

308
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:40,670
So this table is from a paper that I talked about this year.

309
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:43,299
Medicare data specifically,

310
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:52,960
you have different types of files that will give you information about those with the cancer program, which will be easier.

311
00:41:53,500 --> 00:42:02,590
And then you have other data sets that can be used for your if you wanted to do a study looking at the Medicare data.

312
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:06,220
So you have data that might result from a hospital visit.

313
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:10,720
You have data that might result from a visit with a physician.

314
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:17,740
And then you also have all patient files that are associated with the Medicare data set and all of

315
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:23,920
those data sets continuing useful information for you to be able to use the combined with your data.

316
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:32,440
Six. So the Metcalf file is the one that's associated with the hospital visit.

317
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:36,640
And so you have a record that has information about your hospital.

318
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:42,489
Hospital stay the date that the person was admitted to the hospital when they

319
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:46,630
were discharged and all of the medical diagnosis associated with that visit.

320
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:56,440
And so we we're able to pull some information about co-morbidities that somebody answered about what assistance conditions that they have.

321
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:03,370
And then you have information about the procedures and the associated dates for those procedures.

322
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:11,710
Then there's the physician supplier file which has information about your physician visit.

323
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:22,179
Those going for just an outpatient visit will also generate a file that has information about diagnosis, the data service,

324
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:30,100
the provider information, and all of the information necessary for Medicare to process the the claim for payment.

325
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:39,610
And then there's also the outpatient clean file where you have, again, similar information,

326
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:50,060
the date of the the procedure, the timeframe, the diagnoses associated with that particular outpatient visit.

327
00:43:51,830 --> 00:44:05,060
So based on the data we are able to get from Medicare, we have a spectrum for how reliable the data are for trying to understand exposure.

328
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:16,670
So when it comes to billing the hospital, the health center will collect accurate information about hospital procedures, hospital diagnoses.

329
00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:23,030
And so those information are truly accurate as it relates to what we can use the data for.

330
00:44:23,990 --> 00:44:29,690
Both are lifestyle factors, maybe assisting medication that people are taking.

331
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:34,280
It's possible those information will be missing to a certain extent.

332
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:40,880
So when you go for a medicare of people who are eligible for Medicare, when they go for that visit,

333
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:46,520
they are not going to be routinely collected about certain conditions.

334
00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:57,080
But if a person is there for a medical visit, that's going to talk about whether that person is dealing with obesity complications,

335
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:00,440
then that's going to show up in the medical records.

336
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:05,240
But if the person is a person who has a high BMI,

337
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:12,080
but that particular visit has nothing to do with their obesity status, that's not going to be required.

338
00:45:12,650 --> 00:45:18,290
And because of that, you have to be mindful about what's reported and whether that gives you a full

339
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:24,230
capture of these conditions that you might be interested in evaluating as exposures.

340
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:33,470
So if that visit is going to have something related to maybe bariatric surgery, then it's going to be recording.

341
00:45:33,890 --> 00:45:41,810
If the patient is asking for a pass for their smoking habit is going to be recorded.

342
00:45:42,290 --> 00:45:48,590
But if the person is a smoker but the visit has nothing to do with their smoking, it's possible it's not going to be reported.

343
00:45:49,010 --> 00:45:53,750
And so when we think about using Medicare data with the C program,

344
00:45:54,140 --> 00:46:00,710
we also need to be thinking about how we might be missing some factors, even for people who have those exposures.

345
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:07,100
The exposure would not show up in the data if there's not a medical reason for it to be brought up during that visit.

346
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:13,990
Any question about this? Okay.

347
00:46:15,790 --> 00:46:18,759
So the Medicare data, again, they're available.

348
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:25,150
Some of them are available, especially ones that are associated with the hospital or the health center.

349
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:32,200
Those are publicly available. But for individual level data, they are not publicly available.

350
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:37,570
So you'll have to submit a request and get an approval.

351
00:46:38,110 --> 00:46:44,830
And their approval is not really to critique what your research proposal is, sound or anything.

352
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:55,660
It's more so the investigators are aware that they need to ensure that the data ever be confidential and to be able to protect patient information.

353
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:05,650
And for some of these data, especially if you want to link the SIA Medicare data, the Medicare data to the SEER data,

354
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:10,390
you need to be able to have unique identifiers to be able to make that connection.

355
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:16,840
If you are just using SEER data like we just did on the site, you don't need that unique identifier.

356
00:47:17,230 --> 00:47:24,040
But to be able to combine the data with an existing data set, you will need a unique identifier for that.

357
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:35,800
There's a cost associated with acquiring the individual level data, and it's around $2,000 for one cancer site.

358
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:41,330
So analyzing the Medicare data can be really, really complicated.

359
00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:51,590
But there are opportunities for people to take a training course at the National Cancer Institute.

360
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:59,870
Even though it's not required, you can still try to have access to the data and then maybe try first and realize it's really complicated.

361
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:02,900
Then don't take the course. But it's not a requirement.

362
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:08,420
But in order for you to be able to use the data in a way that's useful, some training will be necessary.

363
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:13,700
All of you can hire a statistician who's familiar with the data so they can analyze the data for the.

364
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:25,810
Any question about population based registries, seer, global care or the Medicare data set.

365
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:36,040
All right. So the next part of class, you will then have time to work on your group projects.

366
00:48:36,430 --> 00:48:40,120
Remember, if you are done, you don't have to stay. You can call your day.

367
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,180
If you have questions, I'll be here to answer your question.
