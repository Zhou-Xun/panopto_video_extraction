1
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:13,980
Okay. I think that's good. And so, you know, folks have been worried about water quality for many, many years.

2
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:20,640
As I said in the intro, sort of the modern era began in the seventies with the Clean Water Act and so forth.

3
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:27,510
But, you know, you have to realize how bad it was before the Cuyahoga River caught on fire.

4
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:32,310
Right. The Rouge River in Detroit, just 30 miles from here, caught on fire.

5
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:40,200
Okay. How could this be? You know, I mean, it's just dumping of waste inside these water bodies.

6
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:49,320
And with the assumption that, you know, dilution is the solution to pollution kind of thing, moves it to my neighbor, gets it out of my my province.

7
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,980
So anyway, a lot of these models have been around for decades.

8
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,600
And some of the ones that are used are listed on this slide.

9
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:02,550
They include exam system, which is a steady state model.

10
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:06,600
Steady state means things don't change over time. Okay.

11
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:14,850
Which can model many different types of things that's typically used for organics with fairly complex partitioning and so forth.

12
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:25,110
There's a stream water quality model called Qual too, which is very similar in a way to the St or Phelps model,

13
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:29,880
except it's got a lot more built into it, and we'll talk about that in a little more detail.

14
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:34,590
These are fresh water systems, really, both of these two models.

15
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:47,880
Storm water is a whole nother thing. Very interesting news on storm water in arid areas because there is so little water available in some locations.

16
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:53,489
The reservoirs have dried up. Groundwater levels are sinking.

17
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:59,490
We're going to spend time on groundwater. And, you know, why not use that wastewater?

18
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:06,740
So how many of you would drink wastewater? No, of course not.

19
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:10,760
You know, it's full of pathogens, right? Chemicals. How about cleaned up wastewater?

20
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:17,750
I think it's that much different from that bottle that you get that says Perrier or whatever.

21
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:26,300
So, I mean, so people are experimenting now with injecting wastewater into aquifers which are used for drinking water.

22
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:35,990
And some countries are using it directly, cleaning it up and drinking it, which in lifecycle sort of sense may make more sense.

23
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:46,640
Maybe we'll talk about that. So anyway, stormwater management models have been mostly concerned with quantity, but quality is a big issue, too.

24
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:55,240
There's agricultural models. There is a very capable simulation called a hack.

25
00:02:55,250 --> 00:03:00,680
This is a series actually of models from the Army Corps of Engineers to deal with watershed hydrology.

26
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:08,870
So you have the lay of the land and this figures out how much water is going to be rushing down that culvert or that channel or a canal or whatever.

27
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:18,620
And it helps the engineer size these things properly and maybe in fact improve landscape and water management planning.

28
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:27,900
And then there is a very general framework called WASP, which is a containment and transport model, which is really generalizable.

29
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:35,000
It's basically a set of equations, and you just have to put it in the well, it's not just it's it's you have to define your system.

30
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:38,120
You have to put in parameters that are appropriate for it.

31
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:50,270
So I want to talk a little bit more about some of these models, and there's some texture on other models and yet more models.

32
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,720
And they have gotten very, very complicated. Okay.

33
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:57,440
And this is a nice picture because in this particular model,

34
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:05,300
it's linking together the different compartments that we have to try to stop that sinks stuff in the water column,

35
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,000
the plants, the animals and so forth.

36
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:18,110
And it provides links between all of these because they're all interacting with respect to contaminant levels that are found in down at the bottom.

37
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:20,270
We have their burial into the sediment.

38
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:32,020
And so this is a very sophisticated model, but it deals with the bio energetics and the multiple trophic levels that you can see here.

39
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:34,130
And at the end of the unit here,

40
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:42,470
I talk about bio magnification and basically it is that increasing concentration as you move to higher trophic levels.

41
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:52,970
And so this is just, again, representing some of those linkages between inflows of nutrients and contaminants, cycling, bio concentration.

42
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:58,069
And in fact, they show phytoplankton trophic level ones who are plankton,

43
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:02,990
eat the phytoplankton, and then some of the forage fish because who plankton.

44
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:11,630
And then you would have the predator fish. You perform fish giving you a fourth level of sort of concentration here.

45
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:21,020
And the impact of this bio concentration is for certain contaminants like PCBs.

46
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:28,100
Amazing. Okay. Or dioxins or DDT and so forth.

47
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:35,060
Okay. But the one I want to talk about a little bit is called qual to qual to K is the current version.

48
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:43,580
This model has multiple constituents that it models in essentially a mass balance manner.

49
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:53,060
So it is preserving mass and they include dissolved oxygen body the right temperature.

50
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:58,399
You don't really do mass balance for temperature, but it does. It doesn't really do a thermal balance.

51
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:04,250
Its empirical for temperature to say algae nitrogen in several forms,

52
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:17,740
organic ammonia nitrate and nitrate phosphorus and several forms coliforms if you want, and any other kind of arbitrary non-conservative constituent.

53
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:25,340
And of course, different models, a non-conservative constituent. You can model a conservative constituent by simply turning the reaction rate to zero.

54
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:31,160
Okay, so it's quite good that way. And so you've got three conservative constituents.

55
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:37,550
This is a stream model. It's applicable to what we call dendritic streams.

56
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:43,610
And I'll show you a picture. And it's assuming that they're, well, mixed horizontally and vertically.

57
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:54,380
Okay. In a reach. And it accounts for major transport mechanisms, advection the flow, the current dispersion, the mixing due to eddies,

58
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:03,620
and it allows for multiple sources, tributary flows, incremental inflows and outflows and.

59
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:16,980
It's used in many cases to make sure that oxygen levels don't drop too much because you'll have fish kills and it's used for the tidal issue.

60
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:26,920
The total maximum daily loads that can be assimilated in water by questions on any of it will make sense to you.

61
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:36,700
Okay. So the structure is mathematically a differential equation.

62
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:42,550
The change in confidence in mass with respect to time is this mess.

63
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:46,920
Okay. But if you look at this mess, you should recognize a couple of things.

64
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:52,150
You've got dispersion coefficient. So this accounts for sort of the mixing.

65
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:58,150
Okay. It's got a u turn here, which is the river velocity.

66
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,180
So this accounts for flow. Okay.

67
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:08,900
It's got a. What is my reaction from?

68
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:21,150
Maybe a user reaction from their accounts for change in first order indicator or whatever.

69
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:27,330
And then it's got an S term, which is a source term, so you can dump anybody or or whatever.

70
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:41,520
And it is complicated to the model is representing all of the processes shown by arrows here with the constituents being in boxes at the center,

71
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:51,660
we have the amount dissolved oxygen in the water body. Now, on this kind of diagram, you should understand arrows and boxes here.

72
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:58,380
Okay. Okay. Some of the dissolved oxygen is degraded with carbonaceous biological oxygen event.

73
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:06,060
Some of it goes into the sediment, some of it will go into algae, but algae can also produce oxygen.

74
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,170
So the earth goes back into dissolved oxygen box. Okay.

75
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:16,170
So it's a balance that way. Some of it's used in a nitrogen cycle in a couple of different compartments here.

76
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:20,760
And importantly, most of the oxygen comes from the top.

77
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:27,950
They can't reach atmospheric variation. Okay. So it's coming in with a rate constant that you guys know as K2.

78
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:33,520
Okay. Same K2 that I've asked you to look at. All right.

79
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:39,240
What is kind of interesting about this model is it also represents the growth of algae.

80
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:44,940
And so if you have enough nutrients coming in and oxygen for algae,

81
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:51,270
the population can increase, some of the algae will die and get incorporated into the sediment.

82
00:09:52,020 --> 00:10:01,740
A lot of the sediment compartment is also the ultimate sink for some of the carbon in the system and some of the nitrogen in the system as well.

83
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:09,540
So it's a spaghetti diagram, but it represents in a conceptual way the linkage between the different compartments.

84
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:14,040
And for me, it shows the central role of diesel dissolved oxygen.

85
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:22,200
Makes sense. So this crazy model here is simply applied to this system.

86
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:28,820
Okay. Now. What's fun to think about is how you use this model.

87
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:40,220
And essentially you would take the stream and break it down into reaches and you call the reach with some subscript I or whatever.

88
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:49,280
So take out the i3. Water is flowing into it from the IFE minus one reach and being discharged into the IFE plus one reach.

89
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:52,850
Because it's the dendritic model. It's kind of linear in this way.

90
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:57,320
In each of these reaches, we assume all mixing.

91
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:07,100
We have different parameters that come in, different sources, different temperatures, oxygen levels, flows and so forth.

92
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:11,960
And you can use a reactor model first. In fact, it is a reactor model.

93
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,770
The only difference is it's a complex reactor model doing all of this stuff.

94
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:30,190
So you can take a realist extreme where the mainstream tributaries block up into different reaches,

95
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:37,720
put in the tributaries, put this together in call to K and it will solve this system for you.

96
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:44,830
Okay. Kind of a steady state model, but you can run it over time as well.

97
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:49,750
This particular depiction here has 67 segments or reaches.

98
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:54,130
That's quite a few. Each of those reaches has dozens of parameters.

99
00:11:54,640 --> 00:12:00,100
So right away I worry about where am I getting this data from? Okay, what's the volume of the water?

100
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:06,280
The temperature of dissolved oxygen, the inflow, the roughness, phosphorous, all of these other chemical levels.

101
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:12,820
I get bacteria even from doing pathogens. Okay, we're good with this.

102
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:23,130
Questions on this. So people who might model a river with this have probably been doing it for a long time.

103
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:27,270
And each year they rerun it and refine it and it gets a little bit better.

104
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:34,500
But the underlying structure and mechanisms are pretty developed.

105
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:44,310
Well, since I have these others up. So that was just a river.

106
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:52,200
You could imagine all kinds of human activities that might affect water quality as shown in the green box here.

107
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:58,920
And then you could imagine how they might impact different parameters that are in the water body,

108
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:08,940
everything from ammonia to nitrogen and phosphorus, organic levels, heat, light, sediment, quality variability of flows and so forth.

109
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,530
And then you can couple that to and points of interest.

110
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,430
In this case, perhaps the ultimate endpoint might be fish levels.

111
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:26,040
And what species that are going to be able to survive and perhaps flourish in those kinds of things.

112
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:33,480
So this would be called a kind of integrated ecological model because it's dealing with all of these different aspects.

113
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:41,160
This is more in kind of the research domain than, say, the quoll, too,

114
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:48,780
which is a very pragmatic sample by comparison style of model that would be used by water quality managers.

115
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:57,630
This might be used to assess, for example, what happens if we change one of these human activities,

116
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:06,120
maybe put in buffers to protect the riparian areas or the the boundary of a stream, something like that.

117
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:13,830
But very complex. Well, since I'm on a roll here, I'm going to go on and I'm going to stop.

118
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:27,240
So, you know, the the specter of climate change where we now have rainfall levels changing or precipitation patterns changing,

119
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:36,330
means that we have flows that might be changing over time in different ways from historical averages

120
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:41,760
means we might need a modeling system to try to figure out how we're going to handle all these things.

121
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:53,489
And this picture here is basically trying to look at the way you might put together some of these types of groundwater, not groundwater,

122
00:14:53,490 --> 00:15:03,480
mostly water quality, surface water quality models where you have a recharge for a water base and you have flows that are generated on a daily basis.

123
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:06,610
It can be coupled to groundwater flow.

124
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:16,340
And and again, it's just trying to represent think how you might handle some of the variability with these coupled models.

125
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:24,430
And so this is also called a decision or optimization support tool.

126
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:33,760
And there are a variety of these. One of the issues is that if you actually try to use these kind of mechanistic models,

127
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:39,920
which are very complicated, it might not be practical to change things too much.

128
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:44,170
They're just just too complicated, too slow, too many experts.

129
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,320
So there is an alternative kind of approach,

130
00:15:47,740 --> 00:16:00,910
which is to use very simplified systems which get at maybe 80 or 90% of the problem and still can be useful for sort of exploring different options.

131
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:11,050
And in this slide here, we're talking about, for example, management practices that might deal with water supply or wastewater or whatever.

132
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:16,780
We're talking about cost benefit analysis and the period of fracture tradeoff,

133
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:22,930
which is kind of the best that I can do for a given amount of input into a system.

134
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:28,780
So, you know, if I have a, I don't know, $100 million, what's the best that I can do to improve water quality?

135
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:37,180
So this would also be considered a screening tool because it's fairly straightforward.

136
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:45,520
And I want to emphasize with screening tools, the major purpose is to screen out bad options.

137
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:49,030
Okay. So these are things that you don't want to pursue.

138
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:55,510
They're not going to be good enough to tell you the best thing, but they'll be good enough to tell you, don't do this.

139
00:16:55,540 --> 00:17:01,569
This is a waste of time. Okay. These are the things this is a subset of options that you should look at.

140
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:02,680
And, you know,

141
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:13,450
you may need to use what we call more detailed modeling with a subset to come up with maybe a period of optimal or some preferred option.

142
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:20,110
So that makes sense. Do we ever do this? Or is this just an academic telling you this?

143
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:26,820
You shake your head. You think we do it? Pretty academic.

144
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:33,910
Yeah. It's a mixed bag. Okay.

145
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:42,850
I mean, quite frankly, it's a very mixed bag because, I mean, you have lots of, you know, real world constraints, political pressures and so forth.

146
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:46,720
But we have done this in the past in a number of different cases.

147
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:52,720
Okay. All right.

148
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:59,830
So anyway, these kinds of optimization or decision support tools themselves can get very complicated as well.

149
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:11,890
And when you are looking at, for example, re-using wastewater to recharge freshwater systems, you do need to have a pretty solid argument.

150
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:17,460
Okay. That you've you've addressed all these things and you won't be the first to think about these.

151
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:22,720
There's a lot of models that are available as depicted in the slides that I'm showing you.

152
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:31,950
So this model is actually simple enough to run in a spreadsheet. Okay.

153
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:38,790
So, you know, again, it's a screen level model, but it does consider lots of different options.

154
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:50,040
On Friday is having lunch with a I guess he's an executive one of our former students for an oil company in there want to become sustainable.

155
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:58,770
So right away this is kind of a contradiction in a lot of ways because, you know, they're pumping out oil, gas, taking lots of CO2.

156
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:06,300
But he was particularly concerned about water because oil and gas business is one of the largest water consumers as well.

157
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:12,000
Okay. And so he was putting in incentives into place to get the company.

158
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:19,800
And this is a multinational, one of the larger oil and gas companies to reduce water consumption.

159
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:32,700
And his approach was very corporate to build it into your salary structure, if you can incentivize and reduce water consumption.

160
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:38,370
Okay. And build it into the company's metrics that.

161
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:45,800
But. I'm not saying if it's going to work, but it was an approach which hasn't been done before.

162
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:54,470
And people typically do want to get a high review in as they advance the corporate ladder and building this into the salary structure.

163
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:00,470
Maybe it's an innovative, maybe it's effective, but it doesn't deal with the big picture.

164
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:08,660
I would grant that, but it does deal with work. What do you think about that?

165
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:18,700
It's innovative and surprising.

166
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:23,410
I doing something like that for company.

167
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:29,660
If you want me to generate ideas too. You're not looking for just one person.

168
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:39,080
What do you mean? Well, depending on who you intended to use, you know it's not going to be just one person.

169
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:46,180
No, no, but it's through the corporate structure. And they have how many thousands, tens of thousands of employees.

170
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:52,010
So, you know, some of it filters down if somebody comes up with a good way to figure out how to save some water.

171
00:20:52,340 --> 00:21:02,719
Yeah. And again, you know, they are drilling and pumping in across the world, including some amazingly arid environments.

172
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,380
You know, that water has to come from somewhere. But then you.

173
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:12,980
I don't know. I'm out of the corporate governance world for the most part.

174
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,820
It's been a long time since I worked matters, but filtering these ideas into the corporate world is really important.

175
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:26,320
And one of the big gaps that I think we have is a disconnect between often all the players,

176
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:31,810
you know, whether it's communities, their employers, the corporate folks.

177
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:40,420
So maybe this. Well, anyway, let's go to the mundane world of the spreadsheets here.

178
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,500
Okay. Since Monday, citing spreadsheets.

179
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:54,260
Okay. So protected view and able editing.

180
00:21:54,950 --> 00:22:03,620
Okay. So generally when I do a spreadsheet model, I have a read me or a notes page and a document.

181
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:07,100
What I've done on this since the last time I've updated it,

182
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:14,150
it's a really good practice to have if you're developing any kind of analysis just to keep on track of things.

183
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:19,550
And then there's a couple of different tabs. And you guys have explored this already, I assume, right?

184
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:24,500
Mm hmm. Okay. Very good. So I'm only going to do a few things on this.

185
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,690
The first is to run the optimizer, and I don't haven't done it on this computer,

186
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:40,560
but I need to go to home options, add ins and down here, excel add ins.

187
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:45,470
And, you know, you can run add ins and excel from other players as well.

188
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:49,460
Okay. And then it has nothing in here. So I need to check.

189
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:54,440
The only one I really need to check is the solver added. Okay.

190
00:22:55,820 --> 00:23:00,260
And hopefully it'll work. It doesn't kind of so good.

191
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:05,210
Okay. So that's first thing you need to do. Everybody's got to that point.

192
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:09,080
Oh, why am I even here? Okay, you guys are good.

193
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:22,670
Okay, so this model is representing a to reach system where we have that Streeter Phelps implementation on a stream.

194
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:30,740
And basically it will produce this oxygen SAG curve that I talked about last week, I guess.

195
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:37,580
And, you know, we want to keep that oxygen curve from hitting rock bottom here.

196
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:50,570
And it goes down because we have a lot of biological oxygen demand shown on this curve here that has to be metabolized.

197
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:55,490
Okay. So anyway, on reach one, let me stop.

198
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:58,900
What questions do you have? So many.

199
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:08,470
All right. Go for it. I mean, everyone understands this.

200
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:15,560
This model is put into these two reaches, which are represented on the thoughts here right now.

201
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:18,759
Could you explain that? Okay. Sure. All right.

202
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:24,220
So each one is representing a section of a stream.

203
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:27,970
And in here, I give all the inputs in the parameters.

204
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:32,470
And essentially the temperature in this section of the stream is 20 degrees C.

205
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:38,470
There are some rate constants, K1 and K2 that are important for dissolved oxygen levels.

206
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:45,430
K One is the body reaction time, the first order. K two Is that deal replacement or re?

207
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:54,460
The dose saturated level is how much oxygen can be in that water.

208
00:24:54,940 --> 00:25:05,050
That's a function of temperature. If I click on this, you can see the formula up here at the top and that is a function of temperature.

209
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:14,640
Okay. So if the temperature is at 20 degrees C like an old 9.37 milligrams per liter, okay.

210
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:19,030
If the temperature goes to 35, what's going to happen to dissolved oxygen?

211
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:30,610
It'll decrease. Okay. And it goes down to seven. That's bad because some of our deal requirements are like 5 to 7.

212
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:34,750
So just even having hot water fully saturated, we're in trouble.

213
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:40,000
Okay. I have to give some geometric parameters.

214
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:45,190
I'd put them in in feet. The depth is four feet, the width is 50 feet.

215
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:50,800
This is ten miles long, kind of like a Huron River size type of thing.

216
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:58,420
Okay. The flows coming into this stream are 200 cubic feet per second.

217
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:08,500
We should really be talking cubic meters or small units. There's some body coming into the stream, but it's only two milligrams per liter.

218
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:17,740
And if the water quality I'm sorry is pretty good, which it is, and I have only two milligrams per liter.

219
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:23,890
That shouldn't be a problem. Okay. Coming in because it's pretty little body.

220
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:29,799
However, I have a lateral flow but don't build from a wastewater treatment plant coming into

221
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:35,950
this stream and that lateral flow is 50 cubic feet per second or what's that,

222
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:43,029
a quarter of the flow. And that's coming in with a body of 250 kilograms per liter.

223
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:48,820
That's quite a lot. Okay. So what's going to happen to my dissolved oxygen level at the head of the stream?

224
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:52,630
It's seven. By dumping all this waste, it's going to pour it.

225
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:57,160
Okay, because I have a lot of beauty. Okay.

226
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,260
That's all the parameters.

227
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:13,480
Oh, and then also coming into the lateral flows, I have a at 250, but I also have a certain amount of dissolved oxygen in there.

228
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:15,620
It's not bad for dissolved oxygen six,

229
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:26,720
but that's a lot of body because you can imagine if you have 250 milligrams and my were desaturated it's only seven

230
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:37,310
I'm going to need what 40 so liters of water per liter of waste just to give it all that oxygen that it needs.

231
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:41,030
Okay, so that's bad. That's a lot of waste. Okay.

232
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:51,260
So when I put that in, what's going to happen is dissolved oxygen started at seven and dropped down to the end of this reach at ten miles down to,

233
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:58,730
I don't know, one or something like that. Okay. At that point we have the second reach and it's set up exactly the same.

234
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:05,450
The only difference is what's coming in is from reach one.

235
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:09,769
It has a flow, a body and a deal. So I don't enter this anymore.

236
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:13,579
It's coming in from that other reach. Okay, it's not all.

237
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:19,400
And I could put together 100 of these if I wanted. I gave you up here to coupled reaches here.

238
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:25,580
If we did that to enter an extreme, we would do this. It was 67 times or something like that.

239
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:30,649
Too boring. Okay, this is. Do you understand everything with us?

240
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:43,520
Okay, so that's it? Yeah. Have a relative sensitivity for the variables we're using compared with.

241
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:47,660
Yeah. The question for the. Yeah.

242
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:04,160
Okay. Let me make sure the running of this model is good for everybody.

243
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:16,790
Okay. Before I get to your question. So if I have here a system like this, my goal is to keep the dissolved oxygen level above five.

244
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:25,830
Right. How do I do that? She's that you can change.

245
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:32,070
Okay, so here's each one. What can I change? You want a lower body?

246
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:40,290
Okay, so the body. I have two bodies. I have the body coming in from upstream flows.

247
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:44,630
Lower lateral and lateral. Okay, so what do you want to change it?

248
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:50,430
I don't know. I'm dealing something little.

249
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:57,030
Well, okay, so this is now sort of an engineering issue because ideally it would be zero.

250
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:03,930
Okay. But realistically, there's absolutely no way you can take a giant flow and get all the body out of it.

251
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:10,230
Okay. Technically, it's increasing costs to lowering the body.

252
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:14,490
Okay. So I can take out half very easily. So let's let's do that.

253
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,780
Put in 125. Okay. And then stuff changes here.

254
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:22,530
But I like to look at it on the plot and things have gotten better for sure.

255
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:28,730
Okay. But I'm still not where I want to be. Okay.

256
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:32,370
So what I could do is go back and reduce it.

257
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:37,770
Oh, I don't know. By another bit.

258
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:45,960
Go to 75. Okay. So I'm down from 250 to 75 and looks like I'm doing pretty good in reach one.

259
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:54,570
Reach one only goes to ten miles. And at that point I have the second wastewater treatment plant discharging.

260
00:30:54,810 --> 00:31:01,440
Okay. But I would fail the water quality standard of keeping the deal level above five.

261
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:11,250
What do I do now? So I'm sorry, I'm sure leading to what you just did.

262
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:19,340
So for a part of this question, it says, Develop two strategies to reach the oxygen target.

263
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:23,780
Here is the five milligrams per liter. Right.

264
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:31,790
So my strategy. Does that mean like reduce the velocity from 3% 1 to 75?

265
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:38,840
Or are you looking for something more specific? No, I'm saying I want you to give me what you think makes sense here.

266
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:44,510
Okay. And to put this in kind of practical terms, let's say Ann Arbor is the first city.

267
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:50,750
Okay. And Ypsilanti is the second city. Okay. You're crossing jurisdictional boundaries.

268
00:31:51,170 --> 00:32:00,830
If I'm in Ypsilanti and I see this problem, which I have right now, I'm not achieving water quality standards in reach, too.

269
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:10,100
What do you think I would say to Ann Arbor? To do a better job.

270
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:13,700
Exactly. So go back into your wastewater treatment plant.

271
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:18,380
And don't give me 75, but give me, I don't know, 40 or something like that.

272
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:22,730
And now I look pretty good here. Okay.

273
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:26,600
So it's it gets home scot free.

274
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:33,530
They did absolutely nothing. Okay, now we meet the honorable if we meet the state water quality standards.

275
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:37,470
So if I don't know the mayor of Ypsilanti, I'd be thrilled as peaches.

276
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:41,900
No, I don't have to do anything. I meet the water quality goals.

277
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:46,340
The river's good. You can bet Ann Arbor is not going to be too happy.

278
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:54,410
Right? Because they went above and beyond what they needed to do to achieve water quality in their neck of the woods.

279
00:32:55,540 --> 00:33:05,600
QUESTION Yeah, I just really have to follow. Do you think we have a model that we need to fix that we doing from wastewater treatment plant one.

280
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:10,700
Yeah, and we don't need to top up on the second one. Is that okay or do you have one solution?

281
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:14,810
But again, I'm asking you to think about is that politically viable?

282
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:16,160
Yeah. You know.

283
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:28,930
This is also known as a core problem, or at least core or a coalition problem, because typically you'd have like a lot of cities along the way.

284
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:36,400
And, you know, if I get you into my coalition, I'm going to do what's best for us and the [INAUDIBLE] with everybody else, basically, you know?

285
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:41,020
And so there's no single answer to this.

286
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:48,550
It depends on how you define your your coalition or your core party for saying.

287
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:02,010
So there's no right answer to this. Okay. And so it really depends on your perspective.

288
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:14,190
Now, what I've done in this particular model is to think of a way to demonstrate an optimizer in the Excel workbook for you.

289
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:24,180
Okay. And if we go back and put things back to where they were originally, show that to reach plot, I have a pretty bad situation.

290
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:31,500
This is worse than the original because I've increased the water temperature and that drives down the deal level.

291
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:38,220
And just to give you a different kind of result, let's go into segment two here and make the temperature 30.

292
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:43,020
35 is awfully hard to write for this area anyway.

293
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,910
I mean, it's almost body temperature.

294
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:55,740
So let's now we're still in a pretty bad shape where for some reason it's going negative here, which is physically impossible.

295
00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:00,959
Okay, I can go down to zero. All right.

296
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:14,310
So on the optimizer, what I have here is another way of thinking about the problem, which is that to a first order approximation,

297
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:22,890
the cost of reducing body is proportional to how much body you pull out,

298
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:29,850
how many kilograms of phosphorus and nitrogen, basically, or carbon you pull out.

299
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:36,240
Okay. And I can get that by taking what we call the body loading.

300
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:43,150
Which is the concentration of body times, the flow.

301
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:47,650
And that gives me a mass per time, kg per day.

302
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:55,690
And I've adjusted to two kilograms per day from grams per mg with a factor of a thousand.

303
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:02,320
Okay. And there's also other units involved because this is liter, this is meter cubed, whatever.

304
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:20,020
Okay. And so I have done no reduction yet, but if I have this, then I would pull out 15,000 kilograms per day.

305
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:23,710
Okay. And so that's kind of proportional to my cost.

306
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:37,120
So what I thought here was, well, let's make an optimal solution by minimizing the amount of body that we reduce across these two facilities.

307
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:45,040
It's kind of like my coalition as group with your coalition, and we're going to work on this together and figure out what's best.

308
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:56,800
So it makes sense. So what I've done in the optimizer, if I run it right, is if I hit this to yes and then I go to our data,

309
00:36:57,730 --> 00:37:06,070
the solver and I have here three parameters which I'm trying to change.

310
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:18,010
That is the flows. I have some constraints and I have the thing I'm trying to in this case says maximize, which is weird.

311
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:33,179
We'll see if it works. And if I hit solve it worked and it's figured out that I can with my optimize reduce from 250 to

312
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:43,690
49.4 reach one and from 250 to 1 41.1 in reach to not so much and then just touch the five line.

313
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:51,430
So this is the minimum amount of body I can pull out of the system and meet the water quality standard.

314
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:58,720
Okay. How the optimizer do it? It's a mathematical solver.

315
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:02,680
I set up the constraints in here.

316
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:11,800
The goal was to keep the lowest concentration of body above five.

317
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:17,320
I have that as a constraint. The solver is really powerful.

318
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:21,410
You can model all kinds of things with it. Good.

319
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:26,450
So that's the best I can do, given the way I've set up the problem.

320
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:41,520
Questions. So this obviously set up to be a total 80% reduction.

321
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:46,440
No, it's not set up to minimize the drop in percent.

322
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:50,730
You could do that. Yeah, that would be another approach.

323
00:38:51,660 --> 00:39:00,930
It's set up to minimize the total loading. But I should say up to some constraints, because it doesn't.

324
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:09,840
Well, I guess you can go down to zero, can't you? So the way I would do this in the next iteration would be to have a cost function,

325
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:17,940
which would mean that the further I reduce or squeeze out the both, the more and more expensive it is increase in costs.

326
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:20,820
Okay. And that could be done sort.

327
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:33,740
So I see the constraints incorrect because due to constraints, the body can be reduced up to 80% as opposed to greater outreach to.

328
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:37,180
So you should be more than 30.

329
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:41,230
Yeah. Yeah. So you can change these if you want. Okay.

330
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:46,030
Um, fortunately, in this problem, it doesn't bump against that.

331
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:53,320
So, um, so the the solver is a nonlinear gradient search technique.

332
00:39:53,970 --> 00:40:00,280
Okay, it's a nonlinear solver. It's not necessarily robust, but for this problem, it works well.

333
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:04,510
So it's good. Good point. And you can add constraints and things like that.

334
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:19,120
In fact, Excel has different solver approaches here and also different criteria for when it figures out its solved the problem.

335
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:23,950
Okay. And sometimes you have to fiddle with these things as well. But I've done that for you in this problem.

336
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:32,110
Yes, I was. Excuse me a bit.

337
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:37,020
I'm not sure how to answer this question.

338
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:46,940
So using the default primer portion, the contribution of Jyoti to the three ways them and looking at on corner,

339
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:52,190
how can we get started to figure out the percentages?

340
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:57,840
Each supplier responsibility. Okay.

341
00:40:57,870 --> 00:41:00,900
I have to. I will be happy to answer that.

342
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:06,630
But I have to answer the first question about sensitivity analysis.

343
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:11,490
Okay. So I'll come back to you with that once I figure out how to get out of this.

344
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:18,730
Close. What did I change?

345
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:24,790
We're going to sell. And she appeared.

346
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:34,320
No like on the actual excel she just programs. Thank you.

347
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:42,840
All right. Okay. Sensitivity analysis. Let's go back to the original problem.

348
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:51,150
Okay. And for a which one is asking for, sensitivity was important for me.

349
00:41:52,740 --> 00:42:00,300
Okay. So what I'm saying is define the sensitivity.

350
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:14,700
So there's a lot of different ways to do this. Okay. And what I did in my solution may not be what you guys do in yours, but that's okay.

351
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:27,310
All right. Let's put this.

352
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:34,980
Yeah. We'll keep it where it is. It's fine for me right now. Let's go in for each one.

353
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:43,080
Here are the concentrations that are reached at different distances up to ten miles downstream.

354
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:50,100
Okay. What I can do and here's the plot for each one as well.

355
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:53,640
So let's approach this as a single reach problem. Okay.

356
00:42:54,060 --> 00:43:02,400
And what I would do is typically to think of the case that concerns me the most.

357
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:09,270
To come up with an indicator that I care about the most. And that might be the lowest dissolved oxygen level reached in the ridge.

358
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:14,760
Reached on the ridge. Okay. So here is my deal level.

359
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:20,610
Okay. And what I can do is pull off the minimum.

360
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:26,460
So I can just say the minimum D0 and put it in.

361
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:31,290
I'll put in a formula, even though it's pretty obvious it's the last value here.

362
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:38,940
Okay. And that's my minimum deal for this case.

363
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:43,470
What I want to do here is preserve this.

364
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:51,420
So I'm going to paste this as a value. And so this is the baseline condition.

365
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:58,659
Okay. Now, the problem asked me to do a sensitivity analysis.

366
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:10,330
On what? Relative sensitivity for, uh, some parameters temperature.

367
00:44:11,110 --> 00:44:15,079
Okay. And so the baseline condition. Not really.

368
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:18,840
If the temperature is 30. Okay. So this is the min deal.

369
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:25,120
And then this is the temp. Is the baseline the same thing as what's meant by, like, nominal?

370
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:29,230
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So I've changed my baseline from yours.

371
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:36,470
Okay. All right. Now it says let's change the temperature by 10%.

372
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:40,690
It's kind of arbitrary how much we change it. We should only change it a small amount.

373
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:51,250
Okay. And so if I come back up to here and change it to 32 degrees, my minimum DAU has dropped.

374
00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:59,670
I'm going to paste this in here again. And my temperatures, 32 degrees.

375
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:05,610
And so I guess I should put the baseline over here.

376
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:11,280
And then this is the new condition. Okay.

377
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:22,530
And so I'm asking you to calculate the relative sensitivity, which is essentially proportional change in the dissolved oxygen.

378
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:27,900
Okay. Compared to the proportional change in temperature.

379
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:34,710
Okay. So I can get the change here.

380
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:49,780
I could type. This keyboard was a little bit better, and I'll just take the difference between the baseline and the new condition.

381
00:45:51,130 --> 00:46:00,370
Okay. And so the relative sensitivity might be calculated as the change divided by the baseline.

382
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:14,110
Okay. And divide this quantity by the change in temperature that I changed.

383
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:20,880
Divided by the baseline temperature. Okay.

384
00:46:21,110 --> 00:46:24,500
So that is a measure of relative sensitivity.

385
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:31,310
So what this means and this isn't necessarily the best thing because it depends on what whether it's Fahrenheit or whatever,

386
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:42,080
but it's indicating that every degree, every percent change in temperature causes a 5% change in deal.

387
00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:49,010
If I did agree or a two degree change in temperature,

388
00:46:50,930 --> 00:46:58,200
an increase causes a decrease in the deal because this has got a negative in front of it and that's important as well.

389
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:02,730
Okay. Because sensitivity can be positive or negative. Okay.

390
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:06,109
So help for filter sensitivity. Okay. Okay.

391
00:47:06,110 --> 00:47:10,100
I did it right. Can you do that one more time? Every percent change in temperature.

392
00:47:10,670 --> 00:47:14,960
Yeah. So. So let me put in one more thing here.

393
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:22,340
So this is the change. And so my units here in dissolved oxygen are milligrams per liter.

394
00:47:22,490 --> 00:47:26,300
All right? And my units here are just degrees centigrade.

395
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:36,829
Right. And so the change, all these are in there. But if I look at percentage change and I probably should have done this intermediate

396
00:47:36,830 --> 00:47:43,910
step is I would take this change divided by the baseline and times 100.

397
00:47:45,290 --> 00:47:49,910
Okay. So I had a 37% change in this deal.

398
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:56,210
Okay. But for only a 6% change or 7% change in temperature.

399
00:47:57,530 --> 00:48:01,490
Okay. And my relative sensitivity is the ratio of those two percentages.

400
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:13,050
And it's negative because they go in opposite ways. Yeah.

401
00:48:13,530 --> 00:48:17,370
Well, I can tell you this. I used the minimum in your optimization.

402
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:21,450
Okay. That's fine, too. Yeah. And in fact, that's probably a better way to do it.

403
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:32,970
Okay. Because that looks at the entire stretch. So instead of using the minimum deal from here, you can go use the minimum in here.

404
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:38,070
Okay. And I would be better if I didn't do that because I want to work on a single page.

405
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:49,520
Oh, there's not a question you asked me about. Yes, for any reason.

406
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:53,990
In default, memory is a portion of the contributions from Jewish water from the plants.

407
00:48:55,730 --> 00:49:01,220
Okay. This is a problem with no answer.

408
00:49:01,970 --> 00:49:05,390
That's correct. And universal. Lots of correct points.

409
00:49:05,390 --> 00:49:14,660
No single correct one, she said. Because it depends on where you start and it depends on the metric that you use.

410
00:49:15,890 --> 00:49:26,630
Okay. So in other words, to demonstrate this, here we are with our to reach plot and things are pretty lousy.

411
00:49:26,930 --> 00:49:32,300
Okay. So let's say you come up with some better option and you are.

412
00:49:32,810 --> 00:49:35,840
Am I asking you to use default here? Yeah. The default.

413
00:49:36,590 --> 00:49:45,110
Hmm. All right, well, I'm going to change the default again to make it something that doesn't go so extremely negative.

414
00:49:45,290 --> 00:49:56,480
Okay, so I've just changed my default to be like this, using the philosophy that what I care about most is the lowest dissolved oxygen level.

415
00:49:59,890 --> 00:50:05,620
Let's go to the to reach plant right here.

416
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:09,490
Let's find the minimum and what these are here.

417
00:50:10,630 --> 00:50:18,220
So, again, the minimum deal would be. The lowest that occurs.

418
00:50:20,470 --> 00:50:27,180
Okay. 2.2. Okay.

419
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:39,780
So my baseline now for the DEO, I'm going to again just copy this as a value because I don't want it to change and this is the minimum deal.

420
00:50:43,950 --> 00:50:53,370
Okay. Now, if I had no pollution coming from source one, then this value would be zero.

421
00:50:55,290 --> 00:51:00,660
Okay. And then you can anticipate the to reach plant is in much better shape.

422
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:04,560
Okay. And the minimum to you is now five.

423
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:10,920
Okay. So this is source one equals zero.

424
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:18,060
Okay. And my minimum d0. I'm just going to put that in there again.

425
00:51:21,630 --> 00:51:26,020
Is five. Okay, let's go back to reach one.

426
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:37,280
Put things back to where they were. And again, by minimum, the euro is back to where it was just checking 2.2.

427
00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:42,410
I'm good and let's change. Source 2 to 0.

428
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:49,550
Okay. And now my minimum deal was 3.8.

429
00:51:49,910 --> 00:52:01,510
So now I can say source two equals zero and I'll have 3.8.

430
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:09,450
I'm just going to type it in because it's close enough. All right.

431
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:12,700
And then one more thing, but for both sauces off.

432
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:20,170
Okay. So instead of having 125 here, I have zero. And then back to my to reach plot.

433
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:24,730
I have pretty much pristine water quality. Okay, that's very nice.

434
00:52:25,150 --> 00:52:30,130
And so forth. One equals two equals zero.

435
00:52:30,610 --> 00:52:34,300
And now I have basically saturated level.

436
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:39,750
All right. Ponder this for a minute.

437
00:52:40,770 --> 00:52:49,980
Who is responsible for most of the degradation, at least in terms of the minimum concentration of source, water source to.

438
00:52:56,180 --> 00:53:07,350
Well. Tell me your logic.

439
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:17,880
One source one isn't zero. I think you got a bigger difference.

440
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:21,540
Yeah. Yeah. So we're at seven. Right.

441
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:29,760
And then if source one is putting out, we drop down to 3.8, which is bad and worse than five is when we source two putting out.

442
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:33,480
Okay. That's a good way to think of it. Okay.

443
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:47,820
Now, if you think about this problem in a kind of I don't know if you're going to appreciate this, but here we have a shortfall of two.

444
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:56,819
Here we have a shortfall of three. And so source and I should probably make this clearer.

445
00:53:56,820 --> 00:54:02,250
So this is source two is on, right?

446
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:13,410
And this clear source one is on notice that we it's clear that we're maybe five and we add those two together, we get 5.2.

447
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:26,100
Which is not the same when we actually run them together of 2.2 because it was 5.2 down from seven.

448
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:30,390
We'd only have 1.8. It doesn't make sense or it doesn't.

449
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:36,820
So in other words, the sources aren't additive. Okay.

450
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:40,600
I can't model one and not have an effect on the other.

451
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:46,430
And that's because the DEO replenishment is a gradient driven process.

452
00:54:46,430 --> 00:54:54,150
The variation rate times the oxygen deficit. All right.

453
00:54:56,270 --> 00:55:01,820
So with that being said, you might think of an apportionment.

454
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:09,680
So this is the I don't know, the deficit. And we might think of the fraction of the deficit.

455
00:55:12,470 --> 00:55:18,980
Or percentage, if you prefer. And so we might lassos and just take a total.

456
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:22,790
I should probably make this a little bit bigger because it's pretty minuscule.

457
00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:30,240
And I could have the total.

458
00:55:34,710 --> 00:55:49,730
Obviously here. And I could say, well, we'll divide this by the total and then multiply that by 100%, if you like, and or not.

459
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:55,680
So I have this fraction and I think I need another decimal place here just to make sure.

460
00:55:57,420 --> 00:56:01,920
And here's from the same source.

461
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:06,240
Two is responsible for 39% of the deficit.

462
00:56:06,570 --> 00:56:10,140
Source one is responsible for 61% of the deficit.

463
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:17,370
This is an apportionment. Okay, but I won't say it's the right apportionment.

464
00:56:18,690 --> 00:56:26,940
Okay. But the idea is to figure out who's responsible and have that pie add up to 100%.

465
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:30,780
And that pie can include natural sources, other sources.

466
00:56:31,110 --> 00:56:34,169
Okay, you're thinking about this.

467
00:56:34,170 --> 00:56:45,780
Tell me what you think. I think the proportion is and I don't see anything in the bill, but I think that an unnamed source wants to blame.

468
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:50,100
But the proportion, I think it doesn't make sense to me.

469
00:56:50,190 --> 00:56:55,980
No, it doesn't make sense to me either, because it's impossible to reduce discharges to zero.

470
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:09,990
Yeah. For one thing, I developed an economy and a model to approach the responsibility.

471
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:14,700
But this is quite complicated as well.

472
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:18,150
But this is a real world problem because we have, for example,

473
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:26,220
examples of regional wastewater treatment systems and we have to assign costs to municipalities that are contributing.

474
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:36,240
And if you did this analysis, then you might say, okay, and after you pay 61% of the cost in Ypsilanti, you pay the balance 39% of the cost.

475
00:57:36,970 --> 00:57:45,300
Okay. But for me, one of the reasons why this is not reasonable is because we can't go to zero in terms of controlling discharges.

476
00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:50,190
So an alternative approach is like sensitivity approach.

477
00:57:50,430 --> 00:57:55,500
Just change it a little bit and see who's responsible and you'll get a different result.

478
00:57:55,770 --> 00:58:04,380
And it's something that's probably more realistic or figure out about where you want to be and then change it just a little bit from there.

479
00:58:04,950 --> 00:58:09,990
And that's probably about the best that you can do. Okay.

480
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:16,290
So it involves, in that case, kind of an optimization to get where you think you need to be and then see who's responsible at that point.

481
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:22,980
So are you saying instead of changing your values to zero, just changing them to a slightly smaller number?

482
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:32,520
Yeah, but what I'm saying is the best thing to do probably is to come up with like the near optimal solution and then change it a

483
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:40,200
little bit to see the marginal impact that one location has compared to the marginal impact that the other location has.

484
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:51,360
I'm interested in what your answer is. There's no right answer or wrong answer.

485
00:58:51,450 --> 00:58:57,930
Well, there are probably some answers that are better than others. But I mean, there's no real final definitive answer on this.

486
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:18,240
The answer is. Concentration from wastewater treatment plant one pays.

487
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:24,980
17.2.

488
00:59:25,570 --> 00:59:29,920
Okay. And from two is ten days.

489
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:34,490
3.3. But. But they don't add up to 100.

490
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:47,170
Yeah. Yeah. Because in my model, um, there is a part I saying this it's either one sport or choose books I think is.

491
00:59:50,270 --> 00:59:58,050
Honestly, I don't know how to explain that, but, um. But I can't blame a problem.

492
00:59:58,460 --> 01:00:03,080
Two for this is the. Is the oversaturated and.

493
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,780
Yeah. I think it's about the saturated, you know.

494
01:00:10,170 --> 01:00:15,000
Okay. So that that could be a good point there because, you know, if it was saturated, it would be higher.

495
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:20,370
And because we're below that. But but, you know, you you make another assumption there.

496
01:00:21,330 --> 01:00:25,140
Okay. And so not one maybe that you can control.

497
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:28,710
So for a management model, you have to deal with what you can control.

498
01:00:30,270 --> 01:00:33,210
But that's that's a good insight. Five minute break.

499
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:37,680
There's one more thing on this problem that I want to talk about and then we'll take any other questions.

500
01:00:38,310 --> 01:00:53,540
And the rest of them were to. Yes, I think so.

501
01:00:59,850 --> 01:01:04,460
I like the idea of including the sort of DOD deficit.

502
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:14,070
You've got the same sort of result. The second point was more important were the first 100 times more important.

503
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:27,570
That's good. We live.

504
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:36,320
Like a third thing to consider, but we're kind of stuck.

505
01:01:38,330 --> 01:01:42,060
We try to stop. No, no, no.

506
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:45,860
I don't feel like I have some small questions.

507
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:56,489
I just like the wording on. And change the this here which we can get to.

508
01:01:56,490 --> 01:02:00,800
But if we don't get to them today for the first time.

509
01:02:03,340 --> 01:02:07,470
But as soon as we can.

510
01:02:08,890 --> 01:02:14,310
That's just. And revenge for.

511
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:25,940
Is this the best time to have their issue with you?

512
01:02:26,890 --> 01:02:31,470
Um, I have, I have availability from like 1 to 5 months, okay?

513
01:02:31,890 --> 01:02:41,190
To, you know, probably going to do to put it in person or to.

514
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:45,570
What, what's good for you, I guess, is a matter of you on campus.

515
01:02:45,710 --> 01:02:52,380
Okay, so you're supposed to do that?

516
01:02:52,460 --> 01:02:56,620
Yeah. Norma? Yes. I figured out last time.

517
01:02:56,640 --> 01:03:02,000
It took me a while. I was like, Oh, no, really, it's okay to the time. Thank you.

518
01:03:03,050 --> 01:03:06,950
We'll see how much we can get there today, though. Okay. Who else is in Europe?

519
01:03:08,180 --> 01:03:12,040
Okay. I will not be there and of box at that time, you know.

520
01:03:12,860 --> 01:03:25,160
Okay. I want to focus more on today's prosperity, too, in 2 to 3 part.

521
01:03:25,250 --> 01:03:28,460
Mm hmm. Mm hmm.

522
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:33,530
I define this as a breach of contract. Okay.

523
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:38,030
I like that approach, too. Right. And, in fact, that's one of my favorite approaches, to be honest,

524
01:03:40,070 --> 01:03:46,850
because what you do there is is makes a lot of sense from the controlled perspective.

525
01:03:47,450 --> 01:04:00,490
So I like the term. And for me, I need to calculated a sensitivity for both ritual and race to separate.

526
01:04:00,740 --> 01:05:36,840
Right. That's probably. But.

527
01:06:05,340 --> 01:06:08,130
Okay. We all back quick.

528
01:06:21,190 --> 01:06:33,490
The other part of this problem that I always found interesting was considering the sort of probabilistic aspects to it or the uncertainty,

529
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:39,849
and it's a deterministic model. Okay. You say this is at the level.

530
01:06:39,850 --> 01:06:43,180
This is the inflow concentration. This is the removal.

531
01:06:43,390 --> 01:06:56,410
No variability, no uncertainty. And I gave you in the problem statement, I think a little picture showing the distribution of flows in the river,

532
01:06:56,980 --> 01:07:05,320
which you can picture as the purple line, which is a probability distribution or a cumulative distribution as the blue line.

533
01:07:05,650 --> 01:07:10,030
Okay. And you guys should all be familiar with how to read these kinds of plots.

534
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:19,240
Okay. And the critical number is understanding the median or the geometric mean or the average in the median would be,

535
01:07:20,230 --> 01:07:34,870
you know, the probability that has 0.5. And so I can read across and get that in, you know, in distributions like flows, they can't go negative.

536
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:39,700
Okay. And they typically have very long tails to the right.

537
01:07:40,630 --> 01:07:48,310
So it's considered a right skewed distribution. And often we assume that something like this as well as normal distribute, distribute it.

538
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:54,279
So in other words, if I take all the river values of flows, you know,

539
01:07:54,280 --> 01:08:03,010
five cubic feet per minute and take logarithm other and then do a plot like this, it'll look normal.

540
01:08:03,430 --> 01:08:07,150
Okay. Symmetrical bell shaped curve. Okay.

541
01:08:09,890 --> 01:08:13,160
All right. So that's all sort of basic descriptive statistics.

542
01:08:15,930 --> 01:08:25,650
So what does it mean then? If you tell me you've solved this water quality problem, come up with the optimal answer.

543
01:08:25,950 --> 01:08:33,180
Okay, it's going to make everybody happy. You've got ABC paying just the right amount of money, Ann Arbor paying just the right amount of money.

544
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:37,470
And then I say, well, how confident are you?

545
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:42,040
Have you handled the variability in the problem? Okay.

546
01:08:42,180 --> 01:08:52,710
And all I would have to do is point to this river flow and say, you've just given me the answer for the average flow, but what happens?

547
01:08:52,950 --> 01:08:58,859
The flow drops a little bit. You're going to exceed the water quality standard.

548
01:08:58,860 --> 01:09:06,870
You no longer have enough to. For me, I don't worry in this problem about the right hand side of the table because that's a lot of water,

549
01:09:07,140 --> 01:09:11,820
more dilution, lower impact of worry about the left hand side.

550
01:09:13,620 --> 01:09:17,310
Okay. So how can you handle that problem?

551
01:09:31,830 --> 01:09:43,800
You aim for a lower goal or probability like level or probability of one.

552
01:09:44,810 --> 01:09:48,150
Hmm. Well, you're onto it.

553
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:54,210
The problem becomes worse. The lower the flows are. Right.

554
01:09:55,260 --> 01:10:05,280
So maybe a reasonable approach is to say, well, let's cut down on the flow instead of being whatever it was,

555
01:10:05,580 --> 01:10:08,640
let's drop it down to the lowest flow we ever get.

556
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:20,000
Is that reasonable to do? Well, the problem is flows can get really, really low.

557
01:10:20,750 --> 01:10:28,190
And that might be a value that occurs one time in a year, one time in ten years or whatever.

558
01:10:28,670 --> 01:10:33,560
Probably not realistic. Moreover, the solution that you're going to get is probably impossible.

559
01:10:33,950 --> 01:10:41,370
You don't have to remove everything. Okay. Probably can't do that. All right.

560
01:10:41,380 --> 01:10:45,270
Well, you guys have had statistics, right? When you express a confidence interval.

561
01:10:46,140 --> 01:10:53,340
What do you say? Here is the mean plus or minus some 95% confidence interval or something like that.

562
01:10:53,350 --> 01:10:58,200
Right. So why don't you take the fifth percentile for.

563
01:11:00,100 --> 01:11:05,230
Okay. That means 95% of the time levels are above that.

564
01:11:06,670 --> 01:11:12,760
If you solve a problem for the fifth percentile flow, you'll solve it 95% of the time.

565
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:18,060
That's not bad. Okay. In fact, that's pretty darn good.

566
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:25,260
Okay. So that's another approach to handle some of the uncertainty.

567
01:11:26,010 --> 01:11:30,330
This may end up with something that is very conservative.

568
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:35,040
95% confidence is pretty high for this kind of problem.

569
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:39,930
Okay. But it's certainly one approach, you know, and it's a good answer.

570
01:11:40,890 --> 01:11:47,650
So the rest of the spreadsheet is just using some of the functions of Excel to calculate probabilities or whatever.

571
01:11:47,670 --> 01:12:00,680
And, you know, in this case, I think the river flow was 150 cubic feet per second, the standard deviation was 200 a give away.

572
01:12:01,380 --> 01:12:05,070
When you have a standard deviation, that's about the size of the mean.

573
01:12:05,900 --> 01:12:09,299
Probably not normal. Okay. Certainly in a flow.

574
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:16,560
It's not normal. It's probably not normal. So here's a couple of formulas that translate this to a log,

575
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:26,310
normal parameter of standard deviation in a mean and then that's plugged in up here and then more formulas that give me sort

576
01:12:26,310 --> 01:12:38,490
of a probability of 1% to 99% and then the transformed variable values and then the log flows exponentially weighted here.

577
01:12:38,850 --> 01:12:43,770
So basically the one percentile flow is 33 cubic feet per second.

578
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:49,710
Okay. Compared to the normal flow of 150, we're down, what, five times?

579
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:57,900
That's a minuscule flow. Okay. And the 99th percentile flow is 756.

580
01:12:58,260 --> 01:13:01,469
That's three times higher. No, it's more than three times higher.

581
01:13:01,470 --> 01:13:04,510
It's six, seven times higher. Okay.

582
01:13:05,650 --> 01:13:14,090
So this is just using some functions in Excel to calculate the flows at arbitrary percentiles again.

583
01:13:14,100 --> 01:13:19,930
And here green are the numbers that you can enter. So I'll put this spreadsheet up on the homework site.

584
01:13:20,710 --> 01:13:23,650
You don't necessarily need it, but if you want, it's quite good.

585
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:38,730
I was thinking about showing you a probability plot, and I thought I had done it in this paper.

586
01:13:39,990 --> 01:13:46,080
But it's not exactly a probability plot. It's cumulative distributions for lead levels.

587
01:13:46,740 --> 01:13:55,980
Here's the lead levels in drinking water. And if I take the 50th percentile level, this happens to be in Chicago.

588
01:13:56,430 --> 01:14:01,380
It's only about two or about four micrograms per liter.

589
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:04,830
The action level for EPA is 15.

590
01:14:05,550 --> 01:14:10,890
If I look at the 15 level, I probably go up to this plant to look at it a little more precisely.

591
01:14:11,740 --> 01:14:15,930
There's about a 93 or 4% chance of being under that.

592
01:14:15,940 --> 01:14:19,980
So that means about 6% of the time I'm above the action level.

593
01:14:21,420 --> 01:14:32,580
Okay. Just reading off the plot, the EPA standard and letting copper rule is set up that if your 90th percentile is below 15, you're good.

594
01:14:33,030 --> 01:14:36,090
Since I'm at that 96%, I'm good.

595
01:14:37,470 --> 01:14:43,350
Okay. So I have 6% or 4% of homes in Chicago that have levels above it.

596
01:14:43,350 --> 01:14:48,030
But I'm not in exceedance of the leading copper rule limits.

597
01:14:50,430 --> 01:14:58,290
What I wanted to show you was different from this, which was if I had a special scale here called a probability scale,

598
01:14:58,650 --> 01:15:03,120
then a normal distribution fits a straight line on that plot.

599
01:15:04,290 --> 01:15:12,069
Okay. And since most concentrations are more like log normal, it wouldn't be a straight line.

600
01:15:12,070 --> 01:15:18,719
It would still be dead. If I change this to a large scale, this to a probability scale, it should.

601
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:23,390
Plot is a straight line. And it does about even.

602
01:15:23,910 --> 01:15:28,620
And having worked with lots of data sets, don't assume anything is normal.

603
01:15:28,890 --> 01:15:32,550
Typically the high values are still higher than what log normal will tell you.

604
01:15:33,090 --> 01:15:37,979
It's kind of a store skew or mixed or contaminated or whatever you want to call it.

605
01:15:37,980 --> 01:15:42,240
Distribution. Good question.

606
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:55,080
For your interest in this paper we did just a couple of years ago, it's the drinking water study in U.S.A.

607
01:15:56,580 --> 01:16:01,170
Okay. Questions? Back to the homework on that.

608
01:16:01,530 --> 01:16:06,420
Oh, sorry. The missing one with that construal control strategy.

609
01:16:07,140 --> 01:16:17,300
What are you looking for specifically with that one on which one number of core genes and sense

610
01:16:17,490 --> 01:16:22,140
estimates of these water treatment plan reductions that are needed to develop a control strategy,

611
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:29,880
which are 75 or 95%. Mm hmm. So we know we figured out what that is.

612
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:34,480
Well, what do you want? Elaborated on for the controls that.

613
01:16:36,390 --> 01:16:45,840
I don't necessarily want anything elaborated. But what you might do is use what the fifth percentile flow.

614
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:56,460
Okay, and then solve the problem for that. And then, you know, 95% of the time, your concentrations will be fine.

615
01:16:57,150 --> 01:17:01,680
Mm hmm. Okay. So that might be a strategy that you undertake.

616
01:17:02,460 --> 01:17:16,010
Oh. I thought you guys would have questions on number five.

617
01:17:19,610 --> 01:17:28,909
It's going to open up the door here. Okay, brother, I was wondering if we can have a little bit more information on like what consulting fee is

618
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:38,120
proposing because it says you're with a lot of folks who are activated charcoal filter.

619
01:17:38,260 --> 01:17:47,720
Right. So that basically like a one time thing that reduces the initial concentration of the one four dioxane or like I'm just confused.

620
01:17:48,670 --> 01:18:00,370
Yeah. Okay.

621
01:18:00,380 --> 01:18:03,920
Slow motion. All right, so what I always recommend.

622
01:18:07,300 --> 01:18:10,900
Is start off with a conceptual model.

623
01:18:11,410 --> 01:18:19,920
Okay. And in this case, we have an underground storage tank complete into a small one X leak, which is a volume problem.

624
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:27,100
Okay. So my conceptual model is sort of a square all year round thing and I know I

625
01:18:27,100 --> 01:18:33,310
have a volume in here and I have a flow here coming in and a flow coming out,

626
01:18:34,690 --> 01:18:38,380
and I just bring markers to one of these work.

627
01:18:39,940 --> 01:18:43,990
Okay. And then there was some spill that.

628
01:18:54,790 --> 01:18:59,230
Well, we'll try and see how far we get with this. Are you going to steal something?

629
01:18:59,770 --> 01:19:03,730
Yeah, I think so. Thank you. Okay.

630
01:19:03,910 --> 01:19:14,950
And so there's some spill in here which produces an initial concentration of 200, I guess, 2000 micrograms per cubic meter.

631
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:20,890
Okay, so consultant, you're good with that, right?

632
01:19:21,790 --> 01:19:27,880
And for that, you would use the equation for of a fully conserved.

633
01:19:28,670 --> 01:19:33,350
Yeah. Okay. Because we're assuming that it's not apologizing.

634
01:19:34,070 --> 01:19:42,190
Okay. It's okay. Okay. Thank you so much for being here.

635
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:52,370
I'm confused. I'm like, What? When we're taking out a thousand years and like, how that affects the concentration.

636
01:19:52,370 --> 01:19:57,540
So it's just something that, like, happens at the beginning. And so you like, you know, and I'm sorry.

637
01:19:57,560 --> 01:20:04,590
Let's. Let's. I think there's a type of. It's a thousand cubic meters per day that you're all right.

638
01:20:04,610 --> 01:20:05,900
Okay. Sorry about that.

639
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:15,440
So it would be the same is okay, let's take a will or I'm sorry, let's take a pay, put it in your treatment process and then put the water back in.

640
01:20:16,490 --> 01:20:20,630
Okay. And so this is some kind of water treatment process.

641
01:20:20,700 --> 01:20:28,130
You're moving to action. And his or she has figured out something like an activated charcoal filter,

642
01:20:28,490 --> 01:20:33,640
which actually doesn't work that well for this chemical, but it works a little bit. Yeah.

643
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:40,950
Okay. That answers my question. So in this flow, he's got a thousand gallons per day, is what we're saying.

644
01:20:41,580 --> 01:20:44,780
That's true. Yeah, I do that right.

645
01:20:49,250 --> 01:20:52,440
I think it might be. Oh, yeah, you're.

646
01:20:55,800 --> 01:21:06,390
Was killed. Okay. Now what's the info on 1000 meters per day?

647
01:21:06,540 --> 01:21:10,320
Okay, so this is flowing in about 1000 miles away.

648
01:21:13,620 --> 01:21:17,230
And what's your life? I have 2000.

649
01:21:21,270 --> 01:21:25,050
And the outflow is the same as the inflow. So that would be a problem.

650
01:21:28,770 --> 01:21:33,180
So where do you get the thousand input or input from?

651
01:21:36,060 --> 01:21:41,550
Because consulting the statement says it'll be cleaned up because the inflow is the thousand.

652
01:21:41,930 --> 01:21:58,920
Okay. Good. So this is.

653
01:22:01,620 --> 01:22:06,900
An interesting problem for me. This is like our primitive migration from Yorkshire.

654
01:22:08,580 --> 01:22:12,000
Because this really requires that you step back and think,

655
01:22:12,390 --> 01:22:23,400
How does this all work with these simple engineering models of models that I've given you with a simple flow coming in from coming out of your system?

656
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:30,030
It's falling victim to things like this. How do your work as a consultant be in this model?

657
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:35,800
What is the concentration rate here?

658
01:22:38,220 --> 01:22:41,550
Coming into his reactor. We don't know.

659
01:22:41,790 --> 01:22:48,160
Right. It's the same as the concentration in here. So this is the same as this, right?

660
01:22:48,220 --> 01:22:52,080
Because he's just sampling water, pulling it out, treating it, dumping it back in.

661
01:22:52,950 --> 01:22:57,240
What's the concentration right here, sir?

662
01:22:58,020 --> 01:23:02,760
Yeah. So he or she has figured out a way to remove all the dioxin.

663
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:07,530
Okay. What's the concentration right here?

664
01:23:10,680 --> 01:23:18,690
Coming into the stream. Where the concentration as well Zuma.

665
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:28,600
Now because it's upstream. It's considered to be clean.

666
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:39,670
The spill was directly into the leak. Okay, so how much clean water is this system receiving every day?

667
01:23:42,650 --> 01:23:47,420
With Consultant Bee 2000.

668
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:55,400
So Bureau. I have accumulated 2000 cubic meters per day of clean water.

669
01:24:03,180 --> 01:24:12,270
Okay. And so this is this conceptual leap to recognize verbal conformity is assuming is equivalent to this.

670
01:24:15,970 --> 01:24:25,500
And you know how to solve that. Okay. Using that model, we would stay the same CEO would stay the same initial concentration.

671
01:24:26,810 --> 01:24:30,700
Q Well, not that it's very relevant, will stay the same.

672
01:24:31,390 --> 01:24:40,090
Okay. The only thing that changes instead from the base case natural attenuation seen went from 1000 to 2000.

673
01:24:43,850 --> 01:24:49,170
And so this is like this huge conceptual leap. And if you guys get this, I'm really happy, okay?

674
01:24:49,700 --> 01:24:59,780
Because that's essentially what the proposed breakdown in this should result in an exponential decay, which is faster than the base case.

675
01:25:01,720 --> 01:25:09,940
Makes sense. Good. So we're just like a living humans.

676
01:25:10,120 --> 01:25:16,720
So when I think of, like, conservative, nothing is reacting happening.

677
01:25:16,990 --> 01:25:24,870
But in this case, like, something is happening, but it's happening outside the lake and then right in the treatment room.

678
01:25:25,930 --> 01:25:29,290
Well, no, I mean, we have some engineering control here.

679
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:33,070
Okay. And it doesn't matter whether the blue is conservative or not.

680
01:25:33,340 --> 01:25:40,810
Basically that activated carbon will grab this molecule and stick it on to somewhere in the carbon surface.

681
01:25:41,380 --> 01:25:46,580
Okay. Activated carbon has like a lot of surface area, lots of micro fractures.

682
01:25:46,930 --> 01:25:57,020
So a gram of it can have like a 700 cubic meters, 30 square meters of surface area, just really lots and lots of fractures, that sort of stuff.

683
01:25:57,100 --> 01:26:04,480
Texture. Yeah, I guess what I'm trying to think of, like the math that comes later, I need to know if it's conservative or not.

684
01:26:05,170 --> 01:26:12,130
And I. Yeah. So nothing here has changed our assumptions of this chemical is not degree.

685
01:26:12,490 --> 01:26:18,940
Okay. Okay. And in fact, that's kind of an issue in these activated carbon systems,

686
01:26:18,940 --> 01:26:27,280
because what happens is the contaminant builds up on the carbon and now you have carbon with a very high level of contamination.

687
01:26:27,700 --> 01:26:31,269
And it's essentially a hazardous waste because it didn't degrade.

688
01:26:31,270 --> 01:26:35,530
It's just kind of stuck, magnified in concentration on that carbon.

689
01:26:41,890 --> 01:26:47,020
The other thing that's actually quite interesting with these kinds of systems is that

690
01:26:48,850 --> 01:26:53,050
there's a lot of other stuff in the water that can be picked up with the carbon as well.

691
01:26:53,980 --> 01:27:00,730
And in many cases that includes radionuclides. So not only do you have a lot of chemicals, you may have radiation in there as well.

692
01:27:01,660 --> 01:27:05,170
Okay. And finally, another thing that's really interested.

693
01:27:05,560 --> 01:27:11,830
Interesting with carbon is absorption and absorption are exothermic processes.

694
01:27:12,250 --> 01:27:18,860
So they actually give off heat. However, concentrations here are going to be so dilute it doesn't really matter.

695
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:27,460
But if you were sampling a ring, pulling out the velocities, both organic compounds and air, putting it through a carbon filter,

696
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:36,730
that carbon filter will physically get much warmer and in some bad situations they can actually exceed the thermal limit of the carbon and burn,

697
01:27:37,420 --> 01:27:42,670
which is a disaster not going to happen in the water treatment process.

698
01:27:44,380 --> 01:27:49,720
Okay. What else on this 131 December.

699
01:27:49,720 --> 01:27:54,740
Just a really good question. How do you work with patients in this whole effort?

700
01:27:54,760 --> 01:28:00,160
Numbers just fine, right? Sure. Yeah. But don't you don't have to go too overboard here.

701
01:28:01,780 --> 01:28:10,900
Actually, back to this problem for five eight. I'm really for the simple aspect.

702
01:28:14,090 --> 01:28:22,900
Um, what we did was, is, um, the new one served at first, the first level to be the same as the 15th.

703
01:28:22,910 --> 01:28:31,250
So that's okay. And then we consider, uh, durable consumption of the water.

704
01:28:32,390 --> 01:28:35,920
That's fine. I mean, I. Again, I won't go too crazy here.

705
01:28:36,020 --> 01:28:39,020
It's a moving target for most of these levels.

706
01:28:39,020 --> 01:28:44,120
So it's good I didn't do this as p false because that's an incredibly complicated one.

707
01:28:44,720 --> 01:28:49,670
So. How do you mean?

708
01:28:49,790 --> 01:28:57,080
Like. Oh, because there's it's it's a mixture of chemicals, and it is very much in flux.

709
01:28:59,160 --> 01:29:03,350
Mm hmm. And on. Did you find it himself or dioxin?

710
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:13,430
Um, I believe it's 5.61 milligrams or, um, making the law, uh, making it solvable and.

711
01:29:14,390 --> 01:29:19,220
Okay, that's okay. Um, but there's no MCO, I don't believe.

712
01:29:20,030 --> 01:29:24,440
And there's no MCI LG either, so. Okay, good.

713
01:29:25,220 --> 01:29:30,290
Is it because like or five micrograms per unit.

714
01:29:30,620 --> 01:29:35,480
Right. And that would be the second one that I would use. Yeah. So that's obviously a lot lower.

715
01:29:36,290 --> 01:29:47,200
And because of this, um, you know, wells are being shut down and there is a proposal before EPA.

716
01:29:47,210 --> 01:29:54,980
I think at this point whether this should be considered a Superfund site because of the extent of the contamination is so big, you know.

717
01:29:57,500 --> 01:30:01,950
Good. Other questions.

718
01:30:03,210 --> 01:30:06,360
Yeah. So, my, um, consultancy.

719
01:30:06,630 --> 01:30:11,580
Mm hmm. So first you have this as a conservative equation.

720
01:30:11,700 --> 01:30:20,310
Mm hmm. Um, but in the second half of the equation, I'm wondering if there's originally, like, dioxins coming in.

721
01:30:21,930 --> 01:30:26,910
Like, how much it's the original concentration originally of the.

722
01:30:27,390 --> 01:30:36,990
Right. Well, I think the problem statement says that the original concentration is 20 nanograms per liter.

723
01:30:37,230 --> 01:30:40,860
Right. Is that the initial or is that what's coming in?

724
01:30:41,100 --> 01:30:45,180
That's the initial after the spill. It's 20 nanograms per liter.

725
01:30:49,140 --> 01:30:52,440
And in fact, for your MCL, that's an interesting dilemma, right?

726
01:30:52,440 --> 01:30:55,810
Because you gave well, your water quality standard is above that. Yeah.

727
01:30:55,990 --> 01:30:59,730
You just get some fish. Yeah.

728
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:12,540
So in other words, when I see an orange is whatever I just said, 220, 29 grams per liter.

729
01:31:16,750 --> 01:31:24,610
You should always make these things bigger. And so what we expect to see is an exponential decrease with time.

730
01:31:26,530 --> 01:31:31,569
Okay. Okay. So then this is just to make sure.

731
01:31:31,570 --> 01:31:37,120
So the end is always zero because nothing's flowing into the record directly.

732
01:31:38,230 --> 01:31:42,590
Correct. Yeah.

733
01:31:42,890 --> 01:31:50,930
I don't think there's any naturally occurring or background level of this chemical or any

734
01:31:50,930 --> 01:31:56,760
of our future homeworks have a dynamic model where we would have a concentrated flow in.

735
01:31:56,830 --> 01:32:04,040
We're contaminating things like a spill or something when in fact my work very well is.

736
01:32:04,250 --> 01:32:08,329
Would you like one? And I just wanna know because that's fun.

737
01:32:08,330 --> 01:32:12,080
So. Oh, well, I'll think about that if I can come up with one that's manageable.

738
01:32:12,080 --> 01:32:20,870
Yeah. I mean, you know, you could do that with any of these models.

739
01:32:20,870 --> 01:32:28,890
For example, with a spreadsheet model, you could have seasonal flows in the river, and that would be kind of fun to handle, you know?

740
01:32:29,300 --> 01:32:40,220
But it gets complicated pretty fast. You know, my interest here is sort of getting you to think about conceptual models and sort of practical aspects.

741
01:32:40,580 --> 01:32:47,360
And, you know, going from a system where we have a waste treatment plant or processing facility,

742
01:32:47,660 --> 01:32:52,250
taking this and putting it into this conceptual frame, that's a big step.

743
01:32:52,370 --> 01:33:03,050
That's what I'm after here, you know, and having too much complexity here muddles the conceptual issues a little bit sometimes.

744
01:33:03,320 --> 01:33:06,890
But you're right. I mean, we need to get to something which is dynamic.

745
01:33:07,310 --> 01:33:10,930
We'll be tackling that kind of dynamics in this class in the.

746
01:33:11,060 --> 01:33:18,140
No, not really, because we'll be doing more modeling with air quality and a little bit with groundwater.

747
01:33:18,950 --> 01:33:26,960
And the model that I have planned for you guys to use in air quality is a steady state model.

748
01:33:28,280 --> 01:33:33,200
So it has to hold.

749
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:37,610
And I was, you know, and I was wondering if that would be appropriate in elsewhere.

750
01:33:39,470 --> 01:33:47,330
Yeah you know even 670 Tuesday right it's very steep for the my and we used to cover dynamic as well.

751
01:33:47,450 --> 01:33:56,960
Yeah. So I mean I'm happy to talk about them but in terms of having you use them, uh, let me think about and see if I can find one.

752
01:33:57,350 --> 01:34:03,680
I mean, the problem is that they all require that you have access to like specialized things like your stocks.

753
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:15,170
Well, I'll use stocks as one example, but in terms of the environmental models, the ones that are there are a couple that are actually quite nice.

754
01:34:15,170 --> 01:34:24,650
There's one in groundwater which I will try to demonstrate for you, and that's a great example or something that's really quite fun to look at.

755
01:34:28,010 --> 01:34:35,040
And actually I do have some groundwater examples that are not so good dynamic where we have access to.

756
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:39,440
Yeah. All right. Yeah. Good.

757
01:34:46,120 --> 01:34:50,890
Set it for the homework. No, no problem for him and for her.

758
01:34:52,360 --> 01:34:58,380
So regarding the truth is that she didn't want to tell the.

759
01:34:59,290 --> 01:35:03,220
Sure, sure. I mean, you don't know exactly what's going on with he is.

760
01:35:03,880 --> 01:35:15,140
You know, that's perfect. Can you tell us if you're on the right track with respect to that question?

761
01:35:17,540 --> 01:35:25,370
Um, sure. Um, we noticed that reached to the finger in the water.

762
01:35:25,860 --> 01:35:29,870
We're wondering if that. Mm hmm.

763
01:35:30,890 --> 01:35:38,680
Okay. So, you know, spread out. So let me just talk about rearrange as an example.

764
01:35:38,830 --> 01:35:48,430
Okay. So this is largely from the surface to air of the atmosphere to the surface of the water.

765
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:57,700
Okay. And we talked briefly how more turbulence, irritation, rapid flow, all these things can increase K2.

766
01:35:58,360 --> 01:36:05,830
Okay. If you have the presence of a scum on top of it, it'll reduce it because you're just not letting oxygen come through.

767
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:09,850
So those kinds of parameters, I mean, I didn't give you any pictures.

768
01:36:09,850 --> 01:36:15,390
I didn't give you any parameters, but those are some of the factors that might influence rearrange.

769
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:27,150
There are handbooks that help you figure these things out as well.

770
01:36:27,390 --> 01:36:35,160
In practice, this is what we would call a distributed parameter because it applies to a very large area.

771
01:36:35,640 --> 01:36:42,840
And a lot of times what people will do is to come up with sort of a ballpark number and then actually

772
01:36:43,200 --> 01:36:48,479
fit it because it's very important parameter so that you get a good match with your observations,

773
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:52,170
your observed levels of D0 and re aeration and so forth.

774
01:36:55,140 --> 01:37:00,390
So we're approaching this point now. If you give me 10 minutes, I'm going to show you something more if you can, in less than 10 minutes.

775
01:37:01,170 --> 01:37:04,350
I just let you go. Okay.

776
01:37:04,360 --> 01:37:11,540
What other questions? Yeah.

777
01:37:11,890 --> 01:37:17,650
Well, you didn't mention why you still want this assignment due on 31st or.

778
01:37:18,310 --> 01:37:22,570
I just. I want you guys to approach it in a phased way.

779
01:37:23,260 --> 01:37:29,290
Okay. And if the 31st is an issue, then, you know, I'm okay to take another week.

780
01:37:29,890 --> 01:37:39,520
But, I mean, if you can get it done, it would be good to get it out of the way. So I just I don't know if you want to get a consensus or.

781
01:37:41,030 --> 01:37:45,280
Hmm. For me, we're going to be moving on to other topics.

782
01:37:45,700 --> 01:37:50,800
And so if you can't get it done in the week, I would say this would be advantageous.

783
01:37:51,250 --> 01:37:56,830
Okay. Okay. But, you know, if any team wants to petition to me, that's fine, too.

784
01:37:58,070 --> 01:38:02,290
Well, let's try. Yeah.

785
01:38:02,520 --> 01:38:06,910
You want this turned down for me emailing it or on campus?

786
01:38:08,110 --> 01:38:11,470
There is a place on on canvas where you can upload it.

787
01:38:12,330 --> 01:38:15,830
No, I don't think you know. Mm hmm.

788
01:38:16,590 --> 01:38:19,720
Uh, well, if I don't get that fixed, just email it to me.

789
01:38:19,900 --> 01:38:29,050
Okay. Or print it out and give it to me. That's good. Um, do you know anything I can handle?

790
01:38:29,500 --> 01:38:35,290
So what? I. If you want to print it out, that's great, because that's what I do, is I put it out to grade, so.

791
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:51,180
Old school. I got to look at it, you know. Action from section 34 seconds asking about the adaptive management.

792
01:38:51,180 --> 01:38:53,520
And if the US EPA supported this approach.

793
01:38:53,730 --> 01:39:04,620
And I went through like the Superfund website and a bunch of different documents and I guess I'm not totally sure how to find if the EPA supported it.

794
01:39:07,080 --> 01:39:10,680
There's a document referenced as well for 2018.

795
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:17,580
See if you can locate that W or if I haven't read.

796
01:39:20,320 --> 01:39:24,590
For what, 2018? I don't have more of a reference in there.

797
01:39:24,870 --> 01:39:31,360
And when I say that, thank you. Um, it's.

798
01:39:31,440 --> 01:39:41,330
It's a memorandum. Superfund. Superfund. Task Force recommendation number three from the use of adaptive management.

799
01:39:43,310 --> 01:39:53,120
These. I'm interested in your thoughts on that because this is something which is

800
01:39:54,080 --> 01:40:03,050
still relatively innovative and the Superfund has a very structured process.

801
01:40:03,650 --> 01:40:10,380
I mean, Superfund has been around now, you know, since the eighties. Right. And it's designed to clean up the largest contaminated sites.

802
01:40:11,060 --> 01:40:15,920
And these are huge sites. I mean, the Kalamazoo Rivers, 100 miles long.

803
01:40:15,980 --> 01:40:23,389
Right. And industrial properties typically have a cleanup bill in many tens of millions

804
01:40:23,390 --> 01:40:28,190
of dollars on the Kalamazoo River because they took on so many other things.

805
01:40:28,190 --> 01:40:34,940
That number is way larger. And there are also processes that go on for decades.

806
01:40:35,500 --> 01:40:41,150
Okay. So, in fact, people make their careers on cleanups of a Superfund site.

807
01:40:42,020 --> 01:40:46,730
All right. So it's a good job if you get it because it's not going to go away, but the funding is there.

808
01:40:47,030 --> 01:40:55,250
So anyway, part of the Superfund process was to conduct an of remedial investigation, a feasibility study.

809
01:40:55,610 --> 01:41:02,450
And you have elements of that in the rules. And the R.I. part is to see what's going on.

810
01:41:03,340 --> 01:41:08,840
Okay. It's a big study, involves lots of different players and actors to figure out what are the values,

811
01:41:08,850 --> 01:41:15,589
ecological, you know, species, the how much contamination is there, where's it coming from?

812
01:41:15,590 --> 01:41:22,030
Where is it going? The feasibility study, the first part of it is, what if we do this?

813
01:41:22,040 --> 01:41:30,700
What if we do that? Okay. And for some of these sites, the I heart takes you.

814
01:41:34,550 --> 01:41:42,170
And you know, you just have this stretched out process that the site doesn't ever get cleaned up.

815
01:41:42,650 --> 01:41:47,810
It seems for decades and it's costing you and the contamination is spreading and so forth.

816
01:41:48,050 --> 01:41:52,370
So this adaptive management strategy is quite unique here.

817
01:41:52,400 --> 01:41:57,320
It's quite interesting to see if there are things that we should be doing as we learn more about the problem.

818
01:41:59,290 --> 01:42:05,950
Okay. So I haven't seen it applied very often because the other aspect of Superfund is

819
01:42:06,280 --> 01:42:15,160
it's a highly litigious battle between typically feds and private industry where,

820
01:42:15,490 --> 01:42:23,139
you know, somebody has to pay the bill and this is kind of fired in a legal agreement, okay,

821
01:42:23,140 --> 01:42:28,090
that you are going to do X, Y and Z and you are going to split the costs like this.

822
01:42:28,660 --> 01:42:31,899
And if you have adaptive management, you don't know what the strategy is.

823
01:42:31,900 --> 01:42:34,930
You don't know what the costs are, you don't know any of this stuff.

824
01:42:35,230 --> 01:42:41,790
And so it doesn't have to be the same legal, you know,

825
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:53,319
enforcement or clout that a traditional record of decision are owed on a Superfund site where the judge and everybody else signs off and saying,

826
01:42:53,320 --> 01:42:56,380
this is how much you have to come up with in terms of cleaning up the site.

827
01:42:57,010 --> 01:43:06,730
So, you know, this is kind of a tension with this adaptive management, but sometimes, you know, maybe it's a good strategy.

828
01:43:07,450 --> 01:43:14,660
So. I have a question for the screen.

829
01:43:14,770 --> 01:43:18,900
The list is for information.

830
01:43:19,200 --> 01:43:28,980
If you want us to propose form or you want us to identify well from the reading carrier, go find one that you like that that interests you.

831
01:43:30,060 --> 01:43:37,380
I mean, there's all kinds of stuff there, you know, with things that they're trying to do and just choose one that you like.

832
01:43:44,750 --> 01:43:53,670
And the small one. The question is just what's an appropriate boundary for analysis and why I'm here?

833
01:43:53,690 --> 01:44:01,549
I'm curious what you're looking for. You know, I guess I don't really understand what a boundary is, right?

834
01:44:01,550 --> 01:44:04,790
So when I started off talking about models and this was,

835
01:44:05,420 --> 01:44:14,600
I think the session that we did remotely sort of draw a box or shape around what's going to be in the problem domain.

836
01:44:15,320 --> 01:44:18,260
Okay. And so that can be physical.

837
01:44:18,740 --> 01:44:25,370
You know, in this particular case, it could be Manhattan, New York City, the five boroughs, it could be Connecticut, New Jersey.

838
01:44:25,820 --> 01:44:29,390
I mean, so the physical boundary would be a reasonable place to start.

839
01:44:30,980 --> 01:44:35,120
There are other types of boundaries, but since NEPA has so much to do with land use,

840
01:44:35,120 --> 01:44:38,570
I think a physical boundary makes sense or jurisdictional boundary makes sense.

841
01:44:39,050 --> 01:44:53,350
Great. Thank you. Good. Well, if you have a chance, take a look at the end of the notes.

842
01:44:53,350 --> 01:44:57,790
I talk about bio concentration. It's some good stuff there.

843
01:44:58,160 --> 01:45:01,480
We talk about pitfalls. Okay. Some good stuff there.

844
01:45:03,700 --> 01:45:10,390
Those are topics that are just, you know, I think important in the surface water quality.

845
01:45:10,690 --> 01:45:14,980
Next week, though, we're going to turn to totally new area groundwater.

846
01:45:15,370 --> 01:45:20,320
I don't know how many of you have background in groundwater. My experience is very few people do.

847
01:45:20,950 --> 01:45:26,590
Okay. So there's a lot of information to understand. Contaminants, flows, water flows.

848
01:45:26,710 --> 01:45:32,830
Quality. Quantity issues in groundwater. And so we're going to shift gears and talk about that.

849
01:45:33,490 --> 01:45:36,760
Okay. All right. Good luck on the homework.

850
01:45:37,690 --> 01:45:41,290
Give me an email if you need to see me for any reason.

851
01:45:41,710 --> 01:45:45,790
Okay. Surveillance. Yeah.

852
01:45:45,890 --> 01:45:55,400
Yeah, yeah. Okay?

853
01:45:57,850 --> 01:46:08,860
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So what do you want to do here?

854
01:46:09,020 --> 01:46:17,490
I would like to. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

855
01:46:17,500 --> 01:46:20,290
And I feel like I should do the feel of each other to do so.

856
01:46:20,290 --> 01:46:33,050
Like, if one of us, if it's, you know, thing like that or something like yeah, absolutely everything else is.
