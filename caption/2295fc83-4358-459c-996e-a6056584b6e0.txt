1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:05,940
This recording is about finding and using data.

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,337
So we're talking about data needed different types of sources and

3
00:00:09,337 --> 00:00:10,861
strengths and limitations.

4
00:00:10,861 --> 00:00:13,640
Different types of sources of data.

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:17,621
You might need a lot of different types of data for a cost effectiveness analysis.

6
00:00:17,621 --> 00:00:22,582
You might want epidemiological data incidence and mortality for

7
00:00:22,582 --> 00:00:29,140
example demographic data information on your population characteristics.

8
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:35,328
I also need effectiveness information on how effective your intervention is and

9
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:42,040
cost information on the costs of different aspects of your intervention.

10
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,761
So where do you find that data for cost effectiveness analysis?

11
00:00:44,761 --> 00:00:47,431
I don't think they're kind of two main sources.

12
00:00:47,431 --> 00:00:52,121
One databases like we saw earlier in the semester HCUP maps, things like that,

13
00:00:52,121 --> 00:00:54,240
the medical literature.

14
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:59,040
Other sources might be expert opinion or author assumptions.

15
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:03,957
So as far as databases go the Muennig text has some information on

16
00:01:03,957 --> 00:01:06,540
databases that are useful.

17
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,263
And if you're not sure which database to use good strategy is to look in other cost

18
00:01:10,263 --> 00:01:14,740
effectiveness analyses in the medical literature and see what they have used.

19
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:17,640
So where do you find these studies in the medical literature?

20
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:23,071
PubMed is good source, Google Scholar is also a useful source and

21
00:01:23,071 --> 00:01:27,415
I think it's also very valuable to use then Tufts new

22
00:01:27,415 --> 00:01:33,340
England Medical Center cost effectiveness analysis registry.

23
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,841
That's got a listing on a lot of different cost effectiveness analyses.

24
00:01:35,841 --> 00:01:40,469
And you can study or you can request or search for

25
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:47,940
studies based on diseases and keywords and so it's really handy.

26
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:52,916
When you're getting data from the medical research there

27
00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:58,010
are different study designs that those studies might use.

28
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:03,787
Some are observation studies, so and they might be called epidemiological or

29
00:02:03,787 --> 00:02:08,270
ecological ecological that study people in the real world.

30
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:13,232
So there might be cohort analyses, cross sectional analyses, time series analyses,

31
00:02:13,232 --> 00:02:15,740
case controller case studies.

32
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:20,738
Then there are experimental study designs like a randomized

33
00:02:20,738 --> 00:02:25,744
controlled trial and Meta analysis is a final study design.

34
00:02:25,744 --> 00:02:30,631
For these observational studies there's we can think of these as retrospective.

35
00:02:30,631 --> 00:02:35,312
Some of these are retrospective and if you're retrospective today is

36
00:02:35,312 --> 00:02:40,410
the present and we have algorithms, we evaluate people for disease today.

37
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:44,892
And with the retrospective design, you go back into the past and look for

38
00:02:44,892 --> 00:02:46,240
risk factors.

39
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:50,806
A prospect of study design, we look at the risk factors today in the present and then

40
00:02:50,806 --> 00:02:55,530
observe people over time into the future and look for the disease in the future.

41
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:58,540
In our experimental and control arms.

42
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:04,399
A randomized controlled drying controlled design is a prospect of research

43
00:03:04,399 --> 00:03:09,195
design that randomly assigned subjects to the experimental and

44
00:03:09,195 --> 00:03:14,840
control groups before evaluating them for the disease in the future.

45
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,400
When using any one of these studies signs,

46
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,910
we need to remember the distinction between correlation and causation.

47
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:25,731
Generally we're looking for causal relationships.

48
00:03:25,731 --> 00:03:30,404
How does something cause something else, generally are statistics give us

49
00:03:30,404 --> 00:03:34,220
a correlation or something correlated with something else.

50
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:39,083
And so it's we have to think about how do we actually establish that cause

51
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:45,040
a relationship and even if not can correlations alone tell us anything.

52
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,040
So keep in mind that correlation does not always mean causation.

53
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,202
The fact that something is caused by X

54
00:03:53,202 --> 00:03:58,210
is correlated Y does not necessarily mean that X causes Y.

55
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:02,051
Two main reasons are reverse causation and omitted variables here.

56
00:04:02,051 --> 00:04:07,401
So Y may cause X and that's why they're correlated or omitted variables.

57
00:04:07,401 --> 00:04:11,430
Y sorry, Z Is correlated with X and causes Y.

58
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:15,040
So Z causes maybe causes X and Y.

59
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,560
But maybe X does not cause Y.

60
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:23,290
So a simple example of reverse causation example might be rain and umbrellas.

61
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:28,451
If it's rainy, rain might cause umbrellas, but umbrellas are correlated with rains.

62
00:04:28,451 --> 00:04:32,699
So if you were in the basement of a building and hadn't been able to look

63
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:37,595
outside and see the weather, you saw a bunch of people coming in with umbrellas,

64
00:04:37,595 --> 00:04:41,051
you would assume that there had been rain outside because

65
00:04:41,051 --> 00:04:45,180
the two would be correlated people holding umbrellas and the rain.

66
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,655
But you wouldn't say the umbrellas caused the rain,

67
00:04:47,655 --> 00:04:49,840
they were correlated with the rain.

68
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,940
So that's reverse causation.

69
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:55,534
So let's think about some of these study designs,

70
00:04:55,534 --> 00:04:58,794
a cohort analysis is one type of study design,

71
00:04:58,794 --> 00:05:03,580
also known as a quasi experiment or prospective ecological study.

72
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:08,468
Some examples of cohort analyses might be examining medical records of

73
00:05:08,468 --> 00:05:13,447
high risk clients at a hospital over time and then asking a key question.

74
00:05:13,447 --> 00:05:17,705
Where people who received counseling likely to contract or sorry, less likely

75
00:05:17,705 --> 00:05:22,231
to contract HIV subsequently as compared to people who did not receive counseling.

76
00:05:22,231 --> 00:05:26,964
So that might be a cohort analysis examining this cohort of

77
00:05:26,964 --> 00:05:28,999
individuals over time.

78
00:05:28,999 --> 00:05:33,127
The way the statistics might work for a cohort analysis might be to use a multi

79
00:05:33,127 --> 00:05:37,140
variant regression controlling for potential confounders.

80
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:42,600
So your regression might look something like this, HIV as of 2010 would

81
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:47,660
be a function of some sort of baseline risk of HIV Plus Beta one times X.

82
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:52,277
X would be things like gender, ethnicity, age, socioeconomic status and

83
00:05:52,277 --> 00:05:54,460
things like that sunken founders.

84
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:58,364
Beta2 would be the the estimate of the impact of Z and

85
00:05:58,364 --> 00:06:03,425
Z here would be counseling one If it's counseling during this prior

86
00:06:03,425 --> 00:06:08,170
time period and zero, if not then you would be your error term.

87
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:12,340
So beta2 here would be the estimated mean effect of the intervention.

88
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:15,521
Now the question is dissipated to represent a causal relationship.

89
00:06:15,521 --> 00:06:17,390
And here's where we need to think about those relations.

90
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:20,512
The differences between correlation and causation and

91
00:06:20,512 --> 00:06:24,299
see if there might be some reverse causality or omitted variables,

92
00:06:24,299 --> 00:06:27,290
things like that and depends on how patients actually

93
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:32,040
use the counseling service if they're higher risk or low risk and so forth.

94
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:36,936
And are there some correlations in relationships between whether someone

95
00:06:36,936 --> 00:06:38,257
uses counseling and

96
00:06:38,257 --> 00:06:43,086
maybe the risk of HIV before we even think about the impact of counseling.

97
00:06:43,086 --> 00:06:47,121
Another type of analysis might be a cross sectional analysis.

98
00:06:47,121 --> 00:06:49,604
So this is not looking at people over time, but

99
00:06:49,604 --> 00:06:53,940
it's a sample of a bunch of people collected all at a single point in time.

100
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,950
How do we analyze this?

101
00:06:55,950 --> 00:07:02,440
You can control for confounding is in a multivariate regression or maybe ANOVA.

102
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:06,281
And this type of analysis might isolate the relationship between those

103
00:07:06,281 --> 00:07:08,970
intervention variables and outcome variables,

104
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:14,340
presumably independent of those confounds that you controlled for.

105
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:18,583
So, an example of cross sectional analysis might be to survey all clients at

106
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:22,827
a hospital in a high risk group and ask whether they contracted HIV in the past

107
00:07:22,827 --> 00:07:27,740
five years and whether they received HIV risk counseling in the past five years.

108
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:31,391
So that might be one way to do a cross sectional analysis.

109
00:07:31,391 --> 00:07:35,365
The limitations of this type of analysis that might be maybe the intervention came

110
00:07:35,365 --> 00:07:38,823
after the outcome or maybe there's some omitted variables founders,

111
00:07:38,823 --> 00:07:43,240
there might be recall problems with this as well.

112
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,156
A few types of can founders in in natural experiments, or

113
00:07:47,156 --> 00:07:51,420
observational studies is a treatment indication bias.

114
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:54,667
So maybe the more severe or risky cases are more likely to get a treatment

115
00:07:54,667 --> 00:07:57,540
intervention, so that might bias your results.

116
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:01,086
A different potential problem, like that would move things

117
00:08:01,086 --> 00:08:05,070
in the opposite direction would be a motivation to be healthy bias.

118
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:08,107
So maybe people who are more attentive to their health are more likely to receive

119
00:08:08,107 --> 00:08:09,170
treatment intervention.

120
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:13,510
So you can imagine an HIV risk reduction counseling intervention.

121
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:16,651
If the intervention were, if physicians and and

122
00:08:16,651 --> 00:08:21,707
health care providers were trying to give that intervention to the people they

123
00:08:21,707 --> 00:08:27,040
thought were most high risk, then we have this treatment indication bias.

124
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,832
And then maybe the people who got counseling would be more

125
00:08:29,832 --> 00:08:33,990
likely to get HIV, but simply because they were riskier individuals to start with.

126
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:38,294
On the other hand, if maybe this counseling was an opt in and

127
00:08:38,294 --> 00:08:44,780
maybe the people most motivated to change their behaviors might join the counseling.

128
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:49,540
And so maybe they would have been low risk or low risk anyway.

129
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:54,540
So those are the types of can founders to think about or concern yourself

130
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:59,889
about if if the study isn't randomized, if it's an observational study.

131
00:08:59,889 --> 00:09:04,169
They're also a simple time series analyses kind of before and

132
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:06,250
after pre post comparisons.

133
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:09,174
Those types of studies can be somewhat useful, but

134
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:13,040
there is a limitation that they don't have a control group.

135
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,173
So an example might be following clients who receive HIV risk

136
00:09:16,173 --> 00:09:19,061
counseling over time and then how light and then looking

137
00:09:19,061 --> 00:09:23,240
at what the risk is of contracting HIV before and after the counseling.

138
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,363
Sometimes these time series analyses are more general for

139
00:09:26,363 --> 00:09:30,270
evaluating interventions that affect continuous outcome, like BMI.

140
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:35,326
And it might be sensitive to show some sort of discrete jump before and

141
00:09:35,326 --> 00:09:39,180
after and the after period after the intervention.

142
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:43,764
There are also case control studies, so this might be used for

143
00:09:43,764 --> 00:09:48,351
evaluating uncommon medical outcomes that would occur a long

144
00:09:48,351 --> 00:09:53,440
period following an intervention or exposure of interest.

145
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,608
So here you select cases who realized a particular outcome like breast cancer and

146
00:09:58,608 --> 00:10:02,940
then compare those cases to controls who do not have that outcome but

147
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,080
have similar characteristics.

148
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:09,361
So the key question you're trying to answer here is are there significant

149
00:10:09,361 --> 00:10:11,019
differences in treatment or

150
00:10:11,019 --> 00:10:16,040
exposures like breast cancer may be affected by breast implants or something.

151
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:21,294
This is can be useful for studying a rare outcome or events that occur a long period

152
00:10:21,294 --> 00:10:27,340
of following the intervention, but it does have some significant limitations here.

153
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:31,850
It is difficult to find well matched controls or people who who have

154
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:35,506
similar characteristics as those in this is the cases,

155
00:10:35,506 --> 00:10:38,930
also there's recall bias and presumably the people

156
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:43,482
who have the cases might be might have been thinking more carefully.

157
00:10:43,482 --> 00:10:47,226
About what really may have happened to them in the past and

158
00:10:47,226 --> 00:10:52,140
kind of psychologically kind of think very carefully about what might have

159
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,091
happened to them in the past.

160
00:10:54,091 --> 00:10:58,733
Where as someone who doesn't have that outcome of interest, maybe they would

161
00:10:58,733 --> 00:11:03,445
forget about some of the exposures they may have had in the past because it's not

162
00:11:03,445 --> 00:11:10,240
so salient for them because they don't have that condition like breast cancer.

163
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,857
So another type of study would be a case study or case series, case,

164
00:11:14,857 --> 00:11:19,879
case series usually focus in depth on one or a handful of people data points

165
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:24,601
here and and often times these are more useful for qualitative data.

166
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:30,749
Not really quantitative data, so case studies might use interviews or

167
00:11:30,749 --> 00:11:36,400
some sort of content analysis or observation of individuals.

168
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:41,043
So an example related to HIV prevention might be some sort of in depth analysis of

169
00:11:41,043 --> 00:11:45,370
five people's life experiences in a community with very high HIV rates.

170
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:49,194
Because its qualitative it can actually give you a lot of richness

171
00:11:49,194 --> 00:11:53,390
of understanding of what the problems are and what the challenges are.

172
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:57,452
But the downside is oftentimes it's not it might not be as

173
00:11:57,452 --> 00:12:02,640
quantitative as you'd like.

174
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,051
Then we have randomized controlled trials.

175
00:12:05,051 --> 00:12:07,760
These are kind of the gold standard for medical evidence.

176
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,811
So an example might be a new HIV counseling intervention.

177
00:12:10,811 --> 00:12:14,592
We identify high risk clients at a hospital randomized a certain number two,

178
00:12:14,592 --> 00:12:18,314
the new counseling intervention and another the same amount to usual care,

179
00:12:18,314 --> 00:12:19,361
compare outcomes for

180
00:12:19,361 --> 00:12:22,740
the intervention versus control group after a period of time.

181
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:27,640
And oftentimes these analyses are done on what's called intention to treat.

182
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:33,500
So depending on what you were randomized to then we study your outcomes.

183
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,780
So maybe we randomised 500 people to new counseling, but

184
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:39,310
maybe only 400 completed the counseling.

185
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:44,203
I think that's important because that also highlights if the intervention

186
00:12:44,203 --> 00:12:45,940
itself has a problem.

187
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:48,125
So you can look at adherence and

188
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:53,190
see maybe this intervention is challenging to get people to adhere to.

189
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:55,952
If you do the analysis only on the complete ear's,

190
00:12:55,952 --> 00:13:00,130
that also might bias things because the people who are complete maybe are more

191
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:04,460
motivated and more motivated to take better care of their health or something.

192
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:09,759
So oftentimes the best way to look at these is based on the intention to treat.

193
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:12,498
Randomized trials have many advantages,

194
00:13:12,498 --> 00:13:15,940
they really are the best way to establish causality.

195
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:19,804
Randomization is designed to address baseline cofounders.

196
00:13:19,804 --> 00:13:24,580
So you get equal confounds presumably in each group, it's controlled so

197
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:28,584
it should address current can founders and if it's blinded,

198
00:13:28,584 --> 00:13:33,640
it should address reporting biases.

199
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:38,366
Also in randomized control trial allows researchers to conduct interventions to to

200
00:13:38,366 --> 00:13:42,424
be very specific to desired specifications so they can look at exactly,

201
00:13:42,424 --> 00:13:46,349
this specific counseling program because they're studying it and so

202
00:13:46,349 --> 00:13:51,940
they can design the study to evaluate a very specific counseling program.

203
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:54,850
With that said, the randomized control trial does have some limitations.

204
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:57,650
Oftentimes because they're expensive,

205
00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:01,400
they have smaller sample sizes and there's very short.

206
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,985
Oftentimes it's short term follow up without much long term follow up,

207
00:14:04,985 --> 00:14:08,291
there are some ethical concerns with randomized control trials.

208
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:11,595
If we really think the intervention is helpful and then the question is,

209
00:14:11,595 --> 00:14:15,140
is it ethical to randomize someone to not receive the intervention?

210
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:19,580
Likewise, if the intervention is risky, we ask the question is is

211
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:24,440
it really ethical to expose someone a risky intervention?

212
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:29,666
Also, randomized control trials might not be generalizable,

213
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:34,507
oftentimes randomized control trial will select patients

214
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:37,820
that only have the disease of interest.

215
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:42,088
So they might be kind of healthier than the general population that has this

216
00:14:42,088 --> 00:14:46,040
disease, oftentimes they exclude high risk patients for example.

217
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,908
And oftentimes these are very controlled environments with

218
00:14:49,908 --> 00:14:52,787
that have great staffing, great follow up,

219
00:14:52,787 --> 00:14:57,740
great adherence that might be better than what we see in the real world.

220
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:02,407
And so those are things to think about when you're looking at data from

221
00:15:02,407 --> 00:15:06,680
randomized controlled trial, see if you think that they really

222
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:11,585
are generalized able to whatever the cost effectiveness analysis is,

223
00:15:11,585 --> 00:15:14,150
a final studies on is a meta analysis.

224
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:16,776
It's really an analysis of analyses,

225
00:15:16,776 --> 00:15:20,840
it's a synthesis of previously conducted studies.

226
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:25,579
They have many advantages it's basically kind of combining many samples together,

227
00:15:25,579 --> 00:15:28,140
so you have a larger total sample size.

228
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:33,869
They also can be used to gather data from studies of many different varied settings,

229
00:15:33,869 --> 00:15:37,240
so it might have better external validity.

230
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:42,564
And potentially if it uses a set of slightly varying interventions,

231
00:15:42,564 --> 00:15:47,520
you can get a sense of how might additional interventions work

232
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:52,777
that aren't quite exactly the same as the interventions studied.

233
00:15:52,777 --> 00:15:55,862
With that set of data analysis can only be done if you have these previously

234
00:15:55,862 --> 00:15:56,771
conducted studies.

235
00:15:56,771 --> 00:15:59,340
So you someone has to have done the previous studies.

236
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:02,712
There can be variability in the underlining studies and

237
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:05,151
they're also can be publication bias,

238
00:16:05,151 --> 00:16:09,831
which means maybe studies that are not successful, never get published.

239
00:16:09,831 --> 00:16:14,501
And so the the studies that end up in the literature are only the successful ones

240
00:16:14,501 --> 00:16:19,051
and the ones that are unsuccessful get hidden, they're not republished.

241
00:16:19,051 --> 00:16:23,633
And so the public record of publications might be skewed

242
00:16:23,633 --> 00:16:27,440
towards studies that have an effect.

243
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:33,572
So here's an example of a meta analysis of some

244
00:16:33,572 --> 00:16:40,240
anti viral drugs used to prevent influenza.

245
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,422
And this is a meta analysis of laboratory confirmed symptomatic influenza with these

246
00:16:44,422 --> 00:16:45,840
different drugs.

247
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:49,175
Each row here represents a different study and

248
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:55,240
they're grouped by the types of antivirals also familiar and cinema here.

249
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,548
And when we look at this here, so

250
00:16:57,548 --> 00:17:02,676
this group up here at the top would be looking at those interventions and

251
00:17:02,676 --> 00:17:07,060
the top here, these ones are just also to move your studies.

252
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:12,260
Looking at the impact of the studies in each on the right hand side here,

253
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:16,440
these boxes and lines represent the the impact here.

254
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:20,640
You can see favors the NI or the neuraminidase inhibitor.

255
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,149
And so each study, each of these studies is the is the black box

256
00:17:25,149 --> 00:17:28,910
here into these four studies with the mean effect.

257
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:30,145
And the conference and

258
00:17:30,145 --> 00:17:33,721
the size of the black box represents the kind of size of the study.

259
00:17:33,721 --> 00:17:36,056
So these first three were kind of bigger studies and

260
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:37,911
the bottom study was a smaller studies.

261
00:17:37,911 --> 00:17:40,730
The boxes little smaller, you can see the confidence interval is much wider.

262
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:45,257
And then the bottom part of the diamond is the overall estimated impact for

263
00:17:45,257 --> 00:17:49,040
that drug in this case also to move here.

264
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,731
So this is the impact of the drug on symptomatic influenza.

265
00:17:52,731 --> 00:17:57,001
And so what we're interested in the end is kind of this overall diamond,

266
00:17:57,001 --> 00:17:59,241
in this case this relative risk here or

267
00:17:59,241 --> 00:18:02,461
the risk difference either one of those get an estimate

268
00:18:02,461 --> 00:18:06,670
of what that difference is kind of combining all the studies together.

269
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:12,296
So that's kind of meta analysis is a great solution if you haven't,

270
00:18:12,296 --> 00:18:14,150
great source of data.

271
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:18,090
Finally we have other source of data here expert opinion.

272
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:23,300
So maybe consulting physician specialists when you can't find data in the evidence.

273
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:27,125
So maybe you want to evaluate the quality of life with a certain rare condition but

274
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:29,620
there aren't any studies that have looked at that.

275
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:33,284
And you can always use author opinions and as authors of the study,

276
00:18:33,284 --> 00:18:37,537
sometimes the authors are experts and certainly have experienced looking in

277
00:18:37,537 --> 00:18:40,821
the literature and a little experience researching this.

278
00:18:40,821 --> 00:18:43,435
So they might know something about this.

279
00:18:43,435 --> 00:18:49,058
With that said, making if you're making your own assumptions about parameters,

280
00:18:49,058 --> 00:18:52,595
you definitely should use sensitivity analysis and

281
00:18:52,595 --> 00:18:57,495
use a wide range in your sensitivity analysis to reflect the fact that you

282
00:18:57,495 --> 00:19:02,340
might be quite uncertain about what those parameters might be.

283
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,549
So as you're using whatever data source you're using,

284
00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:06,270
you want to think about generalizability.

285
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,895
If you're looking at a study you want to ask,

286
00:19:08,895 --> 00:19:12,709
are the results generalizable to the analysis I'm trying to do?

287
00:19:12,709 --> 00:19:17,030
So in this study I've found in the literature, is it or in a data set?

288
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,041
Is it geographically relevant?

289
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:22,940
Also, are the patient characteristics similar to patients I'm thinking about?

290
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,991
Are the disease characteristics similar?

291
00:19:24,991 --> 00:19:27,538
Is this kind of the same severity of disease for example,

292
00:19:27,538 --> 00:19:31,440
and other treatments I'm looking at similar to the ones I'm trying to study.

293
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,936
Now with this said,

294
00:19:32,936 --> 00:19:38,230
you're rarely going to find a study that's exactly the same as yours.

295
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:42,444
So you need to be careful not to over generalize a study, but

296
00:19:42,444 --> 00:19:46,171
also be careful not to under generalize a study too.

297
00:19:46,171 --> 00:19:50,982
And sometimes you will have to try to generalize from a study that's not

298
00:19:50,982 --> 00:19:56,131
exactly the patient population or the intervention you're looking at.

299
00:19:56,131 --> 00:19:58,631
Just a few additional comments here,

300
00:19:58,631 --> 00:20:03,780
when you're knitting together data from different sources, be careful about how

301
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:08,810
you do pull data from different sources into your cost effectiveness analyses.

302
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:14,534
So let's say if we're trying to compare interventions A and intervention B,

303
00:20:14,534 --> 00:20:20,258
maybe if you grab the intervention effectiveness of study A from study one or

304
00:20:20,258 --> 00:20:25,840
the effectiveness of intervention be from study to that could be a problem.

305
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,156
Because we want to compare the effectiveness of these two and

306
00:20:29,156 --> 00:20:33,188
if the effectiveness is drawn from two different studies, there might be

307
00:20:33,188 --> 00:20:37,830
differences in the patient populations or methods and so that could be a challenge.

308
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:41,449
Also the costs, maybe the cost of intervention air drawn from study one

309
00:20:41,449 --> 00:20:45,270
costs of intervention be drawn from study two, that can also be a problem.

310
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:49,102
Because again those two states might have a different populations,

311
00:20:49,102 --> 00:20:51,440
different methods and so forth.

312
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:58,224
So keep that in mind ideally, I mean it's okay to pull stuff from different studies,

313
00:20:58,224 --> 00:21:03,408
but if you can it's best to get data from a study that's evaluated

314
00:21:03,408 --> 00:21:09,470
both of those interventions, either costs or effectiveness and so forth.

315
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:11,102
So they use similar methods and

316
00:21:11,102 --> 00:21:15,201
patient populations when looking at intervention A versus intervention B.

317
00:21:15,201 --> 00:21:19,091
Because in the end we're looking at the incremental difference between A and B.

318
00:21:19,091 --> 00:21:23,923
And so we want to choose hopefully studies that have had used similar

319
00:21:23,923 --> 00:21:29,340
methodology to evaluate both interventions A and intervention B.

320
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:33,421
And with that's the end of this little intro to collection data.
