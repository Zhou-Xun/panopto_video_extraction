1
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,590
Good morning, everyone.

2
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:15,420
So. Which one did you do get started for, actually?

3
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:30,810
So we usually just reason for that because anyone mentioned to you as possible and says I'm the problems that one.

4
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:41,420
So today I will be signing a new.

5
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:46,069
The U.S. only kitchen illnesses.

6
00:00:46,070 --> 00:01:02,030
And for that, you should have watched for, I believe, for a set of videos and the quiz and still have one more session to cover.

7
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:11,060
I'm like, It's just me. That exam will be posted next Thursday after after class.

8
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:22,500
Do you have so over six to finish that and we will have another the London and other problems that this kind of

9
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:33,170
methods that would be to also I believe nine 929 so we'll see how we're doing on the timelines for the problem set.

10
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:41,600
So 30 day before we start linkage analysis and like any questions you have,

11
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:50,209
I'm I was thinking I was thinking to saves have some time for you guys to work on problems that to to finish that

12
00:01:50,210 --> 00:02:01,550
because that's do days before class so could you like raise your hand if you're still working on how to do that?

13
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:07,070
So okay, so we'll do like 30, 30 minutes or 45 minutes, give you some.

14
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:12,440
Don't do that. And then we will talk about linkage analysis.

15
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:20,500
Okay. Okay. So start working.

16
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:30,172
I am here for 30 minutes and I think this is easy.

17
00:02:38,705 --> 00:02:46,595
even slightly different challenge that you let me have four more questions about it.

18
00:02:47,495 --> 00:02:54,004
But just in the last 15 minutes or so, let's talk a little bit about the combination and linkage.

19
00:02:54,005 --> 00:03:01,925
Analysis and linkage and conversation can be tricky.

20
00:03:01,925 --> 00:03:13,325
So any questions you start with like one after the hour?

21
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:23,944
Yeah, I guess I was like a little confused on Elodie and like how to calculate that like, yeah, okay.

22
00:03:23,945 --> 00:03:34,865
So we'll get to that. I feel like we'll do the practice problems that maybe next time and then it's really helpful to kind of work through an example,

23
00:03:34,865 --> 00:03:41,945
but we'll talk about it. I'll go through the slides quickly and see if I can answer some of them examples.

24
00:03:41,975 --> 00:03:46,985
Okay. See, I'm extremely critical of a practice problem set for you.

25
00:03:47,585 --> 00:03:51,395
Absolutely. Okay.

26
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:56,614
So you combination linkage studies.

27
00:03:56,615 --> 00:04:06,844
So linkage studies are sort of family based studies that were done sometimes in the nineties.

28
00:04:06,845 --> 00:04:15,785
And the idea was if you see a disease that's kind of said you need the family or a pedigree that's showing a certain disease,

29
00:04:16,325 --> 00:04:28,325
we want to know which genomic loci, which region of the genome was actually causing this this disease or this trait that you're interested in.

30
00:04:29,345 --> 00:04:34,625
So think about like you see the disease and you want to kind of map which genomic

31
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:41,345
location is actually being transmitted to the offspring and so causing the disease.

32
00:04:43,495 --> 00:04:53,184
So for that, that's how linkage studies are used and they're based on the idea of recombination.

33
00:04:53,185 --> 00:04:59,125
So a refreshing refresher on recombination meiosis.

34
00:04:59,575 --> 00:05:10,675
So whenever you have gametes forming the the that chromosomes like chromosome one through the mom comes up to from the dads.

35
00:05:10,705 --> 00:05:17,485
They're not just inherited like as one block but you have kind of crossing over between those two chromosomes.

36
00:05:17,965 --> 00:05:24,925
So you kind of have that shuffling of the of the genetic material from coming from mom and dad.

37
00:05:25,765 --> 00:05:33,565
And you see here, like how you add some some red and the blue chromosome here, some blue on the red chromosome here.

38
00:05:34,255 --> 00:05:40,555
And so this recombination results.

39
00:05:40,555 --> 00:05:51,655
And so remember how like Mendel's law talks about how you have traits being inherited independently,

40
00:05:51,655 --> 00:05:56,785
so those experiments on peas about color and whether they were smooth or wrinkled.

41
00:05:57,295 --> 00:06:06,145
So this is based on kind of an exception to that rule that some traits are inherited together and that's due to crossing over.

42
00:06:07,885 --> 00:06:17,695
And basically, if you think about genetic distance and it's like you're thinking about a marker,

43
00:06:18,265 --> 00:06:27,415
like a place that, you know, like a deviant or as the example as the example in the in the lectures talks about.

44
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:35,615
So if you're looking at a marker and you want to see whether it is moving with the with the disease locus.

45
00:06:35,765 --> 00:06:41,015
So the closer the distance is between the disease workers and the genetic foci,

46
00:06:41,585 --> 00:06:50,435
then the less likely they are to kind of separate during meiosis and have recombination happen.

47
00:06:51,305 --> 00:06:56,865
Is that kind of clear? So I'm going to draw here about.

48
00:07:12,685 --> 00:07:34,055
But basically. So you have you have like a section of the council and then you have like a marker here that could be at the end.

49
00:07:34,105 --> 00:07:44,075
TR Or sniff that, you know, it's location and then you have the disease locus here and these are less likely to recombine.

50
00:07:44,075 --> 00:07:50,855
So it's less likely that if they are close, it's less likely that like recombination will kind of.

51
00:07:53,635 --> 00:07:57,954
Break those two apart. And that's how we're going to say, oh, well,

52
00:07:57,955 --> 00:08:08,625
the disease locus is likely to be in this genetic region because it's kind of linked to this marker here that we know is located on chromosome, say,

53
00:08:08,785 --> 00:08:16,915
two or something versus if you have the locus here, then these are more more likely just because of the genetic distance,

54
00:08:17,185 --> 00:08:26,065
which is like in the slides we talk about how the genetic distance, it's kind of synergistic to the physical distance.

55
00:08:26,065 --> 00:08:32,915
So the further they are, the more likely they are to be broken up here and then they become unlinked.

56
00:08:33,865 --> 00:08:38,165
Is that clear? Any questions? That.

57
00:08:42,265 --> 00:08:50,005
Okay. So this is basically what this first set of slides talks about,

58
00:08:51,655 --> 00:09:05,375
how the genomic distance is kind of synergistic to the recombination recombination possibility segregation is being.

59
00:09:19,245 --> 00:09:25,214
So recombination fraction is is this is a measure of the genetic distance that

60
00:09:25,215 --> 00:09:32,895
we kind of just talked about and we calculate that we do know that with theta,

61
00:09:33,315 --> 00:09:39,194
which is the probability that values of two loci, two loci will be combined, you're going to need formation.

62
00:09:39,195 --> 00:09:42,705
So it's like the likelihood that they will kind of separate.

63
00:09:44,155 --> 00:09:50,805
So separate and if you have a theta 5.5, then what does that mean?

64
00:09:56,695 --> 00:09:59,875
What? There's no linkage. There's no linkage.

65
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:06,205
Yeah. So they are so far apart that they are not linked or they are.

66
00:10:06,235 --> 00:10:15,205
They could be even different chromosomes than a theta between zero and point five means that.

67
00:10:18,455 --> 00:10:25,385
They could be any combination. They are imperative together.

68
00:10:25,505 --> 00:10:28,525
They are linked. There's simply.

69
00:10:33,195 --> 00:10:35,475
And here we talk about genetic markers.

70
00:10:35,745 --> 00:10:46,064
So this is like places that we know where their location is across the the chemical, across all the chromosomes.

71
00:10:46,065 --> 00:10:51,645
And so we kind of use them to figure out where we are at the map, where we are,

72
00:10:51,675 --> 00:10:56,385
at which chromosome is which genetic location is associated with the disease.

73
00:10:58,035 --> 00:11:04,515
And I know there was a quiz question on the quiz about what could be an informative marker.

74
00:11:04,525 --> 00:11:08,745
So we look for for a variable marker.

75
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:18,795
So many fields that we're able to kind of have variation and then ideally have the frequencies to be roughly equal.

76
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:35,355
Any questions about that? Here's where it gets complicated with all the calculations and math.

77
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:46,565
So so whenever we have a pedigree, we could have faced those pedigrees or face unknown pedigrees.

78
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:54,585
So phase one is that when you know that the wheels are coming from parental chromosome.

79
00:11:54,595 --> 00:11:58,905
So if you have if you're looking at two genetic foci.

80
00:11:58,935 --> 00:12:12,315
So example here, if we know that both the 11 and the five are coming from one parent and then the 13 and six are coming from another parent,

81
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:17,995
then that's when you have phase one. So that's one. Remember that concept of haplotypes that we talked about?

82
00:12:18,015 --> 00:12:21,735
So the combination of because along the same chromosome.

83
00:12:22,185 --> 00:12:30,315
So if you're able to tell that this haplotype or this kind of combination comes from one comes from another parent,

84
00:12:30,705 --> 00:12:36,965
then that's when we say phase is known. And Phase unknown is that when you don't know?

85
00:12:36,985 --> 00:12:44,724
Well, this could be an 11 from the mom and then a six from a six and then a six from the mom.

86
00:12:44,725 --> 00:12:49,164
Two. But so the haplotypes could be either way.

87
00:12:49,165 --> 00:12:54,685
So a loving five, six or eight could be switched around for these two wheels.

88
00:12:56,365 --> 00:13:10,414
So there. And then whenever you have a phase known, it's kind of easier to know when the combination happens and when the combination does not happen.

89
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:21,455
So we're looking at example here. We know that these two kind of come from the same parent and we see them inheritance here.

90
00:13:23,295 --> 00:13:32,145
19 six So these are. So here, this is where you have three combination.

91
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:39,245
So the 11 and the six, that's then you have some type that you do not see in the parent generation.

92
00:13:39,255 --> 00:13:45,705
So you look at the parental generation, the 11 is with the five or the 13 with the six.

93
00:13:45,705 --> 00:13:50,115
But here in this child, here we have 11 with the six.

94
00:13:50,295 --> 00:13:53,805
So that's like an indication that recombination has happened.

95
00:13:55,685 --> 00:14:02,705
And that's the basis. Whenever we have a face known pedigree, then that's how we calculate theta,

96
00:14:02,945 --> 00:14:08,705
which is number of three components over the total number of informative meiosis.

97
00:14:10,385 --> 00:14:18,955
Have you. Is the number of informative meiosis, just the number of offspring that you get.

98
00:14:18,965 --> 00:14:23,195
So, so in this case.

99
00:14:23,705 --> 00:14:29,165
So an election that we talk about in the recording, how informative and non informative.

100
00:14:29,645 --> 00:14:40,655
So this one here we count as not informative because we cannot like you cannot tell which 11 five it is because they're homozygous basically.

101
00:14:41,945 --> 00:14:48,695
But if you have a heterozygous for both parents, then the number of informed minorities would be double.

102
00:14:49,145 --> 00:14:54,035
So for if this person has two different genotypes here.

103
00:14:55,645 --> 00:15:00,985
Then the number of my losses would be eight. And we'd be counting.

104
00:15:00,985 --> 00:15:07,795
Not so here. Like it's the same if you count offspring or kind of recombinant chromosome.

105
00:15:08,755 --> 00:15:14,575
But yeah, in that case, you know, it's not like this sibling.

106
00:15:14,575 --> 00:15:19,465
It's like recombinant chromosome, but it's double in the denominator.

107
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:24,535
Yeah, that's. It's a question of making sense.

108
00:15:26,575 --> 00:15:35,545
So it's possible for one offspring to have more than one in formative meiosis because it's based on the chromosomes, not the offspring.

109
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:38,835
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

110
00:15:42,685 --> 00:15:47,535
Question. Can you estimate theta if it's a phase unknown?

111
00:15:48,225 --> 00:15:52,815
Yes. Yes. Which is the next set of slides?

112
00:15:54,585 --> 00:15:59,445
So whenever we have face on tape, then we kind of have to think about both.

113
00:16:00,545 --> 00:16:10,115
Both scenarios. And then the thing that we estimated based on the likelihood estimate, which we would talk about, but basically.

114
00:16:12,565 --> 00:16:16,455
I think we would put two scenarios.

115
00:16:16,465 --> 00:16:24,705
So whenever you have face and know, let's say you have five siblings, a phase unknown and one is recombinant,

116
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:33,225
so then the kid would be one is one is recombinant and the came would be one then then it's up in front of meiosis.

117
00:16:35,175 --> 00:16:38,655
And then you would take the other scenario, which would be the opposite,

118
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:48,104
where all five of the other siblings with the four would be recombinant and the one would

119
00:16:48,105 --> 00:16:54,945
be non recombinant and we would do evidence of that in the formulas and other slides.

120
00:16:56,675 --> 00:16:56,945
I mean,

121
00:16:58,175 --> 00:17:08,045
I feel like it'll be clear once we solve the examples and how to account for the phase non pedigree example which meiosis are the informative ones.

122
00:17:10,925 --> 00:17:23,465
So whenever you have the parent not homozygous at the end of the of the joke what they were looking at then then the number

123
00:17:23,465 --> 00:17:34,355
of informed minuses would be four and like in this case it's four because you have four siblings or four offsprings.

124
00:17:35,015 --> 00:17:39,485
So they each have one. Yes. Because you can have meiosis for this gamete.

125
00:17:39,485 --> 00:17:46,595
Meiosis for this is for that. And so you have for informed and formative meiosis.

126
00:17:47,345 --> 00:17:55,475
This one here, we do not count because they like we cannot tell like how how the kind of the gametes are formed.

127
00:17:59,075 --> 00:18:03,395
How is that different from the first offspring?

128
00:18:03,605 --> 00:18:07,085
Because that one also has a lot in five, 11, five. Yeah.

129
00:18:08,195 --> 00:18:14,225
So this one is like. But we know for sure that one comes from here.

130
00:18:22,825 --> 00:18:27,035
Know. Yeah. I've been trying to watch this.

131
00:18:34,955 --> 00:18:40,355
So the meiosis what happened here are happening in the mom to create the gametes.

132
00:18:41,045 --> 00:18:49,145
So we know that the meiosis was if somebody could just pick this child, you've got that loving five from the mom versus the 36.

133
00:18:51,865 --> 00:18:57,045
Yeah, that makes sense. That's.

134
00:19:02,765 --> 00:19:06,485
So whenever we have a phase,

135
00:19:06,485 --> 00:19:22,144
I know that we use this estimate to estimate the recombination fraction and then the last set of slides talk about sort of testing statistical

136
00:19:22,145 --> 00:19:33,905
significance of that genomic region that we think is moving with the disease locus or that the marker and the legacy inherited together.

137
00:19:34,385 --> 00:19:40,085
Then we want to calculate the the logs of odds ratios of lots spores.

138
00:19:41,855 --> 00:19:47,745
And then so this is testing the null hypothesis that they are not linked.

139
00:19:47,765 --> 00:19:53,585
So the two well so we're looking at they're not saying that means the data is point five.

140
00:19:54,275 --> 00:20:01,755
Then the alternative is that they are linked. And then this is the formula to calculate the log score.

141
00:20:01,955 --> 00:20:14,075
So basically we're calculating the likelihoods at different values of theta compared divided by the likelihood of theta equals half,

142
00:20:14,075 --> 00:20:23,515
which we can use not linked. So it's like a ratio of theta at a certain value versus not linked.

143
00:20:23,615 --> 00:20:33,405
And then we would take the log. And this is this is basically just show me the formulas.

144
00:20:34,225 --> 00:20:42,595
If the formula, if you have no data, is equal to zero and you have no recombination introduced to this, and then if you have.

145
00:20:46,615 --> 00:21:01,995
So it as zero and you have these constant combinations then then the last one would be negative infinity, which indicates that they are unlinked.

146
00:21:05,085 --> 00:21:07,035
This is just interpretation.

147
00:21:07,245 --> 00:21:21,375
Typically in the field we do a lot of devalue of three to indicate that they are lengths that's like equivalent to .01 p value.

148
00:21:22,365 --> 00:21:31,735
Anything in between the three and the negative two, which is significant sort of against linkage.

149
00:21:31,755 --> 00:21:36,285
This one is kind of evidence, but not statistically significant.

150
00:21:48,855 --> 00:21:53,594
Swing the calculations and we'll go over them next time in the class.

151
00:21:53,595 --> 00:21:59,174
I feel like it would be much, much easier to understand once we work through an example,

152
00:21:59,175 --> 00:22:04,664
but this is just an overview of the concepts and you won't have to know all those formulas.

153
00:22:04,665 --> 00:22:15,615
It's basically it's basically this five kind of shows the formulas that you would want to know for most of the calculations.

154
00:22:23,665 --> 00:22:29,725
So next time we'll finish work on the practice and go through that.
