1
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:09,350
I could identify Bonnie and Clyde before I can say that the stories that I spent were like, Oh,

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,550
I think you make a card there that I haven't used, and now I'm going home and I feel really bad.

3
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:29,260
So that was pretty good. I feel bad, but I can't be like, Oh, this is the first one where you have to person.

4
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:35,430
You look like you don't you don't have to do that.

5
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:40,720
It's like I get my message to everybody and then maybe people are it.

6
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:47,130
Yeah, I was just about to do it.

7
00:00:47,400 --> 00:01:01,020
Yeah. I mean, there was no way we can survive today if we have a set of presentations.

8
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,260
So let's go ahead and get started.

9
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:07,810
So we'll start with some history.

10
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:52,400
Someone needs to get your problems and I have nothing, so I'm not ready.

11
00:01:55,850 --> 00:02:04,830
Yeah, just saying.

12
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:13,860
It's like the U.S. government.

13
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:31,040
I really like that type of talk.

14
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:37,310
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

15
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:54,040
You know? Yeah. Yeah. I don't know why you don't want to do that.

16
00:02:54,410 --> 00:03:03,780
I mean, someone else would just be like.

17
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:14,730
Now. I'm Dominic. Are you all right? So our overall topic was health incarcerated populations.

18
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:20,560
We specifically chose to focus on the health of pregnancies while in prison.

19
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:31,489
I'm Skye. I'm Amber. And I'm. So the target population we chose specifically, we went back and forth on this a few times.

20
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:35,300
But once pregnant adult women who are incarcerated in U.S. prisons,

21
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:41,330
we chose specifically adult women because there are juveniles who are incarcerated and

22
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:47,830
pregnant and they're going to be facing different issues or need different options here.

23
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:56,110
And then we chose this women specifically because there are almost no data on pregnant who are not since

24
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:03,530
women and first rate chose prisons because it's a bit different in jails and there's almost no data on that.

25
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:12,910
About 3% of women entering state prisons and 4% entering federal prisons are pregnant at the time of incarceration.

26
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:17,240
So this is a big issue and we wanted to address it.

27
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:25,880
Less than half of pregnant women in prison receive any form of care beyond them.

28
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:34,400
And not all incarcerated women who are pregnant get an obstetric exam, which is their basic minimum pregnancy care.

29
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:42,350
So next, we'll show some statistics on incarcerated pregnant women just to show how dire the situation is.

30
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:49,040
So over 220,000 women or who are incarcerated in the U.S. in 2019.

31
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:53,320
So this is like a 700% increase since the 1980s.

32
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,589
So. So overall, there's a lot of women who are incarcerated.

33
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:04,950
And it's particularly concerning when about 52% of incarcerated men and women are our parents.

34
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:14,520
There's also racial disparity as Latina and black women are 1.3 to 1.7 times more likely to be incarcerated than woman.

35
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:21,090
So based on these statistics, we can infer that among incarcerated women, the majority are parents who are black and brown.

36
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,900
So why does this matter?

37
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:33,390
Well, it matters because the number of incarcerated women has steadily increased since the 1980s, and it is also on a trajectory to continue to do so.

38
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:39,930
On top of this, women of color are disproportionately affected by these growth and incarceration rates.

39
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:45,810
And additionally, women who find themselves incarcerated are typically from vulnerable populations,

40
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:51,360
so they are more likely to experience poor access to health care before entering that system.

41
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:58,710
Have HIV or other eyes unmanaged chronic diseases such as heart disease,

42
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:04,620
diabetes and high blood pressure, which also have implications for their pregnancy as well.

43
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:12,180
Substance use disorders, history of violence and lower health literacy, which again have implications for the pregnancy as a whole.

44
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:22,760
So another thing that is important to understand is that while incarcerated, once they find themselves into this system,

45
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:28,580
the number of miscarriages and premature births occur at much higher rates than we see in the general population.

46
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:34,910
So we can see that there is a negative effect of not only being of a vulnerable population, but then entering the correctional system.

47
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:39,050
So there are also a limited number of policies that protect these individuals.

48
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:42,139
And even across different cultural institutions,

49
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:49,070
we can see that there's also an additional disparity because because many of the systems are run by private institutions,

50
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:57,100
they have the liberty to create their own policies. So even amongst incarcerated women, we may also see additional disparities depending on how low.

51
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:02,870
On top of this, there are also a shortage of why is that practice in these facilities.

52
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:07,040
So already there there's even if they are they had policies in place.

53
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:11,270
There is just a limited number of personnel. So you can provide that care for these individuals.

54
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:20,660
And these factors can all have long term implications for not only the baby, but the pregnant women as a whole across over time.

55
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:29,810
So a couple the outcomes of the current policies is that we see that when women enter the carceral system,

56
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:35,360
there's pretty severe implications for their pregnancy and the health of them themselves and their baby.

57
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,660
When we look at it from a proximal perspective,

58
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:45,200
they just simply aren't receiving either prenatal care or it's a really poor quality of prenatal care they are receiving.

59
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:51,260
So that can be stuff like lack of education about their health and their baby's health, lack of emotional and social support,

60
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:56,910
and inadequate access to things like vitamins and supplements that would sustain that health and

61
00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:01,940
a healthy pregnancy and then poor mental health for those who are incarcerated and expecting.

62
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:07,760
There are also distal outcomes that we have here and overall those just outcomes are just an

63
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:13,430
increased occurrence of adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes that we have in our uterine growth,

64
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,229
retardation, retardation,

65
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:21,880
low birth weight and maternal and child mortality rates are relatively higher in comparison to the general public just because

66
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:29,270
the risk of infections and a couple of these other things are much higher when you are in prison and not receiving proper care.

67
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:38,480
So women who find themselves in the carceral system are more likely to come from disadvantaged backgrounds,

68
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:47,630
which include having a low socioeconomic status or educational opportunities or quality of education in their communities.

69
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,850
Inadequate health care access. So limited access to health care facilities as is.

70
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:57,980
And they're more likely to engage in risky sexual behaviors and experience interpersonal violence.

71
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:03,889
So once they move into the control system, they so once they move into the carceral system,

72
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:11,210
they have this effect on the behavior, socio and social rights and environmental factors and personal factors.

73
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,940
And the reason why we talk about all three of these factors is because we

74
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:18,410
actually use Bender's theory on reciprocal determinism to look at this issue.

75
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:26,360
So that theory talks about how all of these factors are influenced by and influence each other to to

76
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,770
affect that behavior in the behavior we're looking at is engaging in that prenatal care or having that.

77
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:38,109
So incarceration while being pregnant, therefore affects all of these different factors in different ways.

78
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:45,220
We have those listed here. So like behavior, you're less likely to engage in prenatal care activities if they aren't provided.

79
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:50,830
There's less social support in prison and lack of provisions for proper care.

80
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:59,440
And in terms of personal, there's chronic stress. Self regulation may be threatened and there's a lower perceived, lower perceived social support.

81
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:05,980
So all of those have effects on those factors, which in turn all affect each other, according to Banderas theory.

82
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:14,080
So yeah, so some of these factors can have negative effects on women's behavior as far as their pregnancy is concerned.

83
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,810
While they're in the castle system, however,

84
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:23,170
there are positive effects that the castle system could have with community and organizational engagement.

85
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:27,520
And I do want to bring you guys to your attention to our little key here.

86
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:35,350
This is influenced by the ecological models where we now have everything color coded just for your convenience.

87
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:38,080
So I just want to orient you guys in that way.

88
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:46,690
But also the positive effects that can be had by community and organizational partnerships can be that women

89
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:53,680
receive more help from health care providers while they're in the carceral system from community partnerships.

90
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:59,530
And they also have access to people who come in from outside health clinics.

91
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:07,030
They can also have birthing doulas and coaches come in to talk to them about like how you can access

92
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:12,850
resources and really find out more information about how to care for your pregnancy while in this system.

93
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:21,610
And there also are people who can come in and provide mental health coaching, such as parenting classes or how to manage.

94
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:25,030
Like if you do have an STI, how to manage that during a pregnancy.

95
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:33,040
And all of these are influenced by the into organizational relations theory, which aims to address change across organizations,

96
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:40,570
which focuses on how all of these organizations who may have different missions like providing mental counseling or providing STI care,

97
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:50,199
they may all have different aims individually, but this theory really focuses on how they work together in order to come to a overall agreement on

98
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:55,450
how to really help these pregnant populations and their pregnancies while they're incarcerated.

99
00:11:56,140 --> 00:12:07,160
So, like Amber said, this can have a positive impact on the behavioral, personal and environmental factors and therefore we see these other outcomes.

100
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:14,830
So the proximal outcomes being that an individual may not be able to attend physical examinations or have access to those prenatal vitamins,

101
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:20,920
and maybe they have a support group now that they can go to and receive that social support that was lacking prior.

102
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:28,810
And then it also leads us to the distal outcomes, which means overall there's a decreased frequency and risk for adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes.

103
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:37,209
We talk about the intervention that we designed, we had to play a couple of different components.

104
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:43,450
As you saw, there are a lot of different risk factors at play in resulting in these adverse outcomes.

105
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:49,640
So in terms of prevention, we talked about education in the community before people enter the system.

106
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:53,170
We talked about how there's low health literacy in disadvantaged communities.

107
00:12:53,590 --> 00:13:01,479
So increasing that would be one way to decrease risky pregnancies in our personal system and then

108
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:06,910
addressing those other more systemic risk factors that we talked about on the previous slide.

109
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:11,260
And then, of course, education inside the carceral system,

110
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:17,620
teaching expectant mothers how to care for themselves and their pregnancies and just what to expect throughout pregnancy.

111
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:23,110
With less than half of women in the correctional system are pregnant receiving any kind of education.

112
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:28,510
There's no way really to find out what you can expect, what's normal and what's not normal terms of your pregnancy.

113
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:34,030
And we address social support with group sessions.

114
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:40,900
It's a very isolating experience to be pregnant in prison, feeling like you don't have any kind of support from people,

115
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:47,230
same experience or people who can talk to you about their experience or what you can expect.

116
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:53,379
And then increasing access to things like vitamins, obstetric exams, nutrition,

117
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:58,740
and other items like training to care for your pregnancy that you generally can't get inside of.

118
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:09,520
Some of the limitations that we ran into trying to figure this out was the structural and systemic nature of the problem.

119
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:16,620
We talked about the risk factors that a lot of incarcerated people have before they enter the system.

120
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:24,880
There is only so much that you can do once people are already in carceral systems to address those things in that setting.

121
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:31,270
We also. Grappled with very limited autonomy in prison.

122
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:38,969
There's only so much help that education can provide when you just don't have access to the things like even

123
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:46,890
if you are willing to engage in health behaviors and do that education and you just don't have the resources,

124
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:54,780
there's not much you can do about it. And then similarly, the behavior change is just really limited by availability and access to what you have.

125
00:14:57,210 --> 00:15:02,370
So I want to get into what we want to give a real, real world example of what our intervention would look like.

126
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:08,170
So what that would look like is the grassroots organization Motherly Intercession, which is based in Flint.

127
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:12,420
So they partner with community organizations, local churches and social workers.

128
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:18,480
They focus on the children of incarcerated parents, but also the family and the incarcerated parent.

129
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:24,600
So for incarcerated mothers, they have weekly parenting and support group sessions and the Genesee County Jail.

130
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:30,870
They also weekly sessions to help for the parents, to help reduce the incarceration related stress,

131
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,620
and then also to help them develop behaviors to become better parents.

132
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,870
They also help preserve the family structure.

133
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:43,470
But by providing the children with bi monthly face to face visitations with their mother or their incarcerated father,

134
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:47,910
that they also help the mothers sign up for health insurance.

135
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:53,730
And then for the children, they provide afterschool homework assistance, tutoring and reading, writing, math.

136
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,050
And they also have a summer day camp with academic support and field trips.

137
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:02,219
So not only are they supporting the incarcerated parents and the family,

138
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:05,970
but also the children to make sure that the children feel that social support, too.

139
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:11,850
Now our experience. So there was a little bumps in the road.

140
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:17,460
We had some trouble with our conceptual models, such as figuring out what behavior change we wanted to address,

141
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:22,800
especially when incarcerated women who are pregnant. It's largely a systemic problem issue.

142
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:29,940
We also had trouble narrowing down our topic as the original topic of health of incarcerated populations is very broad.

143
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:35,280
So overall, we learned a lot about disparities among pregnant women who are incarcerated.

144
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,930
Then also just working together as a group. The.

145
00:16:46,700 --> 00:17:16,510
Thank you so much for your kind of questions now just so strong, you know?

146
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:27,620
Yeah, that's what I like about the design.

147
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:50,320
You know, I feel like that's the one place I don't think that you are a little tiny facility.

148
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:55,460
Pretty comfortable. Yeah, it was impulsive last time.

149
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,450
I it's. I think so.

150
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,970
I thought I saw something at Target was me. Hi.

151
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:15,059
I'm Audrey. Annie, this is Hannah calling because environmental justice is a social movement rooted in the civil rights movement that seeks

152
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:22,770
to address the unfair burden of environmental exposures for low income and black communities such as air pollution,

153
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:29,000
which is our focus today. So one illness related to air pollution is asthma.

154
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:34,580
And asthma is a medical condition in which certain stimuli trigger the narrowing of airways.

155
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,920
And as you can imagine, this leads to proximate outcomes, such as wheezing, coughing and shortness of breath.

156
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:47,990
And some distal outcomes include increased risk of lung infection and scarring, as well as limitations to work and social engagements.

157
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:57,049
So data from 2019 showed that in Detroit there are 20.3 asthma hospitalizations per 10,000 people,

158
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:59,720
which is four times the rate of Michigan as a whole.

159
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:06,740
And as you can see in this graph, adults and children living in Detroit have much higher rates of asthma compared to the rest of Michigan.

160
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:16,480
So in this graph, you can see that it's specifically black Detroiters that have much higher asthma hospitalizations compared to white residents.

161
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:22,360
And this is a problem. One, hospitalizations, hospital outpatient care and emergency room care costs a lot.

162
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:29,440
And this is all compounded by the cost of inhalers, which rose by 35% between 2013 and 2018.

163
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:39,310
And today, the average price of an inhaler is $380, with the cheapest being slowly and that Advair being the most expensive.

164
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:44,920
And as you can tell, this is really a problem considering the economic background of many Detroiters.

165
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:53,170
Okay, so what increases risk of asthma? The primary culprits are indoor and outdoor air pollutants.

166
00:19:53,620 --> 00:20:00,850
Indoor air pollutants can look like mold, pollen and dust, which is usually found in old or poorly maintained buildings.

167
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:03,879
And when thinking about indoor air pollution,

168
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:09,340
it's important to think about workplaces or spaces outside of homes that you spend a lot of time indoors.

169
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:20,280
Outdoor exposures can often look like being in close and prolonged proximity to major highways and heavy industry folk,

170
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:29,200
which emit a lot of particulate matter. And because certain groups are at a higher risk of experiencing these environmental exposures,

171
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:34,750
I really think this is why it's really important to bring this environmental justice perspective to this issue.

172
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:45,600
Okay. So considering the risk factors for asthma, we narrowed our target population to the 48206 zip code.

173
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:52,860
So looking at the map on the left here, this is from E.J. Screen, which is a really cool tool created by the EPA.

174
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:58,890
And they map sociodemographic data and environmental exposure data all across the country.

175
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:06,780
And we think that this map does a really good job of showing how pervasive asthma is among adults in Detroit.

176
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:10,530
And you can see our target zip code kind of within this landscape.

177
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:17,550
And on the right, here is a map that was actually part of a tool created at the University of Michigan.

178
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:30,600
And the researchers gave Detroit a high score, which means that they found high levels of or high risk of exposure to environmental hazards.

179
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:35,390
And also they found high levels of indicators of social disadvantage.

180
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,940
And by that they mean high levels of poverty,

181
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:47,130
low educational attainment and high proportion of minority populations, all of which we know to be true of Detroit.

182
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:55,589
And so, considering the prevalence of asthma in Detroit in conjunction with this sociodemographic landscape,

183
00:21:55,590 --> 00:22:00,000
it's really apparent that Detroit is an environmental justice hotspot.

184
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:09,240
And this is of great concern. And you can see how our zip code is kind of nestled in at the heart of this issue.

185
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:18,760
Which brings us to our conceptual model. So we were kind of looking at a lot of underlying things and trying to narrow down and

186
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:23,230
take it from the entire environmental justice wider lens to a more individual lens.

187
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:32,290
So we started with our antecedents, and here we were really leaning on fundamental cause theory and looking at a lot of sort of initial like aspects

188
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:38,290
of the community as well as then the impacts of the policies and all these years of like systemic issues.

189
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:45,129
And which brings us to our predictor. So we're looking a lot at the built environment and how these fundamental causes, these antecedents,

190
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:53,170
lead into the built environment and then into our mediators being a lot of the financial factors as well as they one being the environmental

191
00:22:53,170 --> 00:23:03,340
exposures themselves and trying to narrow in on how these things all lead to people being exposed to variable amounts of pollutants.

192
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:08,920
And then when trying to sort of go from those actual exposures to the outcomes,

193
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:13,480
identified some moderators and here we were looking more on the socio ecological level

194
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:17,950
and trying to identify a bunch of different levels at which those moderators occurred,

195
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:25,959
including some wider levels, financial and social barriers being broader, things that within our culture that are impacting those things.

196
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:31,940
And then on a more narrow force, more narrow scope, looking at the individual and family levels,

197
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:38,140
the tools that people do or do not have that allow them to mitigate the impact of those exposures on them and their families.

198
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:45,340
And then as we discussed our outcomes, obviously asthma diagnosis being that initial overlying outcome,

199
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:48,160
but focusing a little bit more on proximal being,

200
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:54,130
how you're experiencing at the moment being diagnosed, how does that affect you to day to day to day to day?

201
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:58,780
And then distally looking more like that cumulative effect of that cost over time,

202
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:07,420
the impact on your ability to participate in different things throughout your life, the actual overwhelm there, the cumulative health impact as well.

203
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:14,290
So as I mentioned, these were kind of our main theories that we incorporated into building the actual model.

204
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:20,950
So starting out with the fundamental cause theory to identify underlying factors and then moving into the social ecological

205
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:27,250
to look at the multiple levels on which those factors influence people and then how much those factors could be mitigated.

206
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:34,750
Cool. So our intervention consists of four parts and part one.

207
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:38,799
And two of our intervention were really inspired by Latino Health Access,

208
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:47,530
which was the diabetes management program that we learned about in a theory, assessment and kind of modeled off the structure of that intervention.

209
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:56,050
We really wanted to create a space that centers community expertise to hopefully improve asthma outcomes in a sustainable way for the community.

210
00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:04,570
So part one of our intervention, we would seek out local community members that would be willing to support with the

211
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:09,970
dissemination and installation of air filters for homes and workplaces within their community.

212
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:17,410
And ideally, these air filters would be fully subsidized by grants that our program would have successfully secured.

213
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:25,389
And community leaders would also be trained on the importance of air filters for mitigating asthma,

214
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:29,980
and they would be equipped with the skills to communicate that information to their community.

215
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:39,879
And so by providing Detroiters with tangible equipment, but also knowledge, to take steps at the individual level to mitigate asthma,

216
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:45,310
we're really hoping to improve autonomy, which is a construct of self-determination theory.

217
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:55,389
And in this construct, we're trying to address this construct as we work to empower community members with a sense of control over their health,

218
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:59,110
but also a sense of control over the built environment within which they reside.

219
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:06,790
And also by creating spaces for community members to rise to positions of leadership

220
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:11,380
is a really empowering opportunity for these historically marginalized communities.

221
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:17,230
And that just speaks to another way of how this part of our intervention is working to improve autonomy.

222
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:26,510
Okay. Part two of our intervention will be health literacy programing to improve community capacity.

223
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:35,240
And so this would look like trainings, workshops and even more informal community gatherings that would be facilitated by these community leaders.

224
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:43,970
And they would offer resources and knowledge related to asthma prevention, management symptoms, mitigation.

225
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:54,770
And our goal here with increasing health literacy as it relates to asthma is really to empower and organize impacted communities,

226
00:26:54,770 --> 00:27:00,560
to take these steps at the individual levels to improve their asthma outcomes.

227
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:08,990
And so this component of our intervention addresses self-efficacy, which is a construct of the social cognitive theory.

228
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:20,089
And so these efforts to increase self-efficacy, specifically through locally informed and locally directed capacity building is

229
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:23,930
really hopefully working to improve overall confidence at the individual level,

230
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:30,170
to engage with asthma prevention and mitigation strategies to then overcome these environmental barriers.

231
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:41,690
So the interventions that I mentioned there varies like individual level, but we also need to think like bigger, broader like interventions as well.

232
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:48,580
So we thought of community advocacy for stronger zoning laws and for stricter industrial regulation, which kind of go hand-in-hand.

233
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:55,030
So stronger zoning laws would look like not having someone's home right next to a polluting industrial plant.

234
00:27:55,690 --> 00:28:01,300
And then stricter industrial regulation would look like putting on carbon caps for like PM 2.5.

235
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:09,880
Sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide. And these two are rooted in the community organizing models under issue selection.

236
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:16,150
So it's really about rallying people behind one issue to tackle first, and it's usually most relevant to their lives.

237
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:26,790
So this matters because our interventions are like a step for Detroit to become a more equitable and environmentally conscious city.

238
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:33,480
And we're aiming to decrease the disproportionate impact of environmental exposures on low income black communities.

239
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:44,549
It's a reflection on behalf of our group. We did kind of struggle to think of interventions for our topics since we were really

240
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:49,920
coming at the issue of asthma from a more structural and environmental justice lens.

241
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:53,219
And so it was kind of hard to think of interventions that could be informed by

242
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:57,180
the theories that we learned in class that were more individual and behavioral.

243
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:02,340
Yeah, but overall we thought it was cool to see our conceptual model morph through

244
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:06,510
iterations as we learned about theories and literature related to our topic.

245
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:28,460
I'd like to.

246
00:29:48,500 --> 00:30:10,580
There was also some allegations of drug use.

247
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:24,490
You know what he's saying?

248
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:40,680
I think you should have more faith. Okay. Good afternoon, everyone.

249
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:43,690
So I'm Davina. And with me I have J.

250
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:53,719
Max and we are going to present to you about mental health management in the LGBTQ citizens of the United States moving forward.

251
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:57,080
This is just a general overview of our entire presentation.

252
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:05,600
Why do we choose this topic? Who are we addressing? What are we being brainstormed, conceptual model baby and how do we plan to intervene?

253
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:14,150
Moving on to the back, a little bit of background. So from all school closures and prolonged isolation during the onset of COVID 19 took an indirect

254
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:19,549
toll on youth mental health and consequently triggering increased rates of anxiety and depression,

255
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:22,280
especially in our LGBT adolescent population.

256
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:33,170
75% of LGBTQ adolescents reported experiencing anxiety to date from COVID and 61% LGBTQ adolescents reported symptoms of depression.

257
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:40,560
Of that, 82% of LGBT adolescents planning to seek out a method of health management.

258
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:48,830
But of the 80%, 60% LGBTQ adolescents were able to receive any health care management.

259
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:53,780
And so during a time like COVID 19,

260
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:59,059
we wanted to focus our mental health management project on a population that already had a high prevalence of mental

261
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:04,940
health struggles and a low prevalence in data of seeking out and taking part in mental health management services.

262
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:10,720
Since many behaviors and habits are established in adolescence that carries over to adulthood,

263
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:14,440
this left us led us to shift our focus towards LGBTQ adolescents.

264
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:18,530
Because because of our youth population support, you know.

265
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:25,520
And so given our outlook, it's especially vital to ensure that LGBTQ plus adolescents develop the good mental health management

266
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:31,040
practice and are provided the appropriate resources to ensure their overall well-being and achieve success.

267
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:38,170
Target people. And so we select LGBTQ adolescents and as our target people.

268
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:46,020
And the AP teen at the age of 13 to 19 and their education is activation for words like lesbian and gay.

269
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:52,100
And these terms are used to describe a person's sexual orientation or gender identity.

270
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:55,969
And the LGBTQ community has a different risk factors.

271
00:32:55,970 --> 00:33:02,120
And most than heterosexual peers, such as the host's sexual orientation and the rituals,

272
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:10,089
adolescent community reasons is that they are in critical neurological and the development stage and therefore

273
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:16,520
all adults and they heighten the effects of stress on mental health and a significant memory sits on

274
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:24,829
development and of time on us is to stress and is due to this unique maybe risk factors and that sexual

275
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:32,059
group is more likely to suffer from mental illness combined with maybe our project background COVID 19.

276
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:41,570
So this new squeeze for inclusion and to kind of like focus on some of the snapshots on the outcomes we're focused on for our project.

277
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:47,180
We found through some of the research in this field, we broke it down to that proximal outcome just I just format.

278
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:51,950
So some of the proximal outcomes we're looking at such as the first time consultation with the mental professional,

279
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:56,870
whether or not they were able to make contact at all if they were already having that help seeking behavior present.

280
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:03,080
Also the initial diagnosis of a mental health disorder and nobody gave statistics about the prevalence of depression anxiety for example,

281
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:07,340
in this population trauma disease outcomes like focusing on that continual visit

282
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:10,309
to therapy over a six month period that was generally sought measurement,

283
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:16,520
those using a lot of research that we found and that would be following that first time consultation.

284
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:21,410
So following that patient throughout a much longer period of time to see the patient team to receive that treatment.

285
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:26,870
And then overall, like a reduction of mental health disorder symptoms as treatment continues.

286
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:31,670
Right? So now let's go to the bite study of a conceptual model.

287
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:36,109
So this was a tough process, but the initial base for our draft,

288
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:40,910
when we kind of looked at the predictor as the quarantine procedures during COVID pandemic,

289
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:47,360
and then we wanted to look at the outcome as mental health issues like, as Max explained, depression and anxiety.

290
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:52,160
So this was our first model that we came up with, pretty proud of it, but most of it was made up.

291
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:56,570
And and the thing is, this is what we presented.

292
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:02,660
So we rejected it because we looked into research. We didn't find back backing, but much so much of this data.

293
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:11,629
So we went to the second model, modify things around and and then around two and a half weeks before what happened was we realized with a mental

294
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:16,490
health management group and not the mental health issue group because there's a different group for that and then

295
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:23,510
we freaked out pre to all the got to there might be research and I think that we rejected this model and so we

296
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:30,110
used that as the base for the draft three and that's when we came up with this model a little slightly better.

297
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:38,900
Just to highlight, we came up with help seeking behavior as a behavioral outcome and then that going to Legg Mason Mental Health Management.

298
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:46,850
So we worked on this, improvised this do this, which is very close to our present model and now coming to our baby.

299
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:52,790
So we have predictor as the quarantine procedures of COVID 19 going to the outcome,

300
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:56,120
which is the mental health management which already Max is going to do us.

301
00:35:56,360 --> 00:36:03,589
So we wanted to see the relationship. And what we found out from literature is that there are some factors like these which act

302
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:07,970
as mediators because they sort of like influence how the predictor goes to the outcome.

303
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:14,990
So we structured this in layers and then because of time constraints, I can go through each of this, but I'll tell you the most important ones.

304
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:20,000
So generally because of COVID 19, all of us know we were forced to isolate ourselves.

305
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:25,249
So that comes into that category. Under institution, we have all these adolescents working.

306
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:28,010
There are no barriers to schools because schools were closed down.

307
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:35,690
But the reason why I wanted to point that out was because schools were one resource where these kids used to go out to seek mental health resources.

308
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:41,030
So when that shut down, they were not able to access any of this. And we have barriers to social.

309
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:44,990
Activities and obviously availability and accessibility to healthcare services.

310
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:53,780
And then we go to Inter-personal where we want to deal between people with respect to family, with respect to with respect to the community at large.

311
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:58,420
So obviously, this LGBTQ community is a minority.

312
00:36:58,430 --> 00:37:02,690
They felt a lot of like stigmatization in general and neglect.

313
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:09,860
But one important thing that I want to point out here is family neglect, where parents were not able to accept their kids because of their identity.

314
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:16,640
So they were basically thrown out from home. And that's why schools were an important place for them to reach out to for mental health resources.

315
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:21,349
So and then coming to interpersonal, which is basically within themselves,

316
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:26,600
where they had faced issues concerning internalized homophobia and gender expression,

317
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:32,240
then we had this confusion of where to place socioeconomic status and geographical location.

318
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:39,199
Now, the reason why we placed it here within the interpersonal is because we wanted to we wanted it with

319
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:44,690
respect to the individual and adolescent does not get to decide which family they are born into.

320
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:48,440
So sometimes they are born into families of lower socioeconomic status.

321
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:55,909
So they have extra burden of stress upon themselves because of financial constraints and other all sorts of reasons and for similar reasons,

322
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:59,360
geographical locations with respect to rural and urban.

323
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:01,040
So that's why we placed that did.

324
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:08,000
And then we have the moderator, which is health seeking behavior, which we defined as them actually going to seek out for mental health,

325
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:17,329
either directly from the health care providers or finding some source which sort of directs them to that maximum.

326
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:29,330
Sort of explain to us how what the theories conform. So kind of describe like how we came to this ultimate form of our conceptual model.

327
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:35,300
Generally, I mean, I really took a note from the social ecological model in terms of the overall structure of the main bubble of the diagram.

328
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:43,040
Just focusing on that like expanding out sort of factors of interpersonal, interpersonal, institutional, general like general being isolation.

329
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:52,179
We also implemented the minority stress theory, which was a specific theory that focused on how different stressors are much

330
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:56,320
more prevalent for certain minority groups and how we can better tackle those.

331
00:38:56,740 --> 00:39:00,190
So that's like how we looked at for those social stigma, social neglect,

332
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:06,850
those very specific stressors that were very unique to our group, or at least were more prevalent and more severe.

333
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:15,560
In Las Vegas incorporated our health leaf model and that emphasis on perceived barriers and perceived self efficacy.

334
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:20,809
So then those kind of fed into like the perceived barriers to get out there,

335
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:24,990
clearly their schools were closed when they had access to counselors, perceived some efficacy,

336
00:39:25,010 --> 00:39:27,410
whether or not they felt that they were able to actually complete that,

337
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:32,420
like the first consultation with the counselor and just being able to take that and

338
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:37,210
help us narrow down like some of the factors we wanted to include in this general.

339
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:42,550
And so for interventions, kind of respectfully, these are the goals for each one.

340
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:47,530
So the first one is always to provide the community with in-depth needs assessment.

341
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:54,760
Second is to increase community and social support and to integrate school counselors and other mental health professionals into the community.

342
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:00,340
And finally, to assist LGBTQ adolescents with developing healthy coping strategies through an action plan outside of school.

343
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:07,690
Okay, so starting where the people are, doing what the LGBTQ community needs is what we did through our needs assessment.

344
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:15,610
And so from our literature review, we found some common themes that is like having structurally and linguistically competent support systems,

345
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:21,700
having free access and ability that are available off of the systems and then unbiased treatment,

346
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:25,360
having safe and inclusive spaces and community and familial acceptance.

347
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:33,460
So we used concepts from the social support to sort of go through interventions for these needs specifically.

348
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:40,209
And some of the interventions that we came up was one was to have an integrated healthcare system that is a hospital where there

349
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:47,320
are doctors that are psychologists and then that is like the insurance companies and then that is also social workers who can,

350
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:50,590
you know, sort of like shuffle between hospital and the students homes.

351
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:57,460
And these are strategically placed schools and playgrounds where students have access to it very easily.

352
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:05,530
Another thing we thought of is a compulsory online training module for the medical student medical school students.

353
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:09,640
Such that as health care professionals, they are trained in LGBTQ issues.

354
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:17,170
And then and like, for example, identity development and substance use, STDs, all of those things.

355
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:25,780
And also they adopt about how to communicate in a non-biased manner and also by using non stigma, stigmatizing language.

356
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:34,450
Another thing we thought about was how do we address bed? And so one place parents come in comes to is the parent teacher meetings at school.

357
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:44,260
So we thought that we would conduct programs that create awareness about the LGBTQ issues in general so that we are addressing parents in the schools.

358
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:49,120
And then last but not the least, we want to use the concept of social marketing to display,

359
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:53,380
as you do, flags and basically symbols all around the schools.

360
00:41:53,650 --> 00:42:01,270
And just so that people from this community feel like they're part of that environment and people who are not within the community

361
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:09,740
will be reminded that there are such people that exist within the environment and according to maybe behavioral theory.

362
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:21,010
And we designed a virtual psychosocial education maybe through PR, professional therapist of education program, and they may maybe a meaningful part.

363
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:30,219
And then you mentioned the first user briefing LGB adolescent about not Non-sugar and the resources and which includes introducing a

364
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:37,510
beautiful support of resources for them and the when they encounter difficulties and that they can find those resources to help themselves.

365
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:40,870
The next is a problem solving training ISA.

366
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:52,270
Maybe it's providing LGBT go and maybe with the tools to identify and solve problems that arise for people and thus more life stressors.

367
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:59,460
And it aims to improve the overall quality of life and reduce the negative impact on raising the encounter.

368
00:42:59,470 --> 00:43:06,549
Discrimination during COVID 19 and the studies of community maybe CEO training, writing songs,

369
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:13,390
the person skills, masses and the resources to help the community with the parents and their classmates.

370
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:22,940
And when they came home and the classroom and the COVID 19 and the final is assertiveness is saying online this program

371
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:30,880
you have these insight training messages and these not just to improve the self-confidence of the LGBT community.

372
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:36,429
I know that some face the sexual orientation and how do you deal with discrimination?

373
00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:44,140
You can't use the all maybe life and the which can help them reduce and the anxiety and the worry.

374
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:53,280
So another probably was one of the kind of intervention is like also making sure paying attention to the presence of the mental

375
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:58,940
professionals that will be in the closest proximity to these LGBTQ plus adolescents while they're in school as we return from COVID.

376
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:07,100
So this program is a school counselor program that specifically targets at providing LGBTQ plus topics and issues,

377
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:13,310
education to school counselors until they feel better equipped to be able to help out their students during school hours.

378
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:21,680
Generally, this is informed by social commentary, but also more specifically the reciprocal determinism idea of like focusing on how cognitive

379
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:26,330
behavioral environmental factors can affect an individual and their help seeking behavior.

380
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:31,790
So focusing on improving the environmental factor to hopefully benefit these students in all of our aspects.

381
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:36,680
It's also just generally to promote sensitivity, acceptance of diversity among all staff and students.

382
00:44:37,070 --> 00:44:38,510
And the last point,

383
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:45,680
because there was some research done that was shown that when counselors and other school professionals were educated on these matters,

384
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:49,399
they were able to better help identify and prevent physical and emotional harassment

385
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:53,180
that these groups received during school hours from usually fellow students.

386
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:57,890
They are able to better control that that issue as well during school hours.

387
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:06,080
And then a youth mental health action plan. This is informed through the trans transsexual model of stress and coping through

388
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:10,010
community and or interventions and then facilitated through community change principals.

389
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:13,720
So the idea is that community efforts will be put off,

390
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:19,700
will be made to implement LGBTQ support groups and community health centers to provide a safe place outside of school settings.

391
00:45:20,570 --> 00:45:24,280
These are generally about two hour sessions, depending on the needs that day.

392
00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:30,859
The group that they are, you know, this or that and once a week and led by mental health professionals that are familiar within the community,

393
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:36,919
they either work in the community health center or from the community or somebody is really around them comfortable enough.

394
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:43,560
They know what they're doing in that community. But these mental health professionals be present to facilitate and monitor conversations, right?

395
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:49,760
Education on how and where to access mental health services, whether it be through their health center or anything else that they need directly.

396
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:53,570
And then also to provide education, how to develop healthy coping mechanisms.

397
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:59,150
And then because our LGBT are we're working with adolescent populations for like

398
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:04,100
basically that 13 to 15 group ages or even if they don't have a form of transportation,

399
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:11,120
community will work with local government or even more communal offers to provide transportation for those adolescents who don't have a reliable form.

400
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:20,990
Teacher housing. Mental health for their communities. This is our reflection of the whole maybe project and in the background.

401
00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:28,530
We spent a lot of time on research work and so we found that maybe we as they have,

402
00:46:28,890 --> 00:46:36,680
they have been to specific issues and to support our project and our model became maybe more difficult and challenging.

403
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:41,640
And it obviously clearly that was the most of all that was in our conceptual model.

404
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:47,390
So provided by our previous slides, that was kind of like our hardest part of the project in general,

405
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:50,940
just because we were trying to figure out how to contextualize the whole issue,

406
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:58,110
because it involved a myriad of things from very individual characteristics that stem from also a lot of societal issues.

407
00:46:58,770 --> 00:47:01,829
So being able to concisely put that all in one diagram,

408
00:47:01,830 --> 00:47:07,680
that's kind of like why we like lean more towards kind of the interpersonal, interpersonal, that sort of leveling structure.

409
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:16,980
And then for interventions, we wanted to pinpoint like make up interventions are supported by literature too, but that weren't sort of generic.

410
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:22,920
So what we designed, we feel that they were well-informed interventions and this is the last slide, I promise.

411
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:30,810
So we work together as a team and it was really hard to get four busybodies together in one place at one time.

412
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:35,850
And so but it was really cool because we not only sort of looked at the project,

413
00:47:35,850 --> 00:47:40,110
but we kind of found out cool stuff about each other, which we want to show.

414
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:46,830
So Max here modeled for the UN and this is him proudly standing was a part of Mali when you.

415
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:57,480
And he also played the role of the Speech Writing Lab for Art Project.

416
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:04,350
He's really good at writing. Then we have Jay. She may be very quiet, but she's one heck of a daredevil.

417
00:48:04,490 --> 00:48:07,610
This is her skydiving earlier this year from Florida.

418
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,750
Then we have Maddie. She she has two younger brothers.

419
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:15,170
And it's really nice how she balances school with managing them.

420
00:48:15,170 --> 00:48:21,650
And this is her youngest one, and he basically got her leave today because he asked her to prepare lunch.

421
00:48:22,310 --> 00:48:29,930
And then there is me. I know you guys think I'm going to talk about the gym, but no, I'm going to miss Elvira from the 2016.

422
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:33,500
That's a fun fact about me. And also, this is my mustard mommy moment.

423
00:48:33,900 --> 00:49:02,310
Oh, thank you. You know, it's scary.

424
00:49:05,850 --> 00:49:12,190
Yeah. She's the last thing you should be telling me.

425
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:17,150
She was, like, give you that because going to be so nice.

426
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:35,480
So I said, this is what I want to talk about.

427
00:49:39,230 --> 00:49:44,120
So everyone here, the access to affordable health care group or health care.

428
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:47,510
But we focus on oral health. I'm Camille. I'm Sandra.

429
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:57,640
And I'm Sierra. I think this is an overview of what we'll be discussing.

430
00:49:59,420 --> 00:50:01,640
And then to start with some background information.

431
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:11,000
In 2015, 2.3 billion people were affected by dental caries or more commonly known as dental cavities globally in their permanent teeth.

432
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:16,040
And that 2.3 billion 540 were children who are affected in their primary.

433
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:22,740
And the United States has a variety of reasons as to why this is happening.

434
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:30,360
This is partly due to lack of insurance, access to care providers, shortages, cost and health literacy.

435
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:35,969
And and although Medicaid does give an option for dental insurance for children,

436
00:50:35,970 --> 00:50:42,240
a considerable large gap of privately insured children, 30% about do not have dental insurance at all.

437
00:50:42,690 --> 00:50:47,730
And with 15% of the U.S. population experiencing a shortage of dental professionals where they live,

438
00:50:48,270 --> 00:50:55,260
many dentists don't see a reason in participating in Medicaid due to the low or the low reimbursement rate.

439
00:50:59,010 --> 00:51:02,280
Also on the last slide, I kind of got ahead of myself.

440
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:10,170
The lack of health literacy, especially for those facing language or cultural barriers, make understanding the health care system,

441
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:19,260
insurance and medical terminology intimidating and cause delay dental care insurance barriers additional to the insurance barriers.

442
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:26,580
The unaffordable cost of dental care has been reported as a reason why many parents and caregivers are unable to get treatments for their children,

443
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:31,770
which in turn could worsen their children's dental issues and cause them to be more expensive in the long run.

444
00:51:33,450 --> 00:51:41,219
And then this slide, you know, carries you not only impact children's oral health, several disease, so several dental issues.

445
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:48,050
I cannot read it. Sorry, can deteriorate a child's quality of life by causing chronic pain, discomfort and infection negative,

446
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:52,650
negatively impacting their academic achievement and interfere with their diet and sleep.

447
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:57,989
Also, oral disease, especially for those children without dental insurance, can increase personal,

448
00:51:57,990 --> 00:52:03,660
societal and financial burdens, which in turn can contribute to rising health care costs and expenditures for the country.

449
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:06,209
From all of this.

450
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:13,440
It can be said that the children hit hardest by this disparity are those who live in rural areas lack transportation and are low income.

451
00:52:15,610 --> 00:52:18,759
And for our target population, for our intervention,

452
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:26,830
we chose to focus on 4 to 12 year olds from various racial backgrounds and that are come from low socio economic backgrounds.

453
00:52:27,550 --> 00:52:34,510
The reason for choosing this population is because the relation and influence of social health on oral health outcomes.

454
00:52:35,230 --> 00:52:41,380
In fact, children from low socio economic backgrounds suffer 25% more than those from higher socio economic backgrounds.

455
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:45,610
And regarding our choice of having a more racially diverse population.

456
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:53,860
We started research that Hispanic and black children had higher prevalence of dental decay than non-Hispanic whites and Asians last.

457
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:57,910
In our conceptual model, we emphasize children of this age living in rural areas.

458
00:52:59,110 --> 00:53:05,070
John We will get into the outcomes of interest. Okay, so there are three outcomes of interest that we looked at for height.

459
00:53:05,350 --> 00:53:13,180
Poor oral hygiene has been shown to have a decline in children's oral health, leading to a long term health and well-being.

460
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:21,280
Influencing children's long term goal being children may be unable to perform to their full potential because

461
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:28,960
of pain due to poor oral hygiene leading to long term impacting their long term academic performance.

462
00:53:29,230 --> 00:53:35,950
Then and two factors such as genetics and salivation also increase the likelihood of these children developing cavities and then the

463
00:53:35,950 --> 00:53:46,509
frequency and duration of acids caused by sugars from their diet interact with caries causing bacteria leading to the enamel that's weakened,

464
00:53:46,510 --> 00:53:47,770
which is the outer layer of the.

465
00:53:50,510 --> 00:53:57,530
Then out of these because of these outcomes of interest, these led us to our proximal outcomes of looking at behavioral outcomes,

466
00:53:57,530 --> 00:54:02,510
such as brushing, flossing, beverage consumption, the frequency of what they're eating at,

467
00:54:02,810 --> 00:54:09,410
and then the severity and number of cavities and then the distal outcome being their academic performance and their school attendance,

468
00:54:09,410 --> 00:54:16,399
because it has been shown that poor oral health and academic performance has been successfully documented.

469
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:19,550
And this is why we chose to look at school attendance as a.

470
00:54:22,330 --> 00:54:26,080
And then this is our first iteration of the conceptual model.

471
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:29,620
Very rough. A lot going on all over the place.

472
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:34,640
And then this is our fourth one. We decided to add some colors.

473
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:38,770
It was concise, down a little bit, had a campfire that we did not need one.

474
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:50,260
And then this is our last one. Color coded have numbers dictating what each concept is.

475
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:52,720
And now Alexandra will explain it more in depth.

476
00:54:54,490 --> 00:55:00,700
So as you can tell from our final product, we wanted to make our conceptual model as straightforward and as concise as possible.

477
00:55:01,090 --> 00:55:05,350
So I'm going to quickly run through some of the concepts and relationships that we felt were important.

478
00:55:05,350 --> 00:55:10,390
Pieces of this bigger picture of how lack of access to oral care can lead to cavities in children.

479
00:55:11,110 --> 00:55:15,069
So the first pieces of our conceptual model that I want to highlight are the personal

480
00:55:15,070 --> 00:55:19,510
and socio environmental factors which are informed mainly by social cognitive theory.

481
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:26,560
We felt that personal factors such as socioeconomic status and geographic location were important antecedents to consider,

482
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:33,440
as they could be precursors for whether or not a child has access to oral care in terms of socio environmental factors.

483
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:40,190
We felt this was especially important considering our target our target population when thinking about child health.

484
00:55:40,210 --> 00:55:47,410
It's difficult to separate a child's health behaviors away from the wider context of their family or caregiver environment.

485
00:55:47,770 --> 00:55:51,490
So I wanted to make sure that we captured this important dynamic in our conceptual model.

486
00:55:52,210 --> 00:55:54,700
Additionally, we started to delve a little bit more into the research.

487
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:59,139
We discovered that evidence shows that parents who have dental issues or poor oral

488
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:03,400
health themselves were more likely to have children with higher levels of cavities.

489
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:08,070
So this could be due to normative beliefs surrounding the importance of oral health,

490
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:15,550
but it could also be due to the oral health behaviors that are modeled at home by other members of the family, like caregivers or older siblings.

491
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:20,529
So as we all know, children are really observant and they learn through observational settings.

492
00:56:20,530 --> 00:56:27,910
So if they witness the people around them going out, brushing their teeth or never flossing, they're more likely to model that same behavior as well.

493
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:30,640
And then within socio environmental factors,

494
00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:37,750
we also wanted to make sure we included the concept of relatedness which we took from self-determination theory.

495
00:56:38,230 --> 00:56:42,820
So this comes into play, especially when thinking about peers, friends and the school environment,

496
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:47,710
because most children in our targeted age range spend a majority of their time in school.

497
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:54,280
We also found findings that demonstrated that students and friendship groups all practice similar oral health behaviors,

498
00:56:54,310 --> 00:57:00,370
illustrating just how important a role the social environment plays in determining health behaviors in young children.

499
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:05,319
And then finally, while we felt the social environmental factors affected access to oral care,

500
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:09,280
we also felt that they play a mediating role as they may fluctuate and change

501
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:13,270
and can influence this relationship in different ways and different tests.

502
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:18,069
And then finally, I wanted to talk a little bit about the health leaf model,

503
00:57:18,070 --> 00:57:22,120
as is the other main theory that we used during the creation of our conceptual model.

504
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:30,249
So as you can see, we broke it down into two main concepts perceived self-efficacy and perceived barriers in terms of perceived self efficacy,

505
00:57:30,250 --> 00:57:34,000
of engaging in healthy behaviors, which we consider to be a mediator.

506
00:57:34,330 --> 00:57:38,850
We thought it was necessary to specify both oral hygiene and dietary behaviors.

507
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:45,220
And so those are two important pieces when thinking about our proximal behavioral outcomes and the development of cavities.

508
00:57:45,610 --> 00:57:50,290
And with perceived barriers, we wanted to highlight transportation, financial burdens and insurance,

509
00:57:51,010 --> 00:57:58,090
where all communities have a particularly hard time accessing dental clinics, which could be far away in neighboring towns or communities.

510
00:57:58,510 --> 00:58:02,920
And this problem can be exacerbated if reliable forms of transportation are not available.

511
00:58:03,550 --> 00:58:08,860
Through our research, we found that there was an association between the geographic location of low income families,

512
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:13,720
their proximity to dentists and the development of untreated dental cavities.

513
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:19,030
And then finally, the insurance and financial pieces are at least to take our time together.

514
00:58:19,690 --> 00:58:25,240
As many of us know, going to the dentist is expensive and dental insurance is often expensive as well.

515
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:29,260
And the out-of-pocket costs for cleanings alone, not even the filling of cavities,

516
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:34,870
puts an enormous burden on families, and low income families suffer disproportionately in this regard.

517
00:58:36,130 --> 00:58:41,950
Evidence shows that children have a higher chance of developing cavities when coming from less educated and low income families,

518
00:58:41,950 --> 00:58:47,500
which highlights how these perceived barriers contribute to the development of our proximal outcomes of interest.

519
00:58:48,310 --> 00:58:53,260
So I hope that gives you a better understanding of the thought process behind the creation of our conceptual model.

520
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:56,440
And I'm going to turn it over to Seattle so she can talk about our intervention.

521
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:01,660
Okay. So our intervention, we know that schools are really important for kids,

522
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:08,380
but I want you guys to just picture for a moment at least 20 students ranging from 4 to 12

523
00:59:08,770 --> 00:59:14,230
and a teacher trying to teach them and demonstrate how to brush your teeth and how to floss.

524
00:59:15,580 --> 00:59:21,160
It seems kind of frustrating to put a teacher in that position. There's already a lot of stress on teachers as it is.

525
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:29,130
So with the. What's another place that can be accessible if given transportation and is a safe place for kids to go to?

526
00:59:29,670 --> 00:59:39,250
And we thought of the library. And so what we're going what we would do if we could is we would have a school field trip to the local public library.

527
00:59:39,330 --> 00:59:44,160
Transportation would be provided. Goodie bags would be given out as a as one of the rewards.

528
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:48,930
Before you can go on a field trip, you have to have your permission slips like and so.

529
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:49,410
Right.

530
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:59,430
So with the permission slip, there would be a QR code for parents to look at, for resources, for local dentists, office, for like dental resources.

531
01:00:00,690 --> 01:00:07,530
But one of the important things is like getting involvement with a dental school and with dental hygiene as a guidance.

532
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:15,000
So if the kids were to get the permission slip forms signed and the parents were to agree to the intervention,

533
01:00:15,390 --> 01:00:19,290
students would be able to go to the library for relatedness.

534
01:00:19,290 --> 01:00:24,629
We thought it'd be a good idea for the librarian to read age related books that show characters

535
01:00:24,630 --> 01:00:28,620
and books taking care of their teeth or talking about their fears of going to the dentist,

536
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:33,120
but showing that it is okay to go to the dentist, we would have dental hygiene,

537
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:37,830
a show like demonstrations on like teeth models, kind of how to teach them how to floss.

538
01:00:38,220 --> 01:00:44,480
And then specifically with the permission slip, kids who are given permission from parents and are okay with that,

539
01:00:45,270 --> 01:00:51,959
they would be able to be given fluoride sealants on their teeth, which has meant that it's just a little coating they put on your teeth.

540
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:55,890
It's fine. Very reasonable. It's cost wise.

541
01:00:55,890 --> 01:01:03,750
It does vary and it can be expensive, but probably a good portion of the budget for this type of thing because we want to make it accessible.

542
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:08,700
And then I think that's everything for us.

543
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:15,380
Okay. So I just want to say a couple words about our experience throughout this project.

544
01:01:15,770 --> 01:01:19,880
So like the majority of the groups I mentioned, conceptual models are really hard.

545
01:01:19,970 --> 01:01:24,170
So I feel like we have an appreciation now for people how to do that more than once.

546
01:01:25,010 --> 01:01:30,290
Interventions are also really hard and as a group we just had so many ideas and it was

547
01:01:30,290 --> 01:01:34,550
really hard to kind of bring it all back and figure it out in a way that made sense.

548
01:01:34,970 --> 01:01:39,350
But I feel like one of our biggest takeaways as a group was just that like being able to do this

549
01:01:39,350 --> 01:01:45,089
as a group was great because if we we brought all of us brought different things to the table.

550
01:01:45,090 --> 01:01:49,340
And so if we had to do this individually, I don't think we would, but ended up at the same point.

551
01:01:49,340 --> 01:01:55,280
So I thought that was one of the strengths of our group and we were just really grateful to have all of our different

552
01:01:55,280 --> 01:02:03,440
perspectives and ways of thinking that led to just a really productive collaboration and so a final product that we're proud of.

553
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:13,960
So overall, it was a great experience to have. Last year.

554
01:02:14,790 --> 01:02:24,230
It was a really it's going to be contributing something.

555
01:02:25,470 --> 01:02:28,820
Yeah. Half an hour ago. Let me do it for you.

556
01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:55,110
I suppose that's the start of your thinking.

557
01:03:00,090 --> 01:03:25,940
Really? Can you. So where?

558
01:03:25,940 --> 01:03:29,010
What doing? Speaks.

559
01:03:32,510 --> 01:03:37,360
Exactly. It's.

560
01:03:40,530 --> 01:03:44,090
Let's go. Oh, okay. All right.

561
01:03:44,180 --> 01:03:47,900
Hi, everyone. We know you've been through a lot of presentations. We appreciate your attention.

562
01:03:48,380 --> 01:03:56,220
We are the sexual health promotion group, and today we're gonna be talking about HIV, AIDS management specifically, and HIV positive women of color.

563
01:03:56,390 --> 01:03:59,420
Trans women of color. My name's Sarah. I'm Julia.

564
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:03,760
I'm Jenny. This is just an overview of our project.

565
01:04:03,770 --> 01:04:06,980
We're going to take you through the background of the issue our population of interests,

566
01:04:07,340 --> 01:04:12,170
our health outcomes, our conceptual model intervention, and then go over some limitations and reflections.

567
01:04:13,460 --> 01:04:15,590
So starting off with the background health issue.

568
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:23,779
So HIV and AIDS first came to national attention during the 1980s, during the AIDS crisis, and I'm sure you're aware of during this time,

569
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:31,430
over 100,000 people died and the main population affected then and now is gay by men who have sex with men.

570
01:04:31,940 --> 01:04:39,110
This led to severe disease stigmatization, which led to large inaction by public health officials during the height of the crisis.

571
01:04:39,530 --> 01:04:46,640
This picture here is the AIDS Memorial Quilt, which was a demonstration by AIDS activists to show the magnitude of the crisis.

572
01:04:47,030 --> 01:04:50,600
So they brought the issue right to Washington and right to the Reagan administration.

573
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:59,660
So each of those boxes is a quilt and each individual quilt, each patch on there represents one person that passed away due to AIDS.

574
01:05:00,050 --> 01:05:04,970
So it's just a really powerful statement to show that this was a severe problem that needed attention.

575
01:05:05,510 --> 01:05:12,590
And today there's over 1.2 million cases of HIV and AIDS in India, in the US, in individuals who are age 13 and up.

576
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:21,440
So continuing on with the background, the average lifetime cost of HIV AIDS care is over $420,000.

577
01:05:21,860 --> 01:05:28,220
And then talking specifically about transgender individuals, they make up approximately 2% of HIV AIDS cases.

578
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:33,800
And while this may seem like a low number within this population, there's a high prevalence of HIV and AIDS.

579
01:05:34,340 --> 01:05:41,600
And something to note is that the CDC did not collect and publish data specifically for trans persons until 2018.

580
01:05:42,020 --> 01:05:46,130
Previously, their data was collected under men who have sex with men, which is inaccurate.

581
01:05:46,820 --> 01:05:50,030
And this also varied state by state. So there was a variation in data.

582
01:05:52,850 --> 01:05:58,820
So I'm looking at our target population, which we're HIV positive trans women of color in the United States.

583
01:05:59,030 --> 01:06:04,249
So most of the statistics on the next few slides are taken from the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey,

584
01:06:04,250 --> 01:06:09,920
which is the largest survey to date on trans experiences in the U.S. with almost 28,000 respondents.

585
01:06:11,630 --> 01:06:18,520
So within the population of trans women, trans women experience increased rates of poverty and unemployment, housing and food insecurity,

586
01:06:18,530 --> 01:06:24,680
sexual harassment and violence, substance use and psychological distress, including depression, anxiety and suicidality.

587
01:06:25,790 --> 01:06:32,720
Trans individuals more generally experienced barriers to accessing health care, including problems with insurance,

588
01:06:32,930 --> 01:06:39,260
specifically related to being transgender, having negative experiences with health care providers.

589
01:06:39,530 --> 01:06:48,230
Among the people that have seen providers in the last year not seeing a doctor when they need to for fear of being mistreated or because of cost,

590
01:06:48,980 --> 01:06:51,950
and then not directly related to health care, but tangentially related.

591
01:06:52,130 --> 01:06:57,530
39% reported currently experiencing psychological distress and interfered with daily life,

592
01:06:57,530 --> 01:07:00,740
and that could interfere with attending appointments or medication adherence.

593
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:08,780
Specifically looking at trans women experiencing HIV and AIDS, so compared 2.3% of the general U.S. population.

594
01:07:09,290 --> 01:07:13,310
Trans women experience HIV and AIDS at a rate of 3.4%.

595
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:20,750
And then you can see that increases for Latina trans women, indigenous trans women, and then 19% of black trans women.

596
01:07:22,930 --> 01:07:28,239
So moving into our outcomes, we first cited for our proximal outcomes to focus on improving the overall patient

597
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:33,520
experience of seeking care and increasing the frequency of HIV and AIDS care visits.

598
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:37,059
So why we focus on this was because we thought we could improve the overall experience

599
01:07:37,060 --> 01:07:40,480
people have that might motivate them and inspire them to continue to seek care.

600
01:07:40,780 --> 01:07:44,800
And this directly ties into our this the outcomes of an increased retention of HIV and AIDS here,

601
01:07:45,190 --> 01:07:53,259
increasing medication adherence and decreasing the viral load. So viral load is just the number of copies of HIV in the blood per milliliter of blood.

602
01:07:53,260 --> 01:07:59,170
So by increasing the medication adherence, we can get people to a lower viral load and lower viral load.

603
01:07:59,470 --> 01:08:06,550
By medication, adherence will mean HIV is no longer able to progress into AIDS, and it stops the spread of transmission through sex.

604
01:08:07,210 --> 01:08:15,370
So a low viral load is noted as less than 200 copies of normal viral load is below 10,000 copies, and a high viral load is 100,000 copies or more.

605
01:08:16,180 --> 01:08:20,620
So if you have a low viral load to be undetectable, thus making HIV untraceable.

606
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:24,659
All right. And then moving on to our conceptual model,

607
01:08:24,660 --> 01:08:30,870
the health behavior that we decided to focus on is HIV care seeking behavior among HIV positive trans women of color.

608
01:08:32,310 --> 01:08:38,760
So our model was influenced by these social ecological model, social cognitive theory, transactional model of stress and coping,

609
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:43,620
and the minority stress model, as well as the health care empowerment model, which we did not learn about in this class.

610
01:08:44,970 --> 01:08:52,530
And then we also took influence from the HIV care continuum, which is a widely used know.

611
01:08:53,610 --> 01:09:00,239
This is just how most professionals suggest that those who have HIV go through the care systems.

612
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:04,770
This inform the flow of our model and also just to make sure it is relevant to current HIV care practices.

613
01:09:06,730 --> 01:09:11,230
So this is our model and I know it looks complex. We're going to go through it bit by bit in a second,

614
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:16,600
but I just wanted to show to you all in its entirety and we have a key up top just to make it a little easier.

615
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:25,360
So the box in pink is our structural factors boxes in green, our patient factors boxes in yellow are provider factors.

616
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:29,440
Our behavior is shown in purple and our health outcomes are shown in blue.

617
01:09:29,890 --> 01:09:33,280
And then we have a couple different outlines just to show what those mean as well.

618
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:40,720
So a solid outline is an antecedent factor. A dashed line is a mediating factor, and a dotted line is a moderating.

619
01:09:42,910 --> 01:09:47,010
Looking at some of our antecedent factors, be specific to our population.

620
01:09:47,020 --> 01:09:52,809
We're thinking a lot about how an informative social ecological model we're thinking about how sort

621
01:09:52,810 --> 01:09:58,780
of structural systems create conditionalities which then relate to individual and provider factors.

622
01:09:58,790 --> 01:10:04,840
So for structural factors, we were looking at structural racism, transphobia and CIS heteronormativity,

623
01:10:05,020 --> 01:10:09,909
patriarchy and capitalism and kind of those structures inform these next few bullet points.

624
01:10:09,910 --> 01:10:12,879
We wanted to call them out specifically because they're connected to our population.

625
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:19,840
So the stigma of HIV and AIDS and criminalization of sex work, as our specific population reported,

626
01:10:20,050 --> 01:10:23,140
increased rates of participation in the underground economy at sex work.

627
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:28,620
So that then leads to the position of our patient for gender identity and sexuality, race,

628
01:10:28,690 --> 01:10:33,550
ethnicity, socioeconomic status, employment and housing status, as well as education level.

629
01:10:34,300 --> 01:10:39,310
And then sort of same things for the provider factors which then lead to individual provider factors of

630
01:10:39,310 --> 01:10:45,130
attitudes and beliefs in formal or informal education related to working with transwomen or people of color,

631
01:10:45,340 --> 01:10:52,720
and then trans women of color specifically. And then as well as the self-efficacy of providers in providing care to patients within our population.

632
01:10:53,590 --> 01:10:57,760
So moving on to the patient factors for our models we have socially for it to begin with.

633
01:10:58,030 --> 01:11:02,860
So social support in our model is mediating the relationship between interpersonal factors and individual factors.

634
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,780
It also acts as a source of empowerment and affirmation and social support,

635
01:11:07,780 --> 01:11:13,570
and our model can consist of relationships such as family, friends, community and relationship with transit organizations.

636
01:11:13,870 --> 01:11:17,370
So moving into interpersonal factors, we have experienced and perceived racism,

637
01:11:17,380 --> 01:11:22,450
transphobia, sexual and gender based violence and harassment and medical mistreatment,

638
01:11:22,450 --> 01:11:26,920
which directly ties into the individual factors which we wrote down by motivation and ability.

639
01:11:27,250 --> 01:11:33,250
So first motivation we have minority stress, and minority stress just draws on the past experience of the individual,

640
01:11:33,430 --> 01:11:38,530
including past race, the transphobic discrimination that they might have faced due to their minority status.

641
01:11:39,310 --> 01:11:42,370
Then we have medical mistrust, sex worker status, and therefore our ability.

642
01:11:42,370 --> 01:11:46,510
We have access to resources, substance use and insurance status.

643
01:11:46,780 --> 01:11:51,280
And these are moderate about by outcome expectations and a lack of transgendered research.

644
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:57,160
So for outcome expectation, we really looking at the expectations people might have of not be able to avoid being able to find

645
01:11:57,160 --> 01:12:02,380
culturally competent care and expectations of experiencing racism or transphobia while seeking care.

646
01:12:04,030 --> 01:12:06,519
So in those patient factors in our behavior,

647
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:12,790
which is seeking HIV and AIDS care and the relationship to our behavior in our outcomes is moderated by health care.

648
01:12:12,790 --> 01:12:20,349
Empowerment and empowerment. Within the health care empowerment model is a construct which relies on the development of skills in

649
01:12:20,350 --> 01:12:26,560
patients use to manage their own health and employs methods that are patient centered and collaborative.

650
01:12:29,260 --> 01:12:30,920
I'm sorry. Intervention.

651
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:40,670
So I proposed intervention is to create an organization that's dedicated to promoting the experiences of HIV positive transmitted color,

652
01:12:41,630 --> 01:12:46,459
access HIV related care and seek out routine care and intervention.

653
01:12:46,460 --> 01:12:54,530
Recognizes that the reason that HIV positive transmit of color are not retained and not engaged in care are very complex and multifaceted.

654
01:12:54,920 --> 01:13:05,240
So we use the three fold approach to increase the HIV care, HIV care seeking behavior among this population.

655
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:14,330
So in one arm of the organization, we focus on cure clinician advocacy of HIV positive trans women of color and a second arm.

656
01:13:15,050 --> 01:13:19,520
We provide health, education and communication services for providers.

657
01:13:19,910 --> 01:13:24,920
And the third is really focused on creating a database of trans inclusive

658
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:29,450
providers that trans women of color can access when they're looking for care.

659
01:13:31,660 --> 01:13:36,260
To talk a little bit more about each part of the organization and more of the theory and constructs.

660
01:13:37,230 --> 01:13:39,990
I didn't want their interventions or intervention activities.

661
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:49,710
So to increase social support, which is a construct of transactional model and stress and coping.

662
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:57,570
We intend to hire and train translators, color and care coordinators and health educators within our organization.

663
01:13:57,570 --> 01:14:01,979
Expanding the peer support network in terms of color messaging, HIV,

664
01:14:01,980 --> 01:14:13,800
AIDS related care and in line with the health care and construct of one of our care coordinators is to provide wraparound services.

665
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:23,129
And so this means that in addition to assisting with HIV specific care, the care coordinators will also help support like food,

666
01:14:23,130 --> 01:14:30,030
housing, transportation and Trans-Pacific Care, which includes hormone therapy and other gender affirming care services.

667
01:14:30,930 --> 01:14:39,810
So care coordination is also have a role in HIV care business and advocating for shared patient or shared decision making.

668
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:47,520
In addition to our agent positive trends with color as the clinicians fostering improved patient provider relationships.

669
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:57,970
So essentially social support and empowerment are really defining our first term or position in the second arm.

670
01:14:58,210 --> 01:15:04,240
Another way we intend to create more positive patient provider relationships is by

671
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:09,580
increasing clinicians confidence in their ability to provide care to patients.

672
01:15:10,060 --> 01:15:12,550
So as the social cognitive theory notes,

673
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:21,040
it's really important to build provider efficacy related to care because it promotes sustainable change amongst providers.

674
01:15:21,550 --> 01:15:30,060
So in our interventions, we are going to have our health educator go to existing sexual health care clinics and assess for trans inclusive practices.

675
01:15:30,340 --> 01:15:34,300
And then these health educators will do trainings to the same clinics.

676
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:41,680
One on transgender, one on one topic, including identities and significance of pronouns.

677
01:15:41,950 --> 01:15:48,670
And the second training will focus on transgender health topics with emphasis on the HIV AIDS care continuum.

678
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:59,080
So after those trainings, again, these same clinics eight weeks to incorporate some of the trans inclusive practices that maybe were absent before.

679
01:16:00,070 --> 01:16:09,490
And then, for example, assigning a gender for filling out excuse me, or creating trans inclusive intake forms.

680
01:16:10,270 --> 01:16:18,670
So at the end of this eight weeks, then educators will go back and assess for trans 70 and see if there was provider change.

681
01:16:20,620 --> 01:16:28,600
So I want to take a moment to highlight the scale that our health educators will be using to assess excuse me, to measure trans inclusivity.

682
01:16:28,630 --> 01:16:32,620
So it's called the trans and provider skills are known as steps for short.

683
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:39,910
The scale was created by Dr. Oncotarget and their colleagues here at the University of Michigan over in the School of Social Work.

684
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:47,650
And essentially, there are 30, 60 mental health providers will be every one of them at this one has a transgender

685
01:16:47,650 --> 01:16:51,850
pride flag on the door and then give it a rating between one and five.

686
01:16:51,850 --> 01:16:55,900
So one evening this is not true at all. Or five, meaning it's always true.

687
01:16:56,290 --> 01:17:04,510
So then you double the numbers and a high score means that the provider is trans implicit and it also highlights opportunities for growth.

688
01:17:05,850 --> 01:17:11,850
So once we have all of those scores collected from all these different sexual health clinics, we can compel them into the database.

689
01:17:12,300 --> 01:17:16,440
And then this will be accessible to HIV positive trans.

690
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:23,520
McCullagh And this activity really targets outcomes for patients with the idea that, you know,

691
01:17:24,450 --> 01:17:29,730
it's because a champion of color can choose providers they know will be inclusive and

692
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:37,120
potentially shifting their expectations from maybe a more negative light to positive lights.

693
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:42,090
Okay. And finally, some limiting limitations and reflections.

694
01:17:44,190 --> 01:17:50,670
So structural barriers like transphobia and racism and the segmentation of HIV AIDS,

695
01:17:51,660 --> 01:17:58,979
what we've done over night and what we just to mention because of these very complex,

696
01:17:58,980 --> 01:18:05,760
interlocking systems of oppression throughout our presentation and our own position today was also limiting

697
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:13,290
factor as well as the feasibility of actually acquiring this funding to support the organization in terms.

698
01:18:14,530 --> 01:18:23,349
And lastly, just some reflections as many years ago that it was really challenging coming up with a comprehensive conceptual

699
01:18:23,350 --> 01:18:29,350
model that really illustrated all the relationships and especially when there are so many systemic issues at play.

700
01:18:30,190 --> 01:18:36,520
Having said that, it was really cool to see our very first iteration of our consumption model, which is absolutely nothing like our current model.

701
01:18:37,750 --> 01:18:42,190
And also this work aligns with all of our future career aspirations.

702
01:18:42,970 --> 01:19:02,230
Very affirming. And we also really value our teamwork and everyone's skills and abilities and knowledge contributing to it so much.

703
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:16,000
So really, I think checking on my coat,

704
01:19:18,010 --> 01:19:33,450
I'm going to say mission accomplished for me because this is an amazing job this semester and I'm so impressed by all that you can take that

705
01:19:33,880 --> 01:19:45,430
is work and being able to inspire and just the high quality and thoroughness of your project and your bravery in engaging in group work.

706
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:49,690
And, you know, it's hard, but I appreciate that you stuck with it.

707
01:19:49,690 --> 01:19:53,139
And, you know, it's an important aspect of graduate school.

708
01:19:53,140 --> 01:20:00,010
And I just really hope you got a lot out of this. I got a lot out of this class engaging with all of you and learning from all of you.

709
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:04,640
So it's been a real pleasure. Again, this is a sad day for me.

710
01:20:04,660 --> 01:20:12,550
I really had a great time with you. But it's not the end because there's next semester and I hope to see you.

711
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:20,649
I'm teaching a class, so I hope I see you in one of my classes or even in the hall or in my office.

712
01:20:20,650 --> 01:20:25,900
Because I hope you come by and we chat. So I hope you guys have a wonderful winter break together.

713
01:20:25,900 --> 01:20:32,970
I'm really proud of the work that you've done in here, and I look forward to promoting your careers.

714
01:20:33,310 --> 01:20:52,030
So thank you. Thank you. I'm starting to my tomorrow.

715
01:20:54,220 --> 01:20:58,120
What do you mean, sacrifice?

716
01:21:04,020 --> 01:21:12,730
I don't know. I can't.

717
01:21:16,490 --> 01:21:24,770
Oh, no, no. I'm not going to go out tomorrow.

718
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:49,770
I know you're not quite ready.

719
01:21:49,820 --> 01:21:59,920
I don't want you to feel that.

720
01:22:00,190 --> 01:22:04,510
I'm sorry.

721
01:22:08,630 --> 01:22:25,400
Oh, I don't know. I think I'll go down to the basement, do some work later.

722
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:34,070
Hi, I'm Sam.

723
01:22:34,490 --> 01:22:49,510
I know you cackling like there's no doubt about that matter.

724
01:22:53,320 --> 01:23:14,900
How do you like everyone who's going to be much easier to hear about?

725
01:23:16,610 --> 01:23:51,200
Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah, I think it's your life, and then it's like, explained to you, like, ten questions and, you know, in 2020 plus, you can get an.

726
01:23:52,000 --> 01:24:01,880
Thank you. Yeah. Yeah, I can get me what you asked me to say.

727
01:24:02,420 --> 01:24:07,810
Yeah, I guess so. Yeah, you're right.

728
01:24:10,070 --> 01:24:22,750
You know, it's so hard to hear your response.

729
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:28,820
What can you do?

730
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:36,560
Yeah, so that's my background as well.

731
01:24:36,860 --> 01:24:45,560
Yeah. Yeah, you're doing background. I'm doing cause I do is just like that because I'm like.

732
01:24:46,490 --> 01:24:50,600
Yeah. So I'm not even going to talk much about what we mean.

733
01:24:52,770 --> 01:24:57,000
Yeah. I have to have you in the closet.
