1
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:15,710
As we stressed before, negotiations do not have to be a win lose situation.

2
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:27,870
There's actually a different way of thinking about negotiations that would avoid the perception that negotiations are competitive as a zero sum game.

3
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:36,940
Broadly speaking, we negotiate only when the chance of our success is dependent upon the decisions

4
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:43,600
and actions of other people whose position on an issue is different from ours.

5
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:47,980
Meaning there is a conflict between our positions.

6
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:54,820
In other words, negotiation involves inter dependency.

7
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:58,340
It is a process of interactions,

8
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:10,250
the end of which is to advance our interests by working with our counterparts to jointly decide on an agreeable plan of action.

9
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,480
Therefore, the fundamental goal of negotiation problem is to advance our interests.

10
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,790
The keyword here is interests.

11
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:33,410
It is very important to keep in mind that interests or more specifically underlying interests are the raw material, the focus of negotiation.

12
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:40,670
Moreover, we should know negotiation is a means a tool for advancing interests.

13
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:42,980
It is not an end in itself.

14
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:52,100
Negotiating for the sake of negotiating could be counterproductive, actually likely impeding the goal of advancing our interests.

15
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:58,390
As a mix. Negotiation is really a process of choosing problem solving.

16
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:04,450
In fact, the essence of negotiations is this To advance our real interests,

17
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:15,850
we must assess the yes we want from our negotiating counterparts and understand why they might agree to the Yes,

18
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,890
rather than walking away from the negotiation, opting for no deal.

19
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,050
And to achieve that,

20
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:34,540
we need to influence how they see their interests in such a way that whatever they choose to decide and do will serve our interests.

21
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:42,160
In other words, negotiation is the art of letting other people have our way.

22
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:48,800
As I said, the concept interest is foundational to effective negotiation.

23
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:54,950
Your interests are whatever you care about that is at stake in the negotiation.

24
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:59,640
He can never be an effective negotiator if you don't know what you want.

25
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:06,500
So let's think of one example. Say you are negotiating with your new employer.

26
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:10,940
If your real purpose is to broaden your experience,

27
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:20,480
learn new skills and seek opportunity for self-improvement, then those things should be your focus.

28
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:28,230
You should make sure that the conversation with your new employer are now primarily about salary in this case.

29
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:37,640
Given this example. Keeping your salary flexible will be important for productive and successful negotiation.

30
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:44,380
So no thyself. Knowing what you want is a core of effective deal making.

31
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:48,700
Equally important is know thy counterparts.

32
00:03:49,840 --> 00:04:00,010
A major mistake that people, including me there will make during negotiation is that we confuse issues and positions with interests.

33
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:06,790
They're quite different issues as you see on the slides represented by the iceberg.

34
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:11,140
There are the items on the negotiation table to be discussed.

35
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:18,700
Positions, what people say they want. It is the service statement of where they stand on the issue.

36
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:24,520
It is just like the tip of the iceberg, which is visible and apparent.

37
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:35,780
Interests are why people want it. They are the underlying reasons and motivations explaining why people take a position.

38
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:43,190
Interests represent the major part of the iceberg underneath the water's surface that you don't see.

39
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:51,310
They are hidden and invisible. Let's use an example to illustrate this concept and know differences.

40
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:58,600
Let's say a project manager is negotiating with her boss about the timeline of an important project.

41
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:10,300
The issue is the project timeline. Now regarding that issue, the project manager wants a one month extension to finish the project.

42
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,300
So her position is one month extension.

43
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:23,700
On the other hand, her boss's position is that the project has to be done on time.

44
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:30,570
No extension. So there is no convergence between your positions.

45
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:38,730
But in terms of your interest, the reason that the project manager wants an extension is because she feels there

46
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:43,980
may be unexpected obstacles that may prevent completing the project on time.

47
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:55,440
And also because she wants to show to her team that she fights for their needs and she will push them to work overtime to complete the project.

48
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:04,450
The boss is on the line. Interest is completely financial because if the project is not completed on time,

49
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:10,870
the company may lose money because of a penalty course in the contract.

50
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:18,220
So you see in this example, issues, positions and the interests are all different.

51
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:29,320
Well, all the time. We take positions and make the mistake that positions are the same as interests to negotiate successfully.

52
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:35,770
We have to keep in mind that positions and interests are different.

53
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:41,260
We had to be clear about our interests before we enter a negotiation.

54
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:51,610
At the same time, we have to explore, discuss and actively listen for the other party's interests so that we can increase the possibility

55
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:59,620
of finding alignment in our interests and create values for everyone involved in the negotiation.

56
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:04,130
Now let's go back to the project management example.

57
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:14,830
If the project manager and her boss realized that even though their positions are conflicting, different, there's no convergence.

58
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:26,650
They actually may share similar interests. So they decided to sit down, discuss and listen to in order to understand each other's interest.

59
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:33,010
And based on their conversation. And as a result of understanding where each other it's coming from,

60
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:45,760
the bus decides to give the project manager discretion to manage her team and decides to extend the deadline on a different and less urgent project.

61
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,590
That way, they can move other people to work on the project.

62
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:55,210
And the project manager can have additional help with the important projects.

63
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:02,680
The happy the happy ending after the conversation is that the project is done on time without any extension.

64
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:11,200
And that the project manager is able to demonstrate her ability to protect her team and care for their needs.

65
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:13,930
Let's consider another case.

66
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:22,930
Chess and Harry for Health System have been partners to provide health care for residents in Detroit for over three decades.

67
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:27,130
The partnership has been beneficial to both organizations.

68
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:36,670
Chess is a federally qualified health center and serves a large number of uninsured and low income patients.

69
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:44,020
So chess has been able to help Henry for health system to fulfill its philanthropic

70
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:50,320
mission and keep its nonprofit status by meeting the community benefit requirement.

71
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:57,460
Henry for health system, on the other hand, supplies primary care physicians to staff chess clinics.

72
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:05,080
It cost two factors stagnation of economic conditions in Southeast Michigan and

73
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:11,410
reduced supply of primary care physicians have increased the cost of positioning,

74
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:21,640
recruitment and retention and therefore force Henry Ford health system to renegotiate the physician contract was chess are unknown to each other.

75
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:28,959
Henry Ford Health System did its estimate that the cost of the new physician contract has to

76
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:36,250
increase by 20 to 40% in order to recoup the loss in physician recruitment and retention.

77
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:47,020
Chess, on the other hand, has its own estimate showing that the cost increase over 20% is likely to threaten its financial viability.

78
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:59,630
So apparently based on the example, the issue on the table is renewal of a physician service contract between Henry Ford Health System and Chess.

79
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:08,560
What other positions. They are also very clear. Chess wants the cause increase to be as small as possible.

80
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:18,370
By contrast, Harry for health system wants the increase to be high enough to offset their cost in physician recruitment and retention.

81
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:26,830
And simply based on their positions, it is clear that there is no convergence and the physician contract may fall through.

82
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:36,860
But on the line, chess. His position is the concern that too much increase was threatened the center's financial viability.

83
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:43,790
Also, there is a strong interest on his part to keep the clinic staffed with primary care physicians.

84
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:53,130
In terms of Henry Ford's health systems interest, there are probably a concern is to recoup the loss in physician recruitment and retention.

85
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:59,150
Also, they need to fulfill their charity care and community benefits responsibilities.

86
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:03,060
And for those things, chess could be very helpful.

87
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:08,520
And Henry Ford's primary care physicians are feeling committed to chess.

88
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:16,940
In addition, there could be other interests to consider for both chess and herring for health system.

89
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:26,970
They may include access to specialty care market share in the city of Detroit and publicity and institutional reputation.

90
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:32,220
Those interests have different degrees of importance to Chaz and Henry Ford

91
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:37,440
health system and may be satisfied through various strategies or mechanisms.

92
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:44,670
Let's think about an example. Access to specialty care is critically important for jazz patients.

93
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:50,620
Other than Henry Ford Health System. The Detroit Medical Center, for example,

94
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:57,909
is also interested in accepting Chaz patients because many of the patients cannot

95
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:03,580
afford a care as a result of the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid expansion.

96
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:16,510
The important point is that considering the full set of interests and how they may be satisfied by the negotiation party or potentially others,

97
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:23,560
is the first critical step towards effective and successful negotiation.
