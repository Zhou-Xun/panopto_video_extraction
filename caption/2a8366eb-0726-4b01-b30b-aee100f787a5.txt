1
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,100
In other videos, we've gone over

2
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,930
some of the basic
features and trends of

3
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:14,820
the hospital market and taking

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,210
a deeper look at horizontal
and vertical merger activity.

5
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,550
In this video, we
will analyze some of

6
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,805
the other factors that
determine hospital prices.

7
00:00:23,805 --> 00:00:25,890
Our learning objectives are to

8
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,080
analyze how actors
interact in the pursuit of

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,480
their objectives and
how those interactions

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,560
influence the cost and

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,270
effectiveness of the
health care system.

12
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,850
And to adapt this general
behavioral model to

13
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,410
account for the
particular features

14
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:40,060
of health and health
care decisions.

15
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:43,325
In our discussion of mergers,

16
00:00:43,325 --> 00:00:45,770
we concluded that by
increasing market power,

17
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:48,175
mergers resulted
in higher prices.

18
00:00:48,175 --> 00:00:50,360
Today we will examine
the dynamics of

19
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,885
negotiations with insurers
that underlie those findings.

20
00:00:53,885 --> 00:00:56,690
We'll also examine the
impact of prices set by

21
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:00,390
public payers on those
paid by private insurers.

22
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:04,985
Both hospitals and insurers
have power in most markets.

23
00:01:04,985 --> 00:01:08,045
A good outcome for
consumers' low premiums

24
00:01:08,045 --> 00:01:11,720
relies on the market being
at a competitive sweet spot.

25
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,200
Insurer market power can help
consumers if it provides

26
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,460
insurers the leverage to

27
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:18,919
negotiate low prices
with hospitals.

28
00:01:18,919 --> 00:01:21,950
However, if insurers
are too powerful,

29
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:24,635
they will not need to compete
strongly on premiums,

30
00:01:24,635 --> 00:01:26,840
and therefore will have
little incentive to pass

31
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,960
on low negotiated
prices to consumers.

32
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,295
This figure illustrates
that balance of power.

33
00:01:33,295 --> 00:01:36,170
At point B, insurers
are strong enough

34
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:38,930
relative to hospitals to
win price concessions,

35
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:40,550
but not so powerful that

36
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:43,280
those concessions won't
be reflected in premiums.

37
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,380
Conversely, points A and

38
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:48,155
C result in worse
outcomes for consumers.

39
00:01:48,155 --> 00:01:50,180
At point A, insurers are too

40
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,010
weak to negotiate lower prices,

41
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:53,780
so premiums will be high and

42
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,865
hospitals will be
very profitable.

43
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:59,435
At point C, insurers are
able to win discounts,

44
00:01:59,435 --> 00:02:03,450
but won't need to pass them
on to compete for enrollees.

45
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:07,460
Let's see how many metropolitan
statistical areas have

46
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,230
a favorable balance of power

47
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:12,070
for competition to
yield low premiums.

48
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:14,450
The provider market
figures reflect

49
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:16,295
an expenditure weighted average

50
00:02:16,295 --> 00:02:18,470
of the concentration
in hospitals,

51
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:21,740
specialty physicians, and
primary care physicians.

52
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,140
First, none of the markets meet

53
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,670
the pure competitive ideal of

54
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:28,965
both providers and insurers
being unconcentrated.

55
00:02:28,965 --> 00:02:31,070
2.8 percent are actually

56
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:32,869
at the opposite end
of the spectrum,

57
00:02:32,869 --> 00:02:35,720
with both markets being
super concentrated.

58
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,790
In those markets, we'd expect

59
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,650
providers to demand and receive

60
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,660
high prices and insurers

61
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,880
to mark up premiums
even further.

62
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,560
The most common
market structures are

63
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,930
both insurer and provider

64
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:50,120
markets being highly
concentrated,

65
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,790
and markets where highly
concentrated insurers

66
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:55,385
face super concentrated
providers.

67
00:02:55,385 --> 00:02:57,590
Together those two combinations

68
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:00,170
account for just over
half of all markets.

69
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:03,575
They also don't look very
favorable for consumers.

70
00:03:03,575 --> 00:03:06,860
More favorable combinations
like both being

71
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:10,859
moderately concentrated,
are relatively uncommon.

72
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,660
This figure shows how
market concentration has

73
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:17,540
changed in different parts
of the health care economy.

74
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,550
All sectors have
a large share of

75
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:22,505
markets in the highly
concentrated level or above.

76
00:03:22,505 --> 00:03:25,990
Hospitals are by far the
most concentrated sector.

77
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:28,940
Primary care is the
least concentrated but

78
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:32,315
has the most rapidly rising
concentration over time.

79
00:03:32,315 --> 00:03:35,900
Specialists and insurers
lie in between.

80
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:39,095
In low concentration
physician markets,

81
00:03:39,095 --> 00:03:40,610
prices were not affected by

82
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:43,055
the extent of insurer
concentration.

83
00:03:43,055 --> 00:03:46,265
However, in high concentration
specialist markets,

84
00:03:46,265 --> 00:03:50,480
highly concentrated insurers
tended to get lower prices.

85
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,900
Similarly, hospital
prices per admission

86
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,600
tended to rise with hospital
market concentration.

87
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,390
But highly concentrated
insurers were able to

88
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:00,770
obtain lower prices in

89
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:03,745
high concentration
hospital markets.

90
00:04:03,745 --> 00:04:06,810
Unfortunately, the
high concentration

91
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:08,570
in those insurance
markets means there's

92
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:10,340
no inherent mechanism to ensure

93
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,840
those discounts are passed on

94
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,400
in the form of lower premiums.

95
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,170
The study of market
power and prices

96
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:20,150
by Cooper and
colleagues found that

97
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:21,800
monopoly hospitals had prices

98
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,390
12 percent higher
than those with

99
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:25,580
four or more rivals
and were less

100
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:28,690
likely to have contracts
requiring them to bear risk.

101
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:31,820
Further, hospital prices
were seven percent lower in

102
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,670
concentrated insurance
markets and hospitals were

103
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,170
more likely to have contracts

104
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:38,170
requiring them to bear risk.

105
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:41,630
Finally, mergers between
geographically close hospitals

106
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:43,475
raised prices by six percent,

107
00:04:43,475 --> 00:04:46,520
while those between distant
hospitals over 25 miles

108
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,320
apart did not raise prices.

109
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:53,240
Hospital administrators
often argue against cuts in

110
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,800
public payment rates by

111
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,380
asserting that if Medicare
or Medicaid pay less,

112
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,060
they will be forced
to make it up by

113
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,585
raising prices charged
to private payers.

114
00:05:01,585 --> 00:05:03,930
This is called cost-shifting.

115
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:07,175
Let's see if these claims
are fact or fiction.

116
00:05:07,175 --> 00:05:09,530
Empirically, there
is no evidence from

117
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:12,545
the last 20 years to
support this common belief.

118
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:15,800
Logically, we might wonder
why if it's profitable

119
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,980
to raise prices after
public programs cut prices,

120
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,750
wouldn't it have been
profitable to raise

121
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:24,105
private prices even before
the public prices were cut?

122
00:05:24,105 --> 00:05:25,610
Do we really believe that

123
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:27,650
hospitals were leaving
money on the table for

124
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:31,385
years just in case public
programs cut their rates?

125
00:05:31,385 --> 00:05:34,460
Finally, shouldn't the
reverse also be true?

126
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,050
For example, the ACA

127
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:38,720
reduced uncompensated
care substantially.

128
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,720
Did the grateful hospital
suddenly cut their prices?

129
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:46,845
Even if cost-shifting
doesn't happen,

130
00:05:46,845 --> 00:05:50,010
cross-subsidization and
price discrimination do.

131
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:53,490
However, those are distinct
concepts from cost-shifting.

132
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:56,950
The difference is that
cost-shifting is a dynamic story.

133
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:59,845
First, the government
cuts its prices

134
00:05:59,845 --> 00:06:01,570
then the hospitals respond

135
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,745
by charging private payers more.

136
00:06:03,745 --> 00:06:05,410
Cross-subsidization and

137
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:08,380
price discrimination are
point-in-time concepts.

138
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,795
Different payers yield
different profits,

139
00:06:10,795 --> 00:06:13,570
and the firm will seek to
maximize total profits by

140
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:14,605
charging each type of

141
00:06:14,605 --> 00:06:17,290
customer the
profit-maximizing price.

142
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:20,500
Let's draw an analogy to
the airline industry.

143
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,290
Suppose our airline is
able to sell 1/3 of

144
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:27,235
its seats to business passengers
who they charge $500,

145
00:06:27,235 --> 00:06:30,425
1/3 to vacationers
who they charge $300,

146
00:06:30,425 --> 00:06:33,390
and 1/3 to students
who are charged $100.

147
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:37,640
That yields average revenue
of $300 per ticket.

148
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,130
Suppose the average
cost per passenger of

149
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:42,565
running the flight is $250.

150
00:06:42,565 --> 00:06:45,680
The airline cross subsidizes
students in the sense that

151
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,815
it would lose money if it
only sold student tickets.

152
00:06:48,815 --> 00:06:51,815
But does it really lose
money on students?

153
00:06:51,815 --> 00:06:56,300
Pause the video for a minute
to think about the scenario.

154
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,880
The images of the
can of soda and

155
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,030
peanuts might have
provided a clue.

156
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:02,825
Compared to an empty seat,

157
00:07:02,825 --> 00:07:05,090
the marginal cost of
filling it with the student

158
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:08,195
is 1/2 a can of soda and
a small bag of peanuts.

159
00:07:08,195 --> 00:07:10,400
Now suppose the
government prohibits

160
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,645
the airline from charging
students more than $70,

161
00:07:13,645 --> 00:07:16,625
will the airline charge
other passengers more?

162
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:18,260
No, if it would have been

163
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:20,570
profitable to charge
other passengers more,

164
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:23,730
the airline already would
have been doing it.

165
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:27,800
Paradoxically, it might even
be profitable to reduce

166
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,360
the other fairs because

167
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,295
as students become
less profitable,

168
00:07:31,295 --> 00:07:33,320
the best strategy
may be to reduce

169
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,960
other prices in order
to change the mix of

170
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,060
passengers on the plane
by selling more of

171
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:41,420
those tickets and
fewer student tickets.

172
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:44,540
To summarize, if
we hope to rely on

173
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:47,135
competition to keep
costs down to consumers,

174
00:07:47,135 --> 00:07:49,640
we need to have conditions
under which insurers are

175
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,220
powerful enough to win
discounts from providers,

176
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,930
but not so powerful that

177
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,020
they can just
pocket the savings.

178
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,420
Like airlines, hospitals charge

179
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:01,490
different customers different
prices but this does not

180
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:03,950
imply that they will respond
to low public payments

181
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,890
by further raising prices
to private payers.

182
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:09,230
For that to be a
likely response,

183
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,730
they would need to
have been leaving

184
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,170
unexploited pricing power

185
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:16,110
on the table before the
public price cuts occurred.
