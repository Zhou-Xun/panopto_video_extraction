1
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:09,130
But need to speak to the for the aspect.

2
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,980
What did you brothers. Oh. I did the 100th. The 200 and sometimes over 100.

3
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:19,020
You know, it's the worst one ever. I believe that.

4
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:31,260
Oh, no, we have to do it here because just knowing how good we do, we have to sing in tragedies.

5
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:49,640
I know. I know. We have to keep one of those simple, quiet centers, frank minds, that one up Sydney from the ground.

6
00:00:53,220 --> 00:01:00,740
And you just click on this link in the trees and use it.

7
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:04,220
It is a joke that I'll tell you.

8
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:08,670
It was like this. I was great.

9
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:14,160
I started that. Let's stop that already.

10
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:20,880
Oh, yeah. You know, Ireland, it doesn't exist two weeks ago.

11
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:27,330
Oh, you're doing fine. I don't need to take it.

12
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:32,210
No, no, I don't know anything.

13
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:43,110
I just took a shower this morning and got three presentations today, so that'll be the entire class for one that we missed on Monday.

14
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:48,010
So we'll start with cost minimization and marginal cost of visualization,

15
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,440
and we'll go to the readmissions and disparities and then end up with minimum wage and that.

16
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:11,650
Oh, right. But they represent where things don't go.

17
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:25,410
It's pretty hard to say good morning for one of your excited.

18
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:39,450
You know you walk in closet and learn about my name is digitization so I this inspired the customization of fact that.

19
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:46,479
So just briefly we'll talk the first article has some discussion questions for the second article and also have some discussion questions.

20
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,350
So, you know, we're excited and we'll get right to it. All right.

21
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:55,780
So I'm going to talk about the first article, which is how digitization has created a golden age of music.

22
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:04,609
All right. So to start off, what is digitization? So it's exactly what it sounds like.

23
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:09,889
It's turning something that was previously physical into something that's impossible online, a digital product.

24
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:15,350
So you can see on the figure there that after digitization really picked up in the late 1900s,

25
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:20,090
there was a steep drop in the total value of U.S. music shipments.

26
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:26,990
It's because now people can just go online to listen to music and they don't need to buy physical albums, CDs, tapes, what have you.

27
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:38,290
Okay. So there is a standard model to how a media product gets released to the market.

28
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:44,709
So using music as an example, an artist would get signed to or discovered by a record label which acts like a

29
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:49,960
gatekeeper that facilitates product entry to market based on quality and other factors.

30
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:59,230
The label invests time and resources into the production of an album which includes expensive studio time musicians, audio engineers and more.

31
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:07,690
And then distribution would be through physical album sales and stores, which involves shipping plus promotions through magazines, radio tours, etc.

32
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,430
However, post digitization we see this model has changed,

33
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:19,660
so the role of the record label or the gatekeeper plus cost of production industry distribution has all reduced significantly.

34
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:23,470
An artist no longer necessarily needs to go through a record label anymore.

35
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:27,670
They could just buy the equipment themselves and produce their own music.

36
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:32,380
So distribution also doesn't have to be through physical albums anymore.

37
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:36,550
You can put a song on iTunes for roughly $10 and promote it through social media.

38
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:42,910
So as you can see, digitization has changed the landscape of what production and distribution channels look like.

39
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:50,260
So what are the economic implications of all this?

40
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:56,970
So digitization offers an increase in the number of available products because it's easier to create them.

41
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:02,709
So let's say that Y prime is expected revenue and T is the cost threshold based on which

42
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:08,230
traditional gatekeepers like record labels would decide whether or not to sell a product,

43
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,040
go to market.

44
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:19,119
So if T prime is less than T, which it would be post digitization because the costs are less, there is more x, y, prime that would be greater than it.

45
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:27,710
So there's more projects that get to go to market because of this. And so we see that that's actually what ended up happening.

46
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:33,470
Post digitization, there is just a larger number of products and media markets.

47
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,720
But more doesn't necessarily have to mean better, right?

48
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:45,149
Consumers gravitate towards high quality products, so we can expect that even if there's more options,

49
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:53,070
they will pick one that they get the most utility from. So we know that marginal utility is decreasing with each additional unit consumed.

50
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:58,440
But the article actually found that the quality of products in the market has also increased,

51
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:03,510
whether it be through IMDB ratings or play based or sales based indicators of quality.

52
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:07,560
Interestingly enough, it does appear that more means better in this case.

53
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:13,560
So with more quality products in the market, consumers will simply consume more, which is the principal.

54
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:23,720
Since we're talking about creative industries, the quality and appeal to good by teachers, artists or producers.

55
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:30,980
Therefore, the effect of the cost reduction in production and distribution is only that it increases the volume of the products in the market.

56
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:37,970
Digitization has allowed for a higher market share of non gatekeeper products like independent label phones and things like that.

57
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:42,650
So we call those expected losers because they don't have that kind of quality stamp.

58
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:48,080
But evidence shows that the proportion of expected losers will turn out to be successful.

59
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:55,160
So basically, now that you have more products in general, you have more expected losers, and inherently you would have more expected winners.

60
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:01,660
So how does how has digitization affected revenue streams?

61
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:05,320
Basically, digitization has allowed for a marginal cost of zero.

62
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:09,610
Once you upload the song, it doesn't necessarily cost you more for another person to listen to it.

63
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:14,260
That's why companies like Spotify and Netflix have created bundle access to generate revenue.

64
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:21,070
As far as direct sales are concerned, now markets are adapting to the digital era through intra temporal price discrimination,

65
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:27,250
which is basically considering how income and preferences dictate consumer behavior through their willingness to pay.

66
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:31,270
So it allows the model to harvest high valuation consumers.

67
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:39,760
So, for example, like Marvel fans who have the income capacity would go see what kind of forever like in the first two weeks, pay $15 per ticket.

68
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:44,830
People who aren't fans or don't have the income capacity would wait until maybe it's on Netflix or something.

69
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:54,199
So to sum it up, what was once considered a revenue depleting innovation digitization has actually

70
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:58,370
allowed for a new era of accessible media products without the need for gatekeepers.

71
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:04,160
There are more products in the market, more quality products in the market, and more chance of successful products in the market.

72
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:14,960
With that, I will be, especially as anyone wants, what kind of area I can see this weekend.

73
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:20,390
So yeah, so my first question to everyone, as you know, where is the digitization happening in healthcare?

74
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:25,280
Does anyone have any examples of an area where. So just a couple medical records.

75
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:32,720
Medical records. Yes. At one medical when Amino Ruben came and talks like the app.

76
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:36,620
It's like a digital zation. Exactly.

77
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:40,310
Exactly. So now we're seeing electronic health records, EMR.

78
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:46,819
We're seeing a shift from systems that are more manual toward electronic, for example,

79
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:51,890
prior to prior authorization, you know, taking away those delays, taking away that back and forth.

80
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,920
And you're getting responses within seconds, if not minutes.

81
00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:02,840
And we're still seeing the adoption of telehealth, this option of virtual care on artificial intelligence.

82
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:06,050
So we're seeing all these things, especially after the COVID 19 pandemic.

83
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:11,299
And then the second question I have for everyone is, you know, how does technology affect cost curves?

84
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:22,070
And then want to highlight this really artistic one that anyone have any idea is how it affects effects.

85
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:40,100
Oscars inspires digitization, and it is yes, it's generally upfront fixed cost at a lower marginal cost over time.

86
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:47,140
Exactly right. So you are seeing with technology, technology, we're seeing a shift in cost curve.

87
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:50,990
So we know that anything that changes cost minimization points will change the cost curves.

88
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:53,360
So we're seeing what technologies that can improve health care.

89
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:58,850
I'm sure you can improve the health care production process so it provides a more efficient way to provide health care.

90
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:05,360
And ultimately you can have the same health care output with fewer inputs and then you're lowering your cost curve.

91
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,639
And I did have a second discussion question about it just because of time.

92
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,410
I think I'll skip it. We can just think about it and also just appreciate the cat meme that's right there.

93
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:23,989
And with that will go to our second article and some somebody talking about our second article, which was very happy economic mythology and studies.

94
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:32,150
So bear with me, we go back to the fun stuff. So this one was all about increasing markups and market power and what that means for prices.

95
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:41,080
The authors also go through some of the estriol studies of the research that's done and what they like about them and what they don't know.

96
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:45,469
So just some terminology and definitions. I wanted everyone to be on the same page.

97
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:51,860
Monopoly power is the absence of competition in the market. So think of things like local natural gas companies.

98
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:55,639
Sometimes people reference Microsoft and Windows when talking about monopolies,

99
00:10:55,640 --> 00:11:04,280
or there's like a diamond miner company called De Beers, which has a huge share of the market power market for mining diamonds.

100
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:12,170
I had no idea. But when we talk about monopoly power, a lot of times we're talking about the share of market power.

101
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:14,329
I think a market power is a giant pie.

102
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:20,780
And however bigger slice of that pie is in that specific market is how much market power you have is the ability,

103
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:27,260
which then leads to the ability to manipulate prices. You set prices as opposed to going with what the market says.

104
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:34,970
You have the power and you have the ability to set the prices in that market with the market power you have.

105
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:40,940
And this also leads to a conversation about markups, which is the difference in selling price and cost.

106
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,770
So firms that are price makers.

107
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:50,060
So those firms that have a lot of market power can establish and adjust marketplace price of items without relinquishing much of their market share.

108
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:58,340
So that's kind of what we're talking about today is how people can make prices as well as drive up market markups depending on their market power.

109
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:05,960
And just for a little reminder, marginal costs, costs of adding the cost added by producing one more unit of additional goods.

110
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:11,299
And so that's the change in costs over the change in quantity. Okay.

111
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:18,170
So the first thing that as the authors of this article talked about is the methodology behind studying markups and market power and

112
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:24,920
how difficult it is and how the changes what changes have been happening over time and the methodologies used to study these things.

113
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:31,279
So between the 15th and 17th century, with the early research on industrial organizations,

114
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:35,300
they used a method called the Structure Conduct Performance Analysis,

115
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:40,520
which argues that market structure is a determinant of conduct, which in turn determines performance.

116
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:46,070
This has been discredited many times throughout history but has now been adopted.

117
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:52,170
It uses regression analysis and is intended to capture how tough in competition,

118
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:57,680
how toughness in competition changes as market competition changes, market concentration changes.

119
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:04,159
And then the difficulty is with this approach that the authors authors highlighted was a lot of

120
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:10,700
data and how difficult it is to measure concentration in economic markets through direct data.

121
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,849
And a lot of the times we get our data in economics from the census.

122
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:20,150
So looking at census data, not only demographics but also economics, its markets and what's going on in the economy,

123
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,910
census data has three main issues, the first being that it does not well define economic markets.

124
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:30,300
So an economic market such. Software is not a single industry.

125
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,670
There's a lot of industries that fall under software,

126
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:40,290
but the census and the data that they produce fails to to distinguish those differences and bundles all these

127
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:45,570
different companies under the umbrella of software would they may be better located under different labels.

128
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,800
There's also problems with geography.

129
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:57,389
So the census data that comes out so can show a large number of small firms that may represent a situation where there's a lot of direct competition,

130
00:13:57,390 --> 00:14:02,340
but it doesn't distinguish the geographic differences between those firms.

131
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:09,870
So really, that could be not a lot of competition, especially if they're located in different markets or different product markets.

132
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:14,010
And then last, the census does not measure degrees of product differentiation.

133
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:25,170
The other point that the authors make is that firm accounting structures and economic, not economic profit, are very different numbers.

134
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:30,300
So a lot of times markups can not really be directly observed in firm level data.

135
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:34,020
So you're just looking at the specific firm of specific firm level data.

136
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:40,140
There is a difference between the accounting numbers and the data needed for economic profit.

137
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:47,840
Measuring economic profit requires additional measurements like expense on costs in order to be able to articulate causal relationships from.

138
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:55,150
Okay. So the authors then go into some industrial studies that they have found that

139
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:59,470
that have shown that increased market power can lead to increased markups.

140
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:02,710
And in these different industries, the first one being wholesaling.

141
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:10,390
Wholesaling, just everyone knows, is the act of buying from a manufacturer at a discounted price and selling them to retailers for higher prices,

142
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:16,360
as the wholesale sector has grown immensely and has become a lot more concentrated.

143
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:20,080
And they found that that led to an increase in the accounting markups.

144
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,390
This is driven by a combination of lower marginal cost and increased demand,

145
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:31,270
which is because of the improved warehouse networks that they've been able to establish,

146
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:35,110
as well as improved sourcing from both domestic and foreign locations.

147
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:42,970
But the benefits of the increased networks, as well as the as well as the sourcing for us as downstream customers,

148
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:48,730
has really been constrained by the lessened competition that used increased markups and increased marginal cost.

149
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:55,840
So we really haven't seen much of a benefit of the improvements that they've made to their sourcing as well as to their network.

150
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:05,860
Nexus Airlines, this one was actually really interesting because increasing markups were associated with some degree of quality improvement,

151
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:12,730
but have still resulted in price increases. As a lot of the times this comes with debates over airline mergers.

152
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:16,900
So they often, when we're discussing and debating airline mergers,

153
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:24,610
focus on negative effects of markups on the concentrated nonstop routes versus the potential for improved route structure,

154
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:32,379
leading to better choices and increased competition. They actually discussed how slightly there's been a hub and spoke model that's been

155
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:39,210
used for airlines that leads to higher markups over marginal costs in the industry.

156
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:46,180
So even though you have these hub and spoke networks, they should create benefits with low price and convenient connections.

157
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:56,380
But in reality, they've led to high markups and many direct flights out of certain hub airports and less choices for customers.

158
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:03,159
And last one was hospitals. They just pointed to studies that have shown that hospital consolidation between close

159
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:06,760
competitors leads to increase in prices and markups without improving the quality.

160
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:14,560
They note, though, that there's not this research focus on identifying industry wide factors that are driving those higher markups.

161
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:21,250
Okay. So we're going to talk really briefly about the factors that lead to rising markups.

162
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:23,290
There were six that were identified.

163
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:31,900
The authors lumped raising fixed costs and some cost together, which is that industries do not concentrate as market do not want to do.

164
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:38,350
Concentrate is market size growth. There's always an incentive for software for many firms to become large relative

165
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:42,660
to the market and making some investments that drive up demand for its products.

166
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:43,510
So for example,

167
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:52,300
rising fixed costs and lower marginal cost through to increasing in product information technology investments could be a driving increase in markup,

168
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:58,330
could be driving the increase in markups. One that I thought was particularly interesting was network effects.

169
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:05,350
Network effects are any situation in which the value of product or service depends on the number of buyers or seller.

170
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:12,040
But users, I think specifically of like the early iterations of Facebook where like when there weren't a lot of people on Facebook,

171
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:14,139
it wasn't as valuable.

172
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:20,620
But the more and more people that use it, the more and more users that it had, the more and more valuable it became without competition.

173
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:29,380
And obviously, there's a lot of competition in social media markets, but those network effects can lead to weaker competition in a couple of ways.

174
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:36,580
The first being they tend to lead to the consumer lock in, so they enhance the firm's short run market power while making new entry into that market.

175
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:40,810
Very difficult and network effects can make. This costs a lot more important.

176
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:47,620
Growing, growing monopsony power or monopoly power has just linked.

177
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:56,890
There have been studies that link the mergers with increased increases in monopoly power and then increased rent seeking,

178
00:18:56,890 --> 00:19:02,680
which is the act of growing existing wealth without creating new wealth or manipulating social and political environments to do so.

179
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:10,840
The authors note that managers are a lot better trained to find and exploit both social and political environments to create wealth for their firms.

180
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:19,960
Firms in many industries have improved over time. Their ability to price discriminate while raising raising some markups and lowering others.

181
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:27,219
Just a quick example. In the pharmaceutical industry, there was a CEO that sharply increased the price of a generic drug in a marketplace where

182
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:32,470
he knew the take for it would take several years for competitors to be approved by the FDA.

183
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:37,150
So using that as a way to to drive up your market power as well as increasing markups.

184
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:44,710
Last but not least, globalization is pretty straightforward. The firms have a lot bigger global supply chains and have access to lower cost inputs.

185
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,360
So really quickly, just touch on what this.

186
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:57,309
Means for policy because his office is the article, but basically with the structure, conduct, performance, those are the regressions.

187
00:19:57,310 --> 00:20:03,180
Then the outputs from that analysis and that methodology have little weight in policy debates.

188
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:09,719
But usually. But the author notes that using like the production function and making causal estimates

189
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:15,660
can be helpful to figure out why we have markups and what to do about them in policy.

190
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:21,330
So I'm just going to really briefly touch on some, I think, of the stuff that comes out of these conversations.

191
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:26,070
So one of the things that U.S. government does do is enforce antitrust laws.

192
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:35,430
And the part of a large chunk of this article was talking about the past decade with courts have dialed back on

193
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:43,140
antitrust enforcement and how dialing back on that antitrust enforcement may actually have led to increase in markups,

194
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:47,010
mergers and markups, mergers, for example, mergers and markets.

195
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:51,360
But more than two firms are much less likely to be challenged now than in the past decade.

196
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:56,459
So this is directly impacted by legislation on fixed costs.

197
00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:04,260
But you can take care of what legislation? I'm running real quickly through the concerns of the Under Enforcement antitrust.

198
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:14,280
There's vertical restraints, which is just competition restrictions, coordination efforts, which is definitely technical collusion, digital platforms.

199
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:23,609
So exclusionary bundling of platforms and an increase with the increase in the digitization exploiting intellectual property,

200
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:30,000
which is using patents for exclusionary conduct, acquisition of potential competitors, which is exactly what it sounds like,

201
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:34,870
exclusionary conduct, which is deterring entry and disadvantage to existing rivals.

202
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:38,750
One of the things that the author does point out is that these government agencies well,

203
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:45,420
the locals I have here, while some should enforce antitrust, others have made policies or rules.

204
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,630
Regulations actually hurt antitrust enforcement.

205
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:55,710
And so, for instance, there's rules regulations at the FDA that can hinder entry of biosimilar drugs into the market,

206
00:21:55,890 --> 00:22:02,250
not based on patents, but just simply based on bio similarity. And that doesn't help you.

207
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:09,150
So just in conclusion, industrial level, economic, economic, econometric studies are needed to understand markups.

208
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:14,870
We know that competitive markups are generally beneficial to customers because they are prices.

209
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:21,210
And once market power is acquired, it's very durable. And the authors note that policy response is needed to encourage competition.

210
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:26,730
Awesome. So where are we seeing these monopolies in health care?

211
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:39,360
In one of the examples. So, you know, we're seeing the FCC, the Department of Justice, you know, blocking these mergers,

212
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:48,059
blocking these these mergers between hospitals, health system insurance companies, because, you know, they're scared of that idealization.

213
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:53,370
You know, they're scared of they will increase prices. It'll reduce quality because there's that lack of competition.

214
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:57,570
We also have, you know, EpiPen, also Mylan's, a Great Amendment.

215
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:05,180
And, you know, they have such such power and ensure that you normally don't hear, hey, you know, we need our epinephrine auto injector, right?

216
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,100
You said, you know, we need an EpiPen because that's how much power they have.

217
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:17,670
And then also, they even had an EpiPen law that required to have allergy medication in schools, and it also increased their profits.

218
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:23,460
So talking about monopolies, how do we think that this impacts prices of health care services or products?

219
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:28,830
When you have hospitals merge and they control, they have a lot.

220
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:32,399
That's the only alternative place for people to go in the market.

221
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:37,500
They have negotiating power with insurers and things like that because they cover more people.

222
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,950
Right. Exactly. So, you know, increase in prices, that's their only option.

223
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:50,189
So for example, Mylan for EpiPen, they were able to raise the prices for EpiPen from $100 in 2007 to over $600 today,

224
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:52,350
which is near like a 580% increase.

225
00:23:53,700 --> 00:24:02,490
And that's because they benefit from, you know, competition and protections, and that really causes them to have that power in the industry.

226
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,540
So just talk about monopoly markup sign in back to class.

227
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:10,820
You know, for like you mentioned, you know, if someone has a serious illness, right,

228
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:15,360
and they can only get this one medicine, this one drug from this one company, then you don't really have a choice.

229
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:20,669
Right? You value your health, you and your your willing to get this drug despite the price.

230
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:24,510
So we see that the less sensitive to the quantity demand is the price,

231
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:28,440
the higher the markup and the more inelastic the demand, the higher the monopoly markup.

232
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:35,700
And just very briefly, on the left, we see that this is a competitive market where there's a more elastic demand.

233
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:39,780
So the markup, the smaller, the smaller compared to the marginal cost.

234
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:42,389
And on the right, we see that there's more inelastic demand.

235
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:48,330
So the markup is bigger and its benefits monopolists rise up because they see that they can increase the consumer easier.

236
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:53,820
So they increase the price, raising their profits, knowing that their demand will only slightly decrease.

237
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:58,950
And yeah, so that's the end of our presentation. Does anyone have any final thoughts or anything?

238
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:09,320
Yes, that's the those two costs to me.

239
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:16,890
I think his name last name was Shkreli. What is the price of your medication 500 times or something.

240
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:21,299
That's just ridiculous way that that's that's messed up.

241
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:25,740
Right. So we're seeing people need these medications and that's what we're starting to see laws like the Inflation

242
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:32,890
Reduction Act trying to regulate these prices just because it's it's unbelievable how much power to jail right now.

243
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:38,430
Yeah, I do have a question that pharmaceutical companies always talk about.

244
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:43,110
They won't do any more R&D if they get their prices caps. The articles mention anything about that?

245
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:48,180
I don't think specifically. I'm not sure anything about that.

246
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:55,430
I think it's a bit of an older focus for 2017, but is that really you really got a really good point to look into.

247
00:25:55,800 --> 00:26:00,870
Sure. Thank you.

248
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:18,130
Inside? Yeah.

249
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:35,950
Oh. Oh. All right.

250
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:40,970
So, really quickly, just to introduce ourselves, I'm Emily. I'm Sydney.

251
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:47,890
I think Lauren locations today are going to be talking about reducing health care costs and racial disparities.

252
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:52,380
Looking at two different models that are next.

253
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:56,510
And we will go into more detail on what those are, the two studies that we're presenting.

254
00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:02,299
So just to give a little background, think about readmission rates in marginalized communities.

255
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:10,160
We know from numerous studies that marginalized communities have poor health outcomes, including higher rates of chronic disease,

256
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:16,969
as well as worse control of those chronic diseases, higher rates of admission and readmission after their index,

257
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:21,620
admissions, and poor access to quality outpatient care.

258
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:27,680
However, most institutions are moving towards value based care models,

259
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:32,750
which not only places the responsibility of the quality of care on the physician,

260
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:38,540
but the cost of care to the patient, as well as the cost of care to the hospital system.

261
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:42,680
And just an important note on that is value based care,

262
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:50,179
valuable care to the hospital system or insurance companies doesn't always mean the best quality care to the patient.

263
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:54,770
So there can often be some tension between those two ideas.

264
00:27:55,880 --> 00:28:01,430
And so two models that we're going to be focusing on today are the hospital readmission reduction program,

265
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:03,680
which obviously focuses on readmission reductions,

266
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:09,830
as well as the merit based incentive payment system, which focuses in at the level of the treatment decisions of the provider.

267
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:17,870
And just some questions to kind of think about as we go through this presentation and we'll come back to these after each study.

268
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:23,810
How does that affect a patient's access to hospital care as well as their overall health outcomes?

269
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:28,970
What other strategies are there to reduce readmissions, especially in the marginalized communities?

270
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:34,700
And how might adjusting for social risk factors impact MIPS and our value based care models,

271
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:38,270
good or bad for the patient, the provider and the hospital system?

272
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:44,570
So the first article that we're going to talk about today is called The Supply of Hospital

273
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:49,910
Care to Minority and Low Income Communities and the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program.

274
00:28:52,160 --> 00:29:01,219
So just a little bit of background. The hospital readmissions reduction program goal or the HRP goal was to reduce costly, preventable readmissions.

275
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:05,030
And so the way it did this was that it implemented a policy that penalizes

276
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:09,770
hospitals for excess 30 day readmissions by reducing Medicare payments by 1%.

277
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:14,810
And that 1% goes up each year that they are excessive in the 30 day readmissions.

278
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:21,980
And so just through previous research has shown that this implementation of this policy has decreased readmissions,

279
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:26,420
but unfortunately, socially disadvantaged hospitals were more penalized.

280
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:32,660
And so some explanations for reductions include increased observation services,

281
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:37,700
changes in readmission decisions, and decrease admissions of certain populations.

282
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:44,750
So the big question here is we know there hospitals serving socially at risk populations were more penalized.

283
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:51,650
So what happened to access for these at risk patients and why are the hospitals actually discouraging admissions?

284
00:29:53,310 --> 00:30:02,400
And so this study, if h, r, r p is associated with the reduction of inpatient hospital discharges and minority and high poverty zip codes,

285
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:09,059
so that included for AM, Isaac CHF and pneumonia.

286
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:13,500
So that's acute myocardial infarction and then congestive heart failure and pneumonia.

287
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:20,340
And then the hospital discharge data was used for 2006 and 2013 from eight states.

288
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,719
And in these eight states it encompassed one third of the nation's non-Hispanic

289
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:30,240
black and white population and 50% of the nation's Asian and Hispanic populations.

290
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:34,049
And they used data from the American Community Survey,

291
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:41,970
which did Socioeconomic and Demographic Data and CMS Hospital compare website which did the readmissions data?

292
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:53,060
So the results from this study did show that there was a negative association between the expected penalty and hospital discharges.

293
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:57,020
Therefore, there was a decline in the number of discharges due to the penalty.

294
00:30:57,530 --> 00:31:04,010
This negative association did get an increase with the percentage of minority residents that increased.

295
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:11,450
You can see this in panel. The top solid line is zip codes that have a low percentage of minority residents.

296
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:18,890
So they actually did have an increase in discharges as the expected penalty was increased.

297
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:24,140
However, if you look at the bottom dashed line, that is the high percentage of minority residents.

298
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:34,940
They had the opposite effect of the low percentage that there is actually did decrease in hospital discharges as the expected penalty did get greater.

299
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:41,030
This was not observed in the poverty rate. As you can see, it remains relatively constant.

300
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:46,310
However, those that did have high poverty rates to show in panel B the bottom line,

301
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:49,940
they actually did have a slight increase, but that was not significant.

302
00:31:52,660 --> 00:32:03,250
So this study also found tried to quantify the expected mean penalty for zip codes based on the percentage of minority residents,

303
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:13,510
as well as for poverty rates and for populations that had under 10% minority residents, their expected penalty was around $52,000.

304
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:22,690
However, for top four zip codes, they had a higher percentage of minority residents, which that was defined as greater than 10%.

305
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:26,290
Their expected penalty was around $110,000.

306
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:28,780
However, this is a significant difference.

307
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:37,120
They did note that for the under 10% minority residents, they had many zip codes that did have $0 as the expected penalty.

308
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:41,560
So this obviously is going to shift the value closer to zero zero.

309
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:45,459
If you look at the poverty categories, there's really not that many differences.

310
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:49,450
They're all pretty much around $95,000 for the expected penalty.

311
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:57,070
And it is interesting to note that as the poverty rate did actually increase to greater than 60%, it did start to come down.

312
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:07,650
So the HRP may achieve its goal in reducing discharges in minority communities.

313
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:11,440
However, this study did not conclude if this was a good or bad news.

314
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:17,520
It could be great news if hospitals are pushing care out into the community setting and identifying those

315
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:24,720
high risk patients and providing them care and ambulatory settings to reduce those preventable admissions.

316
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:30,930
However, it could be bad news if hospital administrators are telling providers not to

317
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:35,220
care for minority residents and pushing services more into white communities.

318
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:43,050
And with elective surgeries, physicians could be not admitting minority patients for that for the reason of this.

319
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:46,950
This does relate to our class concept of risk minimization.

320
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:55,380
This is a risk minimization strategy that hospitals can take by just avoiding the penalty and not admitting minority patients.

321
00:33:55,410 --> 00:34:00,270
And this is feasible since hospitals do have discretion over the treatment at the end of the day.

322
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:09,360
Part of the results were really unexpected, though. However, a plausible, plausible explanation for this could be the disproportionate share payments.

323
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:17,340
These are awarded by the state government for hospitals that have high percentage of Medicaid and uninsured populations.

324
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:21,930
And if a hospital employing the policy, trying to avoid poor patients,

325
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:30,210
they could lose some of those disproportionate share payments that may account for the losses of the HRP.

326
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:37,649
And it is really important to note that the disproportionate share payments incentives and the penalty from the HRP are not aligned.

327
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:45,910
So this could have led to some perverse results in this study. Just going back to some of those questions we talked about in the beginning.

328
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:51,670
So how does the HRP affect patients access to hospital care and their overall health?

329
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:57,130
And then also, what are some other effective strategies to reduce readmission rates?

330
00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:05,049
And you won't have any thoughts on either of those. Well in for the second one.

331
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:08,590
Like said he mentioned you can like host character community settings or you could

332
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:12,850
also partner with community based partners to identify like high risk patients.

333
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:16,870
Yeah, that's actually one of the best ways that we know how to reduce readmissions.

334
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:22,210
And it's not something that we do that often, which is really a disgrace. Any other thoughts?

335
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:33,940
Okay. The next article we will be discussing is adjustments for social risk factors does

336
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:39,670
not meaningfully affect performance on Medicare's MIPS clinician cost measures.

337
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:50,440
So first, what is MIPS is a merit based incentive payment system that evaluates clinician performance on quality and cost measures.

338
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:55,990
So reimbursement is based off of four factors that are intertwined in a composite score.

339
00:35:56,350 --> 00:36:02,230
They are cost quality improvement activities and promoting interoperability.

340
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:08,860
So the current MIPS model has no formal adjustment that are made for social.

341
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:13,629
So this poses a problem for clinicians who work in safety net hospitals because they are

342
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:18,460
providing care for some of the most vulnerable populations and they may be unfairly penalized.

343
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:27,130
So in order to combat this, MIPS needs to incentivize providers to deliver high quality care to communities with high social risk.

344
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:37,480
A little bit about the study design. So we had a sample size of 100% of 2018, Medicare Part B claims.

345
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:41,110
So there was no sample selection bias in this study.

346
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:44,920
The study aimed to assess episode based cost measures,

347
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:52,020
which focus on acute care episodes and procedures that were limited to direct care for episode diagnosis.

348
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:58,330
So this includes the initial diagnosis, readmission into the hospital and post-acute care.

349
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:06,729
The study also includes a unique risk adjustment model that is based on the CMS hierarchical condition categories, community models.

350
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:13,210
So this model was proposed by experts in the field and it basically accounts for cost variability.

351
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:23,319
Lastly, the study utilized Agency for Health Care Research and Quality Socioeconomic Status Index or a c, h, r, q, a C.

352
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:33,400
And they basically used this to get participants age, sex to eligibility, race and other community characteristics.

353
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:41,559
So all in all, the purpose of this study was to assess the impact of adjusting for social risk factors on clinicians.

354
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:52,210
Episode based cost measure performance. So I'm going to talk a little bit about the results of the study.

355
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:57,400
As we talked about before, we are just focusing on eight different acute care episodes.

356
00:37:57,970 --> 00:38:01,990
So this isn't taking into effect all of the costs for some of these patients.

357
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:08,110
So we talk about dual eligible patients. We did see that they accrued more costs associated with that acute care episode.

358
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:14,290
But after we employed this way to control for some of the high social risk factors,

359
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:19,360
we didn't see a huge change in the cost prediction, meaning that it didn't.

360
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:29,229
Controlling for high risk social characteristics did not significantly affect the cost measures for these providers,

361
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:31,960
and they gave a few reasons why this might be occurring.

362
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:40,120
And like I mentioned before, they a lot of the social burden and sources for this is outside of the acute care episode.

363
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:47,620
So meaning, you know, readmission rates and these types of things were not taken into account in this particular study.

364
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:50,740
And then also that risk adjustment score,

365
00:38:51,100 --> 00:39:01,060
the variability that they adjusted for in the initial cost with MIPS was likely included some social factors without explicitly doing that on purpose,

366
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:07,719
just because they surveyed clinicians in the field and they likely incorporated some of these

367
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:11,890
things into that cost adjustment without realizing that that's explicitly what they were doing.

368
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:23,410
I thought that this graph did a really good job of just visualizing what these changes actually were before and after the social risk adjustment.

369
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:31,170
And as we can see, all of these changes were really around 0% after social risk adjustment.

370
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:37,900
So this compares MIPS as a whole to MIPS plus adjustment for social risk factor.

371
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:46,420
And what I thought was really surprising about this is the quartile four includes the most dual eligible patients that providers care for.

372
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:53,530
And you would expect to see huge differences, or at least I would if we were adjusting for social risk for these populations.

373
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:59,709
But we actually don't see a huge social risk adjustment percentage for these,

374
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:10,370
which indicates to us that in itself is actually adjusting for this quite well and that maybe we don't need to be accounting for additional social,

375
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:14,080
social risk adjustments because this model is actually doing an adequate job.

376
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,469
I we think about last concepts.

377
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:25,900
I know we've talked a lot about value based care and that our incentives for providers need to match providing better quality care to our patients.

378
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:32,800
We know that these dual eligible patients have high social risk, which leads to low quality care and high cost for them.

379
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:40,990
And if we're just looking at episode based cost and not the true source of cost, which is outside of these episodes, as we know,

380
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:50,290
are we artificially rewarding providers when we're not really taking into account the things that are actually causing costs for these providers?

381
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:52,990
But if we completely get rid of these things,

382
00:40:53,530 --> 00:41:01,299
we will then be disincentivizing providers to care for these populations because they'll be unfairly penalized by Medicare

383
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:09,430
services for caring for those populations because their outcomes are not as good as less dual eligible populations.

384
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:16,629
So I really kind of skip over this first question because we just kind of talked about those reasons.

385
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:21,760
But I'm going back to that idea of it as a value based care model benefit,

386
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:26,360
whether it's the provider, the patient or the hospital system or insurance companies.

387
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:43,670
Just anyone have thoughts on that? One example that we can use is the drug that we actually did the activity for when we kind of came up with like,

388
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:45,380
what should the price of this drug be?

389
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:53,960
That's a drug that for some subset of patients is actually good data, that it improves outcomes and has better results over time.

390
00:41:54,950 --> 00:42:00,710
But even at University of Michigan, in the hospital, we have tried to get that drug approved for patients.

391
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:07,159
But the hospital pharmacy actually said that we couldn't do that because it wasn't fit into

392
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:12,320
their value based care model and it was too expensive versus the drug that we typically use.

393
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:18,919
So that's just an example of how this system can actually be harmful to a patient but

394
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:23,000
still benefit the hospital system at the same time because it reduces cost for them.

395
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:33,379
Yeah. I was just going to say, I think it's insurance companies that mostly benefit from value based payments,

396
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:42,680
and they hope that as a side effect, it will help actual patient outcomes, which in some cases it will happen, but not cases like.

397
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:49,980
Well, I listen to say that Asians are the ones that do not benefit.

398
00:42:56,850 --> 00:43:04,800
You know, I think a lot of times the incentives are geared towards the provider and that's for them to provide better quality care.

399
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:09,150
However, it may not always be true, especially for socially at risk patients.

400
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:59,630
Does anyone have any questions overall about speculation? It's.

401
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:14,510
Hi, guys. Our presentation is on minimum wage increases and health insurance coverage.

402
00:44:14,970 --> 00:44:23,750
I was discussing two articles. The first myself Natalie and Jamal will be talking about and the second one and Natasha.

403
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:29,120
So the first one is titled Can Economic Policies Reduce Deaths of Despair?

404
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:35,360
The first thing I wanted to do was define the two main economic policies I'm the, first of which is minimum wage.

405
00:44:35,930 --> 00:44:43,190
That's the lowest wage permitted by law. The current federal minimum wage is $7.25, but this does vary by state.

406
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:51,320
The second policy is Earned Income Tax Credit or ITC, and this helps low income workers and families get a tax break.

407
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:55,130
So if you qualify, you can use a credit to reduce your taxes.

408
00:44:55,430 --> 00:45:00,560
And the criteria might change depending on if you have dependents or children or have a disability.

409
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:08,740
So this article is actually a compilation of multiple studies that estimated changes in mortality

410
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:15,090
as a result of an increase in the minimum wage and its implementation across the board.

411
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:22,360
Those kind of concluded that EITC and higher minimum wages reduce non substance related suicide rates.

412
00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:29,320
But we also want to investigate what the impact of income increases are on substance related mortality.

413
00:45:30,850 --> 00:45:36,490
So that brings us to our first discussion question Would you expect substances like drugs and alcohol to be normal?

414
00:45:36,530 --> 00:45:47,210
That's part. If an individual's income is increasing above what the demand look like, for instance,

415
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:53,820
I would increase okay, so that it would be like it would be towards being a normal guy.

416
00:45:53,880 --> 00:46:02,040
Get more money, drink more alcohol. Okay. It's hard for me.

417
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:11,940
I don't know, since this article didn't really control for, like, the different, like, different drugs or conspiracies, the alcohol.

418
00:46:12,450 --> 00:46:21,110
But it was actually there's not really a correct answer because the authors left this inconclusive because there was evidence that supports,

419
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:25,200
like both them be normal and an inferior good.

420
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:33,210
One study found that during economic downturns, like when individuals and companies stagnant or going down,

421
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:39,690
then there was an increased focus, purchase and use that led to more overdoses, which ultimately led to more deaths.

422
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:47,520
And we know that in that for inferior goods, when an individual's income decreases, then the demand for that certain good increases.

423
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,020
And that's exactly what we saw here.

424
00:46:50,430 --> 00:47:00,390
At the same time, we did see substances as normal goods because with during times of economic downturn, there was decreased alcohol and substance use.

425
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:10,770
So that kind of contradicts the previous study. And along with that, with increases in income, there were increases in substance use.

426
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:18,270
And then specifically responsible for alcohol related traffic fatalities were higher minimum wages.

427
00:47:18,930 --> 00:47:23,339
And then we can also use economic terms to describe this as a cyclical trend,

428
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:26,940
which is like a positive economic impact and then countercyclical, which is the negative.

429
00:47:28,890 --> 00:47:31,530
And we can see that on this graph.

430
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:39,960
On the right, we see that with increased income that shifts out our quantity and increases our demand for certain goods.

431
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:44,940
And then with that, tomorrow, we'll be talking about institutions and data in this study.

432
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:52,080
Yes. So moving to some of the data refers to find deaths of despair, which is what is being measured.

433
00:47:52,080 --> 00:48:02,490
And compared to you, you see rates of deaths, of despair could be an important cause of death.

434
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:09,960
That unintentional drug overdoses, potential overdose on drugs and suicide.

435
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:17,760
The data came from the CDC from 1999 to 2017.

436
00:48:19,170 --> 00:48:25,500
Here are a few tweaks made to the research to ensure that each state was being consistently considered.

437
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:36,480
These tweets included states such as California because of their unusual obesity rate compared to other states and the federal state.

438
00:48:37,470 --> 00:48:51,120
They also were different indicators for whether a state has legalized use of different methods, which is not very safe to do.

439
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:59,790
I'm sorry, what does it mean for you? You use the earned income tax credit.

440
00:48:59,850 --> 00:49:03,700
Oh, thank you. Or earned her job.

441
00:49:05,430 --> 00:49:13,410
And so moving to the main equation used to compare or to estimate the causal factor of minimum wage.

442
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:17,310
On what's it called? It's fair.

443
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:21,930
We see that why as cheese is the alcohol insurance,

444
00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:34,259
which in this case is total pie in your teeth as indicate the year in state and expires to you as a

445
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:42,120
factor of time to time period controlled variables and in all other variables you see in the equation.

446
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:56,090
No evidence yet since the first results found that your policy did not significantly impact drug and alcohol related measures of death, of despair.

447
00:49:56,450 --> 00:50:00,620
So all results are presented in graphs like these to see the measurements over time.

448
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:05,870
So on your x axis you have time. C equals zero is when the policy is implemented.

449
00:50:05,870 --> 00:50:14,240
So we would expect the policy to influence any measurement you want to see a sharp decrease x equals zero that continues in subsequent years.

450
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:22,040
So all of these graphs confirm that there are no significant impacts of these policies on such measurement due to the lack of trends we see.

451
00:50:22,730 --> 00:50:29,690
Even for drug suicides under minimum wage, we do see a decrease, but this is indistinguishable from zero.

452
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:33,920
It's not significant and it's actually just a continuation of the pre policy trend.

453
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:41,390
So both policies are dead, however significantly reducing non drug suicides and a negative causal effect.

454
00:50:41,870 --> 00:50:48,470
These are the types of relationships you would expect to see. The sharp decrease x equals zero and a continued negative trend.

455
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:51,739
Numerically, a minimum wage of a 10% increase.

456
00:50:51,740 --> 00:51:00,260
It decreases nondrug suicides by 2.7% and the EIC for the ITC at 10% increase, it decreases non-direct suicides by 3%.

457
00:51:02,090 --> 00:51:08,780
So the authors also wanted to see what groups nondrug suicides specifically decreased in the first four education.

458
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:15,860
Both policies significantly reduced suicides among less educated adults or those who have less than a high school diploma.

459
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:22,879
We would expect this lecture less educated adults are more likely to be affected by these policies or gender.

460
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:26,180
Both policies significantly reduced suicides for women.

461
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:31,999
However, this was only significant for men with the credit, which we would expect as well,

462
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:37,730
given that women are most likely to make minimum wage jobs and then to be affected by this policy.

463
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:40,819
The most surprising part of the finding, however,

464
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:46,520
was that no significant conclusions were made that either policy has larger impact on racial or ethnic minorities.

465
00:51:46,910 --> 00:51:52,940
We know that these policies do affect minority groups more, but they are not drug related.

466
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:59,550
Suicides are not affected. And this kind of everything with a cumulative impact.

467
00:51:59,630 --> 00:52:05,030
Those policies prevented approximately 8000 suicides between 1999 and 2017,

468
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:10,850
which were the years of data that the study was taken from human and productivity impacts of only the state.

469
00:52:11,390 --> 00:52:17,930
The supplements correspond to a savings of $11 billion compared to the fiscal cost being about 52 billion.

470
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:23,550
So while theory tells us drugs alcohol could either be normal or inferior goods.

471
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:30,800
These specific results from the study highlight that their consumption does not always increase as income increases,

472
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:36,170
though at a certain level, when you achieve a certain level of income, their consumption stops.

473
00:52:36,170 --> 00:52:43,130
So they are normal goods to an extent, so they might be better referred to as necessities instead of luxury goods.

474
00:52:45,550 --> 00:52:52,840
And just to kind of think about all these results together, given that suicides drop following the implementation of more generous economic policies,

475
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:57,759
our minimum wage and you actually see credits worth raising and that these are just all ballistic

476
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:02,650
evidence I talked about for some place to consider while you're thinking about this question.

477
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:28,300
So I mean, the authors concluded that the minimum wage in the 8687 credits are worth raising.

478
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:33,820
I think the most interesting part is their effect on the minority groups.

479
00:53:34,690 --> 00:53:43,299
I think a lot of policymakers think that raising economic policy is always impacting people of color who are more disadvantaged more.

480
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:46,420
But in this case, it did. And so that's important thing to consider.

481
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:50,470
So now we'll turn over to our second article with Natasha mohammed.

482
00:53:52,770 --> 00:53:57,749
I have one. So our next article is called How the Minimum Wage Affects the Health Insurance Coverage,

483
00:53:57,750 --> 00:54:02,130
Safety Net Program, Participation and Health of low wage workers and their families.

484
00:54:03,390 --> 00:54:08,820
So first, I'd like to start by describing some key characteristics of the minimum wage in the United States.

485
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:18,180
And I like to mention that this data was collected prior to the start of the COVID 19 pandemic, which really disrupted the market.

486
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:28,290
So minimum wage workers tend to be younger, more likely to be women, less likely to be white, and more likely to be Hispanic.

487
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:35,430
And additionally, minimum wage workers are less likely to be a parent and more likely to have a high school degree or less.

488
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:43,050
And overall, raising the minimum wage to $12 would increase wages for millions hourly wage workers.

489
00:54:43,350 --> 00:54:49,410
And raising the minimum wage to $15 would increase wages for 40,000,041 million hourly wage workers.

490
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:53,610
Are you talking about federal minimum wage because it's done by state right now, right?

491
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:57,270
Yeah. It's time for all the states.

492
00:54:59,010 --> 00:55:04,799
So our article was a review of recent literature regarding the effects of increasing the minimum

493
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:10,140
wage on various health outcomes in the United States by comparing it to the United States,

494
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:12,570
Canada, the U.K. and the rest of Europe.

495
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:21,930
So first, increases in minimum wage was associated with decreases in specific behaviors and indicators of poor health.

496
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:28,620
And some evidence suggest that it was associated with increases in general health as measured by self-reported health,

497
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:37,020
bad health days and unmet medical needs. And third, there was no evidence that suggests that increasing the minimum wage would harm health.

498
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:41,790
So in the worst case scenario, minimum wage increases have no effect on health outcomes.

499
00:55:43,710 --> 00:55:52,140
And an additional study suggested that the effects of minimum wage increases on various child health outcomes is overall positive.

500
00:55:52,470 --> 00:55:59,790
And, for example, 15.6% decrease in missed school days for children between the age of six and 12.

501
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:08,700
And, as Natalie described more in-depth earlier introduction, suicide rates adjust just a 10% minimum wage increase,

502
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:15,420
reduced nondrug suicides among adults with a high school degree or less education by 2.75%.

503
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:22,649
And next, I'd like to relate this back to the discussion we had earlier in the semester about whether it's better

504
00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:29,130
to provide low income families with direct food stamps or increasing their income by giving them cash.

505
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:39,420
So the argument for giving them cash would be that increasing their income would give them more opportunities to make healthier decisions.

506
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:44,520
As we can see here in this graph. We have two budget constraints.

507
00:56:44,790 --> 00:56:53,640
One, at the current minimum wage of $7.25, and the other at the increase the proposed increase, the minimum wage to $15 an hour.

508
00:56:54,030 --> 00:57:01,589
And the increase in different indifference curve indicates that the individual would be better

509
00:57:01,590 --> 00:57:07,530
off with an increased income and they could have more purchasing power for their various goods.

510
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:14,100
Increasing the income can help low income workers and their families purchase goods and services that directly improve health,

511
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:18,600
such as health care services, prescription medicines, high quality food and so on.

512
00:57:19,050 --> 00:57:23,100
And higher earnings may also make it easier for people to pay rent, mortgage,

513
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:27,600
tuition and so on, and thereby reducing financial stress and improving mental health.

514
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:30,060
So next I'd like to address it's an attention.

515
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:39,380
So the article also discussed the negative impacts of the increase in minimum wage that can happen to health.

516
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:48,020
And I'd like to outline that the article did mention that the health behaviors that cannot be explained by economic theory.

517
00:57:48,170 --> 00:57:53,930
The main reason being is the personal preferences. The preference for one person may not be the same as another.

518
00:57:54,770 --> 00:58:01,760
Natalie was talking about alcohol, so alcohol may be a normal good to you but could be an inferior good to someone else.

519
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:08,180
So those are preferences, education, culture. They all contribute to the choices that we make.

520
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:12,740
That brings us to the first negative impact of increasing minimum wage.

521
00:58:13,910 --> 00:58:17,180
Some consumers may actually end up consuming more costly goods.

522
00:58:17,870 --> 00:58:24,320
They would spend money producing more goods such as tobacco and alcohol, which in turn could have a negative impact on people.

523
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:31,580
And then the second negative impact that the article did speak about was job losses or reduction of work hours.

524
00:58:32,330 --> 00:58:37,400
How this stays down with increase of age. In short, is the theory of inflation.

525
00:58:37,790 --> 00:58:44,120
So when the minimum wage does increase and I actually have a graph which we just discussed in our last class.

526
00:58:44,540 --> 00:58:49,670
So when minimum wage increases, the cost of labor does go up because of wage.

527
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:59,809
If you want to continue producing the same quantity, either you have to or you either have to put in more cost into the business,

528
00:58:59,810 --> 00:59:03,050
or at the same cost you're going to end up producing more quantity.

529
00:59:03,410 --> 00:59:10,459
So there's a lower quantity. There's going to be a higher demand. It's just a cycle that inflation will drive everything high.

530
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:16,400
The cost of goods would actually increase. And in that situation, inflation does go up.

531
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:19,660
People tend to lose jobs, so they'll be more people out of jobs.

532
00:59:20,870 --> 00:59:26,270
When inflation occurs, that has down to our next negative impact.

533
00:59:26,510 --> 00:59:31,160
Obviously, if there is an inflation in the market and the prices of goods do go up,

534
00:59:31,850 --> 00:59:39,820
the resulting higher income would actually net off the net of the benefit.

535
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:46,169
So there would be technically no increase in income because just spending more amount on the price of goods.

536
00:59:46,170 --> 00:59:50,300
So you would actually have a decline of consumption of healthy goods and investments.

537
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:57,950
And the last benefit or negative impact actually, that the article did speak about was scaling back of fringe benefits,

538
00:59:58,490 --> 01:00:03,350
which is the reduction of employer sponsored insurance, which is ECI.

539
01:00:04,790 --> 01:00:10,790
And how this concept works is basically the employer would try to scale back on costs.

540
01:00:10,790 --> 01:00:15,139
And in in order to do that, they would have to cut benefits some way or the other.

541
01:00:15,140 --> 01:00:22,280
So there would be the possibility of employers reducing the coverage among low wage workers.

542
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:27,560
So this article just has some other numbers that actually support what they just said.

543
01:00:27,580 --> 01:00:33,920
My last point. So a $1 increase in the minimum wage was actually associated with the reduction in employer

544
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:39,410
sponsored insurance of about 0.99 percentage points among low income workers and the dependents.

545
01:00:40,310 --> 01:00:47,420
And the article did have clear negative relationship between the minimum wage increases and the fringe benefits for doing this.

546
01:00:48,950 --> 01:00:57,500
There was the article also mentioned that the raise of Wage Act of 2021, which would actually raise the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour,

547
01:00:57,710 --> 01:01:07,860
would actually lift 2.9 million income above the federal poverty level of however four resulted in 1.4 million workers actually losing money.

548
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:13,639
So technically, you would actually see more people out of jobs than the people who would actually benefit

549
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:18,470
from the increase in which the effects were also studied across Medicaid and CHIP,

550
01:01:18,770 --> 01:01:31,309
which is the child health insurance plan. They had estimated that the benefits of increasing by age would actually they would actually not

551
01:01:31,310 --> 01:01:36,840
outweigh the number of people that would actually become unemployed because of loss of jobs.

552
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:45,740
So that's the last point. Which states that involvement with the programs would actually increase because of the unemployment,

553
01:01:46,670 --> 01:01:53,420
would outweigh the effects of increasing employment of people due to increased income and increased minimum wage.

554
01:01:54,230 --> 01:01:58,010
So those are all the negative effects. Again, these studies are all good.

555
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:01,300
So that brings me to our last question.

556
01:02:01,310 --> 01:02:12,020
And tell me, how do you think the labor market affected with the COVID 19 pandemic in terms of minimum wages, employment, inflation or health care?

557
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:15,200
Any thoughts? Any answers?

558
01:02:16,550 --> 01:02:27,610
That's what I feel like. As a result of labor shortages, there has been a decrease in an employment rate, especially during the COVID 19 pandemic.

559
01:02:28,030 --> 01:02:39,690
But now I don't want to say post-pandemic, but now we're seeing businesses are having trouble filling some of these positions because.

560
01:02:41,710 --> 01:02:46,390
You know, two other related reasons I would say that.

561
01:02:50,050 --> 01:02:57,220
Yes, we have actually seen that with the increase in Medicaid enrollment over the period of COVID 19 pandemic,

562
01:02:57,220 --> 01:03:01,750
because of the number of people that have lost their jobs during COVID 19 pandemic.

563
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:05,410
Any other thoughts about inflation or healthcare?

564
01:03:06,670 --> 01:03:11,450
I think because of during COVID, there was a lot of travel nurses being used.

565
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:15,940
Costs have gone up for hospitals as well as like that.

566
01:03:15,940 --> 01:03:24,400
Results of the nurses who are travelers like demanding higher wages and increasing like the costs of labor, labor for hospitals.

567
01:03:24,970 --> 01:03:28,090
So there are many actually studies that I actually went through over the Internet

568
01:03:28,090 --> 01:03:33,639
and they said that with the COVID 19 labor shortage market and the demand for

569
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:38,170
people to request for more wages for the same job that was done prior to the pandemic

570
01:03:38,170 --> 01:03:46,590
has actually increased the increase the overall call expenses in the hospital.

571
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:49,780
So supplies have become more costly. Labor has gone up.

572
01:03:49,810 --> 01:03:56,290
So the net effect, the prices have to rise, which at the end is going to pinch everyone,

573
01:03:56,290 --> 01:04:01,940
the players, the providers, everyone's trying to keep up with the inflation at a certain point.

574
01:04:02,350 --> 01:04:12,550
But, you know, the entire inflation cycle, the consumers are actually probably digging most of the dirt on this.

575
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:16,000
So, yes, that is one of the other.

576
01:04:16,930 --> 01:04:20,409
So I'm just curious. I'm sorry, what's the conclusion?

577
01:04:20,410 --> 01:04:24,879
Because it seems like there's so much conflicting data. Yes. Raising the minimum wage, does it help or not help?

578
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:26,890
Does it have to have something else in combination?

579
01:04:27,340 --> 01:04:32,620
The whole class, we've been getting conflicting data since the beginning of the year and it seems like there's no solution.

580
01:04:33,220 --> 01:04:38,799
Yes. So the article actually does not have any conclusion. It says that there are both sides of the coin to it.

581
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:50,170
It could be positive or negative. Again, a lot of it I'd like to see and I think in the article, what I said was, you can not predict human behavior.

582
01:04:50,980 --> 01:04:55,540
So you cannot because you can't predict what people's preferences and how they behave,

583
01:04:55,540 --> 01:05:00,160
because you can not 100% right now seeing that this is going to be the effect.

584
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:08,130
Yeah. And basically, I think you saw what kind of a paper it would go back and forth.

585
01:05:08,140 --> 01:05:15,070
It would go so well, like in this situation, this demographic, you'd actually didn't have it.

586
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:23,130
So it was very, very with different demographics and like different situations obviously.

587
01:05:23,260 --> 01:05:30,190
So it just seems like there has to be some combination of education and rising income to actually make a difference.

588
01:05:30,190 --> 01:05:36,070
Right now, I don't know what the answer is, but so I have always thought economy is demand and supply.

589
01:05:37,090 --> 01:05:42,999
That supply has to get everything up there to degrees,

590
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:51,070
minimum wage so much that the cost of producing that could close drastically high and that would not be solved in any sense.

591
01:05:51,530 --> 01:06:01,790
And that's. And I think that's it.

592
01:06:05,710 --> 01:06:16,700
Go home, Asia. And before we leave, I find that kids have put a question out to the class about the adjustment for social risk factors.

593
01:06:18,410 --> 01:06:27,260
The two stories we can tell you, which of these stories do you kind of believe is more likely to be true or true in scenarios?

594
01:06:27,890 --> 01:06:38,690
A story in a population that has increased social risk factors in that population is inherently harder to achieve good outcomes.

595
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:42,950
So even good providers providing good care will achieve worse.

596
01:06:42,950 --> 01:06:46,760
Measured outcomes. So increased social risk.

597
01:06:51,250 --> 01:07:07,850
Please. Harder to get good, good measured outcomes, even by good providers making good efforts.

598
01:07:09,020 --> 01:07:19,129
So that would imply that the value based payment system should adjust for social risk factors to

599
01:07:19,130 --> 01:07:25,190
avoid penalizing the providers who are caring for populations that are inherently harder to achieve.

600
01:07:25,190 --> 01:07:29,870
Good measure outcomes for. So that story. Story.

601
01:07:29,870 --> 01:07:33,320
B kind of flips that around a little bit, says.

602
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:44,800
Suppose that populations that have higher social risk factors are cared for by worse providers making worse efforts at delivering worse care.

603
01:07:50,990 --> 01:07:56,330
Populations that have high levels, social factors. They don't really get the cream of the crop of providers.

604
01:08:03,630 --> 01:08:07,530
Okay. So story A, we have worse outcomes, but not worse care.

605
01:08:08,370 --> 01:08:15,180
Worse outcomes are because it's harder to achieve good measure outcomes if there are high social risk factors in your patient population.

606
01:08:15,690 --> 01:08:19,200
This story is a little bit different, says there's still worse measured outcomes,

607
01:08:19,770 --> 01:08:23,520
but the causality in the worse measured outcomes is that they're actually getting worse.

608
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:33,839
Care in those populations actually says you probably don't want to adjust payments

609
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:37,890
for social risk factors because what you're doing is you're excusing worse care.

610
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:44,010
You're saying, Oh, you're dealing with the tough population, I'm going to give you your full reward and a lower level of outcomes.

611
01:08:44,010 --> 01:08:47,250
So it's kind of like grading on a curve in sort of a perverse way.

612
01:08:49,380 --> 01:08:55,080
So the policy implication of should we adjust our value based payments to sort of social risk factors

613
01:08:55,560 --> 01:09:03,780
depends whether you believe or the data supports or ideally story as being the predominant story or story.

614
01:09:03,780 --> 01:09:09,450
B Even if you have sort of a gut feeling or any data that they're aware of,

615
01:09:09,450 --> 01:09:14,010
decide on which of those two you would sort of lean on, even if it's just a gut feeling.

616
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:21,900
Yeah, I don't have a stance, but I'm wondering how do you measure care and quality of care of the provider, how good they are?

617
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:32,820
So that's always a difficult issue because it gets back to the the question of what do you adjust for and what should you adjust for?

618
01:09:33,210 --> 01:09:37,560
In some sense, this story, it's sort of the social risk is sort of out of the provider's control.

619
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:42,750
I'm a good provider, I'm doing my best, but it's harder to achieve good measure of outcomes.

620
01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:47,460
And in this story, I'm actually a worse provider.

621
01:09:47,970 --> 01:09:53,610
And it's just that worse providers select into areas, you know, where do people want to practice medicine?

622
01:09:55,170 --> 01:10:01,260
And a lot of people are trapped. One area, an affluent area, has a lot of private insurance that they make a lot of money.

623
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:03,610
So you have to adjust. The social.

624
01:10:03,870 --> 01:10:13,120
Social risk adjustment has to be high enough to offset what they could do a good provider could do in a different place and different settings.

625
01:10:13,140 --> 01:10:16,560
Okay. So that that's really interesting. That brings up sort of a longer term thing.

626
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:26,070
So it says, well, even suppose this is true, if we increase the reward for caring for more difficult populations to achieve good outcomes,

627
01:10:26,070 --> 01:10:34,440
then maybe in the long run we'll move some better providers into caring for populations that face greater social risks.

628
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:39,930
So that's kind of this is almost like a static sort of question, you know, if we're just doing this today,

629
01:10:40,260 --> 01:10:45,210
but you're kind of bringing up sort of a long term, you know, what about where we want to be a decade from now?

630
01:10:47,070 --> 01:10:52,320
I think you could argue that there is worse care because a lot of times in those areas they're under-resourced.

631
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:57,660
And so their health care systems just don't have the resources that someone like you, again, them would have.

632
01:10:58,350 --> 01:11:01,170
So their standard of care within their hospital might be different.

633
01:11:01,830 --> 01:11:06,390
In a sense, not adjusting makes that problem worse as you're taking resources away.

634
01:11:06,780 --> 01:11:09,270
If this story is true and I don't adjust,

635
01:11:09,690 --> 01:11:15,720
I'm literally going to take resources away from the providers that are disproportionately caring for at risk populations.

636
01:11:16,260 --> 01:11:21,420
It make it making it even harder for them to care for those populations, making outcomes even worse, I think.

637
01:11:21,900 --> 01:11:27,330
But there's also maybe like a middle or a third option where it's not necessarily

638
01:11:27,330 --> 01:11:30,750
that the care is worse or it's harder for those patients to have good outcomes,

639
01:11:30,750 --> 01:11:38,340
but there's just not access to care, which is like the big barrier for a lot of populations.

640
01:11:39,110 --> 01:11:44,060
They're going to come back to the question about sort of how do you measure quality of care?

641
01:11:44,070 --> 01:11:50,250
You might be able to say there are certain metrics that are maybe less affected by these factors.

642
01:11:50,250 --> 01:11:55,559
In other words, I should you know, I should always do this for all of my patients who have Condition X,

643
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:58,830
and it's not a matter of, you know, oh, it's harder to do this.

644
01:11:58,830 --> 01:12:00,050
It's made more of a process.

645
01:12:00,100 --> 01:12:08,729
I measure what I'm doing and that might be a cleaner type of metric is would be less effective if you're looking at the outcome of,

646
01:12:08,730 --> 01:12:15,990
say, mortality, rehospitalization. That's a whole bunch of things that influence that, not not just the provider.

647
01:12:16,410 --> 01:12:19,430
But if you're looking at like, did I prescribe beta blocker,

648
01:12:19,490 --> 01:12:26,490
I give beta blockers to people who showed up in my hospital with a stroke, you know, that sort of directly under my control.

649
01:12:26,820 --> 01:12:31,229
And it shouldn't be harder to do that for a patient, a really patient.

650
01:12:31,230 --> 01:12:32,670
B, you know, there should be.

651
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:42,060
So if you're looking at maybe more, you know, direct metrics of care provided that are less likely to be subject to all types of external factors,

652
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:45,890
you're saying am I read admitted to a hospital? What what's going to determine that?

653
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:52,080
Well, we hope that in this readmissions reduction program that the quality of care provided in the hospital

654
01:12:52,350 --> 01:12:58,139
in there and the quality of discharge planning that the hospital does is going to influence that.

655
01:12:58,140 --> 01:13:00,670
Therefore, it's legitimate to penalize the.

656
01:13:00,850 --> 01:13:08,380
Hospital for a high readmissions rate because the high readmissions rate stems from things the hospital does or doesn't do.

657
01:13:09,370 --> 01:13:15,060
But if it also depends on, well, do they have any family support at home for caregiving?

658
01:13:15,070 --> 01:13:20,620
Do they have, you know, a primary care physician that they can go back to and follow up on in a timely fashion?

659
01:13:21,580 --> 01:13:27,690
So those are all things that maybe are beyond the hospital's control and the ultimate readmission rate, as you know.

660
01:13:27,700 --> 01:13:34,090
So that's kind of a you know, the story is sort of that the first things, you know, hospitals that don't provide good care.

661
01:13:34,330 --> 01:13:42,520
So people are leaving with health risks that are going to cause them to come back, that have been properly addressed by the hospital.

662
01:13:42,820 --> 01:13:47,490
And the hospital hasn't done a good discharge plan. That would be kind of a story thing.

663
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:54,160
But if the things that are driving readmissions rate are primarily, you know, I did everything I could in the hospital.

664
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:56,469
I tried my best to come up with a good discharge plan.

665
01:13:56,470 --> 01:14:04,300
But they have no family caregivers and they've got no primary care physician in their community that will see them in less than six months.

666
01:14:05,650 --> 01:14:07,710
Then you're kind of more of a story.

667
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:14,260
So I think it's the things that are under the provider's control versus the things that are sort of beyond the provider's control.

668
01:14:14,860 --> 01:14:18,430
And if you maybe focus more on the things that are in the provider's control,

669
01:14:18,970 --> 01:14:23,080
then you can maybe get more of a metric of is the provider at least kind of doing their job.

670
01:14:23,260 --> 01:14:28,960
It's not perfect because, you know, beyond your control is sort of that's also an older thing.

671
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:36,640
Is there a good discharge plan? If I know there's no primary care physician in the community who's going to see this patient within six months?

672
01:14:37,780 --> 01:14:42,129
What about is there data from vertically integrated organizations like Kaiser who do a lot

673
01:14:42,130 --> 01:14:47,050
of value based care incentives are really aligned for physicians across the spectrum,

674
01:14:47,530 --> 01:14:51,579
regardless of what community they're in, where they've got standardized testing.

675
01:14:51,580 --> 01:14:57,760
Based on this episode of this condition, standardized discharge, based on this type of patient,

676
01:14:58,210 --> 01:15:03,370
to show that it's better or worse in a socially risk population.

677
01:15:04,060 --> 01:15:07,060
At risk population. No, I'm not aware of that.

678
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:09,280
I imagine there are some data on that.

679
01:15:09,490 --> 01:15:17,310
Kaiser, I think, would be an interesting example because they obviously have a fully integrated system where they're beyond that,

680
01:15:17,490 --> 01:15:21,100
you know, and therefore the cost is all integrated. So the incentives are integrated.

681
01:15:21,630 --> 01:15:28,930
If they send somebody home too soon without a good discharge plan and without follow up community, they come back to the hospital.

682
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:35,070
Kaiser has got to eat that. They don't need a readmissions reduction penalty from the government essentially, because, you know,

683
01:15:35,140 --> 01:15:41,950
they're their own readmissions reduction penalty, maybe 100% of the cost of that readmission and get no extra revenue for it.

684
01:15:43,180 --> 01:15:47,740
So that's a pretty powerful that's there more incentive to make sure it's right.

685
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:52,810
Yeah. It's almost impossible to standardize things like that.

686
01:15:52,850 --> 01:15:58,480
Like, you can't have like a standardized discharge process for like every patient with one condition.

687
01:15:58,900 --> 01:16:03,190
And even like within a hospital system, different providers are going to treat patients differently.

688
01:16:03,790 --> 01:16:08,470
I agree with that. But there has been a lot of standardization for certain conditions that there's, you know,

689
01:16:08,590 --> 01:16:12,999
minimum standards that have to meet that total discharge is going to be completely different.

690
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:18,040
But I think a lot of hospitals are moving towards they decide they're going to implement a clinical pathway for something.

691
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:21,060
They just do it in a much more easily. Yeah.

692
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:30,810
So you do have independent physicians and independent hospitals in their network and pathways.

693
01:16:33,140 --> 01:16:38,450
So basically we don't want to penalize good providers for taking care of tough populations.

694
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:43,460
But on the other hand, we also don't want to excuse bad care delivered to those populations.

695
01:16:44,690 --> 01:16:50,299
And it's kind of a really difficult question to answer should we risk address.

696
01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:59,629
And I think more of the field is kind of coming towards a as kind of the predominant answer that there's a greater risk from taking

697
01:16:59,630 --> 01:17:08,240
resources away from those providers who are caring for patients or populations that have above average social risk factors.

698
01:17:08,750 --> 01:17:13,820
That's maybe more of a risk to not adjust. We want to be an ear of the side of me of adjusting.

699
01:17:15,290 --> 01:17:21,470
But there is sort of then the risk of, you know, you're basically excusing worse care being delivered to those populations.

700
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:27,660
Saying, Oh, you only need to achieve a C level standard of care to get your full payment.

701
01:17:29,070 --> 01:17:33,600
So it's a tough question. I think the field generally has been moving more in this direction.

702
01:17:33,990 --> 01:17:40,920
Aren't we kind of seeing that with MIPS, though, because it's you're not really seeing any difference once your risk adjusting.

703
01:17:40,950 --> 01:17:48,750
So we're not really looking at what we mean. We're not looking at the entirety of what we need to be looking at then making that recommendation.

704
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:54,920
Right. So that study, it was a little bit surprising not finding that adjusting,

705
01:17:54,970 --> 01:18:02,280
basically adjusting or not adjusting for social risk factors didn't really matter, you know, so it wasn't necessary in that case.

706
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:07,500
So it's sort of neither A nor B in a sense, in that study, which was a little bit surprising.

707
01:18:11,430 --> 01:18:20,290
Well, why don't we just a couple minutes early presentations.

708
01:18:21,850 --> 01:18:24,860
I just wanted to bring it back to us.

709
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:40,989
Oh, right. Yes. Got it. I think you're going to have to take a look at it, because I do, actually.

710
01:18:40,990 --> 01:18:59,280
I've seen it on TV and, you know, I saw the pogroms and they're doing, you know, a lot of that, you know,

711
01:19:00,570 --> 01:19:31,120
and I think they can actually process when they find out how amazing is that every time you do something wrong and someone's like,

712
01:19:34,470 --> 01:19:48,600
you know, someone like you just bizarre, like treatment of your family, they might seem like, are you leaving the.

713
01:19:49,010 --> 01:19:58,970
Yeah. You don't watch X, Y, you know, no one to do something like that because I think you.
