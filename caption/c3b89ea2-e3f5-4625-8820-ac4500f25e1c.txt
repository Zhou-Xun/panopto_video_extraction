00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Injury, part one. Overview. Hi, my name is Alfred Franzblau.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I'm a faculty member in the Department of Environmental Health Sciences in the School of Public Health,

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and I'm going to speak with you today about injuries. The topic of injuries will be covered in five lecture segments.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The first lecture will focus on some key concepts and definitions and an overview of the problem and public health challenges related to injuries.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The subsequent four lecture segments will focus on major categories of injuries in the United States,

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
in particular, fatal injuries related to motor vehicles poisonings,

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:57,000
which includes overdoses, occupational injuries and falls, and intentional injuries for each of these major categories of fatal injuries.

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We will explore a number of questions. How have the numbers changed over time?

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And if so, why are there important patterns with respect to age, gender, race or other factors?

10
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
What are some of the things that have been effective in reducing fatal injuries?

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:24,000
In some cases, we will also look at how the United States compares with other nations.

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
So let's begin our discussion by focusing on some concepts and definitions,

13
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
and then we will examine the overall burden of fatal injuries in the United States.

14
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
An injury can be any form of harm or damage.

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,000
However, some injuries are acute, such as with a fall or a car crash, and some develop over time.

16
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:59,000
As with the muscle strain, for our purposes, an injury is any form of acute physical trauma or damage caused by an external force,

17
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
such as a motor vehicle or a fall or an external agent such as a poison.

18
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:19,000
As we'll see, injuries are all too common. When we talk or think about injuries in public health, it is important to divide them into two categories,

19
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
those that are intentional and those that are unintentional.

20
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
In public health, we try to avoid the word accident or accidental.

21
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
In describing unintentional injuries,

22
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:42,000
since these terms imply that the events leading up to an injury were random or unavoidable and therefore not likely to be preventable.

23
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
In reality, over the last 100 years or so,

24
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:55,000
it has become clear that many so-called accidents are preventable and therefore amenable to public health interventions.

25
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Note that there are a small number of injuries and injury deaths that are ambiguous with regard to intent.

26
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So, for example, most drug overdose deaths are clearly unintentional.

27
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And a smaller number are clearly intentional, i.e., they represent suicides.

28
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
However, there are also a few where the intent of the drug user was unclear.

29
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Overall, the vast majority of injury deaths are clearly definable as intentional or unintentional.

30
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Fewer than two and a half percent of all injury deaths in the United States fall into the category of unclear intent.

31
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:49,000
This table displays the death rates of some of the leading causes of death in the United States from 1950 to 2017.

32
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Clearly, a lot has changed since 1950 and most of the changes have been good.

33
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
For example,

34
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:07,000
death rates from heart disease and stroke have plummeted and the death rate for cancer has declined significantly in the last 15 to 20 years.

35
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:17,000
In twenty seventeen. There were just over two hundred and forty three thousand injury deaths, including both unintentional unintentional injuries,

36
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
which is about eight point six percent of all deaths in the United States in recent decades.

37
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Injuries have been the third leading cause of death. And there the leading cause of death among persons under the age of 50.

38
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Because injuries disproportionately affect younger people. They also contribute to a disproportionate number of years of potential life lost,

39
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:50,000
unintentional injury deaths fell by more than 50 percent during the second half of the 20th century.

40
00:04:50,000 --> 00:05:00,000
However, during the period from 2000 to 2017, the death rate for unintentional injuries increased by over 40 percent.

41
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And it moved up the ranking from the fifth to being the third leading cause of death in the United States.

42
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:14,000
This recent trend of increasing unintentional injury deaths has continued up to the present.

43
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Intentional injuries are also among the top 10 leading causes of death, and they have also been increasing in recent years.

44
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Overall, deaths from injury are relatively common and therefore an important focus of public health.

45
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
The top three causes of unintentional injury deaths, poisonings,

46
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:47,000
motor vehicles and falls account for over 80 percent of all unintentional injury deaths in the United States.

47
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And while motor vehicles were the leading cause of injury deaths for many decades,

48
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:00,000
poisonings have been the leading cause of injury deaths in the United States since 2009.

49
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Other categories of unintentional injury deaths are not shown in this table,

50
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:12,000
but include occupational injuries, drownings, house fires and natural and environmental disasters.

51
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Each of these latter categories accounts for less than five percent of unintentional injury deaths among intentional injury deaths.

52
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Suicides outnumber homicides by more than two to one.

53
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:32,000
And though not shown here, firearms are the single greatest cause of all intentional injury deaths,

54
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,000
accounting for over 57 percent of all intentional injury deaths.

55
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:46,000
A notable pattern is that except for falls, which have almost the same number of male and female deaths each year,

56
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:55,000
all of the other major categories of injury deaths show a marked overrepresentation of males compared to females.

57
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Social factors also have an important role, such as race and socioeconomic status.

58
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:12,000
In most instances, blacks have lower rates of injury mortality than whites, including lower rates for poisonings or overdose deaths.

59
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
A notable exception to this pattern related to race is homicide.

60
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:26,000
That's particularly among black males, where the homicide rate is more than 10 times higher than among white males.

61
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:33,000
As with many other causes of death injury, death rates are higher among those with lower socioeconomic status,

62
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:41,000
including both unintentional and intentional injury deaths.

63
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Another way to understand the problem of injuries in the United States is to look at data from comparable high income or peer countries.

64
00:07:50,000 --> 00:08:01,000
In 2013, the Institute of Medicine published a comprehensive assessment of U.S. health outcomes compared to 16 peer countries.

65
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:11,000
The study noted that the U.S. is a very wealthy country and that it spends far more per capita on health care than any other country in the world.

66
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Nevertheless, the Institute of Medicine found that the United States has the second highest rate of injury deaths among the 17 high income countries.

67
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:28,000
This includes both intentional and unintentional injuries combined.

68
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Recalled that injury deaths contribute disproportionately to years of potential life lost, since most injury deaths occur below the age of 50.

69
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
The same IOM report examined years of life lost before the age of 50.

70
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Among 17 high income countries on average for all major causes of death,

71
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:58,000
males in the U.S. experienced greater years of life loss before the age of 50, compared to the 16 other high income countries.

72
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And notably, the greatest differences between the U.S. and the 16 other countries were for injuries, both intentional and unintentional.

73
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:17,000
A similar pattern also holds for females.

74
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:25,000
We've seen that injuries, both intentional and unintentional, are a major cause of death in the United States and that they are increasing.

75
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
So how can public health help to reduce the burden of injuries?

76
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Most injuries are triggered by human behaviors, but they also involve specific external agents and environmental factors.

77
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
The epidemiological study of injuries has focused primarily on understanding modifiable factors that

78
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:52,000
contribute to injury producing events and on factors that may influence the severity of the resulting injury.

79
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:59,000
A primary goal has been to identify specific factors that can be altered so as to reduce the probability of injuries occurring,

80
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:09,000
what we call primary prevention. Despite the fact that there are still tens of thousands of motor vehicle deaths each year in the United States,

81
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:16,000
as we will see in a later presentation, prevention of motor vehicle deaths has been a major success story.

82
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:25,000
An example of primary prevention related to motor vehicle deaths are education and laws that focus on preventing or reducing drunk driving,

83
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
i.e., interventions that prevent crashes from happening in the first place.

84
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:39,000
An example of prevention related to motor vehicles excuse me, an example of secondary prevention related to motor vehicles would be use of seat belts.

85
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Use of seat belts doesn't alter the risk of a crash happening, but in the event of a crash,

86
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:53,000
use of seat belts significantly reduces the risk of severe injury and death.

87
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Tertiary prevention refers to minimizing death and disability. Once an injury event has already occurred in the context of motor vehicle crashes,

88
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,000
the sooner an injured victim gets medical attention, the better the outcome.

89
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
The development of an extensive emergency response system,

90
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:21,000
or nine one one system in the United States over the last 60 years is a very good example of tertiary prevention.

91
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:31,000
We will employ these concepts in later segments of this lecture. When we examine particular categories of injuries.

92
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:40,000
In summary, injury deaths in the US are common. They are the third leading cause of death and in recent years they are increasing.

93
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
We usually classify injuries as either intentional or unintentional.

94
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:52,000
The US has higher rates of injury deaths compared to most other high income countries.

95
00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:10,144
Importantly, as we will see in later segments of this lecture, effective prevention strategies can help to prevent injuries.
