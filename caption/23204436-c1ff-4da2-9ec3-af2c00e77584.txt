1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:21,120
I just don't like what I'm hearing, you know, like, I don't like this.

2
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:25,020
I mean, it is.

3
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:40,870
Well, they said that this morning, everyone. So today we had one of our cell phones presenting on mic.

4
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:48,899
Just a quick update in terms of, ah, not update, but housekeeping details when Stephanie is done with her presentation.

5
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:55,740
If you could just give me 5 minutes at the end so that I can just check in with you guys about projects and stuff like that.

6
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:00,240
But I am very pleased to introduce Stephanie Langer.

7
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:11,010
She is one of our alums for our program. She's a dietician and I'm thrilled that she's here to talk about seeing your call.

8
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,880
So I am Stephanie. I am a registered dietitian at the Arab-American Chaldean Council in the city of Detroit there.

9
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,740
CLINIC Have we talked about Wicked all yet or is this the first?

10
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:27,960
We're touching on it. Okay. We have. Okay. So what are some things that we know about work and volunteers?

11
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:35,050
Who knows who we serve? Okay.

12
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:39,219
Good, we're getting baseline info here, so we're going to talk about all of that.

13
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:43,750
I have some videos. Some of you may have heard of the audio there for a second.

14
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:46,840
You're going to be very tired of that audio by the end of this presentation.

15
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:54,910
So I apologize in advance for that. But I thought I'd start us off with just touching on this Michigan waste purpose statement.

16
00:01:55,270 --> 00:02:02,469
So just to recap, the mission, the mission of the Michigan program is to improve the health outcomes and quality of life for eligible women,

17
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:06,280
infants and children by providing nutritious food, nutrition, education,

18
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:10,750
breastfeeding, promotion and support and referrals to help and other services.

19
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:15,040
So we're actually an acronym. It stands for Women, Infants and Children.

20
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:27,680
So that's the population that we serve. So you can look at this article if you.

21
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:46,570
Oh. Who?

22
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:14,940
Oh. Oh. Oh, oh.

23
00:03:48,010 --> 00:04:00,840
You. Okay.

24
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:05,800
They should ask to remain interested in working in maternal and child health or pediatrics.

25
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:13,360
Out a few of you. Okay. Yes. Highly recommend. So, yes, we're serving women, infants and children.

26
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:18,060
As you saw, there are over 10,000 locations in the United States.

27
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:27,040
So this is a public health program that's really integrated into the country as a whole and public health services kind of across the board.

28
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:33,820
So what does Wink do? So at the federal level, it provides grants to each state for supplemental foods.

29
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:38,110
So that's a huge portion of our service to clients is providing nutritious food.

30
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,910
You'll note that it difference it differs from SNAP and the way that SNAP is also suited to

31
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:51,549
just offering food benefits in general so you can purchase any kind of edible on SNAP benefits,

32
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:54,640
which has more guidelines. So it's nutritious food.

33
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,070
We'll talk a little bit more about that later. And we offer health care referrals.

34
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:02,830
So this is another huge advantage for our clients.

35
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:11,890
We ensure that they have adequate prenatal care, pediatric care, if there's concerns, related developmental issues.

36
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:17,979
We have services for that. So lots of different referrals for our clients where we of course provide nutrition education.

37
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:24,200
So that's where the registered dietitians and the nutrition or nutrition has come into play.

38
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:30,550
So each of our clients will meet with one of them to assess for their nutrition risk and things of that nature.

39
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,480
So we have three more of these total now in the campaign.

40
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:49,650
And this is talking a little bit about what else is going on here in the.

41
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:47,420
Oh. In addition to the.

42
00:06:53,350 --> 00:07:00,230
Ow! Ow! Ow!

43
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:08,890
Ow! Ow, ow, ow.

44
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:28,570
And. You.

45
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:59,300
Who? Okay.

46
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:04,780
So we're as they covered in one of the previous videos is covered in every state and every county.

47
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:14,530
So that's very it's a very far reaching program. He comes to 10,000 clinics over the entire United States.

48
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:21,580
And is that one video set as well? One in two children will pass through a quick office at some point in their childhood across the state.

49
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:28,180
In Michigan, that looks more like 41% of children. But still, it's touching a lot of lives.

50
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:32,080
It is a federal block grant program. So what does that mean?

51
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:36,700
It means that Congress authorizes a specific amount of funds each and every year for that program.

52
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:40,270
So that's how it's funded and that's how we can carry on our activities.

53
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:44,140
And it's administered by the USDA's Food and Nutrition Services.

54
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:49,970
So just a few fast facts here before we jump into our food packages.

55
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:58,520
So Congress last year appropriated $6.8 billion, for which 6.7 million people participate in the program nationally.

56
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:03,890
And yet this only accounts for 57% of the people who are actually eligible to participate.

57
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:10,040
So there is a significant proportion of the population that could be receiving with benefits that are currently.

58
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:18,380
So opportunities for outreach. In Michigan, we serve about 200,000 moms, babies and children every month.

59
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:23,720
And like I said, 41% of children in the state will be serviced by women at some point.

60
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:31,160
And this is really key here as well. So for every dollar spent by this program, more than $3 in health care costs are saved.

61
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:35,480
So that's that's a huge investment opportunity to save money on the back end.

62
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,800
And with that data, we can really justify the work that we're doing as well.

63
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:47,240
And local communities are also supported with more than $1,000,000 yearly when foods are purchased at local grocery stores.

64
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:55,520
So we do work with vendors in each state and an area so people can go and redeem their benefits that we issue them.

65
00:09:56,270 --> 00:10:00,800
Stephanie, Brooke, sure. You want questions at the end? Whenever if you have a question, please pop it up.

66
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:06,320
Let me know if I'm talking too fast. Yeah, I had a question here in the video.

67
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:13,100
The second one kind of talking about like the role of nutritionists.

68
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:18,080
Is there a reason for that instead of a dietitian? Yes, I know we kind of don't like that.

69
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:23,870
Where it is registered, dietitians write nutritionists so at which it is a legitimate position.

70
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,550
So we call them nutrition specialists.

71
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:32,450
So when I was hired and I had finished my master's program, so I had a degree in nutrition, but I was not a registered dietitian.

72
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:35,690
Those are the people that we have serve as nutrition specialists.

73
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:39,469
So they do they take care of clients who are not considered high risk.

74
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:41,660
And we talk about high risk a little bit later as well.

75
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:49,159
So these are people who have a background in nutrition, either have a degree in nutrition or they have taken a specialty course.

76
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:56,209
I think it's like a 8 to 10 month course where we train them on the basics of nutrition so they can serve in that role.

77
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:58,340
And then we also have our registered dietitians, of course.

78
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:07,850
So each clinic will have those, at least one registered dietitian, and they do nutrition specialist jobs as well.

79
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:13,970
But they their primary role is to address the high risk clients.

80
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,390
Yeah. How is Congress determined? Like how much funding actually goes to it?

81
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:21,740
That's a great question. I'm a registered dietitian. I don't know the answer to that.

82
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:26,570
I'd love to find the answer, though. There is a lot of data that goes into that.

83
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,990
Do you have a good answer? I don't. You don't have that? I don't.

84
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:35,110
Yeah, I. So week to each of our appointments.

85
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,670
It's all data collection, the questions that we ask them, and then we just have all of the data.

86
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:48,770
So I imagine that those are all in that's analyzed and determine how much money goes to each state for that.

87
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:54,020
That's what I look like and I do not deserve any other questions at this point.

88
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:57,739
What's the economic cutoff for being eligible for?

89
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:02,330
When I got you can be like 5 minutes. I have a chart for that.

90
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:07,909
So it's determined based on income for the family, reported income and household size.

91
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:12,730
So I have a chart in here to that. You can see where I am outside of.

92
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:20,330
I had a quick question about the referrals. So do you guys have like social workers on staff like so yes.

93
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:25,610
She has no health insurance. Is there help for like dental care?

94
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:33,050
I thought was great. But again, if they don't have that support, service is which help them find like through the state or.

95
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:36,620
Yes, absolutely. So those are two questions that I ask every one of our clients.

96
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:43,579
I ask about Medicaid and I ask about food stamps. I'd say 70% are on both already.

97
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:50,810
If they're not, I can refer them to their local agency, which would help them get in contact to apply for Medicaid to apply for food stamps.

98
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:58,040
So many women get access to that based on that referral and then all of the referrals as well.

99
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:02,749
So our prenatal referrals or dental referrals, they are all pre removed.

100
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:06,320
So if you can't be serviced by these places, which helps a lot.

101
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:13,370
A lot of the times they go with dentists, they don't always take Medicaid. Sometimes it's a struggle enough to get into the dentist in general.

102
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:17,020
And then when you do get a hold of them and then they don't accept Medicaid, that's a problem.

103
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:20,960
So we're trying to remove those barriers on the front end and it helps.

104
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,200
There's also a lack of knowledge with a lot of that.

105
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:30,439
For example, with dentists, does anyone know what age you should take your baby to the dentist for the first time?

106
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:38,669
Your child. Your baby. No. To. Your cousin's one one years old.

107
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:41,489
They're recommending you take your baby to the dentist for the first time.

108
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:45,870
So just about nobody knows that when I'm talking to moms so encouraging that,

109
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:51,359
you know, we're preventing decay issues with dental hygiene and care really early on.

110
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,870
So things like that, they talk about the village.

111
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:59,580
So the things that you want people to be telling you, you know, why don't we inherently know this is what kind of helps with that?

112
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:09,010
So eligibility we talked about, you know, when women, infants and children. So for women, we service women who are pregnant and who are postpartum.

113
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:17,130
So for breastfeeding, postpartum women, you can receive with benefits for up to a year and for non breastfeeding postpartum women, that's six months.

114
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:25,290
Also, obviously infants up until one year. And that's because after they're infants, their children and you service them up until five years of age,

115
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:33,329
there's also a residential component to eligibility here. So clients need to live within the state in which they're applying.

116
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:36,659
So Michigan folks will get Michigan benefits in a lot of state.

117
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:40,770
You transfer those lot of kids to the state residing in at that point.

118
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:44,490
They may also be required to live in a local service area.

119
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:48,840
So for example, Detroit clients would need to be serviced by a Wayne County public office.

120
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,550
This isn't so prevalent right now, and that's because of the COVID 19 pandemic.

121
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:59,249
We have levers in place which basically allow us to accept clients anywhere in the state of Michigan.

122
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:03,420
So I service clients in Marquette, and that's because we're doing telehealth right now.

123
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:07,350
There's our clinic specifically is still 100% virtual and remote.

124
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,010
Not all clinics are in the state. So there's some that are seeing clients in-person.

125
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:14,020
So that's where that might be a little more relevant.

126
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:17,050
And then here's our income eligibility.

127
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:23,740
So any claims need to be deemed to be at or below the income level or the income standard that's set by the state agency.

128
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:29,500
So there is a federal poverty level that needs to be adhered to from all states.

129
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:33,340
And then the state also sets their income standard as well.

130
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:38,860
It just needs to fall within those federal guidelines as well. And that's broken down in the next slide a little bit further.

131
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:44,770
Our clients need to be determined to be automatically income eligible based on their participation in other programs.

132
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:51,960
So the income standard, so it needs to be at or below 100% of the federal poverty guidelines.

133
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:53,950
So there's a chart here on the next slide as well.

134
00:15:54,520 --> 00:16:01,600
But it can't be the state can't set an income standard that's more than 185% of the federal poverty guideline.

135
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:06,790
I just saw that. So a picture would make a little more sense here in a second.

136
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:11,770
And then also that automatic income eligibility so certain applicants can be determined

137
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:16,000
to be income eligible for just based on their participation in other specified programs.

138
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:20,650
So SNAP Medicaid, the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families.

139
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:25,660
If they participate in those, they can automatically be determined eligible to receive with benefits.

140
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:29,530
And here's our income guidelines. So that looks okay.

141
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:34,440
So if you look on the left hand side, that's our federal poverty guideline right here.

142
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:35,890
Right. This is 100%.

143
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:45,550
So this is just saying this is the maximum that any client in the United States can make per household member to be eligible for work.

144
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:52,000
So let's look at a family size of two. So that annual salary income is $18,310.

145
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:56,950
So then when you come over here, this is our annual we see that the number is 33,000.

146
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:03,100
So that's 185%. So this is actually saying that that income standard set at each state level,

147
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:11,130
they can't make that value any more than $33,874 to set their own eligibility requirements for work.

148
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:18,050
I do that time explaining things that make sense. Yeah.

149
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:20,000
Does the state try to get it closed?

150
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:25,270
I mean, it sounds like you could include more people if you got closer to the federal number, which is a lot higher.

151
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:30,260
So did they try to wiggle it up to get a closer to those numbers to include more people than you would hope?

152
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:35,180
I think there's a lot of people argue making that argument as well to get that value up there.

153
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:39,440
And, you know, I wish I had the Michigan number right here to tell you what that is.

154
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:44,329
Maybe I can send a follow up and kind of show what the different states, what poverty level,

155
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:48,229
their income standard US support because ideally we would have agreed on that one 85%.

156
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:51,740
Right. Which could service more people. Yeah.

157
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:54,820
I wish I would have had that thought yesterday. Okay.

158
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:59,059
And then we're talking about nutrition risk on this slide. So all clients are seen by a nutrition staff.

159
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:04,310
So that's our nutrition specialists or registered dietitians who do an initial assessment.

160
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:10,670
We call them our certification appointments. So we're determining at that point, based on their answers to our series of questions,

161
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:14,810
whether they're considered to be high risk in terms of nutrition.

162
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:19,820
So nutrition risk is defined as an individual having a medical or dietary based condition.

163
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:25,760
So any ideas what types of conditions or status might make someone provide nutrition risk?

164
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:35,050
3.13. Crohn's disease or AGI.

165
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,140
Okay. Can I get you? Mm. CBD.

166
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:47,490
Mm hmm. Yeah. So just about any of these medical conditions that either have their own high risk code or they fall under other medical conditions.

167
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:50,610
So any of these conditions that you're talking about in your classes,

168
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:56,220
we're going to try to capture that in our assessments and we're going to try to get them in with the registered dietitian.

169
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:02,640
And these are also optional appointments. So we offer each of our clients, you know, you are eligible to be seen by registered dietitian.

170
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:08,190
Is that's something you're interested in? A lot of the times that they see us, sometimes they don't just not interested.

171
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,829
It is a little bit longer of an appointment and we get more in-depth,

172
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:17,730
gets more of a clinical approach to care versus just like that, more widespread public health type thing.

173
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:24,660
So here's a full list, too. So we have diabetes, hypertension, anemia is a really big one.

174
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:29,250
Women who are younger than 17, we captured that as well.

175
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:34,469
So severe medical conditions or other medical conditions is what I see more frequently.

176
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:40,560
So that's a lot of those are just extensive list of medical conditions, hyperemesis, gravidarum.

177
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:44,670
Anyone know what that means? Yeah, it's usually in the first trimester.

178
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:48,870
It's just constant throwing up. Yes. Yeah, we have a lot of that as well.

179
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:54,629
It's it's very tough for those moms short time between pregnancies.

180
00:19:54,630 --> 00:20:00,690
So we can start that high risk early in preterm birth is one that I see just about every single day and low birth weight.

181
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:07,229
So women who are at risk tend to have higher rates of these occurrences and then smoking and drug usage.

182
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:12,420
We also try try to capture that and then we can talk about our food packages as well.

183
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:18,989
Any questions at this point? Just alcohol consumption, is that considered to be it's alcohol or drug use?

184
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:22,920
So there's another for alcohol use right now.

185
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:27,360
I think we could do a better job at capturing when that's actually presenting.

186
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,629
A lot of the times the way the question is is phrased right now is kind of asking like,

187
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:37,410
do you know if you've had any alcohol intake during your pregnancy? Which is important to know about a lot of the types of answers like, yeah,

188
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:42,030
I went out before anyone I was pregnant, I had alcohol and we still have to mark Yes to that.

189
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:45,240
So by the time we get to the registered dietician appointment, she's like, No, I'm not drinking.

190
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:49,590
And so important to know nonetheless.

191
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:55,200
So our food packages are designed to align with the dietary guidelines for Americans,

192
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:59,280
as well as the Infant Feeding Practice Guidelines of the American Academy of Pediatrics.

193
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:04,590
And we talked about the dietary guidelines for Americans got. Okay, so we're a little familiar with those.

194
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:10,950
It's kind of the essence of what we're doing here. Right. And they're also designed to target certain key nutrients.

195
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:15,690
And these are mainly protein, calcium, iron and vitamins A and C.

196
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,129
And this is because these nutrients tend to be low in the diets of the populations that we serve.

197
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:24,300
So we want to make sure that the foods that we're we're offering them are going to address that need.

198
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:31,079
So our food packages, you'll see, mainly revolve around these kind of basic foods here.

199
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:41,460
So we have milk, cheese, eggs, juices, cereals, beans and peanut butter, of course, fresh fruits and vegetables and whole grains.

200
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:48,400
Any questions about that? What do we know about juice right now?

201
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:52,240
What are the opinions of juice kind of in the nutrition community?

202
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:56,080
Yes, it's full of sugar and that's probably not terribly good for you.

203
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:01,780
Yeah. And the other thoughts on juice all through the science and classified.

204
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:04,810
I mean, more than accidents and skins for sure.

205
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:09,010
For sure. And these are thoughts and sentiments that we share to a degree.

206
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:15,760
I'm not totally against juice, if you like juice. But we it's important to keep juice.

207
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,990
And the reason that it's not taken off the food packages, because a lot of people have, you know,

208
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:28,240
made these arguments towards it, is that a lot of our population has high blood levels.

209
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:34,420
And we know one of the nutrients that help minimize the amount of blood that our body is absorbing is vitamin C.

210
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:43,360
So juice is a really easily, readily accessible, readily accepted food by children and toddlers to make sure we're getting that nutrient in.

211
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:46,240
So it will likely stay on the food package for a long time.

212
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:58,060
Stephanie, can you speak to how food packages, how do you work with your clients that may have cultural and dietary practices?

213
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:02,770
Sure. Given that food packages are somewhat fixed.

214
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:11,230
Yeah. So I know nationwide too, depending on the area that you're in, we try to match our education resources.

215
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:17,590
So I have a few here. Even down to the color that are associated with these different populations,

216
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:23,350
we're making lots of changes with the education material to kind of reflect how you can use these,

217
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:26,800
you know, kind of cut and dried food packages to suit those preferences.

218
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:33,010
So a lot of the times, the the basics to, you know, food preferences are the same.

219
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:37,180
You know, it's how we can use these to reflect the culture.

220
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:39,490
So we don't want to be including in our nutrition education,

221
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:47,770
very Americanized details of we're serving a population that, you know, services are high Arabic, you know, community.

222
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,030
So those are changed 30th hour teams for that. I'm not currently involved in that.

223
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,460
That'll be a great opportunity for sure.

224
00:23:55,450 --> 00:24:03,250
But that assess that kind of cultural prevalence in those communities and try to reflect our resources to to suit those.

225
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:07,030
Have you heard of anything? No, but you raise a good point.

226
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:16,720
I mean, these foods, many of them are of the basics that men would be use to then make a meal that is much more culturally reflective,

227
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,170
especially with the fruits and vegetables. I mean, it's pretty wide open for that.

228
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:23,740
So whatever fruits and vegetables they want to eat and they just are grains.

229
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:30,190
For vegetarian and vegans, we could use soy milk on their food packages.

230
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:35,380
You get a plus. We get a lot of requests for almost soy like oat milk.

231
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:39,910
But if it's have not been extended to include those quite yet, still a little interesting, I guess.

232
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:43,090
Is there a discussion, too? I don't think so.

233
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:50,620
I don't think that's ever going to come through just because soy is there's good evidence that it's nutritionally comparable to cow's milk,

234
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:55,840
whereas oat milk and all the milk are calorie content isn't comparable to that, you know.

235
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:59,200
And so I don't I don't think so.

236
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:05,649
We'll see. We'll see. Maybe if I don't know, because I know a lot of them are fortified with vitamin D and calcium.

237
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:10,090
So it gets it closer to that mark. But I'm not sure.

238
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,040
I'm not sure how relationships between, you know,

239
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:17,830
dairy industry and like our federal play into that as well, you know, that just might not be an option.

240
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:24,900
So for our infants. So for breastfeeding infants, they don't get any food benefits.

241
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:28,620
Do we know why? Right.

242
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:34,890
For breast and infants up until six months, it's recommended that they're exclusively breastfed so they don't need any food.

243
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:41,070
Partial and non breastfeeding mothers. We do supplement with iron fortified infant formula.

244
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:48,450
So and then starting at six months of age, they are eligible to receive infant cereals and generally.

245
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:54,870
Which also does a program in the summer called Project Fresh,

246
00:25:55,240 --> 00:26:01,660
where we give an additional $25 per eligible participant to be redeemed at local farmers markets and

247
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:06,910
participating farmers markets so they can get fresh local produce as well throughout the summer.

248
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:14,080
So that's coming to an end now. I think the coupons are good until the end of October, so just about when all the farmers markets closed down anyway.

249
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,340
So that's a very cool program.

250
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:21,910
Moms get very excited about that, kids get very excited about that and it's just free an additional above their with benefits.

251
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,540
So I don't know how clear that's coming through.

252
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:30,130
It's probably not a great screenshot, but this looks this is what our food packages look like from our end.

253
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:36,129
So when I'm entering a food package in so the top is an infant that is between six and 11 months old.

254
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:43,210
So you'll see they're getting seven cans of an infant formula as well as their jarred fruits and vegetables and cereals.

255
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:47,080
And then the whole package down here is four.

256
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:53,980
This one's for a toddler, a toddler to a kid that has all those foods that we talked about previously,

257
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:59,470
as well as the mother's food package looks similar to this not too far off.

258
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:07,390
And adjustments can be made to these based on allergies, client preferences, which we kind of talked about in recommendations made by pediatricians.

259
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:12,220
So, for example, if someone's allergic to peanut butter or has a nut allergy,

260
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:15,940
we mainly just advise you don't buy the peanut butter, buy the beans and stuff.

261
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:21,670
They're kind of on the same line. But for like eggs, for example, if there's an allergy, we can just go ahead and zero that out.

262
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:27,190
So those aren't available on the card. We talked about vegan, vegetarian.

263
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:34,450
We do have food packages where we just essentially do the same thing, take away those animal based products so that you have an egg allergy.

264
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:37,929
Is there another protein that you slip it in there? There is not, no.

265
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:41,440
So it just gets taken off so it's not replaced with.

266
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:47,390
And I'm thinking recommendations by pediatricians. So if there's a growth concern.

267
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:56,300
So, for example, for when when children turn two years of age, they get switched from the whole milk food package to a low fat milk package.

268
00:27:56,540 --> 00:28:02,689
It shows a growth concern, low BMI. We can't get a special formula request form from the pediatrician,

269
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:07,610
and we can put that back to whole milk so we can get those extra calories in that extra fat to children who need it.

270
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:14,030
For mothers, that looks like 2% milk solids rather than whole milk.

271
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:18,180
2% milk. Okay.

272
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,930
And here are five standard infant formula options.

273
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:25,410
So we do have a list of other formulas that are approved on work.

274
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:32,100
So for children who have low protein allergies or premature infants, they get specialty formulas with one of those forms as well.

275
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:37,590
Well, for the most part, this is what the majority of infants getting with benefits are receiving.

276
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:42,480
You'll notice that they're all Similac formulas. You know anything about Similac right now?

277
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:48,420
We think in the news that they had a little trouble at their factory shut them yeah Abbott nutrition.

278
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:58,829
So Similac parent company is Abbott nutrition and back in February there was a formula recall and it was next to the COVID 19 pandemic,

279
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:03,510
the biggest public health crisis I've seen. And it happened approximately two weeks into my career.

280
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:07,790
So I learned what I was supposed to be doing and other like just getting stop all that.

281
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:10,830
Now we have to address this. So it was very chaotic.

282
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:17,219
But yeah, here's some of the newest titles here for four things that was happening.

283
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:22,260
It was just about the only thing that everyone could talk about, and rightfully so.

284
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:30,329
It was it was very stressful time. So February 17th, the FDA announced that a recall of certain Abbott powder formulas had happened.

285
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:37,410
And Abbott did voluntarily recall this because there were reports that babies were getting sick from a chrono Baxter infection.

286
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:43,379
All of these the all of the babies who initially were infected were hospitalized and two ended up dying.

287
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:46,830
So it was a very, very serious issue that was happening.

288
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,720
And they did do an investigation later on the facility.

289
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:55,200
Has anyone know where the facility was at Michigan? Yeah, in Sturgis, Michigan.

290
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,250
So kind of you from Sturgis to your account. Okay.

291
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:04,560
So you're familiar. Yeah. So Michigan got some negative limelight there for a minute because we had that factory there.

292
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:09,870
So they went into the facility and they found five different strains of Corona bacteria in the facility.

293
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:13,080
But interestingly, they didn't actually find any in the powder samples.

294
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:17,430
So these babies were getting sick from it and they couldn't find it anywhere in the actual powder.

295
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:22,530
So I think it kind of just ended up being, you know, when you put two and two together, the bacteria is there.

296
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:30,410
It somehow got to infants. Maybe that lot load was passed already and it also exposed a lot of other things.

297
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,530
So it wasn't up to code with hygiene.

298
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:37,230
There were several things with their equipment,

299
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:43,320
so they got put on another six week backlog before they could restart functions just to get up to code with everything.

300
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:50,640
So that was another issue I think I read at one point they were wondering if the bacteria were in the cans.

301
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:56,190
You can't you know, the packaging says it wasn't found in the product.

302
00:30:56,370 --> 00:31:01,949
You know, that surprised everybody. It did because also these cases were not all in one area.

303
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:05,190
They were they were in different areas. So it's like, how did that happen?

304
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:08,880
Think so what did we do?

305
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:13,170
So we obviously had to had a response to this.

306
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:17,130
We had all these moms who were receiving Similac formula on their benefits.

307
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:25,620
It caused just panic across the board, you know, women not wanting Similac in general, but we have a contract with Similac.

308
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:29,399
So I think every five years is when this contract is up for renewal.

309
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:36,360
And predominantly it's Enfamil or Similac, whether with those with one or the other, whoever kind of gives the best quote.

310
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:43,139
So that's how we ended up with Similac in the first place. We had just recently switched over for ago, which moms were happy about before this.

311
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:48,540
So then added and formula recall on top of that once really we're happy with Similac.

312
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:54,240
So initially what we did was we helped to determine whether their cancer formula were affected by the recall.

313
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:59,760
So of those five formulas that we had just seen a minute ago, four of them were affected by the recall.

314
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:05,399
The only one that wasn't was Similac soy. Which of those five is the least prescribed formula?

315
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:10,620
So that's not very helpful either. But we had to check serial numbers on each of the cans.

316
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:17,190
So we helped mom, based on the guidelines that Abbott had put out, identify whether their lot number on their formula was affected.

317
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:24,299
And the great part about this was as part of my job, I was in clinic and I was looking at all these serial numbers to make sure any

318
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:28,170
of the formulas that we were giving to clients who needed it weren't affected.

319
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:31,800
Right? So I did all that. There were only one or two that were affected.

320
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:39,870
I put all the other ones in another section and then how that came out and said, We think there's a labeling issue as well.

321
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:44,970
So then I went back to all the ones that I had checked and some of these cans, there was a carton,

322
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:51,660
right with the serial number and they were placed in a box with the same serial number on the bottom or should have been the same serial number.

323
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:53,790
So I was looking at the bottom of the box.

324
00:32:54,360 --> 00:33:00,990
So then when I opened it up, I look in the can and the serial number on the bottom of the can is different from the one on the box and it is affected.

325
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:09,299
So a lot of moms, after they had been on these, had been vetted and based on the serial number on the box actually did have an effective formula.

326
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:12,660
So that was a secondary kind of blow to all this situation.

327
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:17,340
We also authorized several alternative formulas for each of the.

328
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:23,450
Standard formula is that wink provides sort of a nice that this was done a little bit sooner than it was I think it totally.

329
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:28,030
He's going to have two weeks, and that's a long time to be in limbo with formula.

330
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:34,490
But we did approve alternative formulas based on what formula was listed on their benefits.

331
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:42,770
So at this point, Wegmans can pretty much purchase any formula that's on shelves or on the grocery store shelves.

332
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:50,730
It just depends on what is listed on their benefits. But it is an extensive list for each of the formulas, so that's helped alleviate the burden.

333
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:55,790
Once that was put in place, we were able to get nutrition to these babies, which was really important.

334
00:33:57,230 --> 00:34:02,480
We also provided education on infant nutrition and offered guidance when formula was unavailable in stores.

335
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:07,810
And this, I think is an under-discussed part of the whole Albert recall.

336
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:11,270
So especially once things had settled down just a little bit,

337
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:18,770
we were at the point where your baby could get formula in some capacity, even if it wasn't the one that you wanted baby to be on.

338
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:21,890
It wasn't the best one that they they tolerated.

339
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:27,580
But we could get you formula, which at baseline is what we want, either breast milk or infant formula.

340
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:32,329
Right. We got to the point where there was such a mistrust with the formula, with Similac,

341
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:36,590
without it, that moms were turning to completely alternative nutrition routes.

342
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:40,490
So they were giving solid foods prior to four months even.

343
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:48,320
They were giving cows milk really early. So we don't recommend the cows milk is given to infants or to babies until one year of age.

344
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:54,979
So anyone know why we wait until one year to do cow's milk written on protein?

345
00:34:54,980 --> 00:35:04,580
The sugar? Yeah. So it can cause intestinal bleeding and it can also the protein and the minerals and almost milk is just too much for baby's kidneys.

346
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:12,230
So that was a problem. There was one case where we dealt with my mom was giving her five month old baby skim milk,

347
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:15,830
which across the board is just so nutritionally inadequate.

348
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,580
So very scary stuff. So at this point, you know, it's not your fault.

349
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:23,850
There's just so much fear and lack of knowledge. So we helped kind of bridge the gap with that.

350
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:29,870
We got babies who were doing cows milk, you know, education to moms that we any formula,

351
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:36,649
anything that you can find on the shelves is going to be better than cows milk. It's going to be better than pet milk, which is evaporated milk.

352
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:40,400
So also not better. Goat's milk was another one that I heard.

353
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:44,450
Apparently that was a thing in the early 1900s, goat's milk.

354
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:49,760
So people were returning to that. So lots of dangerous activities that we were trying to help minimize.

355
00:35:49,770 --> 00:36:00,080
So that was a lot of my job. Yeah. How would you go like addressing a parent who is giving their child one of those?

356
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:07,160
Yeah. So a lot of times they don't even know what that what they're doing is as dangerous as it is.

357
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:11,470
And even so, we had doctors who were recommending pet smell.

358
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:16,610
So these were very old doctors recommended cut smell, which is just makes the hair on your skin, say a dog.

359
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:26,360
You're just like, Oh my God, why is it doing that? So just defaulting to what the facts are, so giving them resources to reputable resource sources.

360
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:33,680
You know, with that information that we know that this happens. I mean, every single mom that I talked to when I said that, you know,

361
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:37,549
she can cause intestinal bleeding, it's you do it over a prolonged amount of time.

362
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:41,570
You will have a malnourished baby. That's enough to be like, okay, this isn't the right approach.

363
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:47,090
We need to to deviate back to somewhere in the middle. So you have a lot of sympathy for these moms.

364
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:55,460
I mean, even with the a hoarding and over purchasing a formula that happened in the beginning which also exacerbated the shortage issue,

365
00:36:55,490 --> 00:37:00,290
you have a lot of sympathy for these months. You know, you tell a man that she can't feed her baby.

366
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:06,010
What is she going to do? You're going to do whatever you need to get the and you need to do this.

367
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:09,740
I'm just kind of directing the chaos. What is possible.

368
00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:18,860
Yeah. Where are we now with that? Like, is the like the bacteria kind of controlled now or is that so?

369
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:23,509
That facility is back up and running. I can't remember the date that it was, but it is within compliance now.

370
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:28,910
So they're producing. So we're in a good spot with Formula One now.

371
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:34,760
There's still some that are difficult to find, not even the ones that we had just recommended.

372
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:38,989
It just kind of caused like cascading issues across the the stock.

373
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:42,799
So, you know, it's like our challenge and formula, which wasn't one of those initial five.

374
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:47,210
Like a lot of babies switched over to that. So now that's an issue to find.

375
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:53,330
A lot of waivers were put in place, which I touch on here in a second to more so related to the COVID response,

376
00:37:53,540 --> 00:38:00,770
but lots of waivers put in place just so basically whatever they could find in store that their doctor gave the go had on we could provide to them.

377
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:05,000
So there was many more regulations prior to this formula.

378
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:11,840
Recall for all the given that have been relaxed, heavily relaxed too, to address these things that are going on.

379
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:20,730
I think roughly what proportion of your your clients do they are breastfeeding versus, you know, formula feeding.

380
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:28,440
I have that stat for you either I know I think it's more especially in my district is more that our infant formula feeding than breastfeeding.

381
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:32,070
So that's something that we'd love to see the opposite be true for.

382
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:41,330
So a lot of people say to, you know, if breastfeeding isn't the core of Wicks mission, why are we offering infant formula as well?

383
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:49,709
So there's a lot of cultural and historical background that goes into why women choose to feed their baby a certain way, especially my population.

384
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:50,480
I work in Detroit,

385
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:58,680
so I work with a lot of African-American women where there is a deep historical context to why they're choosing not to breastfeed their families.

386
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,040
Their friends are not breastfeeding.

387
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:09,960
Now, I encourage you to Google that to Google about the historical context of breastfeeding in African-American populations or minorities in general.

388
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:15,840
It sheds a lot of light. I think I was in my second year of grad school when I finally looked into that, and it's just perplexing.

389
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:20,040
So again, a lot of sympathy for my, you know, versus just being like, why aren't you breastfeeding?

390
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:29,489
Why do you choose to do formula feed? We know that breastfeeding is better, but with the formula, it's not something that we heavily advertise.

391
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:32,729
We actually take steps to minimize that exposure.

392
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:38,219
So we're putting a lot of effort into encouraging breastfeeding while simultaneously, you know,

393
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:45,810
not putting physical advertisements out for formula in our clinics where we're not making it, you know, overly known.

394
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:51,360
I mean, the community knows that like offers formula, of course, but it's not something that we're trying to prioritize.

395
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:55,170
So that's our approach right now, while also just making sure that all babies are fed.

396
00:39:55,830 --> 00:40:02,370
I am of the camp that Fed is best, so we're going to try to encourage breastfeeding, but babies are going to get fed one way or another.

397
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:08,310
So this goes into our breastfeeding services, a great tie in.

398
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:12,479
So every week staff member is trained to help support breastfeeding mothers.

399
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,160
So that's our intake specialist.

400
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:21,239
Everyone is waiting to get some type of breastfeeding support, which also helps just in general for community knowledge.

401
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:25,770
So a lot of the people that we employ live in the communities that they're working in.

402
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:31,319
So they're going to take this information out into the community hopefully. Right, and share why breastfeeding is better.

403
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:34,320
Sure. That is possible that you can do it.

404
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:41,520
Sounds great. And now every local agency has a peer counselor to answer breastfeeding questions and further support moms.

405
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:47,610
So every certification appointment that we have with pregnant moms and postpartum moms,

406
00:40:48,330 --> 00:40:56,280
we refer them over to the peer counselor where they get the opportunity to talk about breastfeeding, challenges, worries, logistics, things like that.

407
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:02,550
So they get that contact point. Any of the women who are interested in breastfeeding often appreciate that appointment,

408
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:11,069
just helps clarify choices and the women who are deemed to have advanced lactation needs, so they meet with their peer counselor.

409
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:15,120
There's something more serious going on. They get to meet with a lactation consultant or an ABC.

410
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:23,100
LC So this is someone who is credentialed and, and heavily trained to, to address issues and concerns with breastfeeding.

411
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:27,240
So that's a wonderful resource that we offer classes and support groups.

412
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:30,960
So this is something that kind of took a hit with COVID. These were all happening in person.

413
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:37,350
And we're slowly starting to see that the telehealth versions of the use of the the remote versions are kind of picking up traction.

414
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:42,389
More and more women are attending those. So that's really good educational materials in all caps.

415
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:46,130
These are like circulating things, too. So you can take a look.

416
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:50,850
There's one in there. This is just a small sampling of what our education resources look like,

417
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:58,200
but we provide lots of physical materials for them to reference to give some more education.

418
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:03,240
You also provide breast pumps and other breastfeeding equipment to qualifying moms.

419
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:12,720
And breastfeeding moms get larger food packages than their non breastfeeding postpartum counterparts, and this is to support breastfeeding further.

420
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:16,500
You need additional calories for breastfeeding. So that helps with that.

421
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:19,650
And we also offer these food packages for an entire year.

422
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:27,480
So women who don't breastfeed are only eligible for benefits for six months following delivery versus if you were to breastfeed,

423
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:31,830
even partially, you get a full year of benefits. So that's a great incentive.

424
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:37,890
And then anyone know why we want moms to breastfeed?

425
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,540
So we probably haven't taken maternal and child nutrition yet. Okay, so I'll cut you guys some slack,

426
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:49,140
but you guys really go into this in your maternal and child nutrition course as well as if any of you take that nutrition in the lifecycle.

427
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:53,280
There's some really concrete reasons why it's better to breastfeed.

428
00:42:55,050 --> 00:43:04,280
Yeah, it confers immunity from the mother to the baby, which usually matches.

429
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:12,810
Armand Yeah, absolutely.

430
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:17,340
So that's above and beyond this list that I have here, but those are all true.

431
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:23,250
So for moms, we also have decreased risks of certain cancers of breast and ovarian specifically,

432
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:28,140
and decreased risk of type two diabetes and decreased risk for postpartum depression.

433
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:35,160
For babies, this has decreased rates of obesity, of lower respiratory infections and type two diabetes,

434
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:38,790
again, as well as asthma and decreased incidence of said.

435
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:46,650
So these are it's a really powerful substance and is doing a lot to serve the health and nutritional status of our participants here.

436
00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:54,090
So and we shared all this with mom. It's in the materials, it's in our certification appointments, it's in their appointment with the peer counselors.

437
00:43:55,210 --> 00:44:00,000
We're really trying to change the cultural norm, eating and eating practices.

438
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,090
Yes. For people who are sensitive to past, you know, racial things around it.

439
00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:09,330
And so how do you approach those kind of clients like one on one to try to be sensitive to, like,

440
00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:13,799
you know, issues they may have around that, but also there's so much important health benefits like that.

441
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:17,340
Try to help them understand, you know, the importance of it.

442
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:21,569
Yeah. So I'm obviously not directing that immediately.

443
00:44:21,570 --> 00:44:24,950
A lot of this is not on the top of their mind that they're like, This is why I'm choosing not to.

444
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:30,210
So I'm not coming at it from that angle. And a lot of it does fall in the peer counselor, which I think is better too.

445
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:36,150
These are people that look and are experiencing life in a similar way to what these moms are.

446
00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:43,770
So it's kind of that resource resource point where it's like, this person is like me and they're encouraging it for this reason.

447
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:48,630
So I think that goes above and beyond even me saying all this stuff and you just listing all the reasons why you should.

448
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:53,520
Lots of people, lots of medical professionals are telling you what you can do or what you should do.

449
00:44:53,520 --> 00:45:01,740
So that gets overwhelming. But sharing this and then giving them that contact point of someone who is in their community and is like them,

450
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:05,110
one of the big reasons why women choose not to breastfeed,

451
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:10,170
I think I mentioned to so, you know, their moms didn't breastfeed their grandparents and breastfeed their sisters,

452
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:11,340
their friends, they don't breastfeed.

453
00:45:12,090 --> 00:45:22,350
So just not having that putting kind of a pseudo familial person in there to serve as that liaison is does more help, I think.

454
00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:28,810
Okay. Last video. Promise. In an interview.

455
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:45,990
Okay. Who?

456
00:45:52,350 --> 00:46:35,140
Who? So why is this room doing this work?

457
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:38,740
And around for 50 years now I am supposed to be working, said over 40.

458
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:44,070
Officially 50 years that work has been servicing women, infants and children in the United States.

459
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:48,590
Like I said, the day to day is a lot of data collection through work.

460
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:56,760
So there's analysts reviewing this data and looking at the outcomes of of what is happening after we provide the service.

461
00:46:56,850 --> 00:47:01,110
So for children, we're seeing reduced fetal deaths and infant mortality rates,

462
00:47:01,710 --> 00:47:06,480
reduced low birth weight and preterm births, higher rates of immunizations.

463
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:10,260
So that's something that we really spend time on in our appointments.

464
00:47:10,270 --> 00:47:14,339
Every appointment we look at their immunization record or seeing where they're at with those,

465
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:17,010
if they ever see the doctor for immunizations and they're behind.

466
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:25,050
And moms really appreciate that, too, just knowing where your kids are at, but not necessarily reference every day.

467
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:28,620
So having someone doing that favor and telling you where they're at is really helpful.

468
00:47:29,610 --> 00:47:34,079
Four and five year olds who participate have better vocabularies and digital memory scores,

469
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:38,610
so it's really helping with cognition and mental development in that way.

470
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:47,850
Participants in work have lower rates of anemia, and we attribute that to the higher intake of iron mainly.

471
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:54,299
But there's other nutrients that are significantly improved in intake in our population.

472
00:47:54,300 --> 00:48:00,030
So our vitamin C, vitamin A, thiamin protein that you've seen in vitamin B6.

473
00:48:00,270 --> 00:48:07,140
So we're seeing higher rates across the board because of these food packages. So moms are eating foods that work again for women.

474
00:48:08,070 --> 00:48:10,710
Women are more likely to get adequate prenatal care.

475
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:18,210
So we have the referral system that we can get them in contact with a medicaid accepting provider for prenatal care.

476
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:24,870
It improves weight gain and dietary intake in pregnant women and also dietary intake in postpartum women.

477
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:33,660
And we see women have longer pregnancy is about a flip of this early term in preterm birth in our infants.

478
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:39,599
And then I wanted to touch just finally here on the impacts of COVID on live operations.

479
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:44,400
So social distancing impacted just about everything and Wick is no exception.

480
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:49,950
So for a lot of clinics, it affected our ability to provide benefits.

481
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:58,860
So believe it or not, there some states I think Ohio was one of the leaders on this one that was still doing paper coupons for benefits.

482
00:48:58,860 --> 00:49:02,730
So they would take their their paper to it and that's how they redeemed their benefits.

483
00:49:03,510 --> 00:49:10,979
Migrant Clinic has been working with an event card for a while, so that really just helps expedite and prevent fraud and other things from happening.

484
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:17,040
So the IBT system is the way to go. It also affected our ability to provide counseling and nutrition education.

485
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:20,730
So at some point every clinic was performing operations virtually.

486
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:30,090
My clinic is still 100% remote at this time, so we're doing our appointments over the phone and then also impacted lactation consultations.

487
00:49:30,090 --> 00:49:35,459
So that's a very hands on medical intervention.

488
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:40,050
You need to be able to look at the client, look at the baby, look at the latch, look inside the mouth.

489
00:49:40,050 --> 00:49:43,740
That's really hard to do even from a telehealth perspective.

490
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:49,470
So that was seriously impacted by COVID and strained food systems.

491
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:54,840
So increasing food prices and there were shortages that impacted our ability,

492
00:49:54,850 --> 00:49:59,460
our clients ability to obtain the food that we were giving them, at least for a short time.

493
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:02,400
And there were anticipated increases in enrollment.

494
00:50:02,730 --> 00:50:08,879
So I know I don't think that increase in enrollment ended up being as high as was initially anticipated for SNAP.

495
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:19,350
That was Snap's, I believe a 14% increase in client loads wasn't quite that large of an increase, but we did see an increase nevertheless.

496
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:27,180
So the initial response to that was the Families First Coronavirus Coronavirus Response Act that was passed by Congress,

497
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:37,710
and that included several important lift provisions. So first, it appropriated $500 million back in 2020 to support that anticipated increase.

498
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:44,040
So that helped across the board just to maintain the services that we were offering clients when we have this this burden put on us.

499
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:49,589
And it also authorizes the USDA to waive quick regulatory requirements.

500
00:50:49,590 --> 00:50:55,950
So I talked a little bit about those waivers for physical presence. So we're doing everything, telehealth, a few more of those.

501
00:50:55,950 --> 00:51:03,690
So that physical presence, one appointments completed remotely and that's also opened up the door for other telehealth avenues.

502
00:51:03,930 --> 00:51:10,440
So right now, Michigan is partnering with Tufts University on a telehealth study that they're doing.

503
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:16,019
So we're trying to get into Zoom, so providing visual telehealth to our clients.

504
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:17,790
So we'll see how that progresses.

505
00:51:17,790 --> 00:51:24,360
Maybe by the time you guys are registered dietitians, that will be kind of the norm in our practice being able to do that.

506
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:29,520
Remote issuance of benefits that kind of touch on the extended certifications was a.

507
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:33,910
One. So prior to COVID, when your certification was over,

508
00:51:33,910 --> 00:51:37,590
if you didn't come back in for a certification appointment, you weren't going to get benefits again.

509
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:46,150
So this allows us to extend certifications for an additional set amount of time so we can continue giving them benefits.

510
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:51,040
There's a lapse in benefits until we can get them in and food package substitution.

511
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:54,999
So again, this isn't as prevalent right now, but when he was limited,

512
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:59,680
when there were certain items that weren't available, we could substitute certain package items for them.

513
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:07,569
And then in case this was really boring for you and you want a quick synopsis here, I figured I'd give you some takeaways.

514
00:52:07,570 --> 00:52:15,580
So the purpose of work is to safeguard the health of women, infants and children in the United States through nutritious food and nutrition education,

515
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:20,080
as well as breastfeeding, support and health care services. So that's pretty much the essence of work.

516
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:30,250
That's what we're doing with clients must meet certain eligibility requirements on the forms of categorical residential and income realms.

517
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:36,520
To be serviced by women. Clients who are determined to be at high nutritional risk are seen by a registered dietician,

518
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:41,590
and our food packages are designed to align with those dietary guidelines for Americans

519
00:52:41,590 --> 00:52:45,250
in the Infant Feeding Practice Guidelines by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

520
00:52:45,850 --> 00:52:51,280
Any questions? Yeah.

521
00:52:51,850 --> 00:52:58,390
I'm curious to know what kind of like topics to cover through the classes and the support groups that you have.

522
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:04,030
Yeah. So for the breastfeeding ones, those ones are actually run by me. So I haven't seen that.

523
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:11,379
But what I feel good about telling you that they cover those is probably the logistics of breastfeeding.

524
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:19,720
So again, we talk about these women. I've never been exposed to breastfeeding and you know that the breast makes milk and that's what feeds the baby.

525
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:22,870
But like, what does that look like? How do you hold baby?

526
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:27,009
What happens when you know baby does this?

527
00:53:27,010 --> 00:53:30,050
What happens if my baby's not gaining weight? What do I do?

528
00:53:30,070 --> 00:53:34,899
Like, what are some problem solving things I can do? What does it look like when I go back to work?

529
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:39,600
How do I keep providing breast milk to my baby when I'm not immediately there with them anymore?

530
00:53:39,610 --> 00:53:43,929
How long do I breastfeed? So a lot of troubleshooting with that.

531
00:53:43,930 --> 00:53:46,149
And I would imagine it's a it's very client centered.

532
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:50,380
So I imagine they're, you know, bringing their own questions and concerns so they can address them in that way.

533
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:57,520
It's also helpful when you hear other people, their concerns go, Yeah, yeah, maybe I need to worry about that too.

534
00:53:57,550 --> 00:54:02,400
Maybe I need to think about that. So when this happens, I'll do that. So the community element of it is very important to.

535
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:12,280
You said that about 53% of the population that could use this program is at least 40% here in Michigan.

536
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:18,670
What's the barrier to more people using it? Yeah, so it's 40 it's 57%.

537
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:23,830
So 57% of eligible participants are actually enrolled right now.

538
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:29,060
Why are they not be the one to look into?

539
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:33,370
I'm hypothesizing here why they wanted that in.

540
00:54:33,370 --> 00:54:39,820
There's an element to well, shame is the right word, but it is, you know, a government assistance program.

541
00:54:39,830 --> 00:54:42,880
There's certain feelings about that, probably.

542
00:54:44,350 --> 00:54:49,900
I don't know. I can come up with a list for that to write that down. Is the process very complicated, like some of the other programs?

543
00:54:50,590 --> 00:54:58,300
I wouldn't say it's complicated. No, no. I mean, we when a mom comes to us, you know, says, I have a baby, I make this much amount of money.

544
00:54:58,540 --> 00:55:03,190
You know, we put them through in our system to see if they're eligible, determined to be eligible if they are.

545
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:06,549
I mean, that process takes minutes and then they're on the schedule.

546
00:55:06,550 --> 00:55:12,220
Within ten days, you may have to produce W-2s or there is some confirmation element to it.

547
00:55:12,220 --> 00:55:16,299
Yes. Yeah. But usually it's the issue is the opposite way.

548
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:23,200
So if they make too much money on them, that becomes a problem. But for clients who aren't making enough money, it's pretty straightforward with that.

549
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:28,150
But you're right. How do you look at like a single father and maybe a child?

550
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:36,760
Yes. So they can take their children to be so, you know, if mom's not present and they have a child under the age of five,

551
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:41,379
nutrition rest, they meet those eligibility requirements and they can be the authorized person on that account.

552
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:45,250
So we can service them to to get what benefits they themselves don't get with benefits.

553
00:55:46,450 --> 00:55:52,840
But we do have those scenarios as well. Did you want to share in the slides just because I wanted to kind of look through some of the numbers?

554
00:55:52,930 --> 00:55:57,170
Sure. Yeah, yeah, of course. Yeah, yeah, I think there are. Oh, they're already okay.

555
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:01,959
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. We'll get those over to you. Um, and there were two things I wanted to look.

556
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:10,300
I wanted to look into barriers to accessing with benefits and from the income level that the state uses at the state costs.

557
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:14,200
Yes, I'm going to look into those. Okay. And I'll get back with you all have Doctor Gold or something of that.

558
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:18,639
Yeah. So for like the income when you're counting, like how many people are in a family,

559
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:28,000
are you counting the baby or like like if it's still hasn't been born yet so baby doesn't count as part of the family until after they're born.

560
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,570
Okay, so, yeah, pregnant mom is a family of one. Gotcha.

561
00:56:31,690 --> 00:56:35,229
Okay. And also, don't give me too much credit.

562
00:56:35,230 --> 00:56:36,790
I'm not, like, crunching the numbers on this.

563
00:56:36,790 --> 00:56:43,990
We put it into a system, and based on all that information that they put in, it determines whether they're eligible based on their income and size.

564
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:54,750
Yeah, I might have missed this at the beginning, but I was curious how I forgot how long you've been with and then also what you're part of.

565
00:56:55,960 --> 00:57:03,100
Yeah. So I graduated from the School of Public Health in 2021 oh, 2021.

566
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:07,240
So I'm a recent grad. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

567
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:12,250
I as I said, I was thinking about this. I was I guess I was literally here three years ago.

568
00:57:12,970 --> 00:57:16,690
So apologies. You're not getting an overly experienced registered dietitian today,

569
00:57:17,860 --> 00:57:23,800
but I can't paint a good picture about what the next two years of your life looks like, if anyone's interested in that.

570
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:31,600
And so, I mean, with with I graduated from the School of Public Health Dietetic program, matriculated from that program back in February.

571
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:34,930
So I finished that on a Friday and on Monday I started with work.

572
00:57:35,710 --> 00:57:41,590
So I have been with them for over eight months now and I've been registered dietitian for six months.

573
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:53,559
So my favorite parts, I would say so about I spend three days a week doing only R&D roles, so I do those, we call them and CRB appointments.

574
00:57:53,560 --> 00:58:00,730
So it's nutrition counseling with the registered dietitian. I do those three days a week and my favorite part is probably the infants evaluation.

575
00:58:00,740 --> 00:58:04,149
So it's just I look forward to those appointments the most, you know,

576
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:07,360
finding out how babies are doing, you know, addressing issues, answering questions.

577
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:11,709
Those are the ones that are really meaningful to me. I love my job.

578
00:58:11,710 --> 00:58:18,940
I was just telling Dr. Cole I first learned about work during this presentation three years ago, so it's kind of a full circle moment for me.

579
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:22,479
I was like, I want to do that and I'm very happy to report that.

580
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:25,530
I love doing it as much as I'd hoped I would, I would.

581
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:29,080
So it's a wonderful job. I like I like what I do.

582
00:58:30,490 --> 00:58:36,790
Yeah. In regards to lactation consultant, is that a totally separate career or do registered dietitians get that certification?

583
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:45,830
They do. They do. They also asked you that question. At one point in my career, Stephanie was that guy that came in to talk about this, Sheila.

584
00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:50,230
She sent me the number and she was the boss.

585
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:51,460
Yes. Yeah.

586
00:58:51,610 --> 00:59:05,010
So, yes, there are examples of dietitians who are also ABC, CS or Voice or, you know, board certified and actually is the Academy of Nutrition by.

587
00:59:05,410 --> 00:59:18,400
Because really actually put that out. There is an area for dieticians to consider the problem and other than which,

588
00:59:18,850 --> 00:59:25,389
it's difficult for dieticians who have IPC classes to find employment in other AB,

589
00:59:25,390 --> 00:59:34,620
you know, in other work environments because oftentimes IPC classes are often nurses and so they can do both that clinical nurse and IVC.

590
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:41,649
LC But hopefully that's going to change because I mean we are seeing more of our lungs become IVC.

591
00:59:41,650 --> 00:59:48,160
LC Yeah, it's something that I'm hoping to pursue. So the first kind of step to that, so that there's a two part system to becoming an IVC.

592
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:51,969
LC You first have to complete this coursework.

593
00:59:51,970 --> 00:59:56,140
Well, first and foremost, you have to come from a medical background or complete your baseline medical classes.

594
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:59,919
So once you finish this program, you've kind of redone all that.

595
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:06,639
So one step is kind of checked off already and then you have to complete coursework and lactation and all of that.

596
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:11,320
So that's I think every time credits or something like that takes about a year to do.

597
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:15,640
And then you're considered a certified lactation specialist and then you complete

598
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:21,790
1000 hours of clinical hours doing lactation counseling and things of that nature.

599
01:00:21,790 --> 01:00:24,970
And then you're a certified lactation consultant after you set for the exam.

600
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:31,780
So it's kind of a tiered system there. And I will say I've been keeping an eye on the IBC all see job market because it is

601
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:35,889
something I'm interested in doing and you'll see if you Google any of the positions,

602
01:00:35,890 --> 01:00:39,430
a lot of them, you don't have the nursing jargon on there, so they want nurses.

603
01:00:39,430 --> 01:00:46,780
Right. And I will say I'm coming across more and more people who did the even the more what I would consider abstract approach to becoming an IBC.

604
01:00:46,780 --> 01:00:52,419
LC So they don't have any medical background. They completed, you know, a handful of community nutrition classes.

605
01:00:52,420 --> 01:00:56,140
They don't even have a bachelors degree, I don't think.

606
01:00:56,830 --> 01:01:02,950
But they do all the IBC LC requirements to complete those and are IBC classes and I've seen them work in hospitals, which is so surprising to me.

607
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:11,979
So in addition to your specific lactation consultant, but not coming from an alternate career path, so it's very diverse.

608
01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:16,719
I think there's people coming from a lot of different avenues doing that now and hopefully that reflects and you know,

609
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:21,520
who people are willing to help to employ. I think Henry Ford has it in their listing.

610
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:26,089
They they're the only one I've seen in the state that have registered dietitian in their job postings.

611
01:01:26,090 --> 01:01:32,290
So most of them, it's just nurses. But they outline specifically that registered dietitian applicants are welcome.

612
01:01:32,830 --> 01:01:40,240
I think we're going to see more and more of a shift. And I'm seeing more and more alums that are are these that are interested in becoming I,

613
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:49,990
I think the reason why is think that the connection between nursing and ivy schools is because it requires 1000 hours of clinical which nurses,

614
01:01:50,230 --> 01:01:54,790
especially if they're working in OB-GYN. Right. Have that clinical facility.

615
01:01:55,180 --> 01:01:58,670
So but I think it's I think it's shifting. Yeah.

616
01:01:58,990 --> 01:02:03,370
Oh yeah. Yeah. Because it is it's a good knowledge base to have as a registered dietitian.

617
01:02:03,370 --> 01:02:08,379
If you're in pediatrics, that's a very valuable knowledge base to have in your article.

618
01:02:08,380 --> 01:02:11,860
So yeah, she makes this. Oh, yes.

619
01:02:11,860 --> 01:02:16,599
Oh, did you do your public health internship that way? Actually, yes.

620
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:19,870
So we did rotations. So that's how I how I got the gig.

621
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:24,520
I was actually set up to go down to Florida to be a dietitian. I was all ready to accept my offer.

622
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:28,450
And then Detroit went poached me. So that's how I ended up there.

623
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:32,530
But I had known that from my internship, so I did a rotation with them virtually.

624
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:37,750
And I remember telling her at the end of my rotations like, Yeah, how many jobs come off when you call?

625
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:44,050
And it was right time, right moment. So I'm where I'm supposed to be. I guess so, yeah.

626
01:02:44,350 --> 01:02:56,380
Any other questions? As a quick question, how are assessments handled like assessing for anemia, you know, when we're doing telemedicine?

627
01:02:56,500 --> 01:03:02,319
So we were relying more heavily on pediatric visits and we ever have before.

628
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:05,500
So we're not doing lab tests right now. We're not doing any of that in-person stuff.

629
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:07,660
We're not even taking measurements a lot of the times.

630
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:13,660
And we have to be very specific with how we document anthropometric and through metrics from the pediatrician.

631
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:19,150
And that's all due to the waiver. So we have lots of waivers basically excusing that element of the appointment.

632
01:03:20,050 --> 01:03:24,430
So. So then you're relying on that being assessed by the pediatric.

633
01:03:24,430 --> 01:03:29,709
Yes, yes. And we're waiting it if it's not able to be provided. So they sharing that information, they do.

634
01:03:29,710 --> 01:03:34,450
A lot of the times they do. We are able to pull in blood tests from the state.

635
01:03:34,450 --> 01:03:38,229
So that's helpful, not have to do any of that in-house right now.

636
01:03:38,230 --> 01:03:42,430
And then the hemoglobin, I assume. Yeah, you can't. We're not doing it right now.

637
01:03:42,430 --> 01:03:46,490
Oh no. But you allowed to get that from the pediatrician to that.

638
01:03:46,510 --> 01:03:53,799
Yeah. Yeah. It's basically like a word of mouth thing right now. So it'll be interesting to see in the next year how things change because I think

639
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:57,700
there's going to be some movements to go back to normal starting in January.

640
01:03:57,700 --> 01:04:01,330
So we're going to start seeing clients in person again. Yes.

641
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:04,930
I mean, you mentioned love and being a big concern.

642
01:04:04,940 --> 01:04:08,650
And even studies have recently come out saying microplastics.

643
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:15,500
I mean, what would you do, you know, with this considering or educational matter?

644
01:04:15,770 --> 01:04:20,480
Any studies looking into that? Well, it's a very interesting, interesting topic, too.

645
01:04:20,750 --> 01:04:29,420
So specifically where I work, probably Detroit is notable for having just high net exposures in their homes that are felt a lot tend to between homes.

646
01:04:30,020 --> 01:04:34,700
So my population is a really high concern to clients all the time with really high blood scores.

647
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:39,210
And that's a huge problem in terms of it being, you know,

648
01:04:39,260 --> 01:04:44,899
kind of a superior concern on the agenda to lead, I don't know, maybe in the next decade or so.

649
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:48,500
But right now that is so a big thing.

650
01:04:48,950 --> 01:04:58,550
So. Are you working from home or are you like in an office?

651
01:04:58,580 --> 01:05:04,850
Yeah, it's kind of been a gradual return to office. I am in office full time now for probably close to a year.

652
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:07,340
It was all virtual and then they were doing partial.

653
01:05:07,370 --> 01:05:13,490
So we were going into office two days a week, then three days a week and that work full time back in the office south.

654
01:05:14,180 --> 01:05:18,350
There's good and bad parts to all of that. It's nice to to work in your days for sure.

655
01:05:19,190 --> 01:05:21,499
But once we get back to in-person activities,

656
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:30,240
the nature of of a weekday edition is very hands on meeting with the taking of anthropometric with laptops and things of that nature.

657
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:44,540
It's, it's in-person. So then I don't have any opportunities to get involved for getting that are you are not necessarily getting your masters.

658
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:49,099
So in terms of like summer internships or like oh yeah, engagement opportunities.

659
01:05:49,100 --> 01:05:56,509
Oh yeah, absolutely. So we definitely work with the Dietetic Internship, so we do that actively with you on that actually.

660
01:05:56,510 --> 01:06:05,540
So you might see me in a few years, but and I know we do do summer internships as well and there's other with clinics.

661
01:06:05,540 --> 01:06:09,040
And you remember Aria Grabowski, she's a Ph.Ds.

662
01:06:09,050 --> 01:06:11,720
No, I know she but I did she do her. She did hers at work.

663
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:24,889
So they're so in the past, it was hard for students who were interested in maternal and child nutrition to find summer internships with local weight.

664
01:06:24,890 --> 01:06:31,969
Clinics like the one in Washington tends to be fairly overwhelmed with dietetic interns that they in historically,

665
01:06:31,970 --> 01:06:37,970
in the past, they have never been able to take summer interns, you know, three mph.

666
01:06:38,690 --> 01:06:43,819
That being said, there may be some changes and you should definitely reach out.

667
01:06:43,820 --> 01:06:55,549
I always counseled my advisees or anybody who asked me to look for health departments in other counties who would say, Yeah, that's I think.

668
01:06:55,550 --> 01:06:58,640
What are you doing it? Yeah. She looked elsewhere.

669
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:07,340
Yeah, I wouldn't if anyone's interested in that though. I'm not open to getting connected on that.

670
01:07:07,340 --> 01:07:12,110
I have a supervisor who's very shall use the intern element to the two hour thing.

671
01:07:12,110 --> 01:07:19,220
So I think some might be willing more so than definitely Washtenaw County, because Washtenaw County is inundated with med students as well.

672
01:07:19,370 --> 01:07:22,560
So they're dealing with the dietetic students and med students. They just don't have time.

673
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:29,600
But yeah, if you're interested, we can we can talk about it like can you pass that along and see if that's an option?

674
01:07:29,870 --> 01:07:37,699
And we've had students reach out to Genesee County and have that student passed through their summer internship.

675
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:45,079
They don't have a formalized internship program, but they had projects that they needed students or a student to help with.

676
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:49,700
And that's the best way to approach, is not to email and say, do you have a summer internship?

677
01:07:49,700 --> 01:07:53,540
Instead, you have nutrition projects that you would like someone to work on.

678
01:07:54,410 --> 01:08:01,340
That's a nice way to open the door a little bit. And then, Stephanie, obviously it's going to be an opportunity.

679
01:08:03,170 --> 01:08:11,490
Stephanie, thank you so much for that. I'm. Yeah.

680
01:08:13,470 --> 01:08:17,000
I mean, I don't like it where you can count up to one.

681
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:21,990
I sure. Yeah. So I have one of these for everybody. Oh, okay.

682
01:08:22,130 --> 01:08:28,140
Yeah. So this is similar to the one that's actually on the website.

683
01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:33,980
I think they have the fact. I'm sure it does. But anyway, let's hand out those and everyone.

684
01:08:33,980 --> 01:08:44,300
Now look at. Oh, yeah, okay. No, I left. Okay. So does anyone is really interested and thinks they might like to do work materials down here.

685
01:08:44,310 --> 01:08:49,379
This one, everybody help yourself to create limited supply here.

686
01:08:49,380 --> 01:08:55,140
So this would be a few ah you know in the back nine going I want to be a night vision.

687
01:08:55,770 --> 01:09:01,590
Help yourself. And actually I might just keep one so I can copy it.

688
01:09:02,130 --> 01:09:05,520
Other students had otherwise.

689
01:09:06,570 --> 01:09:11,670
Just very quickly extended your break.

690
01:09:12,380 --> 01:09:21,120
A very long break, but never break. Did you always feel like that for the fall break was sort of like I never had a fall break in sixth grade, though.

691
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:30,720
So it was it was nice to have two days off. So really, we know I just had a question about those submitting the data for like feedback.

692
01:09:30,950 --> 01:09:35,760
Yeah. I want us to just email it to us or you know, I'm going to create that's on my to do list today.

693
01:09:36,030 --> 01:09:43,769
I'm going to create a canvas where you can upload it and it will just be you're not going to get a green for it, but you'll just be able to upload it.

694
01:09:43,770 --> 01:09:50,129
And I need to do in a way that you can get comments found out if you don't have a grade and you can't see your comment.

695
01:09:50,130 --> 01:09:53,490
So I might just do I'll see how it works out.

696
01:09:54,480 --> 01:10:00,270
Liz might have to just put a zero in the grade or something just so that you can see all the comments.

697
01:10:00,270 --> 01:10:08,670
But yes, it'll be an upload and I'll get that done today. So, um, so Monday no class and then Wednesday.

698
01:10:08,700 --> 01:10:12,930
Mark Miller from Sydney, others is going to be here.

699
01:10:13,230 --> 01:10:19,080
And so Stephanie, we have on Monday we were talking about food nutrition services.

700
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:23,280
Today you learned about Wick, which is one of their key programs.

701
01:10:23,730 --> 01:10:25,770
Markelle will be here on Wednesday.

702
01:10:26,070 --> 01:10:33,959
And again, for those of you that have questions about some of those food distribution packages or packages for programs like the commodity,

703
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:39,570
I can't even remember how commodity supplemental something or T fat market is

704
01:10:39,570 --> 01:10:48,090
going to be a great resource to ask questions about the programs between programs.

705
01:10:48,330 --> 01:10:50,490
So everybody have a great rest of the week.

706
01:10:50,640 --> 01:11:01,080
A reminder that again, you can submit a rough draft of your U.S. Census Bureau section of your community nutrition assessment.

707
01:11:01,350 --> 01:11:04,860
Stephanie didn't have that option when she was taking the class,

708
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:11,549
but you have that option to submit for feedback from Liz and myself, and that would be on Friday.

709
01:11:11,550 --> 01:11:16,260
And I will have an attendance, you know, a place for you to upload.

710
01:11:16,260 --> 01:11:19,660
It'll be an assignment, but it should be pretty awesome.

711
01:11:19,690 --> 01:11:24,270
So within three rest of the week, have a wonderful break and I will see you all on Wednesday.

712
01:11:30,270 --> 01:11:34,990
Nicole Kelly, so funny.
