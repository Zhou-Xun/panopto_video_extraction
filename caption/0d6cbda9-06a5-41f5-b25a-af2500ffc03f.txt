1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:25,960
You know, mean the way we do things from the computer, but we put on quite a few.

2
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,610
I don't know. I haven't had the opportunity to open.

3
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:47,450
Yes. By switching to a computer that could help in the future.

4
00:00:51,380 --> 00:01:01,730
Okay, cool. All right. So we'll we'll finish up sort of our discussion of the material mediation analysis.

5
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:07,340
Well, the sort of introduction to mediation helps us, I guess, today.

6
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:14,929
But before we do that, I wanted to give people the opportunity to kind of maybe come in with some examples of of instrumental variables.

7
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:18,910
Again, no pressure and almost spend the whole day on it.

8
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,340
So kind of make your descriptions reasonably short.

9
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:27,740
But if you have a example you want to talk about, I think it's a it's a nice little exercise,

10
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:32,000
which is sort of get your thinking about take a lot of the issues that this class is about.

11
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,600
And I think we had fun with it when I did this the first time I took the class.

12
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,680
So volunteers did.

13
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:47,510
Right. Go ahead. You know, I looked at several literature and I found one kind of interesting that basically

14
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:54,950
talks about mortality and medical costs for were caused by air pollution.

15
00:01:55,430 --> 00:02:00,590
So the instrumental variable that they used was basically their every direction.

16
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:11,989
That was really kind of nice because that way the wind direction is not necessarily related to the outcome, which is mortality or cost,

17
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:20,600
but it has to it has to like an effect on the Medicare costs through which has a through air pollution,

18
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,790
which is of the treatment or somehow exposure information.

19
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:28,820
And I feel like it is a good example to illustrate.

20
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,549
Yeah. So it's like prevailing winds.

21
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:38,060
So there's sort of there's a tendency for so that basically that like the direction of the wind is like the velocity.

22
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:41,600
Okay, cool. Very nice.

23
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,540
Yeah. So the, the butter example kind of.

24
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:59,790
But I was just thinking about, you know, like, for instance, like demand for like real wasabi, not like horseradish in the U.S. And,

25
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:04,820
you know, the kind of instrumental variable would be, you know, like growing conditions like in Japan.

26
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:13,740
Okay. Yeah. Could be very similar to the very, you know, rain, rainfall example and rainfall or, you know, just kind of a river where, yeah.

27
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:18,640
It you think might not affect the sort of ongoing demand for that in any fashion.

28
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:25,520
I mean, I was I found an example of, like, cognitive skills on wages.

29
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:32,420
Mm hmm. And then the instrument that they used there was minimum school leaving age, which is the, you know, statewide policy.

30
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:37,840
Mm hmm. And so you have to be in school for a certain number of years, but you test out of school,

31
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:42,979
school early, or you can, like, have other reasons to, like, go to work.

32
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:52,940
But generally it's like 14 to 19. And so minimum school leaving age shouldn't be dependent on like a person's specific wages,

33
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:56,990
but we would hope that it would be related to your computer skills. Okay.

34
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:04,690
So so there's there also has to be variability in the in the living age.

35
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:10,750
So they're looking over at you like a geographic area. There are different have differences of opinion the whole of the US.

36
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:14,330
Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

37
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:20,000
That's an that's actually a subtle point. You're you're you're instrumental variable has to vary.

38
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:26,990
Right. If it's kind of funny and there may not be much variability in that, which is another which is another issue sometimes that crops up.

39
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,450
I, I'm not quite sure if it's right or not.

40
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:36,860
So basically over the summer I actually did for analysis where so a read it you have a bunch of like different subreddits

41
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:43,970
they're looking at and we were trying to look at those other activity so measured by the so daily active users.

42
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:52,579
Okay. We want to see how would the proportion of an acceptable user burn kind of affect that kind of like overall your EU but of W is actually

43
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:58,790
not really well labeled because there are people legitimate mods and depending on the country or depending on what they wanted to see.

44
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:05,810
So what we ended up using was actually using ad status. So for in a sort of you rub it subreddits, we don't put ads on them.

45
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:12,410
So kind of using, but that doesn't like ads that us doesn't actually have or doesn't explain the EU.

46
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:20,330
So we kind of use that as a okay. So you're trying to extend have this not suitable for what tag effects use, right.

47
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:27,800
And so the ads status attached to a given given subreddit is will be in the moving too.

48
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:37,100
So yeah. So I actually saw the item and I mean so basically property.

49
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:41,199
Blacklisted for ads. So that's going to be pretty, pretty correlated.

50
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:45,300
But it's, you know, pretty good. Technically, they don't explain right.

51
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:50,709
Right. As much as they can. So. Okay. It's it gets murky, as complex as in and out.

52
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:53,880
But I think that yeah, it makes sense to me. Yeah. Interesting idea.

53
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:57,730
So there the issue might be it's really this sort of in effect the sort of

54
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:03,549
randomization flavor of the it may not it may not really be an associated with,

55
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:10,600
you know, the reason why I thought it might not be quite correct because like if you look at the labels itself, which is like theoretically.

56
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:16,450
You're right. Um, the problem with that is actually just that we're unsure of this.

57
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:21,939
Actually, it's really hard to measure that because like there, there are a lot of people that just didn't exist.

58
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:30,070
We should have. So that's kind of why I was thinking about using ad status as a proxy or like a instrumental variable.

59
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:35,470
Okay, interesting. I'm sorry you don't have your card, so.

60
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:39,250
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay. Okay.

61
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,759
Uh, so in the marketing literature,

62
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:52,030
there is the research question about whether the drug or whether images are more likely to be liked and shared than without the images.

63
00:06:52,540 --> 00:07:02,290
And so the instrumental variable used was in the Twitter bio of the person posting the tweet Are they a self-professed photography lover?

64
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:08,710
And to the number of Twitter posts where the images that they have posted in the past.

65
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:18,070
So how many Twitter images they've posted in the past will only affect whether or not it was a Twitter post with an image right now,

66
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:23,830
but it won't affect the likes and shares of that Twitter post directly.

67
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,940
Okay. Okay. All right. You know, seems like a quite plausible instrument.

68
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:34,540
Cool greenhouse accounting research.

69
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:41,770
There is more interest to explore the association between the class size and the student grades.

70
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:50,049
So the exploration in that class size and the outcome is the student performance on their test and the instrument,

71
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:55,990
whether they found it happened, whether the score has a limit for the score, for the class size.

72
00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:00,310
So if they so, um, if the,

73
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:11,230
if the instrument are both of course through on and to score has anything for the score say so they likely will have lower scores in those scores.

74
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:21,310
But it's unlikely that whether a score has a limit for the class would have direct association with the students grades on their exam.

75
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:29,830
Okay, so sorry, he's got an ulcer. So the the outcome is the grade on the exam and the exposure is the class size.

76
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:35,280
Yeah. And what was the instrumental value? The score has a limit on the class.

77
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:41,470
Okay. So that would obviously affect class size, but you might not affect think that has any association with that.

78
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,069
Yeah, that's cool.

79
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:52,000
That's a very nice one for me and Abby, I wanted to mention your your your cut off for dates is going to be associated with an example.

80
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,270
We're going to look at something that was in the already. Yeah, go ahead.

81
00:08:55,750 --> 00:09:03,819
So I have an example for those trying to come back to the treatment that whether they receive some drug

82
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:10,000
before the transparent and the response is whether that will affect the survival time of the patient.

83
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:15,489
And the instrumental variable is that whether the drug has been approved by

84
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:22,470
FDA basically because it has been approved that the treatment like the hub,

85
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:26,020
the more people would have received the treatment.

86
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:32,500
However, that wouldn't affect directly that whether these kind of patients would survive or not.

87
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:42,400
Okay. So that's a little bit that has a lot of flavor of the kind of thing we're doing with the with the compliance.

88
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:57,490
Right. You sort of, you know, the. In some sense, you can sort of view the if you view the the drug as is is kind of it.

89
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,550
Well, you're looking over a variety of drugs, just a single drug.

90
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:05,920
So when you said that the the instrumental variable is whether or not it's been approved.

91
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:14,170
Yes. So you're looking. But that would be like it's either yes or no for every every violent rifle.

92
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:19,780
So. Or is it just a single drug you're looking at or is it a whole class of drugs, just that single drug.

93
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:23,200
Okay. To have it be approved like before it has been approved.

94
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:26,620
Okay. So you're actually looking at time. Yeah. Okay.

95
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:31,219
So this is so this is this is more so. So you have this this is the outcome.

96
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:37,760
And so issue the drug. So you have the outcome before approval and then the outcome after approval.

97
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:41,420
Right. So yeah. So it has a kind of a flavor of increase.

98
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:46,450
Well, something like that. Would you be worried about like changes in standard of care over time?

99
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:51,879
Because if we're looking at time changing and like all the like at the beginning,

100
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:57,190
just when this drug is getting used at first, maybe surgical techniques are going bad.

101
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:02,770
And over time we increase those surgical techniques and then over time the drug gets approved.

102
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:12,000
And so maybe like there's some type of like core evolution beginning with time and survival rates that is like,

103
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:17,890
yeah, but the assumption here is that they're using exactly the same drugs and speaking square the same way.

104
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:23,139
But yeah, this is always an issue with but that's one advantage of is that these sort of time events and

105
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:27,969
so changes in laws and all these kind of changes that occur over time are really often used as,

106
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:33,420
as potential instrument variables. But the big issue is all those are exactly that you have may have for so-called

107
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:38,650
these secular changes over time that are now hopelessly confounded with the,

108
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,690
um, with the, with the external variable itself.

109
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:48,970
So no longer, you no longer get that randomization flavor that you'd like.

110
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:52,990
But, but yeah, it's, you know, often maybe not too terrible an assumption.

111
00:11:54,120 --> 00:12:06,969
So I so one example of my point is to do something once to analyze the effect of college attainment on civic participation and how

112
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:13,240
they do it is they actually use the distance and the closest distance from a person to a college as an instrument of variable.

113
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:21,460
And the idea is holding everything the same. If the distance is closer to people, they're more likely it is due to the.

114
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,120
Yeah. Economic consideration of the business class. Yes.

115
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:32,340
And but I think the study was critical and one of the critique is is the second assumption of X

116
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:39,360
this the happiness association through and once again it is so many more civic minded people,

117
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:46,000
they tend to live in an area of great universities and how they handle this is they add more,

118
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:53,350
more variables, more background variables, race, ethnicity, gender and everything.

119
00:12:53,350 --> 00:13:01,360
And right at the end they do that, then they make it work just without adding all these these variables.

120
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,750
It may not work. Right. Yeah. So yeah.

121
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:10,389
So that's actually a really good point too. So certainly we've talked a lot about this in this most recent work with with mediation.

122
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:15,340
Right. That's sort of generally how to use X to discover is to kind of enforce these assumptions.

123
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:19,270
And you can sort of do the same thing in this real variable approach, right?

124
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:24,219
You can you can try to adjust the way you're stratified based on covariates and hope that

125
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:28,360
within those things you're basically now it's it's essentially random where you're living.

126
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:32,500
But it also more generally is just as things are often also sometimes used.

127
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:39,730
A really famous example in my mind because it was an example I worked with carefully when I was first trying to learn this material,

128
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:53,350
was looking at the effect of clean needle programs on HIV transmission, and they used vans that were distributing these around the city of Baltimore.

129
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:58,510
And so the nice thing about that was the vans actually kind of drove around.

130
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:03,970
So it was kind of a a random flavor to where they were. So where they were sort of dropped in Baltimore.

131
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:09,250
So you kind of get away from the concerns you had. They're all hot spots that were never entirely eliminated.

132
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:16,479
But yeah, so distance in this case, distance to the very end was sort of a measure of how likely people were to it to take the needle.

133
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:25,260
So of course, I pulled the old one and I'm sorry, I'm really bad with names, so.

134
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:32,320
Oh, I'm Alex. Alex, yes. Well, the old one from a 1996 economics paper.

135
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:35,910
Okay, but it seems pretty canonical French about variables.

136
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:43,480
It's studying the relationship between having children and like employment outcomes.

137
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:51,640
Okay. And so. Is the effect of of of having a child on your employment status, correct?

138
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:59,920
Yeah. And so they it very clear that it was for people that had two children.

139
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:04,570
Whether or not those two children were of the same sex or not.

140
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:13,540
Oh. And so the idea is people that I think it's well-studied that if you have two children of the same sex,

141
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:28,900
you're more likely to want to have a third child. And that that's what they claim, whether that's what they're using as social 1996.

142
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:37,270
So yeah, I guess that's the usual issue of variables like back to the first question.

143
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:43,300
So. Okay. So basically so.

144
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:47,730
So the the the sort of exposure measure is, is how many children you have.

145
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,390
It's sort of a continuum, sort of. Right. So you're like three versus two.

146
00:15:52,590 --> 00:16:00,130
Okay. You know, if is the next National Bureau of Economic Research.

147
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,809
Yeah. So, I mean, presumably you can look at data and confirm this, right.

148
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:08,020
So that's that's the first issue. Is there is this a kind of association?

149
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,790
So are there more among three children, family?

150
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:17,950
Are there more patterns of two children being the same sex?

151
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:23,010
The first two children be the same sex than you would expect by chance. So presumably they did that.

152
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:29,950
I hope I'm just making that assumption. Well, yeah, I think they they say and even earlier work.

153
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:33,280
Okay. Yeah, but.

154
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,980
Yeah, interesting. No, that's. That's cool. Interesting.

155
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:40,690
And of course, things, particularly when coming to human behavior, behavior changes over time.

156
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:45,639
So things that might have worked as instruments, you know, maybe certain of years ago may not now and vice versa.

157
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,730
I'm also curious about this paper. Did they adjust for gender?

158
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:53,740
Because I think there's a difference in sign of effect for women and or men.

159
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:59,080
Could be, especially in the nineties and earlier. Yeah, that's a good point.

160
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:03,490
I think they did like analysis for like, uh, I see.

161
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:10,660
And this is only on the female leadership side. So yeah, but,

162
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:17,170
but I think it's more about due to girls more likely to lead somebody to try and have a boy or two boys more likely to lead to somebody have a girl.

163
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:25,540
So yeah, that's or to have a another the third child and presumably the idea of giving them both sexes.

164
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:34,570
So I don't know. Go ahead. Um, so the so I'm thinking with one example, but I'm not, I'm not sure if that's a good one.

165
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:43,360
So the outcome could be the kids having lung cancer and then the treatment could be that whether the dad is a smoker.

166
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:53,620
Mhm. So, so we're interested to see if the second hand smoking is having an issue like oh of having lung cancer,

167
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:58,600
but there's like a, like another kind of company rule that is that.

168
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:08,150
So if the dad is a smoker then the smoking this habit could also affect that the that the kid is more likely to be a like.

169
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:16,209
So the instrumental variable could be that the that's the pressure kind of like that.

170
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:24,040
So if because research has shown that if the more pressure that that is having, the more likely that the dad is smoking.

171
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:32,480
Okay. So so this like working pressure, the dad's working pleasure is all the kids get lung cancer, presumably, but yeah.

172
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:35,640
So that's related to this. Okay. Yeah.

173
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:41,230
And there I think it might be at the strength of the instrument might be important and not have that much impact on smoking behavior.

174
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:52,059
So, um, if you were sort of looking at your speed while ice skating, for example, and if that was associated with your speed while running,

175
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:59,200
just like, oh my, oh, your ah instrumental variable could possibly be like how cold your global climate is.

176
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:05,250
Um. So, um.

177
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:10,860
So you're sort of looking at that, although that may be more associative, I guess,

178
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:17,850
in the sense of probably having a common confounder of like body strength or, you know, that kind of thing.

179
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:24,690
But if you were thinking about your running speed as an exposure, that would affect your skiing speed.

180
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:30,770
And I guess the issue there would be the coldness of the climate.

181
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,670
How would that be related to your running speed?

182
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:40,110
I was actually thinking of sort of the other way around where okay, like like I feel like places with colder climates.

183
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:45,360
Okay. More prevalence of like ice. Okay. So you might be a better ice skater as a result of cold conditions.

184
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,680
Have anything to do with how fast you run? Okay. Um.

185
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:53,640
Okay. But again, how would. How fast you run be affected by the cold?

186
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:59,280
There has to be that association between X and z.

187
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:04,530
Right. Um, I was envisioning ice skating speed as the x.

188
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,290
Okay, so what what's the outcome of the running speed?

189
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:15,540
Running speed? Okay, so running speed is the outcome.

190
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:20,160
And what's the exposure of ice skating speed?

191
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,800
Okay, so. Okay, so I guess I flip that around before.

192
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:39,450
So, um, so you would try to use the coldness of the climate, which affects your sort of ability to ice skate and to think that one over a little bit.

193
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:47,780
So. Yeah.

194
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,929
That's an interesting idea. Yeah, my work and my work.

195
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:57,409
I mean, I guess you've sort of think of the potential confounders sort of you sort of return it, you know, but again, more of a mediator.

196
00:20:57,410 --> 00:21:00,530
Maybe you're these these sort of strengths and so forth.

197
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:07,130
So I just sort of think what the confounding does there between between those, whether they're really confounders or mediators.

198
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:13,770
But yeah, I think that could be that could work. Um, sorry, no.

199
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:27,320
Um, so exposure is the quality and, and Alzheimer disease and it seems to be the room temperature when people sleep.

200
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:38,180
Okay. So this is quality. There's some evidence, there's stuff in the paper I've seen about sleep quality possibly,

201
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:42,230
and I'm not sure if it's which way that it could plausibly or does. They're right.

202
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:51,050
Is it is poor sleeping a predictor of onset of Alzheimer's or is poor sleep being leading to Alzheimer's?

203
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:58,640
So you're going to assume the latter, right? There's something about poor sleep over time that sort of leads to potential cognitive deterioration.

204
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:09,200
And so and so the room temperature, which presumably is not associated with your cognitive decline except maybe through the sleep.

205
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,530
So, yeah, it's good. Very good. I'm sorry.

206
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:22,260
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm not trying to estimate the difference between kitchen hospital and.

207
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:28,160
And it's also use distance as an instrument of arrival.

208
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:45,140
Um, the calories in the food like, uh, gender and uh, the distance is Euclidean distance between a specific patient and a teaching hospital.

209
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:49,730
So there are multiple hospitals, your teaching.

210
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:54,709
And so I think to some extent, yes.

211
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:58,440
Relative to. Mike.

212
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:04,720
Hello? Hmm. It's not really a very, uh.

213
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:11,920
Uh, it's not the end of the spectrum.

214
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,090
Mm hmm. Yeah. So those are always a little that that's.

215
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:20,780
That's very scary. A little bit. And maybe you look at stuff like difference in distances between the hospitals.

216
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,250
Right. So we're just the just the right distance.

217
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:35,890
But, um, but it it's, it's and so again, it may be that that sort of low income areas tend to have fewer teaching hospitals or vice versa.

218
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:37,900
Actually, it could be a masking thing.

219
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:55,560
Um, and so you just using the, the distance by itself might not be, you might still have some correlation there between the outcome and that.

220
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:00,920
So adjusting for this coverage is an attempt to get around that I think on a continuous.

221
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:20,390
Right. So there's there was a study that was interested in whether smoking during pregnancy affects birth weight.

222
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:33,560
Mm hmm. I found two possible instrumental variables, and the first one could be the binary indicator of randomized encouragement to stop smoking.

223
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:38,140
The second one is the states like Ohio and Texas.

224
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:43,460
Guess both. Both of them are included in poverty in the form of smoking.

225
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:47,880
Mm hmm. That's right. That related to Berkeley?

226
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,240
Yeah. Right. So I think so.

227
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:56,720
The first one is, is it just a great it's rank as a threatened position if it if it actually causes people to change their smoking behavior.

228
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:03,440
And then the second one can be good, although if be a little careful, because sometimes there may be some fundamental.

229
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:11,260
And so it depends on the reason you're looking at. But there are some potential issues about who has what.

230
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:14,920
States have high and which states have lower taxes which may be associated.

231
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:24,390
The states that may be associated with sort of health outcomes independent of the tax itself, because they're,

232
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:29,079
you know, maybe high poverty states tend to have lower cigaret taxes and those kinds of things.

233
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:35,500
So. Right? Yeah.

234
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:43,790
Yeah. You know, you've been. Yeah. I think my example might be a little different, I'm sure.

235
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:54,189
So I found a study that looked at what your children's schooling can have effect on old age memory among the elderly in the United States.

236
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:57,350
And that actually loses interest. Mm hmm. Mm hmm.

237
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:06,460
And the outcome is the performance in the workplace, the recall test, and the years of schooling.

238
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:16,990
And the instrumental variable here is the changes in compulsory schooling laws of the state, place of the state that participants were in.

239
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:25,750
Right. So basically it predicts the changes in average years of schooling completed by those affected by the state law.

240
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:36,280
And that part of educational difference in Britain in the in the individual characteristics like IQ or like personality.

241
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:44,800
Yeah. So yeah. So potentially those same strengths and weaknesses as it's like the cigaret tax.

242
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:47,500
Exactly. Yeah. Cool. Okay.

243
00:26:48,500 --> 00:27:04,600
Um, if your property has associated with a fairly first wave of interest and, um, moderate to her following her in the face.

244
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:08,660
Mm hmm. Low birth weight. Mm hmm. So.

245
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:12,520
And, uh, instrumental variable is here is the the price.

246
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,260
So it's strong. The price is strongly related to Breaking Bad.

247
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:19,390
And so. Yeah.

248
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:24,070
Yeah. Yeah. So another sort of fit in that same class.

249
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:27,910
Yeah. Cool. And again, all the strength, the weaknesses associated with that approach.

250
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:32,820
So, yeah, I pulled the old, old study published in 1990.

251
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:42,210
So the cell uniquely designed the relationship between whether you participate in the B amenable or with the postwar ladies.

252
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:48,620
Um, so we are interested in whether you are, or whether you participate in the wars.

253
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:58,240
Um, but the fact that the military service during the Vietnamese war was partially determined by equality

254
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:06,730
and basically they just showed you some random sequence number of between one and six and died of.

255
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:19,900
And those numbers were randomly assigned to people and people with smaller numbers will have priority for for being chosen.

256
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:29,890
So in this research, they basically used the lottery number as instrumental variable in user y.

257
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:39,880
And every time the fraction of, uh, like how many people served in this population.

258
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:44,350
Mm hmm. Um, and multiply them together as a group.

259
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,610
Okay. Yeah, that's cool. That's the example. It's more detailed.

260
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:55,510
You probably track on the paper that I mentioned sort of briefly in the earlier on as a as a as a beginning example of a kind of instrument.

261
00:28:56,150 --> 00:29:00,250
So, yeah, that's a very, very famous and good example.

262
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:05,950
So. Okay. All right.

263
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:12,340
And no one else is one of the more controversial ones I found was, uh, research,

264
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:19,060
national research output in the Americas based on, you know, a number of institutions.

265
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:26,950
Okay. For example, the instrumental variable was European mortality rate during formula of the stuff that was.

266
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:36,270
Okay. So you're looking at this is looking at North and South America and looking at their each nation as is is

267
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:42,700
sort of the unit here unit and the outcome is sort of research papers published per capita or something.

268
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:47,050
Yeah. Like, you know, like research paper papers published per capita.

269
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:51,220
Yeah. Right. And so. So what's the exposure?

270
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:55,120
So the exposure is number of institutions.

271
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:04,000
Okay. So do more institutions cause you to produce more papers per capita?

272
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:11,800
Yeah. So it was a little murky is basically it says like, you know, I think it's actually research output per institution.

273
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:15,650
Okay. And so like drawing some sort of point.

274
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:21,160
I see. Yeah. So you if you have more institutions, do you just get are they more productive?

275
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:29,550
Yeah. Right. Are they more productive? Right. You know. Yeah. The implied, in fact, is that age and institution somehow is connected to.

276
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:33,340
Okay. And so and so.

277
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:36,969
Okay. So you would look back to, quote, colonial well. Of colonial times.

278
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:40,300
And that would be. So those are those are.

279
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:46,090
So how many of these institutions were founded pre-independence?

280
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:51,670
Yeah, it's pretty much okay. You know, like how many of these occupations were set up in, you know?

281
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:57,099
Yeah. Right. So, I mean, so America's pretty the Americas are pretty diverse in that.

282
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:05,650
Right? So, I mean, I know the United States accounts in there, but obviously, I guess probably the first independent nation here.

283
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:14,170
But then pretty much all of South America became independent about the same time 20 years later or 20 years later.

284
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:22,719
And then you have little some of the smaller, you know, become very worrisome, like Barbados, I think was in the sixties and and so forth.

285
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:28,690
So. So there's there's a lot of a lot of confounders there in terms of time.

286
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:40,000
Right. I just I just think. Yeah. Know worthy of discussion. Yeah. So and so it's presumably well, sort of so it would be somehow independent of.

287
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:48,360
Research output. That sort of. When the institutions became.

288
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:54,209
Yeah. I mean if you think of age. Yeah.

289
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:57,330
I don't know, I'm not quite sure why that seems like it could be really tied to.

290
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:10,560
So the reputation component might feel right that there would be this correlation between the way we are being indoctrinated,

291
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:14,230
if I want to go after that. Yeah. Yeah. So. Yeah.

292
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:19,830
Okay. So cool. Well, I hope that was okay.

293
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:27,640
I'm sorry. But in my research, we are interested and I'm using, like, data, actually, from you about this.

294
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:32,960
The Machine Genomics Initiative. Mm hmm. And we're interested.

295
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:38,820
So look at how demographic variables affect their enrollment into their study.

296
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:49,020
Okay. Because we ideally would like to have, like, anyone from, like, maybe all ages or all races to be involved in further studies.

297
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:49,500
Mm hmm.

298
00:32:49,890 --> 00:33:01,710
And the thing is, um, they're most of the people that they pulled a lot of their data from are people who receive surgery or they receive anesthesia.

299
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:10,500
Okay. Documented. So, like, have some sort of surgery so they have some sort of event involved and, like, whichever surgery they had.

300
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:14,519
Mm hmm. And so I think and I'm not 100% sure,

301
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:23,579
but I think that the instrumental variable could be like what event they had that caused them to receive anesthesia.

302
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:30,780
So what surgery did they have? Okay. So so the outcome here is enrollment in the study.

303
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:41,520
And you're sort of looking at it to understand sort of what demographic type measures,

304
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:48,660
rates, education, income, those kinds of things are maybe sort of causing that enrollment.

305
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:54,420
Right. And so they are they choose whether or not they want to participate.

306
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:59,310
Yeah. So we're trying to see like. Right. Which one? Yes. Groups of people are participating.

307
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:03,750
So this has no effect on on on whether they're going to participate.

308
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:11,669
And so potentially there are a bunch of potential as well, if we think about demographics as potential confounders.

309
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:15,630
But here it's sort of the other way around. You may have some other things that are confounded with demographics.

310
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:28,560
Well, it's hard to think of that as a cause of causal type thing because demographics often are sort of pre preexisting.

311
00:34:31,410 --> 00:34:43,260
So but if you did want to sort of assume that or maybe worry too much about the direction of the earlier you look at, uh,

312
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:57,180
so the type of surgery they're going to have is maybe associated with demographics but hopefully not associated with their decision to participate.

313
00:34:57,690 --> 00:35:02,490
Okay. Sounds good. Okeydoke.

314
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:14,190
I'm going to move on. I hope that was a little travel break in a chance to to think about stuff that followed the course.

315
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:32,370
So when we left last time, we were looking at these attempts to estimate mediation through essentially unusual product.

316
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:43,540
To. Okay.

317
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:52,749
So I guess I don't have a one page, but we have two steps through stage models.

318
00:35:52,750 --> 00:36:01,480
One where a mediator is predicted as a function of our treatment or exposure, conditioning or screen.

319
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,840
Oh, I'm not. You're right.

320
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:22,510
Right. So. So again, two stage model here.

321
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,510
So we're predicting the mediator. Right.

322
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:34,509
So there's some treatment or exposure has an impact on our mediator and then our outcome potentially has

323
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:46,030
an impact between that mediator and the outcome or possibly directly from the treatment on the outcome.

324
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:56,110
And then we also allow for interactions and I have the interaction model that we did in more general setting allow for that.

325
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:09,010
So we just worked out these linear models for the mediator and the outcome the these.

326
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:20,469
These. Three measures of mediation.

327
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:27,880
This control direct effect. This natural direct effect in the natural indirect effect and again, the control direct effect.

328
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:37,120
We fix our mediators some value and then we consider the difference in the potential outcomes under treatment or control.

329
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:47,710
The natural direct effect where the prefix unit add some value in, we're going to let it be whatever the value would be under control.

330
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:55,830
And again, look at this difference fixing it that the sort of associated treatment effects.

331
00:37:55,830 --> 00:38:01,840
So this is the component of the overall treatment effect.

332
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:10,300
It's direct that doesn't involve the mediator. And then a measure of natural indirect effect which fixes.

333
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:18,339
The outcome under treatment within considers the difference in the potential

334
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:23,050
outcomes with a mediator to be at the treatment value or at the control value.

335
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:41,100
So and so what the next few slides are going to do is start to move into settings where we have non continuous outcomes or mediators in particular.

336
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:43,860
And really a focus here in binary outcomes, right,

337
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:53,250
or binary emitters as being the most common type of outcome of a continuous that can actually make my work more common to continuous.

338
00:38:54,480 --> 00:39:03,570
But so the the assumptions we're going to use are exactly the same.

339
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:09,990
So again, these four assumptions, I guess I should put those.

340
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,139
The treatment is independent of the potential outcome now defined in terms of

341
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:36,230
both the mediator and the and the treatment and then conditional on treatment,

342
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:41,720
the potential outcomes independent of mediator.

343
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:48,920
This can be assumed by design potentially.

344
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,730
This can't be, but hopefully we can get there by conditional access.

345
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:57,680
And then to look at the natural, direct and indirect effects.

346
00:39:58,610 --> 00:40:05,990
We need this unconfined ness between the treatment and the mediator.

347
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:10,550
Again, that can be done by design.

348
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:22,040
And then on confederal ness between the mediator under the alternative arm versus the potential outcome under a given arm.

349
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:32,510
So and again, well, the conditional covariance can help there.

350
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:45,500
So, so under all these assumptions and we assume a linear model, now we have a continuous mediator.

351
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:49,130
So we stick with our linear model for our mediator.

352
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:53,150
But now we're going to use a logistic model for our outcome.

353
00:40:53,780 --> 00:41:00,470
And again, we're going to allow an interaction and include covariates to help improve these assumptions,

354
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:04,910
hopefully the interaction between the mediator and the treatment.

355
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:14,450
So we can we can then define this control.

356
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:30,950
The direct effect then basically is going to be the exponential effect of the treatment adjusting for the mediator, plus any interaction term here.

357
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:39,139
This is now defined as an odds ratio. The natural indirect effect, right.

358
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:45,440
We still have this alpha two times beta one, but now we're exponentially in it and we may have an interaction.

359
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:48,860
If we have this interaction with the mediator, we have this extra piece we add in here.

360
00:41:50,210 --> 00:42:00,980
And then for the direct effect, it's a little it's a little it's a little busier because now we have to worry about the level of the covariates.

361
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,080
So some stuff doesn't cancel out that that would cancel out before.

362
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:19,930
So we. We now basically have this direct this natural direct effect to be a function of clearance.

363
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:32,880
So so I'm going to go through the derivation for the control direct effect because it's for the control

364
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:39,280
to the natural indirect effect derivations very similar in the natural direct effect derivation.

365
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,280
It's somewhat similar, but it's it's a lot of tedious algebra.

366
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:49,240
And I'm going to just refer you back to the appendix of Vanderbilt text which which has that over there.

367
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:57,400
So and I should also add, these last two are really approximations if the outcome is rare.

368
00:42:58,690 --> 00:43:11,620
Otherwise we can we can model the outcome as on a log scale and then we can get unbiased estimates for these for these odds ratios.

369
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:19,130
So. Okay.

370
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:28,220
So actually, first of all, I want to define the effect for a binary outcome on an odds ratio scale for the total effect, right?

371
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:34,730
So we can see that basically if we conditional covariates, right.

372
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:38,809
And we have all this assumption that that we're not worried about mediation necessarily

373
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:44,540
need to worry about the fact that our exposure is independent of potential outcomes,

374
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:47,480
possibly conditional index.

375
00:43:48,350 --> 00:44:04,910
So if we do the linear modeling, the log odds, then we essentially are able to get the odds of Y equal to one under treatment.

376
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:14,330
It's going to be Gemini plus Gamma one, A-plus, Gamma two, transpose x and under control.

377
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:22,840
Right. The same thing except with a star replaced. So the cover, it's here cancel and we just are left with this or that,

378
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:30,260
this simple expression of and of course if Fe is one and a star zero, which is going to be e to the gamma one.

379
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:37,940
So the the usual estimate or regression based estimate of the effect of a treatment.

380
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:46,070
So and I guess one thing to know here is we're we're using covariance to kind of weaken this assumption of confounders,

381
00:44:47,090 --> 00:44:52,100
but the coverage will cancel in the derivation. Again, assuming no interaction rate.

382
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:58,490
If we did allow for an interaction between A and X, then obviously this total effect is going to be dependent on X.

383
00:44:59,450 --> 00:45:03,350
So but if there's no interaction, then these are all of the major false.

384
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:15,150
So. So then our control direct effect kind of work exactly the same way.

385
00:45:17,610 --> 00:45:21,000
So except now we're going to be fixing.

386
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:27,389
The mediator value add some value.

387
00:45:27,390 --> 00:45:41,820
M So we can go from this quantity which involves the potential outcomes to the observed outcomes using exactly the same arguments.

388
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:48,840
I'm not going to repeat them, but exactly the same arguments that we did the previous class with the linear mediators in outcomes.

389
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:55,710
Essentially, as we assume these these conditional independence give x,

390
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:04,230
we can replace weighted conditional neg and then we can once we have a conditional on them.

391
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:10,290
And then the potential outcome corresponds to the observed outcome under super.

392
00:46:11,610 --> 00:46:16,739
So, so now we have exactly the same thing we did before,

393
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:30,780
but now we just have to add in our our terms that involve the mediators and again cover is cancel but the and the mediator values

394
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:41,010
themselves cancel but the interaction term doesn't so so we now basically have this potential extra piece for interaction.

395
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:46,590
Otherwise we just use if there's no interaction, then it's just the adjusted.

396
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:54,540
Just like in the bear case, it's just the adjusted effect of treatment adjustment for the new year.

397
00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:00,210
So. Questions about that.

398
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:04,830
Yes, right. Yes, sir. Just on slide eight, 23.

399
00:47:04,890 --> 00:47:13,890
Yeah. Right. So that's just that's just modeling as a function of why is a function to be an X log transform.

400
00:47:14,160 --> 00:48:15,110
Yeah. Right. So I can write that up. Various. That was so think.

401
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:21,570
And this sort of potential outcome for you.

402
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:31,860
So it was just. You.

403
00:48:43,810 --> 00:48:52,830
Okay. So other questions about this.

404
00:48:52,870 --> 00:48:59,570
Yes. But can you commit to this one?

405
00:48:59,810 --> 00:49:03,549
I'm confused. Like, wait. Why do you need the proximity in the first place?

406
00:49:03,550 --> 00:49:07,230
Can we complete the operation to with this?

407
00:49:08,010 --> 00:49:10,410
So, you know, I didn't quite I'm right.

408
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:17,769
Again, there's a lot of tedious algebra involved, but it turns out there's like a little extra term here that is basically very small.

409
00:49:17,770 --> 00:49:22,240
The outcome is rare. And so I'm going to refer you back to the.

410
00:49:22,690 --> 00:49:28,860
Yeah, one more question is. Yeah, for the the the second sentence there.

411
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:36,130
We want to in that way, is it possible for a new probability to be right in one right.

412
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:46,870
It's a feature of of the estimation procedure in general that's in your models that you none of the

413
00:49:46,870 --> 00:49:51,609
predicted values but greater than one for the observed data for when you fit a model like this.

414
00:49:51,610 --> 00:49:57,969
But if you put in a new X that isn't part of your estimation, then yes, you could get predictions that are greater than one.

415
00:49:57,970 --> 00:50:03,190
That's the downside of using the log link. And what would benefit is that you don't want to win.

416
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:11,020
So, so. So we use the usual model. It's fine for this, this, these parts.

417
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:20,830
And again, I'm not going to get into the full algebra and the approximation, the assumption is, yes,

418
00:50:20,830 --> 00:50:34,780
it's due to the fact that the model results are even more complicated than this and are not maybe a function of of.

419
00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:41,290
I'm trying to remember the details in a way that probably I could sort of look that up again.

420
00:50:41,950 --> 00:50:48,670
But but I think it's maybe just trying to sort of summarize this in a in a fashion that makes it reasonably intuitive.

421
00:51:15,790 --> 00:51:22,270
I'm so sorry. I'll take it. I can dig around a little more in there to get back to you in the right direction.

422
00:51:24,390 --> 00:51:33,600
Okay. So.

423
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:44,040
All right. Okay. So. Right.

424
00:51:44,090 --> 00:51:47,660
So I know that these corporates don't cancel the natural direct effect derivation.

425
00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:50,600
So that's a result of in fact the probability scale.

426
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:57,200
The transformation of the log odds of the mediator depends on the covariate level, so it'll cancel a natural indirect effect.

427
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:01,520
We're modifying the mediator value, but holding the treatment constant.

428
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:08,000
So again, treatment here is is.

429
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:19,500
All right. So true. But what's on the on the large scale in the meat eaters is is on the loose on the linear scale.

430
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:29,359
So. So we modified the mediator value and that will cancel because they're linear.

431
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:32,420
And so we look at these ratios, things to cancel out.

432
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:40,640
But when we're looking at the natural indirect effect, we modify the treatment value but hold the mediator constant.

433
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:49,220
So now as we modify the treatment value, this, this interaction piece involved, the mediator will essentially not go away.

434
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:56,090
So that that that that that transformation creates.

435
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:09,180
So the coverage pattern, I guess the one thing to add on that front, 57.

436
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:20,640
So whenever you have. A lot of positive things really focus on more and more values.

437
00:53:21,930 --> 00:53:26,580
We started trying to figure out what's what's the overall effect in the population.

438
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:33,830
So if we come up with an estimate, that depends on progress. We can integrate our.

439
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:47,170
The covariance is.

440
00:53:50,690 --> 00:54:04,810
Like can. And observe an average this.

441
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:26,460
The causal effect estimates. The condition.

442
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:43,810
So so we have this natural, direct effect.

443
00:54:44,830 --> 00:54:48,640
And I suppose I don't only want to index blacks accent more to school but had certain some girl average.

444
00:54:51,290 --> 00:55:08,680
So what I like to do is integrate that out over the joint distribution of my axis.

445
00:55:09,310 --> 00:55:17,530
And it's actually horrible, right? Because you know that this is like Rachel, a lot of people here, politically incorrect.

446
00:55:17,530 --> 00:55:25,900
But what you can do is you can just approximate it numerically by computing.

447
00:55:39,690 --> 00:55:43,850
There's an ethical value of X. All right.

448
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:58,530
So just for example, if we assume this one is zero and this was equal.

449
00:56:07,830 --> 00:56:54,020
Expression. So a lot of these are actually constants.

450
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:33,800
The. So.

451
00:57:34,950 --> 00:57:50,890
So this can really all have to involve the sort of interaction part of history and then the mediators function of too.

452
00:57:53,190 --> 00:57:58,360
So. Confession I had to be.

453
00:58:12,970 --> 00:58:20,160
So make it three zero then be our natural direct effect corresponds with full

454
00:58:20,170 --> 00:58:26,080
direct effect is just be to the baby when their interaction is going on Big three,

455
00:58:27,310 --> 00:58:31,030
then the things get a little a little more complicated.

456
00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:36,040
And basically, you get this whole one function here along with.

457
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:48,450
A piece that involves you now over this delivery,

458
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:59,930
but it's based on sort of pretty the observed distribution of the axes as the true distribution, the same idea that here's the good stuff.

459
00:59:00,710 --> 00:59:10,970
So we're just stating whatever the imperative distribution is of the axis and saying this corresponds to their distribution and within the population.

460
00:59:12,170 --> 00:59:17,180
So it's a way to approximate that, obviously a better approximation of the terms.

461
00:59:27,790 --> 00:59:36,100
Questions. So for, you know, this is a scalar, I guess it's not so experience.

462
00:59:36,110 --> 00:59:42,110
But is this like what do you do this for just the entire factor of?

463
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:50,360
All right, so whatever whatever x rays, each time we have to observe data, each of them has an x.

464
00:59:53,630 --> 01:00:06,740
Sure. So. ActiveX is so plugged in and this ultimately results in families get and.

465
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:34,410
And the software we've seen in a minute, maybe today, maybe next week does this when it's computing these overall measures.

466
01:00:34,710 --> 01:00:37,550
Of course, you could control keep some of the access constant.

467
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:42,600
So if you wanted to see look at this effect within a gender group or within an age group,

468
01:00:44,370 --> 01:00:52,769
you would fix X at that particular value and then take the mean within the observe the

469
01:00:52,770 --> 01:00:56,640
other changing axes within that within that group sequence or do a partial conditioning.

470
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:02,610
All right. Or you could. So.

471
01:01:07,390 --> 01:01:13,730
Or you can just fix them in advance. All right.

472
01:01:14,690 --> 01:01:21,630
So. So we can kind of play this game in different directions.

473
01:01:21,650 --> 01:01:26,450
Can you circumbinary mediator. All right, we use our linear model for outcome.

474
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:34,659
But now our mediator is a logistic regression. Treatment and covariance control.

475
01:01:34,660 --> 01:01:42,700
Direct effect again doesn't change. But now both the natural direct effect and indirect effects are not going to be a function of x.

476
01:01:44,260 --> 01:01:54,850
So you can plug in these values and you could plug in for a given X or play the game.

477
01:01:54,850 --> 01:02:06,490
I show it up there and and now because our mediators no longer linear in covariates,

478
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:17,650
we have to end up essentially having to do to account for that sort of nonlinearity by conditioning on the covariates,

479
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:33,160
we take expectation so we're no longer able to get these things to cancel because an expectation depends on the ratios of the depend on the X, right?

480
01:02:33,820 --> 01:02:37,960
So, so that sort of depends where you're starting, right?

481
01:02:38,890 --> 01:02:42,130
And same, same issue when we go to the natural, indirect effect.

482
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:56,310
So again, I just expected value of them as this kind of inverse logic, or I call it the expert function of coherence.

483
01:02:59,770 --> 01:03:19,570
Okay. So when both are are binary, then again, logistic regression is the common approach here and our our derivation of the control direct effect,

484
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:32,050
the conditional decree value immediate or direct effect still remains basically linear on the on the on the multiplicative scale.

485
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:45,790
But now both components get involved in, in, in these, these derivations of direct and indirect effects.

486
01:03:47,090 --> 01:03:58,450
Um, so sort of trying to get a little bit of intuition here if, if beta three is zero, there's no interaction,

487
01:04:00,460 --> 01:04:10,270
then you still don't completely sort of boil back to the E to the beta one because the fact that the mediator

488
01:04:10,270 --> 01:04:25,060
value is no longer linear an M and in an A and an X means that these these components kind of survive.

489
01:04:26,350 --> 01:04:34,150
So. No, I can't take that back.

490
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:44,270
Right. So if as I've said, if is 0 to 1, then I guess that's it still can kind of boil down to either the beta one because.

491
01:04:48,270 --> 01:04:53,520
This is just you to the beat of three, two, three, zero.

492
01:04:54,990 --> 01:05:07,969
Then you're just left with. These are going to be constantly either the beta two plus alpha naught plus alpha one eight star plus a2x.

493
01:05:07,970 --> 01:05:11,120
So these would cancel. It's going to be left at the end of the beta one.

494
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:20,479
So in terms of the natural indirect effect, I think the fact that you're here,

495
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:26,140
you're a little bit stuck because you're changing the median or withholding the treatment constant.

496
01:05:26,150 --> 01:05:31,100
And so, you know, if there's no interaction, then this coverage would still still play a role.

497
01:05:32,420 --> 01:05:40,580
So again, the proofs and these are this is kind of an understatement about yes, they are, but they are straightforward.

498
01:05:42,610 --> 01:05:48,400
So. Okay. So variance estimation.

499
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:52,660
So we can carry this out using a Taylor series approximation.

500
01:05:54,200 --> 01:06:01,750
So we're helped a little bit by the fact that the variance covariance matrix for alpha and beta are zero.

501
01:06:02,890 --> 01:06:13,150
So and so we can see this essentially if we think about, you know, looking at the sort of smooth version of this, right?

502
01:06:13,150 --> 01:06:16,600
So if we rewrite the covariance is the expected value,

503
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:23,889
the covariance conditional on an x plus the covariance of the expected values of these conditional and

504
01:06:23,890 --> 01:06:33,220
then make an x well first one zero because you're essentially conditioning on everything in the estimate.

505
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:39,190
And then the second part is zero, because the only thing left over is in the obvious and betas.

506
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:46,910
So, um. So then we just.

507
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,380
We just need to work out the.

508
01:07:00,020 --> 01:07:07,850
That the gang we're doing, Ted, are serious when you take derivatives of respect to alpha and beta of whatever function we have here.

509
01:07:08,780 --> 01:07:14,810
So in terms of the control direct effect, those only involve betas.

510
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:15,950
Right.

511
01:07:15,950 --> 01:07:28,669
So the roots of the Alpha zero and basically it's going to be one for the beta one component and M for the beta three component and zero for beta,

512
01:07:28,670 --> 01:07:36,070
not beta two and four. So we've already established the covariance, alpha and beta have zero.

513
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:46,550
So we just have there the variance covariance of of of the alpha had and beta had is just going to be the diagonal.

514
01:07:50,420 --> 01:07:54,110
Variances based on the regression model. Right. So.

515
01:07:55,260 --> 01:08:08,819
For the mediator. That's just going to be the transpose of the high desire matrix predicting the mediator.

516
01:08:08,820 --> 01:08:20,160
So just one an x times that design matrix inverted multiplied by sigma squared and then similarly for.

517
01:08:22,870 --> 01:08:29,140
Variance covariance for or beta now is the same thing. But now we have this app and this interaction term in there as well.

518
01:08:30,580 --> 01:08:42,010
So, so a lot of the stuff cancels out and I basically get left with just the parts that involve beta one.

519
01:08:42,010 --> 01:08:44,170
Beta had three and they're covariance terms.

520
01:08:45,670 --> 01:09:00,520
So you can see basically that this variance estimate for the control direct effect is just going to be of course the variance of sigma of beta one.

521
01:09:00,910 --> 01:09:03,670
If there's beta three had zero, otherwise I have.

522
01:09:07,100 --> 01:09:13,880
Twice the meter value, times the covariance plus the meter value squared, times the variance of three.

523
01:09:15,540 --> 01:09:19,800
So we can go through the same game for all the other escalators.

524
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:25,889
And no, it's not our vanity.

525
01:09:25,890 --> 01:09:32,970
We all, bless his heart, has done all that. So you can see the results of his and his hard work.

526
01:09:34,110 --> 01:09:37,770
So, of course, the nice thing about this is you do it once. You can program it.

527
01:09:37,980 --> 01:09:42,270
It's done. The great thing about Taylor series approximations and close formal solutions.

528
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:48,050
So yes, but excuse me, where exactly is the opportunity?

529
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:52,890
I'm sorry. Where exactly is the failure? So.

530
01:09:54,150 --> 01:10:00,080
Well, it's territories. Approximation is basically. Right.

531
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:15,940
So. For most people that. This is for the Western Hemisphere.

532
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:56,770
So. So that's some function of say let's say Alvin made a pact to keep our notation the same.

533
01:10:57,580 --> 01:11:01,750
So here on. So basically the variance of this.

534
01:11:59,910 --> 01:12:16,520
So this is sometimes terms that felt the method. Or a serious approximation to the reasons on film series.

535
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:28,340
I'm not going to do the whole thing here. But essentially what you do is a full length expansion of this with all the attendant returns.

536
01:12:29,090 --> 01:12:34,640
And then basically when you go to get the variance, the sort of first term is an expectation zero.

537
01:12:35,390 --> 01:12:42,230
And then the second term is this the other trains or so on.

538
01:12:43,220 --> 01:12:46,700
So if you're one of these two things, you.

539
01:12:49,530 --> 01:12:53,420
So. All right. So you can see that's exactly what we have here.

540
01:12:53,460 --> 01:12:57,270
So I guess here in this particular example.

541
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:24,620
It's just involves a fetus. Right. So. And.

542
01:13:27,730 --> 01:13:33,940
And I guess what you're saying is they might say so. I guess so.

543
01:13:34,420 --> 01:13:39,130
I'm just waiting for you. So.

544
01:13:43,510 --> 01:13:46,569
I cited the direction to take it early. There's no alphas here.

545
01:13:46,570 --> 01:13:50,139
So those are all zero of my four components.

546
01:13:50,140 --> 01:13:53,430
By components of beta. Only beta one makes me feel.

547
01:13:59,180 --> 01:14:05,990
And then this variance is basically just the the variance is better for a linear regression for the.

548
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:16,510
So. Yeah, so sorry. Playing a lot of six or one 650 games here.

549
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:30,100
All right. Good questions. All right.

550
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:36,100
Other questions. Kind of bopped along your quick.

551
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:45,560
All right. So I'm going to finish up with measures of mediation today and then we'll look at the example.

552
01:14:51,400 --> 01:15:04,410
Next week. So okay, so this controlled direct effect can be thought of as the impact or treatment or exposure independent of the mediator.

553
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:07,680
Right. So this thing that doesn't go through that immediate pathway.

554
01:15:10,890 --> 01:15:18,690
So, so as an example and this for me, just to make this bit more concrete,

555
01:15:18,900 --> 01:15:25,139
this is also example going to look at and we might consider child poverty as a predictor

556
01:15:25,140 --> 01:15:30,300
of survival status at some age with the experience of adult poverty as a mediator.

557
01:15:30,340 --> 01:15:33,809
Right. So how does childhood poverty impact survival?

558
01:15:33,810 --> 01:15:39,780
What might be? Because once you you're in poverty. In childhood, it may be hard, harder to escape it in adulthood.

559
01:15:40,740 --> 01:15:45,180
So so the control that effect effect in this case would be effect of changing

560
01:15:45,180 --> 01:15:50,970
childhood poverty status while either keeping the poverty in place or removing it.

561
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:56,130
So this control direct effect.

562
01:15:57,630 --> 01:16:05,720
So you would look at the change in child poverty with the poverty in place or change in the child.

563
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:11,340
The poverty status got poverty now zero or not occurring.

564
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:19,110
So so I think this control direct effect is is sort of most is seen as sort of a policy or

565
01:16:19,110 --> 01:16:23,280
exposure effect to the narrower sense of how does it work in a sort of a fixed setting.

566
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:36,620
The natural, direct and indirect effect measures or can be defined in this in this example, basically as the effect of childhood poverty,

567
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:42,930
keeping the experience of at all poverty level would have been had there been no childhood poverty.

568
01:16:43,170 --> 01:16:50,969
So an individual now we consider what's what's their adult status had they

569
01:16:50,970 --> 01:16:54,810
not know what their adult poverty status had they not been childhood poverty.

570
01:16:55,320 --> 01:17:00,450
And now is the counterfactual where they're in poverty as child and not in poverty as a child.

571
01:17:01,770 --> 01:17:12,329
And then for the natural indirect effect effects individuals that experience childhood poverty and look at what

572
01:17:12,330 --> 01:17:17,850
happens if we change the adult poverty status from having it to not having it looking at that difference.

573
01:17:20,250 --> 01:17:26,310
So in the linear model setting, these natural, direct and indirect effects add up to the overall effect.

574
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:32,070
So the overall effect of childhood poverty on survival. So a natural measure of this is proportion mediated.

575
01:17:33,150 --> 01:17:38,640
So if we look at the natural indirect effect divided by the total effect, it gives the proportion media.

576
01:17:40,380 --> 01:17:53,340
So essentially, if, if all of the effect on survival is through the indirect effect of which is again measured by looking at.

577
01:17:56,970 --> 01:18:07,960
It. So when you have childhood poverty and then changing, this is a fact among these individuals on their dole poverty status.

578
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:10,810
So the effect is sort of mediated through the dole poverty.

579
01:18:11,350 --> 01:18:16,910
If that's if those are equal, then that proportion mediators wonder if there's essentially no effect.

580
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:23,350
No one direct effect. Right. So the mediation doesn't seem to exist.

581
01:18:23,350 --> 01:18:32,170
So there's essentially no effect of poverty on survival, although poverty and survival among those in child poverty.

582
01:18:32,380 --> 01:18:46,180
Then that the crime, of course it would be zero when the outcomes binary they suggest something that looks a little bit different.

583
01:18:46,180 --> 01:19:05,410
So sort of a a ratio of the well the natural direct effect times, the actual indirect effect minus one versus the product of these two minus one.

584
01:19:06,310 --> 01:19:11,620
So it's not exactly the portion, but if the outcomes are not common, it has a kind of flavor.

585
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:20,660
Obviously, if the direct effect here is zero, the direct factors, zero, of course, immediate zero if sorry.

586
01:19:21,490 --> 01:19:27,280
So if the odds ratio is is is one so that the effect is zero, then this becomes zero.

587
01:19:29,770 --> 01:19:36,759
Otherwise, it's you're going to you could have ranges out outside of zero or one.

588
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:40,960
But if these outcomes where they should, they should sort of stay in that same range.

589
01:19:43,290 --> 01:19:46,620
So. Okay.

590
01:19:46,630 --> 01:19:53,790
So I think all right, I know we're out of time, but maybe just we can review this again,

591
01:19:53,790 --> 01:20:01,000
but just to touch on it, um, disproportionate mediator is a natural measure, but it's subject to limitations.

592
01:20:01,980 --> 01:20:07,950
It's unstable. And it's also the removal of the natural, direct and indirect effect of different directions.

593
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:18,930
Right. In which case, we can have proportions that are negative or greater than one makes it hard to interpret.

594
01:20:19,950 --> 01:20:26,520
So an alternative in the linear model setting is sort of the portion of the effect that's eliminated.

595
01:20:27,630 --> 01:20:33,300
So we look at the total effect. We subtract off the control direct effect at some level.

596
01:20:33,300 --> 01:20:39,540
And so is to find it to suddenly overwhelm. And that gives us a proportion eliminated.

597
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:41,460
So in this example,

598
01:20:41,970 --> 01:20:48,510
with the portion of child poverty could be eliminated by intervening everyone in the to scenario one of the population to a certain media value.

599
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:54,840
So the certain value with all poverty. So this has the advantage of essentially being really forced between zero and one.

600
01:20:56,880 --> 01:21:00,260
It's also right. So it still is a fraction.

601
01:21:00,270 --> 01:21:07,230
So you still have stability issues, but but at least it's now actually a real commercial and binding outcome.

602
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:20,250
There's an alternative for that, too. So you stop office hours Thursday and otherwise I will try to get the homework created by this weekend.

603
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:27,020
So I'm. One.

604
01:21:35,770 --> 01:21:35,970
Yeah.
