Welcome to Epit 634 as module on exponential population growth models in this module, I'll provide an introduction to modeling population dynamics.

2
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:22,660
The learning objectives of this modular two one derive an exponential growth model and two, to assess the limitations to the exponential growth model.

3
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:27,760
We'll begin by introducing the basic concepts of population dynamics,

4
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:34,210
population dynamics as defined by changes in population levels to the forces that cause change.

5
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:43,570
We will start with four biological processes that determine how population change over time, birth and death,

6
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:52,480
birth and immigration causes increases in population size and death, and immigration causes decreases in population size.

7
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:58,390
Importantly, each of these processes are generally considered to be independent.

8
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:04,120
The central concept in these population dynamic models is the per capita growth rate.

9
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:10,960
This is defined as the average number of offspring each individual produces per time per person.

10
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:21,960
If we ignore immigration, emigration. We have a per capita birth rate which take on units of number of births per person per time,

11
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:28,340
and we have a per capita death rate which takes on units of number of deaths per person per time.

12
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:36,770
In each case, we get the number of births or deaths per time by multiplying the per capita rate by the total population level.

13
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:44,960
This parameter is a rate because of the of the unit per time and its per capita because of the unit per person.

14
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:55,130
For example, if we have a population of 20 and a per capita birth rate of two, then over one year we would estimate 40 births.

15
00:01:55,130 --> 00:02:03,470
If we have a per capita death rate of point O five, we predict one death over the same year.

16
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:11,570
We can go one step further and simulate this model that we just developed by using Excel spreadsheet.

17
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:14,510
We assume we start with a population of two.

18
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:24,170
And we have a per capita birth rate of two births per person per year and per capita death rate of point oh five deaths per person per year.

19
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:33,020
So after one year, we have four births and therefore we start the second year with six individuals by the end of the third year.

20
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:40,270
We finally have enough people to have on average, one death. We also have thirty six births.

21
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:48,200
If we plot the total population by year, we observe what looks like to be an exponential growth trajectory.

22
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,200
Can we show this more rigorously?

23
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:59,450
Let's take the next step and write down an equation that describes the calculations we made on the X Bell's spreadsheet.

24
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:07,650
We calculated the population at the beginning of the next year by calculating the name to births and deaths during the current year.

25
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:13,880
To the population at the beginning of the next year is equal to the population at the beginning of the current year.

26
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:23,120
And of T plus the number of births during that current year B times entity minus the number of deaths during that year.

27
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,200
D times and T where are equals.

28
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:32,200
B minus D. And is the net growth rate.

29
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:41,360
And if we want to calculate the population at an arbitrary timestep, we could use Delta T instead of one.

30
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:53,980
We then modify the equation as shown here. So why is the term R times in T multiplied by Delta T?

31
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:57,760
The answer is that the units of R R per year.

32
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:08,940
So if Delta T equals point five or a half a year, we would expect only we would only expect to see half as many burse.

33
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:17,460
How can we interpret our parameter? Ah, if we solve for R, we get in the numerator.

34
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:29,630
The change in population per time rate and in the denominator the population size, which can be interpreted as per capita.

35
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:35,330
Taken together, we get the change in population per time per person.

36
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:44,410
So are is the per capita growth rate just as we have we defined originally?

37
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:55,240
Our next step in driving our growth model is to observe that we convert to a differential equation as our TimeStep Delta T gets smaller and smaller.

38
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:03,580
So let's go back to our equation derived from an Excel exercise with a little bit of algebra,

39
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:13,120
we can rearrange the equation as follows as Delta T approaches zero smy a smaller timestep.

40
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:19,350
We approach the following differential equation. This is our dynamic model.

41
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:24,030
It says the following. The change in population over time.

42
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:29,010
This is the left side of the equation is equal to the per capita growth rate.

43
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:34,420
Times the current population size. The right side of the equation.

44
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:40,180
We've assumed from the beginning that this per capita growth rate is constant and independent.

45
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:48,230
A population size. If we solve the differential equation in the details of which I can provide,

46
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:54,100
if you're interested, we get an exponentially increasing function with a rate parameter.

47
00:05:54,100 --> 00:06:01,670
Ah, therefore, this simple model we developed earlier in the Excel example is an exponential growth model

48
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:07,730
where R is the per capita growth rate in and of zero is the initial population size.

49
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:15,400
That time equals zero. What are some of the basic properties of this simple model?

50
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:22,800
One useful statistic is the doubling time, the time it takes for the population to double in size.

51
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:29,570
We can solve for this time if we set NFTE equals to two times and have zero,

52
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:40,050
the end of zero term cancels out and after a bit of algebra, we get the doubling time as log to over R.

53
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:47,360
So let's apply this model. We often.

54
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:57,110
Model bacteria growth using the exponential model. If we assume a bacteria divides every 20 minutes and we start with a 10 gram bacterium.

55
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:10,600
The question is how long will it take for bacteria colony to grow to a size equal to the mass of the earth, which is ten to the twenty seven grams?

56
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,620
We can answer this question using the above equation.

57
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:28,390
If we set NFTE equals to ten, twenty seven, the final colony size, the initial bacterium to 10, the per capita growth rate, two point five.

58
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:33,220
Then we have the following. Solving for tea.

59
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:43,000
We get two days suggesting it only takes two days for a bacteria colony to grow to equal the mass of the Earth.

60
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:52,660
So what does this mean, since this is not consistent with what we observe, bacteria growth must be regulated in some way.

61
00:07:52,660 --> 00:08:00,700
Bacteria growth cannot stay on an exponential trajectory and therefore regulated growth models are needed.

62
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:05,480
Which is the topic for the next class.
