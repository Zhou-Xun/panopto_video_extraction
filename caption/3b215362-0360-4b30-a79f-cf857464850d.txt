1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,513
I want to close by performance measurement and

2
00:00:04,513 --> 00:00:07,740
why that matters addressing this problem.

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,940
So you've been learning this force, veteran types quality measures?

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:12,740
Yes.

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:15,680
You know that movement goes back to the 1990s where we

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,880
really started measuring tensions are falling in here.

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:24,140
But early on he really did not pretty much disparities and inequality.

8
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:28,180
This was an important article that it's published in JAMA

9
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:32,240
years ago showing the disparities are quality from them.

10
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,820
We couldn't think about having the high quality system.

11
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:39,084
If we had significant disparities and the data not adequate,

12
00:00:39,084 --> 00:00:42,611
understand how well we're doing into her groups.

13
00:00:42,611 --> 00:00:46,588
And so they made a strong case that we needed to stratify race,

14
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:48,121
ethnicity and social.

15
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:54,234
And so we then looked within the Medicare HMO programme in different types of

16
00:00:54,234 --> 00:00:57,540
quality measures in the early years of quality.

17
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,240
Yeah, thank you.

18
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,240
And what was happening with race of quality.

19
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,640
The disparity is important.

20
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:07,398
20 process measures whether doctors are using beta blocker

21
00:01:07,398 --> 00:01:10,440
medications after the my heart attack.

22
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:16,476
Been shown randomised studies reduce the rate of subsequent heart attacks and

23
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:21,506
at the start of this period became quality measure in 1997 and

24
00:01:21,506 --> 00:01:26,627
early on, as shown in the green light Whites were about 12% more

25
00:01:26,627 --> 00:01:32,389
like I received this cable lockers but Still even less than 80 of whites,

26
00:01:32,389 --> 00:01:37,640
7% Americans we're getting his treatment is appropriate.

27
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:42,396
And once this became a nationally recognised quality measures,

28
00:01:42,396 --> 00:01:47,756
Medicare being profiled and what we saw was just over a several year period

29
00:01:47,756 --> 00:01:53,211
that 12% disparity is reduced, relatively small margin by 2002.

30
00:01:53,211 --> 00:01:57,770
It was essentially eliminated as the overall rates of treatment 1%.

31
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:00,040
So this was an example.

32
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,440
We're overall improvement.

33
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,677
Integration disparity was eliminated and what we found for

34
00:02:05,677 --> 00:02:09,039
a number of other measures in the state of processing.

35
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:13,080
We're done ordering threat great medication.

36
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,565
We saw similar patterns to this, the rising tide, deferentially improved

37
00:02:18,565 --> 00:02:23,940
care for minority adults and eliminated significant disparities.

38
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,377
But we saw a different pattern with what we call is referred to as outcome

39
00:02:27,377 --> 00:02:27,970
measures.

40
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:32,707
So this is a case of cholesterol control, not just over testing patients for

41
00:02:32,707 --> 00:02:37,740
their what are we actually bringing them under control In this case department,

42
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:41,161
we know that control cholesterol reduces their risk.

43
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:48,025
What we saw was the rates for outcome measures of control pretty much lower than

44
00:02:48,025 --> 00:02:51,540
we saw for those process measures less than 50%.

45
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,961
We saw some gradual improvement over a several year period.

46
00:02:53,961 --> 00:02:58,201
But with that gradual improvement no narrow the black white

47
00:02:58,201 --> 00:03:02,527
disparities shown in green light anything a slight widening

48
00:03:02,527 --> 00:03:07,049
disparity as his care approved both groups quality improved.

49
00:03:07,049 --> 00:03:11,559
But disparities persisted and in some sense, we care more about these outcomes

50
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:16,202
because even if the health care system is doing the right thing, achieving this,

51
00:03:16,202 --> 00:03:20,376
whether it's intermediate outcomes like this one or the more downstream

52
00:03:20,376 --> 00:03:26,040
outcomes like did they have higher rates of heart attacks or mortality emergencies?

53
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,771
Those are the elements of you're party.

54
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,786
So and you're coming back to your question,

55
00:03:33,786 --> 00:03:35,301
this is some of our most recent work.

56
00:03:35,301 --> 00:03:40,713
So we went back about a decade earlier studies looking at what's

57
00:03:40,713 --> 00:03:45,623
happened help Medicare programme and what we've seen now,

58
00:03:45,623 --> 00:03:51,730
if we look at left wing sites and we had data from 2006 and 2011.

59
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:54,958
Following up some of those data from the late 90s and

60
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:59,190
early 2000s that I showed in the prior slide for the same measure of

61
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:03,520
cholesterol control Medicare, HMOs with heart disease or diabetes.

62
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:07,094
What we now see is that overall control has percent but

63
00:04:07,094 --> 00:04:09,801
we still have a significant disparity.

64
00:04:09,801 --> 00:04:16,940
Any word about 8-10% between white America in Medicare agent national.

65
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:19,342
And if we look in the Northeast, Midwest or

66
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:22,770
South, we see some improvement for both whites and blacks.

67
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:27,620
But no narrowing of disparities still significant disparities each of those

68
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,680
three regions.

69
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,250
But for the hopeful finding from this study is

70
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:34,641
looking at the Western United States and nation was there.

71
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:38,673
In 2006 they have pretty similar disparities to the other three regions

72
00:04:38,673 --> 00:04:39,760
the United States.

73
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,450
But over a five year period 2011,

74
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:46,810
quality of care actually rose to the highest level in the US.

75
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:52,068
And this measure about 70% and the disparity between white showing and

76
00:04:52,068 --> 00:04:55,561
showing blue that was essentially eliminated.

77
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:02,310
Why is across the board it's gonna be the starting eliminated.

78
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:05,543
And we also looked at control blood pressure and blood sugar and

79
00:05:05,543 --> 00:05:09,650
that combination controlling blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol.

80
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:14,052
Probably some of the most important ways healthcare

81
00:05:14,052 --> 00:05:19,640
improves Americans who retired pressure and diabetes.

82
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,482
And so I think now the challenge is,

83
00:05:21,482 --> 00:05:24,871
can we understand better what's happening in some of those HMO.

84
00:05:24,871 --> 00:05:30,546
Plans in the west and transfer it into in around the country and

85
00:05:30,546 --> 00:05:36,550
that his state or about a year old now published In late 2014,

86
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:40,340
that's the challenge of the board.

87
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:45,507
We can talk in the discussion of some of the things that maybe have western

88
00:05:45,507 --> 00:05:50,589
each of their driving just to wrap up some of the lessons that I think that

89
00:05:50,589 --> 00:05:56,340
it is very important for us to have moments reports by race and ethnicity.

90
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:59,140
Language is an increasingly important factor as well.

91
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:02,651
And those engaged in this topic, there's a very good 2009.

92
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,240
Yes, sort of why and

93
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:11,140
how we just standardise the data that we have here by race and ethnicity.

94
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:15,932
In fact, in Massachusetts where I moved about 2.5 years ago back in 2006 and

95
00:06:15,932 --> 00:06:20,659
2007, they started requiring hospitals and health plans to collect race and

96
00:06:20,659 --> 00:06:24,357
ethnicity and language from their patients or their members for

97
00:06:24,357 --> 00:06:28,561
this express purpose so that they could then use it to measure all of you.

98
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:35,753
We also see the second point of the slide that brought all improvement

99
00:06:35,753 --> 00:06:40,882
efforts have been effective in reducing disparities with care and

100
00:06:40,882 --> 00:06:45,921
particularly in more organised systems like integrated HMOs for

101
00:06:45,921 --> 00:06:50,432
the disparities process measures with a few exceptions.

102
00:06:50,432 --> 00:06:55,762
I think we still need much more attention focused on health systems and

103
00:06:55,762 --> 00:06:58,540
communities addressing.

104
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:59,040
No.

105
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:04,174
So insurance coverage is going to be important part of this piece of

106
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:09,540
people don't have insurance coverage to have financial barriers your head.

107
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:12,696
But in addition to insurance coverage, we need to focus on more

108
00:07:12,696 --> 00:07:16,640
effective prevention, early diagnosis and coordination of care.

109
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:20,698
And then we really need to develop more effective engagement between communities

110
00:07:20,698 --> 00:07:24,651
and policymakers with the healthcare system to address social determinants.

111
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:30,172
But we also work on social terms of health care and so

112
00:07:30,172 --> 00:07:35,040
there are a number of education campaigns going on now.

113
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,985
This is one example cardiology, community and

114
00:07:37,985 --> 00:07:42,036
advocate advertisement positions and health system in the years

115
00:07:42,036 --> 00:07:46,340
to begin thinking about why patients in different regions.

116
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,801
Yeah, different treatments.

117
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:53,218
And the campaign was actually why did you one of the key messages

118
00:07:53,218 --> 00:07:58,053
professionally pain is that physicians and healthcare systems need

119
00:07:58,053 --> 00:08:02,634
to be focused on making sure the patients get the very best care and

120
00:08:02,634 --> 00:08:07,740
really thinking I'll race, ethnicity, language education.

121
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:11,645
Various factors play out the patients received those of you

122
00:08:11,645 --> 00:08:13,921
who are interested in this topic.

123
00:08:13,921 --> 00:08:19,254
I commanded to share with you a book chapter that I collected a few years ago,

124
00:08:19,254 --> 00:08:22,340
right after, before it was washed.

125
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,540
That's a 10.

126
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:29,820
It talks about this intersection care disparities in health care reform and

127
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:34,740
some of the ways that we can address the issues that raised.

128
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:40,671
We have a few minutes for questions special.

129
00:08:40,671 --> 00:08:41,547
>> [APPLAUSE]
