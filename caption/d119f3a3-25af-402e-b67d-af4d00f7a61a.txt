1
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:25,350
Yes. I think I was like my sister had this notion just in my book, which is what happens to me now that all of this now is just me.

2
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:31,500
But you don't think anything of this land?

3
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:41,230
Are you just going to say and then it was just you guys going to know who she was?

4
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:56,040
I don't know what it is because, you know, it's like it's so different that people in very well thought out.

5
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:01,260
But the thing is, he doesn't just happen to have.

6
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:17,410
Yeah. So it's like you. So I think that's why you think you have to over it.

7
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:26,010
Okay. Why don't we go ahead and started the company?

8
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:33,089
I hope everybody has a nice weekend. I can't believe next weekend is the weekend before Thanksgiving.

9
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:38,790
It's like, wow, flying. Like, you know, flying by.

10
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:43,230
But let's not rush it. It's Monday.

11
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:51,330
So today we're going to talk about adult crime, disease, specifically cardiovascular.

12
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:57,019
We're going to do this over. This is going to occur over several lectures.

13
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:04,240
So today and then next Monday, we will finish up on Wednesday.

14
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:12,960
We have a lot of visiting the class who's been involved in a research project called REACH

15
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:22,170
that's been developed and implemented via researchers at Eastern University in know.

16
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,620
So it's relevant because it's related to chronic disease and so it will be nice to learn

17
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:35,080
about research interventions or research tested interventions at the community level.

18
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:45,870
And so Rachel will be here to talk about that. So again, we'll finalize what we don't cover today.

19
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:54,300
I'm going to stop after about 20 slides so that we can go over your final assignment.

20
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:58,230
I went over it on Wednesday briefly just to get you started.

21
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:04,050
For those of you who didn't attend class on Wednesday, it's important to go back and review that Panopto recording.

22
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:11,830
But I'm going to wrap it up so that you guys know what we're doing for the rest of the semester in terms of this project.

23
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:16,350
So we'll cover that today. Okay.

24
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:23,100
So we're going to spend some time looking at just some statistics with cardiovascular disease.

25
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,390
So in general and those of you not familiar.

26
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:38,309
Cardiovascular disease is just a catch all term for a number of quite a few different diseases,

27
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:43,860
disorders that include the heart as well as our circulatory system.

28
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:56,880
Okay, so so here's a table that highlights very nicely the trends in deaths attributed to cardiovascular disease in the U.S.

29
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:06,220
Just note that before 1930, we did not assess deaths from cardiovascular disease across the country.

30
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:10,980
It was only being assessed in certain regions or cities and so forth.

31
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,890
So after 1930, we had more of a nationwide.

32
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:22,080
We were developing a more nationwide ability to assess deaths from cardiovascular disease.

33
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:30,090
So you can see those climbing sort of peaks out in the 1960s and then it starts to decline.

34
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:35,760
So anybody want to hazard why?

35
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:42,060
We start to see why we see declines after the 1960s and cardiovascular disease.

36
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:53,090
Decrease in smoking. Yeah. So I'm willing to bet that's part of the early declines as we were starting to learn,

37
00:04:54,380 --> 00:05:01,610
you know, that smoking actually was bad for our health in many sectors of disease.

38
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:12,260
So smoking, what else? We see some pretty dramatic after 2000.

39
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:16,610
So what might be. Yeah, maybe a new pharmaceutical.

40
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:21,260
Yeah. So what? Pharmaceuticals will help with cardiovascular disease?

41
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:25,340
Just broadly statins on statins.

42
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:29,390
So statins are used to reduce cholesterol.

43
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:33,799
Yeah. What else? At least one other section.

44
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,550
And trans fat. So a reduction in trans fat.

45
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:48,200
So it's a great point. The question is whether or not we're seeing the benefits of that yet.

46
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:53,420
But that's a good point. In terms of pharmaceuticals, there's one other.

47
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:57,790
Yeah. NELSON Medications to lower blood pressure.

48
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:02,000
Yes. Anti-hypertensive meds.

49
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:11,420
So those three smoking, lowering cholesterol and lowering blood pressure are considered the three major.

50
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:19,070
But, you know, again, all these other factors like reducing trans fat, you know,

51
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:36,560
and that both the campaign to educate but then also eventually we now don't allow trans fats in our especially with manufacturers process foods.

52
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:47,490
So now we see a slight uptick around 2010, but might have triggered that to think about that a little.

53
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:57,139
So it's around 2010. This isn't the crash.

54
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:02,330
That was the financial crash of 2000.

55
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,700
I think I think so.

56
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:13,580
I think I think that's probably we had a really severe recession and that impacted a lot of folks in terms of jobs and access to health care.

57
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:26,830
So I don't know the answer, but I'm willing to bet that that 2009 recession that lasted probably had an impact and then certainly COVID.

58
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,190
Right. But, you know, I had those contributed.

59
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:48,710
If you look at the various sort of major components of cardiovascular disease,

60
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:59,630
the primary component that contributes to deaths from CVD or just in general is coronary heart disease and stroke,

61
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,710
high blood pressure, heart failure and diseases of the arteries all contribute.

62
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:14,210
But coronary heart disease. So that's where any kind of disorder that is involved with the vessels of the heart and sort of, you know,

63
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:22,440
low hanging fruit on that one would just be plaque buildup where you get actual obstruction and reduction of blood flow to.

64
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:37,130
This is what I want to just take a step back, just to note that the citations for these slides are heart disease and stroke statistics.

65
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:42,290
American Heart Association puts out these statistics every year.

66
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,939
So for those of you who end up working and cardiovascular disease,

67
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:54,259
this is a treasure trove of information, not just the prevalence and the risk factors and so forth,

68
00:08:54,260 --> 00:09:03,290
but this document also goes over social determinants and other factors, and I haven't had a chance to go through the whole thing.

69
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:08,690
But in the past they also went over interventions that have been shown to be effective.

70
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:19,190
So this is a really great resource for those of you that end up working in criminology or those of you that do research in this area.

71
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:26,690
This is not an updated slide, but the point is still relevant.

72
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:34,429
I just wanted to highlight that this is just showing this figure is just showing the deaths from cardiovascular disease,

73
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:40,850
which is in the blue as opposed to deaths from cancer.

74
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:45,470
And this is stratified by age groups.

75
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:54,650
And so you can see that cancer and cardiovascular disease are fairly similar,

76
00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:03,200
actually, cancers a bit higher in middle age and then at about 75 years of age.

77
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:07,200
Cancer death from cancer declines.

78
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:17,750
But notice that death from cardiovascular disease just is continues to increase irrespective of age.

79
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:25,520
Okay. So the point here of this slide is just to reiterate that this is not a disease that declines,

80
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,610
you know, at some point it's just continually increasing.

81
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:35,010
And it's also an increase in cardiovascular diseases.

82
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:45,019
And like the 85 and plus, because people are dying or from cancer, maybe in the other age groups, I think what is happening,

83
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:52,849
why we see this is because usually if people are going to develop cancer, usually develop it by the time.

84
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:59,090
I think that's why we see it decline by 85 that cancer was going to develop and they were going to die from it.

85
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:06,980
Usually happens by then, but as with cardiovascular disease, it just continues.

86
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:16,330
Yeah. Yeah. I thought I'm bringing a study to that, like postmenopausal women to have such a higher increase of cardiovascular disease.

87
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:24,110
Yes. Until like after 55, you can see that you're going to see a slide that shows that the ages,

88
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:32,600
pictures fact might be the next one, that women actually have lower rates early on and then all of a sudden they take off.

89
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,540
Right. So as we age, I mean, got there.

90
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:44,270
But that's I think it's important point and I have a slide that demonstrates that the art illustrates it very nicely.

91
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:57,020
So this is the prevalence of cardiovascular disease for men, Heinz 2000 15,018 and it's stratified by gender and by race, ethnicity.

92
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:04,940
And you can see that for most categories we're talking about 50%, 50% prevalence or higher.

93
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:08,540
It's a bit lower for women.

94
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:15,630
Is anybody surprised by these statistics and.

95
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:22,580
It's sobering to see such high statistics.

96
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:33,560
I mean, we're basically saying 50 you know, over half of men and nearly half of women have cardiovascular disease.

97
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:49,850
You know, this is a figure from the 2020 Statistic Report, but it's so compelling that I keep it.

98
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:57,410
This is the 21 leading diagnosis for direct health expenditures.

99
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:03,620
These are expenditures in the United States at the very top.

100
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:14,060
Heart disease. So that's we're talking $109 billion in health care from heart disease.

101
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,069
And, you know, some of the other conditions that are part you know,

102
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:30,200
part of this umbrella term of cardiovascular risk, stroke, other circulatory conditions and so forth, hypertension.

103
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:34,069
So it's not surprising.

104
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:37,750
It's just it's a very it's an astounding number. And that's two years ago.

105
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:42,650
So I'm sure it's it's higher. Okay.

106
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:47,749
Before we move on to the next slide, brainstorm risk factors.

107
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:52,670
What is sort of the low hanging fruit risk factors?

108
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:57,620
There's many, many, many, many. But what are some of the factors?

109
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:02,840
Diet, genetics, genetics.

110
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:09,350
Age, age, gender, gender, ethnicity.

111
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:16,430
Yes. Buzzing.

112
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:19,490
Sounds like a fly between. Sorry.

113
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:27,020
Other risk factors. Lifestyle like exercise or alcohol consumption?

114
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:32,840
Yes. Lifestyle. So that's part of that cluster of diet, physical activity.

115
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:37,980
What was the other one you said? Oh, alcohol consumption. Smoking.

116
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,150
Smoking. Stress. Stress.

117
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:46,070
Yes. Stress. Biomarkers like cholesterol level BMI.

118
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:50,780
Yep. Yep. All of the sort of think you guys nailed it.

119
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:59,700
Now, but you'll notice stress isn't on here because this is from an earlier list.

120
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:05,040
But stress is now one of the leading risk factors.

121
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:09,000
You know, with this, these are all leading risk factors.

122
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:16,280
So stress is now one of those. And I just highlighted the box of top.

123
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:23,610
We don't have any control over the package, darn it, no differences in gender and so forth.

124
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:28,400
But we do have control to some degree, right?

125
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:41,940
I say control in that and that can get to that, as we all are aware of social determinants and others that impact our ability to make healthy choices.

126
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:51,630
But the point here is that these are areas where they can be targeted for intervention to reduce risk.

127
00:15:53,490 --> 00:16:02,670
And hopefully these interventions also have the elements that take into account all the different factors both social,

128
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:09,750
environment, economic, that support and help with improving or reducing these risk factors.

129
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:20,600
This was a study that was published in 2018 from JAMA that I think another is very compelling.

130
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:25,730
So this is the number, even though the title has several things.

131
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:34,329
This particular figure is only two deaths attributed to risk factors in the U.S. in 2016.

132
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:39,340
So these researchers did modeling with a plethora of data.

133
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:44,080
And you'll note that at the very top is dietary intake.

134
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:55,299
So a poor diet is one of the leading risk factors for death from a host of different disorders.

135
00:16:55,300 --> 00:17:00,180
All the different diseases and so forth are on the far right.

136
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:16,070
Yeah. Then underneath diet is tobacco use, which we know is a significant risk factor.

137
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:28,190
So anyway, it's just reiterating what we all are aware of is the importance of a healthy diet and disease prevention.

138
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:36,349
This is an old study, but I consider this a maybe not seminal,

139
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:42,950
but certainly one of those that I keep because despite the fact that it's an older study, the data is so compelling.

140
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:50,930
So this is a prospective cohort study that was conducted in 1980, is actually started earlier.

141
00:17:51,200 --> 00:18:03,080
The nurses health study I think was started in the mid 1970s, but this was a study that had almost 80,000 women aged 34 to 59.

142
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:14,690
And the purpose of this particular study was to assess mortality based on a number of factors, lifestyle factors.

143
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:21,799
So they followed these women. These women had to be free of cardiovascular disease and cancer.

144
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:26,900
So they underwent some pretty extensive screenings and so forth.

145
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:38,659
They followed them for 24 years. They probably still find some of them and they evaluated these lifestyle risk factors.

146
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:48,920
So they evaluated smoking. They evaluated their BMI and they were categorized normal based or obese.

147
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:53,420
Physical activity was assessed. Alcohol consumption and diet.

148
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:59,240
And so these researchers classify lifestyle adversity.

149
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:03,680
So, for example, adversity of smoking is to be a smoker.

150
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:09,200
Physical activity means you exercise less than 30 minutes per day.

151
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:16,490
They had a low diet score using the healthy eating index and alcohol consumption.

152
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:22,490
When you assess these women relative to the mortality of cardiovascular disease or cancer.

153
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:35,450
They found that risk for all five of these risk factors increased risk of mortality eight times with respect to cardiovascular disease.

154
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:41,210
The risk of mortality from cancer was three times the risk.

155
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:46,940
Someone who engages in healthy diet, exercise, non smoking.

156
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:57,200
If you just look at the non smokers in this cohort and just evaluate for diet, physical activity and overweight,

157
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:07,440
you still see the relative risk for cardiovascular disease is three and a half times and mortality from cardiovascular

158
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:16,370
disease three and a half times higher among women who had poor diet or physical activity and were overweight.

159
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:25,010
Even among the non smokers, cancer risk dropped considerably, which indicates that,

160
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:31,440
you know, smoking obviously has a pretty profound risk relative to cancer development.

161
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:44,390
So again, it just really reiterates the importance of diet, physical activity and so forth in terms of reducing mortality risk with cardiovascular.

162
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:54,899
So if we think about I like this socio ecological model because I like the fact

163
00:20:54,900 --> 00:21:02,330
that it has all of the different determinants or factors that influence behavior.

164
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:14,140
So if we think about just dietary behavior and just using this as a framework, what factors influence dietary behavior?

165
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:18,510
So you can think about it in the context of healthy diet or diet quality.

166
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:23,220
Or you can think about it in terms of food access or food choice.

167
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:28,110
But what factors just shout about health literacy?

168
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:35,280
Health literacy. Okay. And you could take another step and say dietary literacy or nutritional literacy.

169
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:46,990
So that would be sort of at the individual level, but it could also be some of these other outer layers in terms of providing those resources.

170
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:55,680
Maybe at the workplace, maybe a place of worship or other places that folks might frequent.

171
00:21:56,190 --> 00:22:01,440
There might be policy in the community that might facilitate that education for us.

172
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:13,890
Affordability. Affordability, yeah. What layers are going to be involved there or which for which level?

173
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:18,970
Levels? Obviously, you can say all of them.

174
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,110
Right. But certainly the outer one public policy.

175
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:26,520
Right, both at the federal, state and even community level.

176
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:32,670
Right. Community organizations likely will play a role in affordability.

177
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:38,400
Maybe. What else? Organization?

178
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:49,960
Yes. So in terms of how organizations may play a role in our food choice or diet quality, you want to take that one step further, Nicole?

179
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:57,490
Like an example, what do you do? So like organizations like schools, what's even available at the school, the choices they have for the kids.

180
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:04,300
Some workplaces have cafeterias will provide free meals or reduced cost meals where some places don't.

181
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,890
Some people have choices. Yes. Yes.

182
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:14,740
And break down from what's in the vending machine to what's being offered in the cafeteria to the whole wellness policy.

183
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:20,970
If you're just I'm just thinking of schools, what else influences food choice or diet quality?

184
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:27,130
I was thinking like culture. So that would intersect with like interpersonal and community.

185
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:31,200
Yes. So culture is going to influence our food choices.

186
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:40,430
Yeah. Yeah. What else do you figure employment is like?

187
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:46,140
What your keep saying, how much money you can put towards food.

188
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:56,790
Okay, so that has multiple levels for everything from what is our unemployment rate in the area.

189
00:23:57,030 --> 00:24:04,170
Are there is there efforts, efforts at the upper level or the outer level to create jobs?

190
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:07,800
Is there effort to retrain?

191
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:12,989
Maybe we live in a community that had a particular industry that's being faded

192
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:21,270
out and we have a whole segment that needs to be trained for other work.

193
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:25,200
So those are all support services that are important. What else?

194
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:32,340
Regulations? Yes. Regulations such as?

195
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:43,900
What would be an example? Despite the FDA and USDA oversight of what's even allowed.

196
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:57,130
Yeah. So that will impact food manufacturers and impact our IT impacts also the public health education of,

197
00:24:57,550 --> 00:25:00,790
you know, what should we be striving for in our food and so forth.

198
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:10,870
Yeah, I think even silly regulations, crises like right now in consumer prices, just absolutely insane, like what the problems are right now.

199
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:25,270
So yeah, you don't always have as much now, but there has been some community specific attempts to regulate.

200
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:34,270
And I'm just thinking and I'm thinking of something that we were talking about in terms of dissuading folks who like tax on,

201
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:42,040
you know, sugar sweetened beverages or something like that. So there can be some regulation not at the obviously at the federal level,

202
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:49,600
but we have had some communities that have implemented taxes to try to steer folks in a more healthy option.

203
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:55,900
That's more extreme example regulation in terms of food assistance.

204
00:25:56,630 --> 00:26:03,340
Right. Also like zoning regulations, like in cities determining where food can be in that food trucks.

205
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:09,280
Yeah. You know how this is actually made out to make it convenient to even get food and what kind of seats can be available?

206
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:15,999
Yes, that's really important. And that's come into play in a number of communities that do not have grocery stores.

207
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,820
So Ypsi, Ypsilanti had an issue where just had no grocery store in the downtown area.

208
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:31,510
I don't know if it's still I haven't been in a while, but they had to jump through some hoops zoning wise to try to find a place where they could,

209
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:35,670
um, you know, even think about bringing in a grocery store.

210
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:40,879
So. Zoning. Yeah. To do that to transportation.

211
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:48,410
To transportation? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, even trying to buy massive amounts of groceries to you can't really take that on a bus.

212
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:59,299
So what do you eat? Yeah. And some folks are I mean, some of you highlighted very nicely that transportation is an issue where in certain communities,

213
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,880
a lot of people rely on public transportation.

214
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:10,160
And I frankly can't imagine carrying, even if you're not carrying the individual plastic bags and you're using totes and stuff.

215
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:17,060
I can't imagine looking grocery home, grocery store in on a bus, even like frozen foods to eat.

216
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:24,980
Right. So the whole perishable issue, which they probably won't perish, but they won't be frozen by the time you get home.

217
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:29,780
Yeah. So those are all any other thoughts about I mean, we know this list is long.

218
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:38,270
Right. And anybody else have you also want to add like maybe like marketing regulations as well for like children?

219
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:42,020
Yes. Especially with like junk food. Yes.

220
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:54,110
And we have had some success in that, but not to the degree that I mean, some countries are really cracking down on marketing to children.

221
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:59,630
So we have a ways to go with that in this country.

222
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:07,790
Yeah. Okay. The reason for brainstorming is this was one of the figures in one of your readings.

223
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:16,890
It's a long reading. So I had said that you guys could, you know, start to this class and finish up for next Monday because it's the same readings.

224
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:22,760
But this is one this is based on the social socio ecological model.

225
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:30,440
And so, you know, I just it very nicely highlights everything from social and cultural norms and support to,

226
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:35,310
you know, knowledge, attitudes and preference.

227
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:43,640
So it's something we didn't necessarily touch upon, but that's an important component, is what's a person's attitude or knowledge about foods.

228
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:47,960
We'll talk a little bit on Monday about attitudes, about sodium.

229
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:56,620
You can get into some interesting discussions with people about sodium levels,

230
00:28:56,790 --> 00:29:01,800
its hazards, food security, food purchasing, power, income and so forth.

231
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:10,350
So anyway, I thought, this is a nice figure, but I like the socio ecological model to think through the various factors.

232
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:24,000
Okay, so this now I just this is we're really just revisiting the prevalence of cardiovascular disease, which is the center column.

233
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:31,020
Excuse me, but if you take into account the prevalence of hypertension.

234
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:37,630
The prevalence of cardiovascular disease drops.

235
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:49,270
So the important point here is that hypertension plays its a significant,

236
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:56,499
significant factor in cardiovascular disease and high blood pressure unfortunately is prevalent in this country.

237
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,730
It's also prevalent worldwide in various places.

238
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:14,350
But for those of you that will be going into cardiology or have an interest in it and those of you in dietetics, this is a key resource here.

239
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:22,330
These are the regulate, these are the regulations, the guidelines for prevention and detection of hypertension or high blood pressure.

240
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:30,830
It's by the it used to be the joint GNC.

241
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:35,380
It's joint and joint national committee.

242
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:45,940
And not that it really matters, but you'll see references to GNC seven and eight have it.

243
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,920
It was a joint collaboration.

244
00:30:51,400 --> 00:31:05,110
American Heart Association's involved the Professional Society for Cardiologists and and I each are involved and this is the most updated version.

245
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:09,550
And so you can see at the top here there's categories of blood pressure in adults.

246
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:12,010
So you can see here what normal.

247
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:24,700
So if you have a systolic blood pressure of less than 120 normal, and then we have the various stages of hypertension that have been outlined there.

248
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:35,720
The other important point on this slide are the cardiovascular risk factors that are associated with hypertension.

249
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:40,340
So these all should look familiar. Diabetes is a risk factor.

250
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:45,170
Hypercholesterolemia. Overweight.

251
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:53,750
Obesity. Physical activity. Healthy diet. Over here are some of the factors that they feel that are relatively fixed.

252
00:31:55,190 --> 00:32:03,500
It's difficult to adjust, although I would argue that I would hope that some of these can be modified.

253
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:08,710
Chronic kidney disease, family history, increased age.

254
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:17,330
Obviously those two their limit the family history and increased age, low socioeconomic and educational status.

255
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:21,830
I'd like to think that that is something that we can modify over time.

256
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:27,560
I'd like to think of that as not being a fixed, unchangeable factor.

257
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:36,970
But it does highlight that those are risk factors, right? Obstructive sleep apnea.

258
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:40,970
That one kind of made me scratch my head a little bit because there are treatments now.

259
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:49,700
Maybe the problem is, is that we just don't have enough folks getting treatment for sleep apnea and then psychosocial stress.

260
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:53,740
Again, I would like to believe that we have that.

261
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:58,360
We will, if we don't now have the ability to help folks with.

262
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:05,010
Managing stress, dealing with stress, and maybe even reducing their stress.

263
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:08,430
Right. I would be more optimistic about that.

264
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:14,880
So, again, these are the guidelines. This is where you would go for information.

265
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:24,300
Again, for those of you that might be using this in the future, this is the prevalence of hypertension.

266
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:29,660
And as we see with cardiovascular disease, it's high. Right.

267
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:37,320
So for most men, it's about 50%.

268
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:41,579
And for women, again, it's in the forties.

269
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:45,930
But if you look at the impact of age, I want to jump ahead.

270
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:53,580
This is hypertension, prevalence of hypertension in the U.S. by age and gender.

271
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:58,630
And you can see women are in the red bars, percent of population on the Y axis.

272
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:05,520
Age on the x. You can see that women have lower prevalence of hypertension when they're younger adults.

273
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:14,550
But then over time, women develop higher rates of prevalence again, that menopausal period.

274
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:19,530
And then you can see that women actually surpass men by 65, 74.

275
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:24,150
And then it's about the same for 75 plus.

276
00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:31,380
So already surpassing them because we're out living them because at that point it could be more women or it could be.

277
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:34,920
So remember that prevalence is just a snapshot, right?

278
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:38,320
This is not the incidence where we're actually right here.

279
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:43,680
But I'm just saying, in terms of prevalence, women surpass men in that age range.

280
00:34:43,890 --> 00:34:47,070
So women gain men.

281
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:50,550
We accumulate more risk, especially after menopause.

282
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:58,830
That doesn't take away from the fact that women are just also accumulating risk factors above and beyond menopause as we age.

283
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:06,660
Okay. And I'm giving you and say it's interesting that it is so low compared to the average woman experience.

284
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:09,990
Is more stress on a daily basis than average man.

285
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:15,209
Several studies have come out with that just from workplace factors and like all the societal pressure.

286
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:21,570
So it's interesting that prevalence is so low despite all of those external risk factors.

287
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:27,150
We may see differences since COVID because we also know that women handle stress differently.

288
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:37,049
Right. But I think COVID has put another layer of stress that may shift that.

289
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:47,280
I don't know if it modifies it, but I, I think there's been some concerns about the stress since COVID or COVID and since COVID.

290
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:52,800
That may change. I'm just curious, but it's good.

291
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:57,719
Your point is well taken and somebody have their hand up. Yeah, I did.

292
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:02,370
And then I realized it was more about heart disease and hypertension.

293
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:06,390
But it isn't, isn't there?

294
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:13,080
I thought that there had been studies that showed that women have this, like, protective extra something around their heart.

295
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:25,330
So it maybe not. Well, I have to confess, I am not well versed in, you know, the differences between the genders.

296
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:30,540
So it's it's a good question to ask and it's a great question to look in the literature.

297
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:51,330
It would be interesting to see, you know what we know what what was determined in terms of gender differences.

298
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,900
But then since COVID also if there's been some work.

299
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:03,820
So all your points are important. And Elizabeth, I.

300
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:07,960
That's a good question. I know, but it would it's worth how long ago?

301
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:13,220
I don't know if I made it up or what. So I don't I would say with a grain of salt.

302
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:16,260
I just remember it stuck with me because I thought it was really, really interesting.

303
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:22,790
So there's probably a level of truth to that because I need to you need to just find out what it is.

304
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:27,350
Right. Yeah. And so that may have something to do with estrogen.

305
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:32,330
Yeah. Because I think it declines once women enter menopause like that.

306
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:38,810
Like protective risk factor. Yeah. If it exists, like is slowly kind of like you see it.

307
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:45,469
The risk for those diseases going up with age as the protective factor might be decreasing.

308
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:51,680
So I wouldn't be surprised if it was with estrogen or something in terms of like the hormone differences between men,

309
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:58,219
the number of tissues that have estrogen receptors. You don't realize, you know what, this is not more than you need to know,

310
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:04,100
but I've had some menopause now and I'm like an amazing appreciation of what

311
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:08,990
the tissues that had estrogen receptors and why estrogen was so important.

312
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,470
Everything from like pull muscles much more frequently.

313
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:20,780
Really? I didn't realize that estrogen was that protective. So that I think that's an important so it's worth looking into.

314
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:27,319
I can follow I can follow up. I just for like my undergrad, we did exercise science.

315
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:31,520
We did a lot of like action looking into like muscle receptors and that kind of stuff too.

316
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:37,729
But it's like they still can't figure out what specific effects like estrogen has on the heart.

317
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:43,610
It's like the last literature, which obviously is probably changed the last couple of years,

318
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:47,209
but they like to narrow it down that it's something to do with estrogen.

319
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:54,950
But there's so many difficult ways of like researching women, especially younger, like with birth control and different contraceptives.

320
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:59,030
Like it's so hard to standardize and like abstinence so crazy off.

321
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:06,200
But I mean, everyone's cycles are just like that, you know, that there's too many uncontrollable factors.

322
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:13,480
And estrogen may play a role with the kidney in terms of how sodium and potassium are handles, too.

323
00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:17,150
I don't know. I'm just seeing it up there that it's not just be the heart.

324
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:23,360
Estrogen may play a role in the stiffness of vessels. That wouldn't shock me, actually.

325
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:27,140
We know that there is and you guys will learn and maternal and child.

326
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:36,949
There is, you know, profound differences that occur in the arterial system or just the circulatory system as an adaptation in pregnancy.

327
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:41,059
So we know hormones can influence our blood vessels.

328
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:44,750
So. Okay.

329
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:49,969
And then, you know, this is not surprising here.

330
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:53,990
We know that there are disparities in the prevalence of hypertension.

331
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:58,190
If we look at not only just gender but race, ethnicity.

332
00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:08,870
And so this is just showing the different news cycles, the blue bar, you know, 1999, 22.

333
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:14,990
Then we have the red bar, which is more recent, and then the yellow bar is the most recent and in cycle.

334
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:26,120
And so you can see that there have been some improvements in the prevalence of hypertension, but in other areas not so.

335
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:30,920
And in some places really we haven't done much. There's really not been much change.

336
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:47,710
So. And also just to point out, the United States is not the only country that struggles with hypertension.

337
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:57,940
This is a worldwide issue. Cardiovascular disease or heart disease is actually the leading cause of death worldwide in adults.

338
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:06,490
So it's not just in the United States. So in this particular figure, the green is.

339
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:09,730
So these are rates per 100,000 population.

340
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:12,850
So the green is less than 65.

341
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:19,569
And then as you shift from green to yellow, you're shifting to the higher rates.

342
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:26,170
And until you get to the highest rate, which is sort of a dark burgundy, that's greater than 290.

343
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:34,240
So there are places you know, there's regions in the world that have rates that are very, very high.

344
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:45,000
So. Important point here is just this is a global issue, not just in the United States.

345
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:55,040
I wanted to just shout out. There's an optional reading on canvas.

346
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:59,720
It's definitely on today's class. I can't remember if I carried it over for Monday.

347
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:04,700
It is not terribly long and you can kind of skim it.

348
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:09,650
It is really well worth reading. There's some really interesting aspects.

349
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:17,480
This is from the reading and it covers the racial disparity in disparities in hypertension.

350
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:26,420
And it looks at, you know, it, you know, factors that contribute to hypertension are in the red.

351
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:29,600
Then we have in the yellow.

352
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:40,939
These are areas that there's acknowledgment that depending on the ethnicity, there may be variable response to pharmaceuticals,

353
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:48,380
to the medication that has not been explored or has not been adequately investigated.

354
00:42:50,390 --> 00:43:02,660
Risk assessment acknowledging that we don't have an appropriate risk assessment tool yet that takes into account ethnicity.

355
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:07,010
And they're developing it. They're working on it, but it requires a lot of data.

356
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:13,640
Europe actually has a risk assessment tool that does take into account ethnicity.

357
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:23,840
So the United States is working on that. So that's important because we may be not reaching some individuals using the current

358
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:31,640
tool we have and we may be overreaching or we may be diagnosing some folks that,

359
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:35,420
you know, it's not as much of a concern.

360
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:46,460
So the tools that are being used to assess risk need to be reevaluated in the context of different ethnicities.

361
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:56,290
So and then they're just talking about novel and culturally specific treatment strategies,

362
00:43:56,290 --> 00:44:06,460
as well as advancing research efforts to improve their the data that they have and that all of these are ongoing right now.

363
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:15,040
But again, it's a really interesting article. It also talks about how there's differences in sodium handling and potassium handling.

364
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:21,650
It differs by niceties, and that's an area that needs to be understood as well.

365
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:25,030
So I just wanted to do a shout out to this article.

366
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:40,000
And then lastly, I just wanted to highlight that I'm sort of circling back to that slide that had the guidelines for diagnosing hypertension.

367
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:46,660
This is part of that article. These are the non-pharmacological approaches to treating.

368
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:54,130
So that document has screening or diagnosis as well as treatment management.

369
00:44:54,280 --> 00:45:01,030
So that's a key document. Again, for those of you that maybe work in cardiology in the future, this is something you always want to know.

370
00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:06,700
If somebody asked you where would you go for treatment of, this would be the one you would want to use.

371
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:17,709
And you can see that the first level of treatment is not necessarily giving them hypertensive antihypertensive drugs.

372
00:45:17,710 --> 00:45:20,950
It's weight loss, it's a heart healthy diet.

373
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:27,700
And we're going to talk more about that on Monday. Sodium reduction, which is part of a heart healthy diet.

374
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:33,280
Potassium increase in potassium in the diet.

375
00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:40,300
Again, dietary physical activity as well as alcohol consumption.

376
00:45:41,770 --> 00:45:48,879
So these are all steps that are initiated when someone is first diagnosed with hypertension,

377
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:54,880
because ideally you want to reduce hypertension if you can, in the non-pharmacological approach.

378
00:45:55,030 --> 00:46:03,880
Now that being said, if somebody has very high, high blood pressure, if just being diagnosed, they may be given a med as well.

379
00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:10,180
But these are guidelines for treatment in addition to the Met.

380
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:25,600
Okay. So we're going to revisit this on Monday, talking more about the diet and some of the issues related to sodium.

381
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:35,690
But one thing that I just wanted to highlight is the article that you have for your reading for today as well as next Monday, the one by.

382
00:46:39,370 --> 00:46:45,290
Atherton. Chris Atherton. At the very end, the part of the document.

383
00:46:45,310 --> 00:46:54,850
There are tables that have community based interventions, some of which have been shown to be effective.

384
00:46:55,660 --> 00:47:00,760
So for those of you who've had cardiovascular disease or heart disease as your

385
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:06,790
topic and you don't have to necessarily have cardiovascular disease as topic,

386
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:15,850
many a number of these interventions are just about improving diet, improving lifestyle factors to reduce disease burden.

387
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,700
And some of these have been shown to be effective.

388
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:26,740
So for those of you that are looking for an effective, community based intervention, this is a nice resource.

389
00:47:28,450 --> 00:47:33,010
You don't have to use just the resources that I provided you in class on Wednesday.

390
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:38,050
Okay. So okay,

391
00:47:38,290 --> 00:47:43,419
so let's take a five minute break and then we're going to revisit I've got a few slides to

392
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:48,520
go over your last project as well as your oral presentations at the end of the semester.

393
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:58,050
So let's take a five minute break and then we'll reconvene. Three pickup trucks.

394
00:48:01,130 --> 00:48:09,160
Okay. Yes, I can get it on the Internet.

395
00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:16,130
Yes. I mean, they're not showing up right now.

396
00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:19,039
Yes, I know. We're having these hearings tomorrow.

397
00:48:22,469 --> 00:48:22,743
Yeah, I have to study as a potential site. I also have to learn anything.

398
00:48:27,241 --> 00:48:30,811
I know. I'm having it.

399
00:48:33,421 --> 00:48:40,441
Okay. So this is your last project?

400
00:48:42,091 --> 00:48:48,931
Students usually expressed this is kind of a fun project, so you guys need to have some fun and sort out.

401
00:48:49,651 --> 00:48:54,031
But it's also skill building. Right. So that's the key point is skill building.

402
00:48:54,041 --> 00:49:02,910
So your last project is to develop a one page advocacy document and your what you're going to be developing

403
00:49:02,911 --> 00:49:10,821
this one pager for is an intervention program that is going to you are going to identify using the resources.

404
00:49:10,831 --> 00:49:18,241
So again, for those of you that maybe weren't in class on last Wednesday, please go back and review those slides, especially at the end.

405
00:49:18,541 --> 00:49:25,141
There's a number of websites that you can use to identify an evidence based intervention program,

406
00:49:25,861 --> 00:49:35,851
and you're going to identify one that will be address one of the priorities that you found in your assessment.

407
00:49:36,091 --> 00:49:42,541
So it's nice because it takes what you found and priorities and you now can find a intervention program.

408
00:49:43,051 --> 00:49:46,410
The caveat that I said before on Wednesday, I'm going to say it again.

409
00:49:46,411 --> 00:49:51,841
I might even say it on Monday. You guys don't have a ton of time to find an intervention.

410
00:49:51,841 --> 00:49:59,250
So obviously in practice there's going to be a lot more deliberation, you know, interventions that look reasonable.

411
00:49:59,251 --> 00:50:06,571
But then in practice, you'd want to make sure that they would be transferable to the community and of interest, things like that.

412
00:50:06,721 --> 00:50:10,561
You guys don't have time for that. You might have little time, but.

413
00:50:11,161 --> 00:50:15,721
So the key point here is you just need to find something, okay?

414
00:50:16,021 --> 00:50:19,741
Because what you're going to be actually graded on is your one pager.

415
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:24,121
So find an intervention.

416
00:50:24,331 --> 00:50:31,231
If you need help, reach out to me. But it doesn't have to be the perfect response to one of your priorities.

417
00:50:31,471 --> 00:50:39,871
Okay. Again, in practice, you would have much more time and you'd be part of a committee to identify an evidence based program.

418
00:50:41,101 --> 00:50:45,811
So this is from the instructions that the instructions should be accessible now.

419
00:50:48,541 --> 00:50:51,551
So it's due on December 5th.

420
00:50:51,571 --> 00:50:54,841
Your one pager at 10:00.

421
00:50:56,461 --> 00:51:05,250
This is essentially non-negotiable, unless you're, you know, family emergency or send me an email because you have COVID or something, your illness.

422
00:51:05,251 --> 00:51:12,391
But the reason why it needs to be done is because you're going to then be presenting an oral

423
00:51:12,391 --> 00:51:18,031
presentation about your intervention and that is going to occur on the fifth and the seventh,

424
00:51:18,211 --> 00:51:24,750
depending on which day you sign up for. Okay. So back to the advocacy one pager.

425
00:51:24,751 --> 00:51:37,231
The purpose of this is that it's the purpose in general for this project is that it's important then write an assessment, his identified priorities.

426
00:51:38,041 --> 00:51:44,370
And so obviously a community is going to want to address and not met an unmet need or concern.

427
00:51:44,371 --> 00:51:54,871
Obviously if they went to the steps and financial steps to conduct an assessment, obviously there's interest in community action.

428
00:51:57,961 --> 00:52:09,711
So first step is to identify an intervention program and then once you identify it, you're going to develop an advocacy one pager.

429
00:52:09,721 --> 00:52:12,931
So let's take a step back and just talk about what a one pager is.

430
00:52:15,031 --> 00:52:22,441
So this sort of piggybacks onto what Mark Hamill Miller from food gatherers when she was talking about food policy and advocacy.

431
00:52:22,831 --> 00:52:34,081
Advocacy is when you are doing some kind of activity in which you want to recommend or you persuade for some type of action.

432
00:52:35,131 --> 00:52:41,731
We often think of advocacy with respect to policy. We have a lot of advocacy groups at the Capitol.

433
00:52:42,001 --> 00:52:52,141
Right. And federal legislation and so forth are to advocate for or against certain policies that will be made in the law.

434
00:52:52,621 --> 00:52:56,041
But advocacy can even you know, you can think about it.

435
00:52:56,461 --> 00:53:02,901
I'd like to. Martell's example, you guys, when you applied for grad school, you were advocating for yourself.

436
00:53:03,111 --> 00:53:09,591
So there's a whole spectrum of advocacy for it to be applied.

437
00:53:11,571 --> 00:53:25,251
The one pager is a very useful tool for advocacy, and at one time it was probably considered one of the more used tools.

438
00:53:25,321 --> 00:53:37,521
Today there is also infographics and so forth. But a one pager is what policymakers rely on to learn about a topic quickly to make decisions.

439
00:53:37,731 --> 00:53:42,111
So again, one pagers were developed by individuals.

440
00:53:43,071 --> 00:53:51,681
For example, food gatherers wants to influence the development of an act, a law.

441
00:53:52,191 --> 00:54:01,731
And so they might hand our senators a one pager that provides a background.

442
00:54:01,741 --> 00:54:13,641
What is the concern? What is the problem? What is the solution so that that person who began a senator can be brought up to

443
00:54:13,641 --> 00:54:18,830
speed on the topic quickly and oftentimes it's handed to them as a deliverable,

444
00:54:18,831 --> 00:54:22,131
in other words, something they can take and learn more about.

445
00:54:23,211 --> 00:54:32,331
So this was developed for policy, especially in Congress or working with congressional members and so forth.

446
00:54:33,201 --> 00:54:38,600
But it can apply here because it's nothing more than an advocacy document.

447
00:54:38,601 --> 00:54:43,311
And so you guys will be advocating for an intervention program.

448
00:54:43,821 --> 00:54:48,801
When you give your presentation, you just will assume you're at some kind of community meeting.

449
00:54:48,801 --> 00:54:54,951
There could be city leaders, stake holders and so forth. And you are advocating for this intervention.

450
00:54:56,691 --> 00:55:08,031
So that's how are you going to apply it? I wanted you guys to have just because a one pager is a skill set is a skill that you can highlight.

451
00:55:08,601 --> 00:55:12,381
I wanted you guys to be aware of what one pager looks like.

452
00:55:12,381 --> 00:55:21,081
The policy level might occur. I think both of these were used at our state capitol.

453
00:55:22,281 --> 00:55:25,821
So the first one is the repeal of the helmet law.

454
00:55:26,451 --> 00:55:37,581
And you guys didn't photocopy well. But in this box here, it just says Michigan's Universal Helmet Law was partially repealed in April 2012,

455
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:41,421
in a recently published study of motorcycle crash data.

456
00:55:41,781 --> 00:55:52,251
The University of Michigan Injury Center found that a partial repeal of the helmet law resulted in a 25% decline in statewide helmet use,

457
00:55:53,721 --> 00:55:59,751
which is substantial and a 14% increase in head injury trauma.

458
00:56:01,611 --> 00:56:16,761
So this was a one pager that was given to members at the Capitol here in the state advocating for repealing or to reinstate the law,

459
00:56:17,001 --> 00:56:26,391
yet reinstate the law. And so you can see here there's an introduction, there's a whole background section of the problem, and they use some tables.

460
00:56:27,231 --> 00:56:32,871
Then they talked about the impact of the repeal and the financial implications.

461
00:56:34,551 --> 00:56:40,731
So in this case, the problem or the solution is, as Hannah said, reinstating a law.

462
00:56:40,911 --> 00:56:47,061
But here they spent quite a bit of time the implications of what that law, the repeal has done.

463
00:56:47,451 --> 00:56:55,071
This is a great example of a one pager, and this would have been handed to those who are working in the Capitol.

464
00:56:55,491 --> 00:57:05,361
You'll note that on the back. So you'll note that for citations, because this is a small document, you don't want it cluttered.

465
00:57:05,631 --> 00:57:12,021
So note the citations of super scripts either at the end of a bullet or at the end of a title.

466
00:57:12,261 --> 00:57:19,011
That's what you guys are going to use for your one pager, and then the citations are on the back side.

467
00:57:19,251 --> 00:57:25,881
So you don't want any citations at the bottom. You want them at the back and on the second chart, second page.

468
00:57:26,721 --> 00:57:32,791
This is another example of a one pager. Again, this used state capital.

469
00:57:32,811 --> 00:57:37,341
This one was urging, oh, no, this is Congress, not the state.

470
00:57:37,821 --> 00:57:46,611
University of Michigan Injury Center urges Congress to provide $11 million to the CDC, their Injury Control Research Center.

471
00:57:46,821 --> 00:57:52,971
So they provided background, the impact of that, the dollars and how it would be used.

472
00:57:53,181 --> 00:57:56,831
So again, this is another example of a one page or.

473
00:57:56,951 --> 00:58:03,401
It's used with policymakers. So I want you guys to see what one is look like.

474
00:58:04,511 --> 00:58:08,171
But this is how they were originally developed to use with policymakers.

475
00:58:11,651 --> 00:58:20,261
That being said, one pagers can be implemented in many different settings.

476
00:58:23,611 --> 00:58:28,741
These are some other resources for you in terms of using one pagers.

477
00:58:29,011 --> 00:58:36,391
There's a public health one, the first, and these are actually U of M researchers barber Israel community because

478
00:58:36,391 --> 00:58:41,461
Pretoria research the first one and then the Institute for Health Care Policy.

479
00:58:41,491 --> 00:58:51,121
Very brief overview of using one pagers. Okay, so your one pager needs to have a title.

480
00:58:51,121 --> 00:58:55,231
And so I've really just outlined what your one pager needs.

481
00:58:56,011 --> 00:58:59,251
It needs a title. And why is that such a big deal?

482
00:58:59,671 --> 00:59:14,291
Well, if you look at the. The effect of the Michigan's helmet law repeal that jumps out and grabs you right here.

483
00:59:14,291 --> 00:59:18,551
One pager needs to be a document that somebody actually wants to look at and read.

484
00:59:19,601 --> 00:59:28,031
So so some things that seem fairly innocuous, like a title, actually plays an important role, grabs your attention.

485
00:59:30,971 --> 00:59:36,881
And there's some, you know, just some dialog or verbiage of what should be included.

486
00:59:37,511 --> 00:59:41,681
Then the next section of your one pager is going to be the problem.

487
00:59:41,831 --> 00:59:46,421
And the problem is your nutrition concern or health topic.

488
00:59:46,421 --> 00:59:47,831
That was your assessment.

489
00:59:48,161 --> 01:00:00,131
And so you can use some of your statistics, whether it's in bullets or small graphs, you can use that to populate the section of your one pager.

490
01:00:02,471 --> 01:00:12,071
This is an example and I realize it's small on course resources on the home page where you've gotten your other resources for projects.

491
01:00:12,221 --> 01:00:14,861
There's now a section for your one pager,

492
01:00:16,211 --> 01:00:23,500
and there is a PDF that has examples of one pagers that students have done in the past so that you can take a look at,

493
01:00:23,501 --> 01:00:30,881
and this one is in there so you can see it better. But you'll note at the top there's a title,

494
01:00:31,991 --> 01:00:40,661
and then there's a subtitle or a brief sentence that provides the reader an explanation of what the program or intervention is,

495
01:00:42,191 --> 01:00:44,741
just gives that reader kind of a brief overview.

496
01:00:45,881 --> 01:00:53,711
Then we have the whole problem section of the one pager, and this student just took information from her needs assessment.

497
01:00:55,501 --> 01:01:08,101
To. You know, to reiterate what the problem is and then had bullets on the side to emphasize key findings and points.

498
01:01:09,241 --> 01:01:14,791
The solution is an intervention. And so she has.

499
01:01:14,791 --> 01:01:19,261
What's the purpose of the program? What are the intervention strategies?

500
01:01:19,771 --> 01:01:24,151
So what do we mean by intervention strategies? I want to clarify that for everyone.

501
01:01:27,351 --> 01:01:33,201
If you read an intervention, if you're reading, usually we've read about interventions that are research tested.

502
01:01:33,541 --> 01:01:39,321
What what does it mean when there's sections of intervention strategies within that document?

503
01:01:44,421 --> 01:01:51,141
Melissa, the steps they took for each to implement the program as a whole.

504
01:01:53,631 --> 01:02:00,290
So you're. Yes, you're on the right track. So it's that but it's not the actual process of implementation.

505
01:02:00,291 --> 01:02:04,941
It's the components of the intervention.

506
01:02:05,481 --> 01:02:14,901
It's not just one thing. And intervention is not let's just assume it's an intervention for supporting weight loss of adolescents.

507
01:02:17,651 --> 01:02:23,651
It's not just one strategy to help adolescents lose weight.

508
01:02:23,651 --> 01:02:27,911
Such as what? I don't know. A dietary education component.

509
01:02:28,451 --> 01:02:34,691
It's going to have that. That's one strategy. There'll be another strategy to promote physical activity.

510
01:02:34,991 --> 01:02:38,021
There'll be another strategy to help reduce screen time.

511
01:02:38,681 --> 01:02:41,861
And within those strategies, there might be multiple strategies.

512
01:02:42,101 --> 01:02:46,481
There might be another strategy that involves family involvement.

513
01:02:47,681 --> 01:02:54,311
So interventions, there are multiple components that make up the intervention.

514
01:02:55,091 --> 01:02:58,421
And that's what we that's what I mean by intervention strategies.

515
01:02:58,871 --> 01:03:05,591
So when you're reading about an intervention, you know, there will often just be sort of weight reduction.

516
01:03:05,711 --> 01:03:12,881
But in the back of your mind, you're like, Oh, but what activities were involved in that intervention?

517
01:03:13,281 --> 01:03:20,471
Okay, so you don't have to get super detailed, but you need to highlight what the different strategies were.

518
01:03:20,741 --> 01:03:28,721
Even if it's just bullets so that the person reading gets a good idea of what the intervention involves, that makes sense to everybody.

519
01:03:28,931 --> 01:03:33,551
So that's what I mean by strategies. An intervention is not just one activity.

520
01:03:33,551 --> 01:03:40,031
It's going to be multiple. If it's a good intervention. So the solution.

521
01:03:40,511 --> 01:03:44,201
And then over here, she has a whole section on the evidence.

522
01:03:44,561 --> 01:03:48,611
How do we know if you're advocating for an intervention?

523
01:03:48,851 --> 01:03:52,000
You will want to make sure there's an evidence section.

524
01:03:52,001 --> 01:03:58,391
And I would argue it should be highlighted that it was shown to be effective in some capacity.

525
01:03:59,681 --> 01:04:02,711
So this is another example.

526
01:04:03,041 --> 01:04:06,251
Again, I know it's hard to see per say this one.

527
01:04:06,641 --> 01:04:12,041
It's just to give you an idea of how one pages can be formatted.

528
01:04:12,461 --> 01:04:22,601
Creative formatting over here. So the problem over here is the description of the intervention or program and here very fully other results.

529
01:04:28,571 --> 01:04:35,371
So the solution here is I just want to make sure that you guys take the time to read the instructions so that you address all this.

530
01:04:35,381 --> 01:04:38,951
What is the goal and purpose? What are the strategies?

531
01:04:40,781 --> 01:04:43,391
The other important point is what are the outcomes?

532
01:04:43,541 --> 01:04:54,341
So in my example of weight reduction for adolescents, the primary outcome might be literally seeing a reduction in weight from pre to post, right?

533
01:04:54,671 --> 01:05:02,081
They measure their weight pre intervention, they measure their weight again post intervention and they hope to see an improvement.

534
01:05:02,591 --> 01:05:11,021
That would be the primary outcome is probably weight and there might be one other, but there's probably other secondary outcomes or other outcomes.

535
01:05:12,041 --> 01:05:15,861
Maybe you see an increase in physical activity from pre to post.

536
01:05:16,331 --> 01:05:19,871
Maybe we see an improvement in blood pressure.

537
01:05:21,191 --> 01:05:27,621
So just be mindful that there may be more than one outcome that an intervention is trying to improve.

538
01:05:27,671 --> 01:05:33,131
It might be an improvement in understanding of or knowledge of healthy diet.

539
01:05:34,661 --> 01:05:38,471
Okay. So I have here what is the primary outcome?

540
01:05:38,771 --> 01:05:49,091
But then just acknowledge that there may be secondary or just other outcomes and then finally provide evidence of the intervention.

541
01:05:50,081 --> 01:05:55,721
And there's some other information just in terms of formatting.

542
01:05:55,931 --> 01:06:04,601
This is just about being creative. Make use of your space and make use of your words.

543
01:06:04,931 --> 01:06:15,911
In other words, make it count. There's also number five says includes some white space if all you have is just text.

544
01:06:16,751 --> 01:06:27,581
I have to admit this one, even though it's considered a good one pager for policymakers and it does have white space.

545
01:06:27,851 --> 01:06:31,841
So it's not as though you're totally discouraged in reading it, but there's a lot in text here.

546
01:06:32,231 --> 01:06:35,891
So again, using bullets.

547
01:06:36,491 --> 01:06:41,771
That's why I like this one, because it's not quite as, you know, there's shorter things to read.

548
01:06:43,241 --> 01:06:51,491
So those are the instructions. I think that's it. There's examples again, in of course, resources there's a PDF.

549
01:06:51,701 --> 01:07:01,391
So take a look at that just so you get some ideas. And then lastly, you're all going to conduct an oral presentation.

550
01:07:01,391 --> 01:07:04,631
It's only 3 minutes long. It's going to be like a really fast TEDTalk.

551
01:07:06,551 --> 01:07:11,651
And all you're going to be doing here is just showing to the class what your invention was.

552
01:07:12,251 --> 01:07:19,511
But the goal and purpose, what the intervention strategies were, are, and the evidence.

553
01:07:20,711 --> 01:07:25,781
So it's an opportunity to just share what you found. There is a signup sheet.

554
01:07:26,951 --> 01:07:30,461
You can either sign up for December 5th or December 7th.

555
01:07:31,811 --> 01:07:37,031
So just let that link and you can go ahead and sign up for your oral presentation.

556
01:07:37,361 --> 01:07:42,010
Okay. As we get closer, I'll give you some more instructions.

557
01:07:42,011 --> 01:07:47,561
But these are just the guidelines for your oral presentation.

558
01:07:47,801 --> 01:07:53,381
So that's what you'll be doing at the end of the semester. They're all linked overlap.

559
01:07:54,281 --> 01:07:59,411
So they're all related. I'm. All right.

560
01:08:02,381 --> 01:08:07,601
That's it on the results section, because we're advocating for us to try something new program.

561
01:08:08,291 --> 01:08:13,121
Other results that they tried this program in Philadelphia, etc.

562
01:08:13,391 --> 01:08:17,651
Oh, no comparison to where it's been successful.

563
01:08:17,771 --> 01:08:23,351
So again, in practice, you know, ideally this is gets back to the transferability.

564
01:08:24,281 --> 01:08:28,511
Ideally you'd want it like for example, if it was something that was done in Philadelphia,

565
01:08:29,021 --> 01:08:35,801
you then want to ask the question, okay, is it with a population that similar to my population, is the environment similar?

566
01:08:36,641 --> 01:08:46,901
That is something if you have time to think about rate, but in practice you probably have more time to look into it.

567
01:08:47,411 --> 01:08:53,921
So one thing that you'll want to do is just make sure that if your intervention program

568
01:08:53,921 --> 01:09:01,691
was implemented in another city or just town or what have you somewhere in the document,

569
01:09:01,691 --> 01:09:04,721
you want to let the person know that it was.

570
01:09:04,931 --> 01:09:12,761
Usually students do it under when they're describing the program. They can say this was originally implemented in Waltham, Massachusetts.

571
01:09:13,571 --> 01:09:20,321
It's you know, we recommend that's going to be implemented in Ann Arbor or Detroit and so forth.

572
01:09:21,191 --> 01:09:26,021
The examples the students actually put up the Indianapolis once.

573
01:09:27,101 --> 01:09:31,721
If it was me personally, I would have taken Minneapolis out and put Ann Arbor for the community.

574
01:09:31,721 --> 01:09:38,621
Just changed the name a little bit, but somewhere in that document you want to let the reader know that it was originally implemented in Minneapolis,

575
01:09:38,861 --> 01:09:43,251
but we're proposing it for Ann Arbor that address your question?

576
01:09:44,381 --> 01:09:48,551
Yes. So somehow when we have our results section, it's something where, you know,

577
01:09:48,551 --> 01:09:55,421
you're going to most interventions, many of them research tested or tested in one community.

578
01:09:55,661 --> 01:10:02,861
But then if they're found successful, then they try to do what they have to do to adapt, to be able to bring it into other communities.

579
01:10:03,101 --> 01:10:06,731
So it is going to be expected. You're not finding interventions.

580
01:10:07,071 --> 01:10:12,431
You're going to find for Ann Arbor or Ypsi. You're going to find interventions that maybe have been implemented in Texas.

581
01:10:12,881 --> 01:10:16,091
But you think it would be a great program to bring here.

582
01:10:17,111 --> 01:10:24,131
And so it's understood that it may have a name or a community that's outside of here.

583
01:10:24,431 --> 01:10:29,261
The other thing I just want to highlight, it's please do not select something like Wet or snap.

584
01:10:30,221 --> 01:10:35,761
Those are already established agencies to find an intervention program.

585
01:10:36,041 --> 01:10:40,721
Okay. All right. So after all that.

586
01:10:43,921 --> 01:10:47,191
And that Texas boy that he ran the tonight.
