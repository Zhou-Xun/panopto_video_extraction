Hi, I'm Kelly Kidwell faculty in
the Department of Biostatistics at

3
00:00:17,706 --> 00:00:20,820
the University of
Michigan School Public Health.

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,150
I'm here to tell you why a little
bit of biostatistics can be helpful.

5
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:29,060
In particular, interpreting and
analyzing public health studies.

6
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:31,340
When I tell people that
I'm a biostatistician,

7
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:34,370
I'm often met with confusion and
disinterest.

8
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:36,210
Statistics is off-putting enough and

9
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:40,420
adding bio in front of it seems
to create even more bewilderment.

10
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:41,260
But statistics and

11
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:45,540
biostatistics shouldn't be confusing,
so I hope that I convey a little bit

12
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:50,820
of why you shouldn't have feelings
of aversion towards biostatistics.

13
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,380
Biostatistics is simply the application
of statistics to public health,

14
00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:00,310
it involves the design, analysis,
and interpretation of data or

15
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:06,080
information to biomedical, environmental,
or more broadly public health settings.

16
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,470
Biostatisticians work in
a wide variety of areas.

17
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:13,320
They may design and analyze clinical
trials to find beneficial treatments.

18
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,930
They may discover genetic variants
that are associated with disease.

19
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:21,660
They may design and analyze surveys or
understand how normal brain function

20
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:25,140
differs from the brain function
of diseased individuals.

21
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,300
Biostatisticians work in
a wide variety of areas too.

22
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,902
They may be found in academia,
government or industry.

23
00:01:31,902 --> 00:01:35,530
So there many opportunities if you
are interested in biostatistics.

24
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:38,590
And if you're not interested, it still
might be helpful to know a little but

25
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,200
of biostatistics.

26
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,910
Quantitative reading skills can be helpful
in evaluating public health studies that

27
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:46,080
we see in the media every day.

28
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,000
Some studies have said that eating more
chocolate can lead to a Nobel Prize or,

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,530
vaccines can lead to autism.

30
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:53,620
Or, beer is healthier than milk.

31
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:57,020
Some of these biostatistical skills
will help you critically evaluate and

32
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,830
analyze public health studies and

33
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:03,740
give you a bit more information
to see if the results are valid.

34
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:07,560
There are many important issues when
evaluating public health studies.

35
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,630
Some of those includes study design,
which will be discussed separately.

36
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:16,130
So we'll spend our time talking about
population and sample, sample size,

37
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:23,310
practical vs statistical significance,
bias, and correlation and causation.
