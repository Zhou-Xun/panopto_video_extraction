1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:11,380
Think she did. You know, that certainly gives them.

2
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:16,050
Yeah. We tried medical nutrition therapy last semester.

3
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,780
So it would have been the same person. It would have been loose lips.

4
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,010
Oh, really? Yeah. So I wonder to change the exam structure for this semester.

5
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:35,700
I think she. There is a change to one semester or two semesters with an empty one and 2 to 1 and two this year.

6
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:43,319
And other is to next semester. Yeah. And she was talking about how previously she only had like a material final.

7
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,040
But now we have three exams because it's like.

8
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

9
00:00:52,980 --> 00:01:01,950
So, um, speaking of exams, there's a, there's not an exam, but a quiz questions like what was on Friday?

10
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:05,730
Same thing. Open note, open book. And it will cover material after.

11
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:17,460
From now, up until the next lecture on our discussion, I should say, on Thursday.

12
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:24,390
So after the material that you've seen on Adaptive Immunity and again, open book.

13
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:33,900
The purpose of this is to reinforce these principles so that when we talk about papers, I remember that now from, you know, whatever you are reading.

14
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:38,639
Okay. I've changed the order of lectures.

15
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,700
I've filled out the rest of the schedule for October.

16
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:53,520
And ideally, we would be talking about fish oil capsules and cardiovascular disease events and a clinical study.

17
00:01:54,090 --> 00:02:03,510
But I didn't post the paper soon enough, and I wanted to give you the more time to look at that paper.

18
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:07,170
That's going to be a next week, next Tuesday.

19
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:15,390
Okay. We're going to revisit that concept. And in terms of practice, so today we're going to be talking about food allergy as a background.

20
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,850
And then I want to remind you again, October 15th is the deadline for the graphical abstract.

21
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:24,600
If you have questions about a paper, some of you have sent me examples,

22
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:34,260
but I need to see it and approve it before you go forward with creating this your turning in this assignment.

23
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:49,290
So I have posted that on the assignments, link and canvas and hopefully everybody can upload their assignment now if they've finished it early.

24
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:58,139
Any questions before I move forward and then please remind me to start Panopto.

25
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:05,040
What if I forget I did it today and John Hart isn't here and I don't know where he is.

26
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:09,780
He might not be feeling well because Covid's been going around campus.

27
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:17,250
Okay, so for today, for food allergy, for learning objectives, there's a lot of information here.

28
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:21,480
I want you to understand the prevalence and demographics of food allergies.

29
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:26,520
I want you to be able to describe the types of foods that cause allergies.

30
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:31,710
Food allergies. Explain the importance of food allergies to public health.

31
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:46,430
Describe the systematic of the systemic effects of food allergens in terms of their ability to cause a really profound reaction like anaphylaxis.

32
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:54,590
To identify the mechanisms of food allergy reactions and counter regulatory strategies.

33
00:03:55,670 --> 00:04:01,370
And then finally, to describe the treatment and prevention strategies for reactions to food allergens.

34
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:09,770
So just a heads up of how I structure learning objectives and the words that I use to describe this.

35
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:20,630
When I say understand, I want you to be able to provide a summary of the prevalence and demographics.

36
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:29,270
When I say describe, you should be able to write down and detail what types of foods causes allergies.

37
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:35,840
When I say explain, I would like you to be able to, given a scenario,

38
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:44,960
explain how in this case food allergies are relevant to public health and then identify when I use the term identify.

39
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:55,750
I'm looking for you to be able to answer a multiple choice question that's more detailed or a fill in the blank or matching type of question.

40
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:02,450
So that's just a heads up of how I structure the learning objectives and what to expect on the quiz.

41
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:07,160
Okay. All right.

42
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,229
I always like to start out with the story for the lectures.

43
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:15,890
And today the story is about a tragic scenario.

44
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:20,170
This is the Georges family camp, Sacramento.

45
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:26,360
It's a family camp where parents, kids can enjoy being outdoors and having group activities.

46
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:30,350
And the families have four children.

47
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:49,940
And unfortunately, Natalie, who is Natalie is here believe Natalie experienced a very significant demise from exposure to peanut butter.

48
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:57,560
So this news report appeared in a newspaper in Sacramento, California.

49
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:05,420
So Natalie was a camp member and her her father's a urologist.

50
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:12,620
And her mother is very much aware of issues related to having children with food allergies.

51
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:17,660
So everybody is aware or should have been aware that Natalie has food allergies.

52
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:23,210
She goes to this camp. There are lots of dessert items that are presented.

53
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:30,620
And she's told that Rice Krispies, that Rice Krispie treat is just marshmallow and rice and she doesn't have to worry.

54
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:40,220
So she takes one bite of this Rice Krispie treat, and she didn't know that it contained peanut butter.

55
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:47,840
So immediately she has no symptoms. But within 20 minutes, she starts to develop symptoms that are consistent with anaphylaxis.

56
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:52,070
Labored breathing. She's starting to feel faint. She's turning red.

57
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:55,130
She's getting hives, breaking out all over her body.

58
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:59,420
She's getting nasal congestion and so on.

59
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:04,850
So her father's a urologist, and her parents are prepared for such an event.

60
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:10,130
They have no idea how much peanut she has consumed.

61
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:18,860
So they give her antihistamine initially to block histamines effects on the systemic responses.

62
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:27,890
Okay. And then he injects her with an epinephrine auto injector, two auto injectors.

63
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:32,390
And her symptoms are still really severe.

64
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:36,620
So they use the camps auto injector.

65
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:44,040
So she gets three injections of this rescue device, which is essentially epinephrine and epinephrine.

66
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:49,729
And what it does is it causes the airways to open up. It's a barrier to agonist.

67
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:52,850
Epinephrine is cursors here, airways to open up.

68
00:07:53,600 --> 00:08:03,920
And it enhances the cardiovascular system to pump more blood throughout the body to prevent circulatory collapse.

69
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:11,330
And despite these heroic efforts to revive her, she died as a consequence of this exposure.

70
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:20,330
Yeah or these name brand Rice Krispies treats are they like these are homemade.

71
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:27,520
Yeah. Go ahead. Why didn't the three you.

72
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:31,950
You know, not like a lot of. It's a lot. That's a lot.

73
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:39,360
Yeah. Her sensitivity to the allergen was so significant that it still wasn't enough to reverse the symptoms.

74
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:46,780
So this kind of thing happens more frequently than you would think.

75
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:51,790
Okay. So here's some food allergy facts.

76
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:57,790
And this is from a website, Food Allergy Facts and Education, posted in 2020.

77
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:05,950
Based on this information, about 32 million people in the U.S. have food allergies.

78
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:14,080
That's about 11% of adults. Approximately 26,000,008% children.

79
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:19,390
Or one in 13. Two in every classroom have food allergies.

80
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:31,750
And there's no cure. There's just treatment afterward to kind of prevent their symptoms becoming so significant that it leads to a bad outcome.

81
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,750
So the way this is treated, or I should say is it's a preventative action.

82
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,400
So this is avoidance.

83
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:52,550
So you avoid anything that contains an allergen that you might be exposed to, and that could come in the form of many different types of foods.

84
00:09:53,900 --> 00:10:01,520
You hear more about peanut allergies than anything else because peanuts are everywhere and very,

85
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:07,909
very small exposure to peanuts or something that has been prepared.

86
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:12,950
Where peanuts were prepared is enough to provoke this type of reaction.

87
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:22,660
I'm going to show you a bunch of mechanisms that are thought to contribute to these reactions.

88
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:26,290
But there's a lot about food allergies that we don't understand.

89
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:41,140
So, for example, why would a child who's sitting on the other end of the classroom have a reaction to another child who just a peanut butter sandwich?

90
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:46,150
How would how would that exposure be enough to provoke an allergic reaction?

91
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:52,720
We don't we don't really understand perhaps this through mechanisms that haven't been clearly defined at this point.

92
00:10:53,210 --> 00:11:05,080
Yeah. Could it be related to your parents walking in to somewhere that, like, into somebody's house?

93
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:10,560
I hope it doesn't hurt that you're not necessarily touching the source of the origin of doing something very rare.

94
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:14,380
Like you're really allergic to dust. You walk. Going to really dust?

95
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:18,670
Yeah. Wouldn't that all be well? It's a little bit. Yes.

96
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,940
You're you're exposed to the allergen and it's airborne.

97
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:25,360
Right. And the cat's, you know, you walk. You stir up the dust.

98
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:31,059
It rises up. There's the cat dander in the carpet or on the floor or with a dust allergy.

99
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:36,010
It's the dust mite. The antigens from the dust mite causes that reaction.

100
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:45,040
This can occur at such low doses that the concentration of the antigen is not enough to provoke a reaction.

101
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:57,370
And it's thought that, um, I know a couple of guys who work at the, or who are part of the Michigan Food Allergy Center,

102
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:06,960
and there's work underway to look at the role of olfactory receptors in eliciting these types of responses.

103
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:15,790
So our factor receptors are responsible for the sense of smell, and perhaps that might be responsible for some of these reactions.

104
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:24,070
So that's kind of an area of research that we haven't seen yet that may help us understand these reactions.

105
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:30,230
So what types of foods cause food allergies?

106
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:34,540
Well, 90% of food allergies are from these nine different foods that are going to list here.

107
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:43,030
So this data comes from studies published in 2018 and 2019.

108
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:52,270
So Americans of all ages who have convincing symptoms of allergy to these specific foods,

109
00:12:53,050 --> 00:13:02,020
shellfish, probably the most most common milk and other dairy products, peanuts.

110
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:08,040
Tree nuts. Egg finfish.

111
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:13,360
Okay. Wheat. Yeah.

112
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:21,770
Soy and sesame. Either sesame seeds themselves or the sesame oil is enough to provoke a response.

113
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:29,030
So these are the nine different foods that are known to cause food allergies.

114
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:32,900
This is this is 90% of all food allergies. Yeah.

115
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,690
Has certainly been officially added.

116
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:42,740
I know they were talking about adding that this 9000 being sesame that has been officially put in terms of the food label.

117
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,060
Yes. I don't know. It should be on there.

118
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:53,350
This you know, if you get 700,000 people who have the allergy this year, it should be on the label.

119
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,909
But I don't know. I haven't seen it. I have not seen it. I have not seen this caution.

120
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:02,540
This food contains sesame seed oil or sesame seed for so long.

121
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:18,000
So the other thing you should know about this is that about 40% of children with food allergies are allergic to just not just one particular allergen.

122
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:28,190
It's many of them. Right. So they perhaps have some kind of a heightened sensitivity to things that can

123
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:36,950
present as agents that activate this allergic response and in your immune system.

124
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:50,080
So. The other thing is that you need to know this, that the prevalence of food allergies is increasing for reasons that we don't understand either.

125
00:14:51,280 --> 00:15:00,220
So between 1997 and 2011, there's been a 50% increase in the United States alone in food allergies,

126
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:09,100
and childhood allergies have increased threefold between 97 and 2008.

127
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:17,650
And then the other thing you should know is that childhood allergies disproportionately affect minority populations,

128
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:25,090
such that to a little over 2% of black kids are affected.

129
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:35,530
One 1.2% Hispanic. And about 1% of white kids have food allergies.

130
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:45,700
So there's this disproportional effect to minority populations in regard to food allergies.

131
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:53,590
Exactly why that is, we're not sure. But there have been a number of ideas or hypotheses that have been put forth that to explain this.

132
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:59,870
So which will visit here in a minute.

133
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:05,720
So food allergy reactions are serious and can be life threatening.

134
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:15,530
And how common is this, Will, every 3 minutes, a food allergy reaction send somebody to the emergency room?

135
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:27,330
This is in the United States now. So each year, about 200,000 people require emergency care for allergic reactions to food.

136
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:37,850
And the number of children against because the prevalence of allergic reactions have increased in children.

137
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:46,550
The number of kids showing up that need that are hospitalized with consequences of food allergies, this this number has tripled.

138
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:57,220
So between in the late nineties and the mid 2000, 20 to 20 6 to 20 4 to 26,

139
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:07,610
about 9500 children per year received in-patient hospital care for food allergies.

140
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:17,520
And that more than 40% of children with food allergies experienced a severe allergic reaction in the form of anaphylaxis,

141
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:29,580
a life threatening condition that can cause death and then medical procedures to treat general access,

142
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:39,809
such as the use of an EpiPen or fluid resuscitation, or to put somebody to provide some kind of a support for their airways ventilation.

143
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:47,360
Perhaps this has increased 377% between 2007 and 2016.

144
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:57,070
Yeah. Copy. Um, I don't think you can grow into food allergies or into anaphylactic food allergies.

145
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:02,170
Can we go out? So for some types of food allergies, you can.

146
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:06,660
So, milk. Um. What are there?

147
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:10,240
Some others give you an example so you can grow out of some of these.

148
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:18,970
So, milk. Egg. Um. I can't remember the others, but there are some that you can grow out of.

149
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:27,690
But not peanut, apparently. And I don't I don't believe you can grow out of shellfish allergies either.

150
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:36,840
I could be wrong about that, but I don't remember seeing that. So it's an important public health issue that has legal protection.

151
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:46,290
So and this is because food allergies limit major life activities.

152
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:51,480
So for any kind of a social gathering, especially among children,

153
00:18:51,780 --> 00:19:00,870
these events are really important in terms of forming their social networks, providing a significant part of the quality of their lives.

154
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:02,579
Birthday party,

155
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:10,800
any kind of a social gathering in which they're excluded or they have to have special treatment has a significant impact on their quality of life.

156
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:18,710
So having peanut allergy for, for example, that can change the landscape for these kids.

157
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,700
And oftentimes parents don't want to take the chance.

158
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:31,260
And parents who are hosting these parties don't want to be responsible for an adverse reaction for somebody else's child.

159
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,770
So this is really problematic.

160
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:46,920
And again, if you have a high prevalence of allergic reactions, 8% of kids, this is going to limit or be an issue with the quality of life.

161
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:58,910
So in order to address this, food allergy was included in the Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990.

162
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:09,700
And part of this law has a provision that anything that contains a food allergen should be listed on the label.

163
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:21,900
And in terms of exactly which types of foods appear on the label, I am not I am not familiar with the details of this statute.

164
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:26,460
But you will see anything with Peanut will be on the label and in some other things as well.

165
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:37,990
So this is a this is a kind of a not a thing that should be more clearly identified on food labels.

166
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:41,610
We have systems to address this.

167
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:48,060
You know, you have you can have you can have a label that has a certain color on it.

168
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:55,950
You know what I mean? You can have an easier way for parents to identify things that potentially can be allergic or cause an allergic reaction.

169
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,360
But they're not being used.

170
00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:07,170
You just have an ingredient statement and then a warning, a bullet point that says warning this product may be may contain.

171
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:14,670
And then I'll give you a list of the different things would be easier if there was like a a color code, right?

172
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:20,280
Say food allergens present, red food allergy, you know, that kind of a thing.

173
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:32,680
And it's expensive. So the cost of caring for a child with food allergies has been estimated at $25 billion a year.

174
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:38,980
And you think, wow, that's really expensive. Well, just the cost of the EpiPen alone is significant.

175
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:45,760
There was a time in the last 5 to 10 years I can't remember exactly when this happened,

176
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:51,850
but a company that provided the EpiPen was able to kind of corner the market.

177
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:58,360
And because they were able to do this, they were the main supplier of these things.

178
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:09,970
They raised the price dramatically. So that added to the cost of, you know, families who had kids with food allergies.

179
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:18,070
And I can't remember the exact dollar amount per EpiPen, but it was in the hundreds of dollars per EpiPen when this happened.

180
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:24,070
Abby And so I just looked it up and said that in 2020, the average United States retail price for a two pack.

181
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,880
Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Yeah.

182
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:34,260
So there was a market shift in that, the increase in the cost of the EpiPens because of this.

183
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:38,390
And you can't keep them around forever.

184
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:45,680
So I don't remember the expiration date, but it's less certainly less than one year could be six months.

185
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:52,430
So during this relative short period of time, you've got to get rid of the old ones and get new ones, right?

186
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:57,840
And that's expensive. If you have more than one child with food allergies, you need to have more EpiPens.

187
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:03,350
Right. And you saw the example with Natalie, you know, three wasn't enough.

188
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:08,490
One might not be enough. You might want to have three or four on hand just in case.

189
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:19,490
Right. So why are we seeing this increase in food allergies?

190
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:27,590
Well, there are some theories about this, and it's based on genetic susceptibility and environment.

191
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:31,910
So there's this gene environment interaction that could be going on.

192
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:38,900
So in this particular diagram, we have genetic susceptibility in environment.

193
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:49,879
We have early exposure to ubiquitous microorganisms that in higher inhabit the gut and that you're exposed to externally that you might ingest

194
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:57,500
for putting your hand in your mouth when you're a little kid or something that you might eat or having pets around or whatever the case may be.

195
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:08,290
So the other issue in regard to environmental exposures is this early depletion of microbes by the use of antibiotics.

196
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:17,020
So if you acquire a bacterial infection or every time you feel sick and the doctor prescribes you now biotic,

197
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:22,060
that's going to change the microbiota or the microbiome in your gut.

198
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:33,370
And there are other types of infections, health infections, hepatitis infections that can shape your immune system.

199
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:41,380
And so all of these exposures can affect the composition of the commensal microbiota.

200
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:46,450
And then you have these interactions between the gene and the environment.

201
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:51,940
So you've got a topic or allergic versus nodding topic or non-allergic.

202
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:58,780
So the different boxes show you the the effects of these interactions.

203
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:07,560
So you can have somebody who has a high genetic susceptibility and they're living in a hygienic environment.

204
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:13,510
They're not exposed to things that can shift the microbiota in a positive way.

205
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:21,070
And they might end up having a greater degree of or a greater chance of having allergic reactions,

206
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:35,620
whereas somebody who has a low genetic susceptibility and perhaps a less hygienic environment, they may have a tendency to have not have allergies.

207
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:42,580
So if you have household pets, it's another example of a non hygienic situation.

208
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:51,190
If you live out in the country and you're exposed to dirt and potentially fecal organisms in the

209
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:58,300
dirt that can be less hygienic and that can lower your risk of having these types of infections.

210
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:11,290
So looking at the genetic sides of things, if both parents have a topic analogy, the child will have a 40 to 60% chance of having an allergy.

211
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:17,140
But neither parent has an allergy. The risk goes down to about 10%.

212
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:21,470
So the environmental. Is it exposure to chemicals?

213
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:31,600
Well, don't know. We do know that there's this hygiene hypothesis in terms of being exposed to clean or dirty environments.

214
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:37,510
And if you're exposed to dirty virus, perhaps you're exposed to more infectious agents.

215
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:46,630
If you're treated often with antibiotics, it can affect your immune response and shift more of that to type of response,

216
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:53,260
giving you more of a chance to have allergic responses.

217
00:26:55,660 --> 00:27:05,770
So what is it about infectious agents? Well, they have this endotoxin that promotes more of ath1 response.

218
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,580
And when you are shifted more to ath1 response,

219
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:23,200
it gives you a T cell repertoire that favors host defense against infection rather than the t h t response, which is an allergic response.

220
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:37,270
I'll go over that in more detail in a minute here. So Endotoxin can come from the organisms that live in animals or in dirt and the animal feces.

221
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:45,300
So the the this is under the umbrella of the hygiene hypothesis.

222
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:50,290
In other words, if you're exposed to a highly hygienic environment,

223
00:27:51,400 --> 00:28:02,410
you might not encounter these things and it may increase your risk of having an allergic response or ath2 type of response.

224
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:09,340
If you're exposed to more of these infectious type things, it perhaps reduces your risk.

225
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:20,140
So the hygiene hypothesis has changed recently, and now it's referred to as the counter regulatory hypothesis.

226
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:28,960
It's the updated hygiene hypothesis, and it's basically focus now on the microbiome.

227
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:37,600
And it's the focus here is on the disruption of the balance of microbes that live on your skin and in your gut.

228
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:49,600
And there's been a fair amount of attention focused on dietary exposures, whether you're exposed to allergies early in life or later in life,

229
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:56,890
whether your diet consists of a certain amount of fiber that can promote or.

230
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:03,900
Provide energy substrates for a healthy gut microbiome.

231
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:08,940
If you have a low fiber diet, this can change that environment.

232
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:20,610
So if you have a diet that's rich in fat and simple sugars, that's going to promote a certain microbiome that might be problematic for the host.

233
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:29,880
And then if you're treated often with anti-microbial agents, you can wipe out an entire population of microbes and those that are.

234
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:36,990
So you're killing off susceptible populations and those that are resistant survive.

235
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:45,720
And this affects the richness and diversity of the population of organisms, the bacteria, principally, they're living in your gut.

236
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:51,090
Okay. So what are the microbes do exactly?

237
00:29:51,330 --> 00:30:00,780
Well, they provide energy substrates, and the energy substrates can be in the form of metabolites of proteins and amino acids.

238
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:11,870
Most of the attention in this area of research has been focused on short chain fatty acids and the ratio of the short chain fatty acids.

239
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:21,870
And you're looking at these short chain fatty acids like acetate butyrate and appropriate and different combinations

240
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:28,920
of the organisms in the microbiome can give you different ratios of these different short chain fatty acids.

241
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:46,770
Okay. So. This is a scenario that describes how the gut microbiota might be shaped by early exposures.

242
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:58,290
So here you have a teaser of 0 to 1, t, h two and three pathways.

243
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:04,200
This represents the different types of T cells that might be present in a newborn,

244
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:18,150
and exposures that occur from diet and other types of sources can shape and and affect that the ratio of these different T cells in the host.

245
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:26,340
So when you have an infant, their immune system isn't fully formed.

246
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:40,260
It's being educated by these exposures to diet and the environment and the phenotype of a newborn is essentially a type one or type two, h two type.

247
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:48,540
And this is essentially really important because it prevents the phenomenon of rejection in utero.

248
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:56,430
So you don't want, for example, the mother's immune system to reject the baby in utero.

249
00:31:56,970 --> 00:32:06,450
So the the baby in utero has a t cell repertoire that is more of ath2 type of profile.

250
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:10,970
Okay. Oh, yeah.

251
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:17,800
So isn't that what happens when there's, like, the equal but completely with the blood type?

252
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:29,630
Yeah. And how does that change? So with the incompatible in utero has to do part of this has to do with the, um.

253
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:39,850
The blood type. Blood cell type. So if you have somebody, a mother that is o negative and a baby that isn't,

254
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:50,920
there's the potential for the mother's immune system to attack the baby based on that blood cell antigen type.

255
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:51,430
Right.

256
00:32:51,910 --> 00:33:01,660
And what she what how this is true, is it if the mother's O-negative, she's given an antibodies that can prevent a rejection in utero because of this?

257
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:14,920
Okay. That's part of it. But there's there's the baby itself now has more of ath2 profile that's separate from that particular condition.

258
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:18,840
Okay. So it's not just blood type, it's every everything else.

259
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:24,280
There are other antigens that can potentially provoke a rejection in utero.

260
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:35,260
So in a baby, this predominant T cell phenotype,

261
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:51,970
the T cells produce these cytokines that promote the B cells and the baby to produce by g e and this is e now can elicit an allergic response,

262
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:58,570
but a type one hypersensitivity involving the mast cells.

263
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:17,540
So if you're exposed to microbes from the gut and externally, this shifts the t h the t helper cell population to more of ath1 phenotype.

264
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:24,020
And as children get older, you'll see more higher populations of this th1 phenotype.

265
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:30,650
And again, this is affected by genetics and their environment and the food that they eat.

266
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:44,750
So over time you have more of ath1 response and the th1 cells secrete th1 cytokines that promote b cells to produce IGA instead of IgG.

267
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:51,560
And this is more tolerant to exposure to food allergies for things that could potentially be an allergen.

268
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:59,810
You also have ath3 population of cells that produce TGF beta,

269
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:12,580
a cytokine that inhibits the B cells that are producing h e and it promotes the B cells that are forming IGF.

270
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:24,260
Yeah, but I just said. Okay.

271
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:28,340
So that's really a simplistic view.

272
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:34,520
There's a lot going on in the gut and this slide shows you all of the potential interactions

273
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:40,010
that are occurring in the gut in regard to food and the immune system in the gut.

274
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:52,400
So you have a genetic composition within the cells in the gut and the microbes,

275
00:35:53,210 --> 00:36:00,200
and you have commensal bacteria and you have cells producing lots of different things.

276
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:05,780
They're producing mucus, they're producing IGA,

277
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:11,390
and they're producing antimicrobial peptides and defense and certain type of things and microbial peptides.

278
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:15,710
And the epithelial cells are also producing cytokines.

279
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:24,230
And in this scenario, it talks about how Vitamin A is critical for some of these reactions.

280
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:26,840
So within the gut,

281
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:42,050
you have trillions of bacteria and other types of organisms and you have food antigens and your immune system is constantly sampling what's out here.

282
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,510
So here's a dendritic cell.

283
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:55,400
It's kind of like a cell type that's sticking its toe in the water to feel what's out there, what's the temperature of the environment within the gut.

284
00:36:56,120 --> 00:37:00,650
So here's this long dendrite that's projecting into this environment.

285
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:16,510
Sampling antigens. And if you have now a food allergy, this shakes everything in the gut in terms of the host's immune system,

286
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:32,379
and it can activate both innate and adaptive immune response and it can disrupt the epithelial barrier and not only allow the antigens,

287
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:46,000
the food antigens, but it can allow in the microbes themselves or that the membranes on the surface of bacteria that have been killed or ruptured.

288
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:53,230
So these microbes, we associate molecular patterns as well as the food antigens,

289
00:37:53,680 --> 00:38:00,340
can activate the allergic response to response and innate immune response.

290
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:06,430
So when this occurs in the gut, it can provoke a profound inflammatory response.

291
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:20,500
So you have conditions in which an individual like an individual who has chronic inflammatory bowel disease this.

292
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:35,310
Scenario now can cause chronic inflammation in the gut as a consequence of this, and certain types of foods can provoke this type of response.

293
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:48,120
So on an individual basis, people have to avoid certain types of foods to prevent having this chronic activation or this in the case of food exposure.

294
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:52,350
This acute activation of an innate immune response.

295
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:59,970
So this is complex and there's a lot going on in the gut in terms of exposure to different antigens.

296
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:04,620
And it does just doesn't involve the T cells. There is a lot going on here.

297
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:18,240
All right. So let's walk through the scenario where exposure to a food allergen can provoke a systemic response causing anaphylaxis.

298
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:26,400
So in this particular slide, you have different types of foods, peanut milk and fish.

299
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:41,430
They're ingested, and you have cells within the oropharynx, within the esophagus that can recognize these different allergens.

300
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:45,810
And then the food is ingested and goes down into the gut.

301
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:59,730
And then you have a reaction to this particular allergen, um, with the cells that line these surfaces and they produce these inflammatory mediators,

302
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:05,220
the inflammatory mediators become systemic and they can reach the lungs.

303
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:14,940
And if you have someone who's experienced exposure to an allergic agent food,

304
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:20,580
they might have higher number of mast cells lining the respiratory tract.

305
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:26,790
And in those individuals that they're exposed systemically to an allergen,

306
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:35,580
the mast cells on the epithelial surface within the airways become activated that degrade and they can cause broncho constriction.

307
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:39,210
Okay. People who have fewer mast cells.

308
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:42,090
Yeah, they get a response, but it's less severe.

309
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:55,550
And the allergies can also affect the cardiovascular system as well as we'll see in the next slide in a little bit more detail.

310
00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:05,160
So this is an overview of the reactions that occur in anaphylaxis.

311
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:11,910
The different boxes here have next to them in red.

312
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:21,060
What's been shown to be. There's a lot of evidence support for mediators that cause these reactions in humans in blue

313
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:27,390
is reactions that are have been demonstrated in animal models and to some extent in humans.

314
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:37,320
But basically you can see from this particular slide that it's the histamine that's really important in terms of provoking anaphylaxis in humans.

315
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:44,900
So at the very top you have the upper respiratory tract and an x.

316
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:48,229
When the mast cells are activated, you get rounder air.

317
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:55,310
So there's inflammation in the nasal cavity, they're sneezing, there's edema that occurs.

318
00:41:55,850 --> 00:42:02,690
You have the the capillaries expand causing this inflammation.

319
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:09,469
You have fluid leaking out to the tissues causing edema. And you can have this kind of a strider.

320
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:16,430
This is the the sounds that are made from having inflammation in the nasal pharynx.

321
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:29,180
And this is the next thing here we have reactions to the cardiovascular system.

322
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:41,450
So the exposure to a food allergen causes can cause hypertension, a sudden increase in heart rate.

323
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:45,680
There's a dilation and this is what causes systemic shock.

324
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:56,120
You have increased permeability, so the fluid within the vasculature leaks out into the tissues and you can faintness a consequence of this exposure.

325
00:42:58,050 --> 00:43:08,040
In the scan, you would see other events occurring, flashing the redness, a rash, appearing very rapidly or you to carrier.

326
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:16,170
And that's the mast cells too granulated in the skin and then angioedema and and and edgy sensation.

327
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:21,330
So histamine, again, is responsible for a lot of these symptoms in animal models.

328
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:26,070
Platelet activating factor in the lipid mediator system.

329
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:30,120
Liver trains have been demonstrated to play an important role in these types of

330
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:36,630
responses and Aflatoxins played an activating factor of 16 all over trains.

331
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:42,240
Also responsible for some of these reactions within the skin and in the digestive tract.

332
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:44,430
Something else happens.

333
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:54,780
You have this inflammatory response occurring and someone can feel nauseated and they can vomit in response to a food allergen.

334
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:03,030
This can cause abdominal pain and diarrhea and in response to ingesting something.

335
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:08,280
If you have an allergy to the respiratory tract, somebody can cough.

336
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:16,170
You get broncho constriction that can change the sound of air coming in and out of the lungs, creating this wheezing type of sound.

337
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:28,560
They may have difficulty in breathing because the airways are now more narrow dyspnea, and if it's severe enough, it can cause hypoxia.

338
00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:36,270
They're not getting enough blood. And through all of these reactions, you can have death as a consequence.

339
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:40,050
So these are the changes that occur in anaphylaxis.

340
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:48,870
D'appolonia I have this question about are there any long term consequences of experiencing like an anesthetic events?

341
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:56,370
So for an analog, a long term consequence of anaphylaxis specifically?

342
00:44:57,060 --> 00:45:07,650
Um, I'm not certain, but I know that if you are someone who experiences a reaction to allergens for a long period of time,

343
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:14,580
there might be issues I'm more familiar with issues related to what's going on in the respiratory tract.

344
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:20,820
So you can have lots more mucus producing cells in the airways.

345
00:45:21,330 --> 00:45:38,550
You can have a higher amount of smooth muscle in the bronchial walls so that ultimately the diameter of the airways is reduced.

346
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:48,509
So in exposure chronically to allergens that can occur in terms of anaphylaxis have repeated anaphylaxis.

347
00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:52,940
And I'm not certain. Okay.

348
00:45:53,630 --> 00:46:00,260
So we've seen here that that in humans that it's the histamine that's responsible as there's

349
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:06,110
been clearly demonstrated to be responsible for these events that occur in anaphylaxis.

350
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:16,010
How does that happen? Well, remember the type one hypersensitivity response where you have that antibody that

351
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:22,910
coats the surface of the mast cell and one that mass cell reacts with an antigen.

352
00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:26,000
What's happening is the antigen is here in red.

353
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:35,600
The antigen binds to the that variable portion of the antibody, the IgG molecule, and it causes that mass cell to degrade.

354
00:46:37,430 --> 00:46:49,220
So initially, there's no response because your you don't have any kind of antibodies that recognize these types of antigens.

355
00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:55,040
It's in subsequent exposure that you start to form these IGE molecules.

356
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:58,339
And the greater the exposure,

357
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:07,940
the more profound you get in terms of an inflammatory response to the point where human exposure to a small amount of antigen,

358
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:12,500
half a peanut in this example can provoke a lethal reaction.

359
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:27,590
So as I mentioned, the severity of the symptoms increase with increased exposure to this antigen.

360
00:47:29,210 --> 00:47:38,690
But I want to qualify this by saying potentially this is a way to desensitize someone to antigens.

361
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:46,010
How does that work? We'll talk about that here in a little bit. And that comes in the form of this oral immunotherapy.

362
00:47:48,050 --> 00:47:53,690
So let's look at what's going on with the mass cell and its systemic effects.

363
00:47:54,410 --> 00:48:01,370
It's going to affect the gastrointestinal tract, the eyes, the nasal passages in the airways and the blood vessels.

364
00:48:02,870 --> 00:48:13,969
So you get an increased fluid secretion in the gut, increased peristalsis, and you get explosive gastrointestinal symptoms, diarrhea,

365
00:48:13,970 --> 00:48:20,240
vomiting in the eyes and in the nasal passages in the airways, you get mucus secretion,

366
00:48:20,810 --> 00:48:27,440
you get congestion, blockage, phlegm, coughing, swelling, mucus secretion, nasal passages.

367
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:31,380
Your eyes get itchy and red in the blood vessels.

368
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:35,300
There's initially increased blood flow and increased permeability,

369
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:45,590
and then you get increased fluid retention within the lymph live lymphatic system in the lymph nodes.

370
00:48:46,610 --> 00:48:50,809
You get increases in cells and protein in tissues,

371
00:48:50,810 --> 00:49:01,549
and this increases in vector response and tissues and hypotension eventually and potentially anaphylactic shock where you don't have enough fluid

372
00:49:01,550 --> 00:49:13,520
within the vascular system to perfused all of the tissues and you can think in response to this and and die as a consequence of circulatory shock.

373
00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:25,100
So how the heck does this happen? What does that in this case, a peanut allergy actually do?

374
00:49:25,850 --> 00:49:33,110
Aren't you supposed to be able to digest the things that you ingest or eat?

375
00:49:34,610 --> 00:49:46,730
Well, it turns out that peanuts that you consume them form a structural matrix that makes them resistant to digestion.

376
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:57,380
And one of the things that we do in food processing that that preserves antigens and food is things like dry roasted peanuts.

377
00:49:58,490 --> 00:50:09,440
So the dry roasting process preserves this matrix within the peanut and preserves the antigens that can actually pass right on through the gut.

378
00:50:10,430 --> 00:50:18,260
So here are some mucus secreting cells within the epithelium in the digestive tract.

379
00:50:19,370 --> 00:50:25,640
And these antigens, specifically dry roasted peanuts and peanut butter and other types of products,

380
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:30,560
can be directly absorbed in a form that's incompletely digested.

381
00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:41,540
And that structure looks to the host as a pathogen and that it needs to respond to violently to remove it from the body.

382
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:51,080
Okay. And you have chemokines that recruit cells to the epithelial surface.

383
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:56,810
And these dendritic cells are presenting antigens to this th2 cell.

384
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:12,590
And the th2 cell promotes this allergic response by making these cytokines four out 13 and nine that promote this inflammatory environment.

385
00:51:12,590 --> 00:51:18,559
And here are some mast cells now that have recognized this food allergen.

386
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:28,160
Food allergen. And they're granulated and they're producing serotonin and platelet activating factor that are going to cause these effects in the gut.

387
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:37,639
Vomiting, diarrhea. The mast cells are all over your body and the skin and the lungs and systemic circulation.

388
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:45,680
And they're responding to this antigen as well. And they're releasing histamine and platelet activating factor and you're getting systemic symptoms.

389
00:51:50,620 --> 00:52:02,919
So this picture has been painted as primarily a Type two response to response mediated by massive granulation.

390
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:10,150
And that's true. But the other immune cells are actually participating in this reaction as well.

391
00:52:10,990 --> 00:52:15,730
So it's not just the mast cells. You've got a lot of other things going on, too.

392
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:20,889
Yeah, the mast cells are reacting, but you have tissue,

393
00:52:20,890 --> 00:52:27,820
macrophages and circulating neutrophils in the blood and that's basically responding to this antigen as well.

394
00:52:29,590 --> 00:52:38,170
So you get all of these cytokines produced and you have then the later response eosinophilia that come into play.

395
00:52:38,770 --> 00:52:45,250
Talk about their significance here in a minute. And so you have this early reaction and a later reaction.

396
00:52:45,430 --> 00:52:53,590
And in terms of the immune landscape that occurs in regard to anaphylaxis making.

397
00:52:54,010 --> 00:52:58,720
Having a magic bullet treat these symptoms very difficult.

398
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:06,400
You can't treat this immune response with just one immune mediator.

399
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:15,010
Okay. Yeah. You can give antihistamine to somebody who's had a reaction, but all these other events are occurring.

400
00:53:16,030 --> 00:53:19,270
So treating this, it becomes very complicated.

401
00:53:21,950 --> 00:53:26,360
So here is what happens within minutes.

402
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:27,950
Here's a mess, though.

403
00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:37,040
Look at all of these granules here that contain preformed cytokines and all of these different mediators and acute inflammation.

404
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:45,020
And this is someone who's having an allergy test to try to figure out this person has allergic symptoms.

405
00:53:45,170 --> 00:53:55,820
What exactly are they allergic to? So they take several different antigens and they inject them at the surface of their skin on their back,

406
00:53:56,390 --> 00:54:02,570
and they look for this relative form and how big it gets after these exposures.

407
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:11,510
And they can figure out the dose and the type of antigen that they might be susceptible to.

408
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:21,030
So the mast cells, yeah, they're releasing histamine, but they're releasing lots of other things too that are shown here.

409
00:54:21,330 --> 00:54:31,800
Um, you've got enzymes that affect the connective tissue matrix that can ultimately cause more fluid accumulation in the interstitial spaces.

410
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:38,240
You've got histamine, you've got other things, you've got cytokines that are released,

411
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:42,060
you've got chemokines that attract other cells to the site of inflammation.

412
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:46,350
And then you have these lipid mediators that have these systemic effects.

413
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:57,959
So that's the early phase. So if you were to look at somebody who has been exposed to an antigen and you were

414
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:03,720
to measure their response by measuring the obstruction of airflow in their lungs,

415
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:06,120
you'd get this kind of a pattern.

416
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:15,700
So in this scenario, you have somebody who's been exposed to an allergen and you're measuring their response to the alert,

417
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:20,820
looking at how much air, how quickly air can be forced out of the lungs.

418
00:55:21,690 --> 00:55:29,550
So before exposure, their ability to produce the blow air month high, they can 34 liters per minute.

419
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:33,600
Right. And there's peak exploratory flow rate.

420
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:43,530
But then here's the antigen challenge. Their ability to exhale maximally in terms of liters per minute declines rapidly.

421
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:48,120
And that's because you get this broncho constriction occurring.

422
00:55:49,170 --> 00:55:57,390
Okay. This can recover rapidly after the initial exposure and they are back to normal.

423
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:06,240
But I mentioned here earlier that there's cytokines and chemokines that are formed.

424
00:56:06,390 --> 00:56:13,650
And this may take several hours and these other cells come into play and they're recruited to that site of inflammation.

425
00:56:14,490 --> 00:56:23,700
So you'll have a late phase reaction. And it's the eosinophilia that are thought to play a principal role in these late phase reactions.

426
00:56:24,450 --> 00:56:30,720
So here's what happens in the late phase figure to do this same peak expiratory flow experiment.

427
00:56:31,290 --> 00:56:41,070
You'd find that later on there's problems with the airways now having an inflammatory response that lasts a few hours now.

428
00:56:42,630 --> 00:56:52,300
Yeah. RB Is this why if you have some of the results of rational inferences, you give a mechanism.

429
00:56:53,530 --> 00:56:57,700
They should still go to. Yes. But all these like, you know, all these things.

430
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,200
Yes, absolutely. Yeah. So here's that.

431
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:10,180
This late phase is thought to be mediated by the recruitment of the cinephiles from the blood to the tissues so that the late phase,

432
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:19,870
they're having problems with airflow. And then here's an individual who's volunteered to demonstrate this effect.

433
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:24,400
So you get here's a well that forms in their arm initially.

434
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:32,440
That's the mast cells in that location being activated and releasing their basal active agents several hours later,

435
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:36,280
the size of the well increases dramatically.

436
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:41,620
So that you have yeah, you have these inflammatory mediators,

437
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:46,749
but now you have a lot more cells present in this area that can secrete these

438
00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:51,730
inflammatory mediators and promote this inflammatory response producing edema,

439
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:54,790
this particular the surface of their skin.

440
00:57:55,630 --> 00:57:59,080
And this resolves, but it takes several hours to resolve.

441
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:13,110
Okay. And these are the molecules released by a cinephiles for inactivation and their biological effects.

442
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:20,010
Now, I don't want you to memorize this, but I want you to be aware that you have two different cell types that are

443
00:58:20,010 --> 00:58:25,500
responsible for the early and the late phase responses to an allergic reaction.

444
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:30,720
Um, and there are many different things that are released.

445
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:34,470
So you have enzymes that affect the structure of tissues.

446
00:58:35,370 --> 00:58:43,980
You have proteins that are formed that are toxic to parasites but can have negative effects on the host.

447
00:58:44,670 --> 00:58:49,799
You have cytokines that can increase the production of immune cells from the

448
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:56,520
bone marrow and they can activate immune cells to become more inflammatory.

449
00:58:56,640 --> 00:59:04,320
And you recruit immune cells to that site of inflammation, and then you have lipid mediators that are formed rapidly.

450
00:59:04,890 --> 00:59:12,930
But because you have a lot more cells in that area now, these lipid mediators are being produced by many different cell types,

451
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:19,050
and they have profound reactions and biological effects systemically.

452
00:59:23,650 --> 00:59:27,820
So we're we're coming now. We went to the week.

453
00:59:28,030 --> 00:59:32,140
We started out with a very large picture and we went our way down to mechanisms.

454
00:59:32,530 --> 00:59:40,210
Now we're coming back out again. So what do you do immediately when you see something like this?

455
00:59:41,350 --> 00:59:51,190
A child has ingested something that they have an immediate reaction to notice the inflammation around the mouth.

456
00:59:51,670 --> 00:59:56,200
Okay. And then it stays. And then you see that the redness around his eyes.

457
00:59:56,620 --> 00:59:59,860
And then you see these welts forming around his neck.

458
01:00:00,730 --> 01:00:07,900
So that's in response to that particular food act allergen that's producing this acute inflammation.

459
01:00:08,350 --> 01:00:16,719
And it's the mast cells that are trigger anyway. So it's the histamine that's responsible for these immediate effects and it's the mast

460
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:21,910
cells with the IGP stuck on their surface that mediates this type of a response.

461
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:35,020
Okay. The thing that you need to administer are epinephrine first and that you need some kind of an antihistamine and histamine,

462
01:00:35,020 --> 01:00:38,390
if it's a very mild, reaction, will work.

463
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:43,690
If it's a more profound reaction, you're going to need an EpiPen.

464
01:00:45,220 --> 01:00:48,440
How do you use an EpiPen? Um, yeah.

465
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:54,970
I've never used one. I've only seen directions like this, but I don't even know.

466
01:00:55,030 --> 01:00:59,950
I was a lifeguard for a time and we didn't learn about this.

467
01:00:59,950 --> 01:01:02,679
We learned about other administering other forms of first aid.

468
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:10,540
But I would hope that nowadays everybody at some point gets exposure to an EpiPen and how to use one.

469
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:17,200
But at $600 a pop, that's a that's a barrier to the deaf to teach everybody how to do this.

470
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:26,829
Right. So how do you do this? So if you see someone with that reaction and they have an EpiPen, they might not be able to do it themselves.

471
01:01:26,830 --> 01:01:36,460
They might need help. So here's what you do. So first you form a fist around the EpiPen and you pull off the grade cap,

472
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:42,460
and then we place the black end of the cap against their upper their mid-thigh.

473
01:01:43,420 --> 01:01:51,670
And then you push it down hard until you hear a click or you feel a click and you hold it there for 10 seconds,

474
01:01:53,290 --> 01:01:57,700
and then you remove the EpiPen and you're careful not to touch the end of it.

475
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:03,460
Okay, because you could get epinephrine and cause your heart to race and everything else,

476
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:17,170
and you massage that area for about 10 seconds and then you would call 911 and have an emergency response to get that person treated right away.

477
01:02:18,190 --> 01:02:21,429
So I showed you a picture of the signs.

478
01:02:21,430 --> 01:02:26,589
And symptoms are swelling of the mouth, face and neck. There's a red skin and rash.

479
01:02:26,590 --> 01:02:33,940
They would have a rapid heart rate. They would have difficulty breathing and it would sound raspy or they'd be wheezing.

480
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:38,890
Their tongue may swell. The back of their throat can swell.

481
01:02:39,670 --> 01:02:43,060
They might not be able to top or they might have a very hoarse voice,

482
01:02:43,810 --> 01:02:52,180
and they may actually lose consciousness and become very pale and floppy as a consequence of having this severe systemic reaction.

483
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:57,010
The other thing you should do is elevate their feet.

484
01:02:57,190 --> 01:03:07,870
And this can help with moving blood out of their lower extremity into their into their lungs and their heart,

485
01:03:09,490 --> 01:03:14,260
perhaps preventing some systemic shock from occurring.

486
01:03:18,910 --> 01:03:23,500
So how do you manage and prevent food allergic responses?

487
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:36,400
Well, you want to keep. You want to be able to prevent children from being exposed to allergens that cause these types of reactions.

488
01:03:39,100 --> 01:03:46,419
You want to be prepared for food allergies by having EpiPen available and educating

489
01:03:46,420 --> 01:03:53,380
everybody else around that child that your child has or you have a food allergy.

490
01:03:54,160 --> 01:04:03,310
And people who work in the school, again, two kids, an estimated two kids per classroom nowadays has a food allergy.

491
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:13,420
So everybody should have some kind of a class designed to teach people how to respond to an emergency from a food allergy.

492
01:04:15,250 --> 01:04:21,490
You need to educate other kids as well. The child who has the allergy, everybody in the family about this.

493
01:04:22,330 --> 01:04:26,680
If you bring something home that's allergic, that causes an allergic response to the other child.

494
01:04:28,150 --> 01:04:32,950
You might have kids in your family that have more severe reactions and none in other kids.

495
01:04:33,430 --> 01:04:39,130
So there's there's a higher degree of variability across children within one family.

496
01:04:40,450 --> 01:04:45,160
So everybody needs to be aware of the potential harm that exposure can do.

497
01:04:46,540 --> 01:04:52,030
And then you need to create, maintain healthy, safe and inclusive educational environment.

498
01:04:52,480 --> 01:05:00,070
If you're working in a classroom of kids and assume assuming that some of them may have a food allergy.

499
01:05:02,390 --> 01:05:06,050
Okay. So how do you treat this?

500
01:05:06,620 --> 01:05:14,720
Well, there's been a lot of work going on in pharmaceutical companies looking at ways to treat allergic disease.

501
01:05:16,130 --> 01:05:23,270
So there's mechanisms of treatment here, the target mechanisms of treatment, this specific approach.

502
01:05:24,110 --> 01:05:30,940
So there is mediator action mediators of specific, specific receptors.

503
01:05:30,950 --> 01:05:35,300
So if you inhibit the synthesis of the mediators, that might be a strategy.

504
01:05:35,990 --> 01:05:40,100
And so you have antihistamines. You have better two agonists.

505
01:05:40,340 --> 01:05:44,450
Those are the 2/1 line use because they're effective.

506
01:05:44,450 --> 01:05:51,830
And it's shown to work in humans for people who have chronic allergies,

507
01:05:51,840 --> 01:06:01,490
you might try something like a Aluko trained receptor inhibitor or something that blocks the synthesis of nucleotides and vaccine ACE inhibitor.

508
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:08,360
In some cases, people have chronic inflammation and they're given corticosteroids.

509
01:06:08,630 --> 01:06:11,960
This is, um, this is done.

510
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:17,509
It's discouraged because of the negative consequences of corticosteroids to your immune responses,

511
01:06:17,510 --> 01:06:22,010
suppresses everything and makes you more susceptible to all kinds of infections.

512
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:32,450
There are therapies that have been developed to desensitize people and this is start to shift the t cell repertoire.

513
01:06:33,770 --> 01:06:38,510
And I'll talk about a therapy. This will be the focus of when we meet again on Thursday.

514
01:06:39,470 --> 01:06:45,620
And then you have therapies that are directed against the IGP antibodies that

515
01:06:45,620 --> 01:06:52,129
you can give somebody a drug neutralizing antibody against the IGP antibody.

516
01:06:52,130 --> 01:06:58,550
And that's been explored as a therapy to prevent an anaphylactic reaction.

517
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:06,680
And here here's some other areas that are they're under investigation or proposed to be under investigation.

518
01:07:07,670 --> 01:07:12,980
Again, I don't want you to memorize these details, but these are experimental.

519
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:26,179
These are these are targets of experimental investigation in terms of how new therapies can be developed to do to affect t cell acting,

520
01:07:26,180 --> 01:07:35,060
each cell activation B cell production of IGP Mass Cell Activation and eosinophilia dependent information.

521
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:44,209
Because so many people are affected by allergies. There's a lot of interest in the pharmaceutical industry to create drugs that

522
01:07:44,210 --> 01:07:51,410
are effective in blocking these types of responses in terms of food allergy.

523
01:07:51,650 --> 01:08:03,770
There was the approval of this oral immunotherapy strategy and and January 31st, 2020,

524
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:11,310
they approved PAL Fauzia, which is essentially a peanut powder or a peanut flower.

525
01:08:11,330 --> 01:08:21,230
That's it's given and it's standardized and it's used in this oral immunotherapy procedure.

526
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:30,890
And the idea here is to desensitize somebody to an allergy by giving them small doses of the allergen over time.

527
01:08:31,970 --> 01:08:35,090
And you need to monitor these people carefully.

528
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:44,900
So when a child is or an adult is going through these types of therapies, you need to have antihistamines and EpiPens available at all times.

529
01:08:46,190 --> 01:08:52,520
And the strategy, yeah, this is kind of summarizes what potentially could be happening now.

530
01:08:53,090 --> 01:08:58,550
So here is the allergen. And this would be a max cell here.

531
01:08:58,580 --> 01:09:09,800
The receptors that respond to the ITP identifying the antigen causing B granulation and all of the the scenario related to anaphylaxis.

532
01:09:11,180 --> 01:09:26,200
If you can do you sensitized somebody to an allergen by getting this class which in effect producing IGG in response to an allergen instead of IGG,

533
01:09:27,290 --> 01:09:37,330
the antibodies that you're producing are going to attack the allergen before that allergen can cause problems and it won't activate that cell.

534
01:09:37,910 --> 01:09:43,130
Okay. That's the idea behind this. And so the.

535
01:09:46,490 --> 01:09:54,350
Antigen here. The allergen won't have this impact on the mass up to the granular.

536
01:09:56,810 --> 01:09:59,570
And then not only are the mass cells affected,

537
01:09:59,810 --> 01:10:10,220
you have a lot of different things that are occurring within the host that doesn't provoke this acute inflammatory response.

538
01:10:10,250 --> 01:10:15,260
So here's a summary of oral mechanisms or oral tolerance induction.

539
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:24,320
So the here are in purple are the dendritic cells that are coming and acquire antigens.

540
01:10:25,070 --> 01:10:34,100
And over time, having desensitization to a particular antigen instead of producing it, you're producing,

541
01:10:34,100 --> 01:10:40,340
itching and within the gut you have this collection of immune cells of the prior patch,

542
01:10:41,810 --> 01:10:49,640
and the T cells that are being produced are in the form of th3 and the T regulatory cells

543
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:57,290
and the T regulatory cells are secreting cytokines that suppress an inflammatory response,

544
01:10:57,800 --> 01:11:05,570
and this can perhaps suppress systemic inflammation as a consequence of exposure to this antigen.

545
01:11:06,170 --> 01:11:11,060
So this is the goal of this immuno oral immuno tolerance therapy.

546
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:21,650
Does it work? Well, that's going to be the subject of the meta analysis we're going to discuss on Thursday.

547
01:11:21,830 --> 01:11:28,340
Now, I've never talked about a meta analysis in class before.

548
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:38,900
It's an it's a paper that describes a number of other clinical trials,

549
01:11:39,710 --> 01:11:52,640
and it compares the results and tries to summarize the effectiveness of, in this case, the oral immune tolerance therapy.

550
01:11:53,630 --> 01:12:00,230
So this is posted for Thursday, and I posted a bunch of questions that you're going to answer.

551
01:12:00,230 --> 01:12:05,480
We're going to have a discussion about this therapy for peanut allergy.

552
01:12:06,980 --> 01:12:16,190
Okay. So any questions about this? Anything that I've discussed so far, do you know anybody who you know, you may not have in here?

553
01:12:16,190 --> 01:12:21,980
When I asked everybody, you know, anybody who has a food allergy. Yes, you do, too.

554
01:12:22,370 --> 01:12:25,400
Okay. Yeah, I know. I'm sorry. Elizabeth. Elizabeth.

555
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:29,990
I know. For people with serious allergies, you know, Centrum, that's.

556
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:34,430
Have you ever seen them respond to an exposure?

557
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:45,780
Not seeing them had anything serious, seemed like it had a teeny bit of exposure and then had a slight response,

558
01:12:45,780 --> 01:12:55,560
but nothing to the extent of needing a EpiPen. Have they shared with you how to use an EpiPen just in case they're exposed and aren't able to use it?

559
01:12:55,590 --> 01:12:59,280
They have. Great. Yeah. How about you?

560
01:12:59,310 --> 01:13:07,709
You know, I never met anyone who has that of a serious allergic, which is people with, like, weird allergies.

561
01:13:07,710 --> 01:13:10,950
Like chicken or. Very strange.

562
01:13:11,340 --> 01:13:18,010
Yeah, well, I haven't heard about that before, but I guess it's possible any kind of an energy you can potentially have an allergy against.

563
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:22,830
Okay, so that's all I have today.

564
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:31,260
I will see everybody on Thursday and be prepared to answer questions about this and then analysis.
