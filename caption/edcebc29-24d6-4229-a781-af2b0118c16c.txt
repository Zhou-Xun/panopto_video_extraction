1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,190
It smells like bad in the building like wet dog, I thought.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:11,399
And I was like, then that's well on this floor, the the water fountain right there.

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,800
It has exploded before and it just melt like a bunch of feces because.

4
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,360
And then and then there's like water issues in this building.

5
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,740
It's an old building, but thank you.

6
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:37,080
All right. So today I'm going to lecture for about the first 20 minutes and then we have a guest lecture coming up from Dr. Ford.

7
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:44,820
I looked over the slide, his slides are up, and then he has an optional reading that I put on canvas as well.

8
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:50,700
It's a little bit maybe a little bit of a review because I think all of you have taken public health 512 by now.

9
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,979
Right. Which ones are all the epi. Yeah, yeah.

10
00:00:53,980 --> 00:01:01,110
Yes. Okay. So it'll be like a review, but getting into more like biases that might influence surveys and things like that.

11
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,810
Okay. All right.

12
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:18,490
So. For some of you in that room, you can answer what is a healthy behavior is a healthy what is a healthy behavior?

13
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:24,700
Healthy contributes like your way and active in life that contributes to a healthy life.

14
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:28,330
But health in general is subjective, so whatever makes you happy.

15
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:37,390
Okay, so if I want to just eat like cigarets McDonald's three times a day and then do cocaine,

16
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:46,209
that's probably if he laughs out of healthy behavior, then that's like sustainable health.

17
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:52,960
Like if it's, you know, going to be healthy now and healthy behaviors that lead into like a healthy future, I think.

18
00:01:53,950 --> 00:02:06,820
Okay. Yeah. Promoting good physical cardiovascular health, good mental health, healthy behaviors are sometimes called health related behaviors,

19
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:14,560
but it's generally in a very broad sense, like actions taken by an individual that either affects their health or mortality.

20
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,660
They don't necessarily always put like a like a value judgment on it, although in public health,

21
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:23,740
we're working towards what we consider to be like good or optimal health.

22
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,360
Yes. Who decides? That's my issue with that. Who decides what?

23
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:33,399
I don't want to go around preaching to be, oh, you can't do that because it's unhealthy.

24
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,390
And like, you know, it's not my place. Sometimes I feel like it's for them to decide.

25
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:42,560
So it's just like then we're like, Oh, well, then we bring in the motivation to, like, motivate them to want it.

26
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:47,020
And like, that's still bringing in our own judgments on them.

27
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,790
So how do you mean?

28
00:02:48,800 --> 00:03:00,130
So, like, just say, for example, if somebody lives in a food desert and they don't want to eat leafy greens, like, should we try to motivate them to?

29
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:06,909
Yeah, I think we should do the fundamental fact that we're not food deserts, so we need to get in healthier food options.

30
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:11,500
Affordable, healthy food options. Okay. So just say somebody lives in a non food desert.

31
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:17,139
Okay. They live across from the Whole Foods. Like you live in those apartments behind Whole Foods.

32
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:22,190
So you can also go to Whole Foods or you could go to Kroger, you could go to Trader Joe's or whatever.

33
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:26,170
It's everything that's on that Washtenaw Drug. What if they don't want to eat leafy greens?

34
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:32,620
I don't know if they can afford it though, too. They might live there, but those are all expensive options.

35
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:37,000
Okay. Like if they need food stamps, support from that, too.

36
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:40,180
You're kind of seeing the whole holistic picture.

37
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:46,140
But then also, yeah, I think if they have everything good they can afford it, but they still decided to eat at McDonalds.

38
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:53,440
And then it's kind of going into the motivation of, okay, what are your what is making you want to go there more the time,

39
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,370
the stress that you just kind of want a quick meal, not know how to cook.

40
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:01,630
Okay. So is it is it a little open to the group?

41
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:07,000
Any health behavior then condom use vaccination?

42
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:22,170
Exercise or is it a gray area? I think it's all I mean, I think there are some clearcut examples like smoking and cancer and sunscreen and cancer.

43
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,060
I mean, then there's less gray ones.

44
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:29,760
I mean, there's there's one where we pretty much certainly know that you want to wear sunscreen to prevent cancer.

45
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:35,210
That's like a gold standard epidemiology study. Then there's other ones where it's like, we know walking's good for you.

46
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:41,730
That may not be like there's a hard evidence one, but I think that's generally can be safely promoted.

47
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:48,450
I think like magazines too, like, I mean other that this is a hot take.

48
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:56,790
So I think about this a lot. I think for me it's fine as until it starts affecting other people.

49
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:06,420
Yes, that's right. Was so like condom use, for example, you can affect somebody else by giving them an STD or an HIV.

50
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:11,220
Same with vaccine. You're preventing population level immunity.

51
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:23,680
Like if you don't eat leafy greens, you may have more health problems down the line, creating like more strain on the health care system in, you know.

52
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:28,860
But those are very, very distal measures rather than like immediate measures.

53
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:36,270
I like the example of where an elementary motorcycle where I mean, I mean, it's your individual choice to wear a helmet,

54
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:39,880
but you do impact the poor guy who has to go put you in an ambulance, too.

55
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:44,100
I mean, I don't I think even more indirect ones still have a public impact,

56
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,330
which I mean, I'm not saying necessarily they always should be legislation.

57
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:51,870
However, I do think seeing why people would choose to not wear a helmet,

58
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:56,820
is it a place of not, is it not make an informed choice or that kind of stuff?

59
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,629
I think that kind of comes into a little bit too. I do understand where it comes.

60
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:05,160
Yeah, I think you had Edwards as my answer is, it's like, okay, you can do whatever,

61
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,270
but whatever you're doing can't negatively impact people unknowingly.

62
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:13,380
Yeah. Mm hmm. I take.

63
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:19,260
But you are in health, behavioral health, education. So you've had a lot of time to stew about this.

64
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:26,129
Oh, yeah. So what you do how behavior can promote or detract from health for oneself.

65
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:35,640
So smoking status, diet, physical activity, sleep, sexual behaviors, health care seeking behaviors, safety behaviors as well.

66
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:44,790
But it's frequently discussed at the individual level, but sometimes measure for populations, groups or larger.

67
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:51,810
And over the life span, it is dynamic across settings, across cohorts and over time.

68
00:06:53,490 --> 00:07:01,650
So interest and efforts and behaviors, though, didn't really start until about the mid 1900s in terms of like public health efforts.

69
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:11,999
And there is criticism, as you mentioned recently, on the overemphasis of individual choice and personal responsibility.

70
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:21,690
For example, obesity in low SES neighborhoods that can be attributed to food deserts and like the abundance of fast food restaurants,

71
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:25,290
no walkable sidewalks, things that we've talked about before.

72
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:30,480
So there's overemphasis on individual choice, but.

73
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:35,940
It's not subjective, but is seen as subjective.

74
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:43,760
Yeah. Okay. And it is the bane but passion of many researchers existence, including my own.

75
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,719
Because it's not very it's not as clear cut as like, okay, we're going out and we're measuring air pollution levels,

76
00:07:50,720 --> 00:08:00,560
or we're going out and we're sampling water to see how many fecal coliforms there are or even looking at like epidemiological data with case rates.

77
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:07,790
When you're looking at behaviors, it's very nebulous because it's super difficult to measure and people define them,

78
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:14,930
like you said, in different ways and put different values on specific behaviors.

79
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:25,640
So many health behavior theories, as well as theoretical and conceptual frameworks try to understand behavior but also change behavior.

80
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:33,290
So we know a lot about exercise, smoking cessation, things that people do for nutrition.

81
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:43,940
But there's some areas where recently we've tried to use theories or theoretical frameworks to try to describe them, like mask wearing compliance.

82
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:49,609
And it does it it doesn't match up with what we think it would match up with.

83
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:58,910
So like generally if you look at anything related to exercise or smoking cessation or nutrition, you kind of would expect to see,

84
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:04,190
you know, what the typical barriers are, what the facilitators are, what might motivate some people.

85
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:10,490
But when it comes to mask wearing compliance, it's like all over the map, all over the map.

86
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:14,719
And one of my colleagues and my former dissertation chair,

87
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:24,170
Susan Middle Stat you know they recently used the reason action approach to look at people's intention to

88
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:35,960
stay home during quarantine and and mask wearing and it was like do not did not expect to see what we saw.

89
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:42,800
That's why she also had such a difficult time with my dissertation because I was trying to apply a health behavior theory to safety behavior.

90
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,430
And they we saw nothing that we expected to see.

91
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:55,400
So what are you give? What type of healthy behaviors do you think are the most difficult to understand to change?

92
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:00,650
I think one's a heavy value or beliefs associated with them.

93
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:07,940
For example, I guess like what you're looking at as the eyes and like condom use just like that.

94
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:12,589
I mean, there's a big crowd of like abstinence only education ones or people who don't

95
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:15,640
like risk mitigation and they believe that there shouldn't be a panic button.

96
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:19,190
That's kind of hard to promote when there's heavy beliefs at play.

97
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:22,850
Yeah, I know. It's like the culture behind some of these health behaviors.

98
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:30,290
You know, like the culture of what we eat is huge things and that can lead to different health impacts and culture of um,

99
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:37,910
I think a health behavior would be like, you know, in being more mindful and kind of be more in tune for yourself, which helps a lot.

100
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:41,810
So it's just kind of like where the culture can impact health behaviors.

101
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:45,470
Okay. Yeah, I agree with all that.

102
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:51,770
That's not what it is, but it is related to occupational health.

103
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:54,860
But I think a lot of that does feed into that, right?

104
00:10:56,150 --> 00:11:01,690
Associate this. Now, people are like my personal autonomy, my freedoms.

105
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:05,720
If I want to get my hands like stuff at work, just let me do it.

106
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:10,310
And, you know. So, um.

107
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:21,810
I'm going to skip this video, but I'll have you watch it on your own time if you're really interested.

108
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:24,950
I think it's pretty common sense. It's things we've talked about before,

109
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:32,630
basically about how all these factors essentially go into like what you're deciding to do for your health

110
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:40,400
in terms of I'll talk about this quick example and then I'll open the zoom for the guest lecturer.

111
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,070
So healthy company practice models.

112
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:52,430
So most companies will not commit to healthy organizational practices unless they cut costs and improve productivity.

113
00:11:52,730 --> 00:12:01,490
Yeah, that's pretty, you know, capitalism. So, you know, despite what everybody says about what you should prioritize,

114
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:07,399
the findings do suggest that mental health risks should be prioritized over others

115
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:13,460
like cardiovascular because of what we know about the mind body relationship.

116
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:20,120
Get into this more on Thursday. So you making a face might disagree, but I think it's like what you're saying.

117
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:24,500
Where are we putting the. Yes, yes. This is according to Quick and Tetrick.

118
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:34,730
So in a sample of nearly 30,000, they found ten health risk factors significantly associated with work limitations.

119
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:41,030
So from the greatest to the least, they found the ten limitations to the use of relaxation,

120
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:45,830
medication, life, dissatisfaction, high stress, safety belt usage.

121
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:47,510
This was in the eighties. Okay.

122
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:56,260
Jobs that is disparities as faction, current smokers, physical inactivity, poor physical health, BMI greater than 30 and then high blood pressure.

123
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:59,510
So the bolded ones relate to psychosocial factors.

124
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:05,310
What is the use of relaxation? May play a role at play relaxation techniques early.

125
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:13,440
Um, just any relaxation I think which I now think people would call that boundary setting if I

126
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:18,440
had to have a conversation with some someone about that using drugs also like breaks breaks.

127
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:30,829
Yeah, schedule breaks. Not eating lunch at your desk, which I'm very guilty of not taking phone calls after you leave the office.

128
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:38,540
Yeah. Okay, so I'm going to have to stop the hour and then switch over to Zoom and then record that

129
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:44,240
zoom because it doesn't allow you to have two things going into the hour at the same time.

130
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:44,420
So.
