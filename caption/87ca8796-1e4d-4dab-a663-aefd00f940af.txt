1
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:53,110
Maybe. Like.

2
00:01:19,620 --> 00:03:03,700
Right. All right.

3
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:07,400
Good morning, everybody. How are you all doing?

4
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:16,070
Good. I think this is our last warmer weather day that we're going to have and then we're going to get into the cold stuff, so.

5
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:21,200
Yeah. Is it raining out there now? Yeah, it's coming.

6
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,170
How did everything go with the slide deck assignment?

7
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,850
How did you all find that? It was interesting.

8
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,989
It was certainly great to be able to sort of see your, you know, your contributions and the questions and your ideas.

9
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:41,389
It was really exciting just to watch that unfold over the week.

10
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:46,430
So, yeah, let me know if you have any thoughts about any changes you'd like me to make to it.

11
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:58,070
So for next week, you know when we're going to be doing the topic of aging in place, there is the perusal reading assignment for that.

12
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:02,360
So one of the, one of the actual papers, you'll go in and you'll do the assignment on perusal.

13
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:09,890
So that's for next week. So we'll just get used to these different kind of mechanisms to just, you know, have the class participation.

14
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,750
But today we're going to be talking about ageism and age discrimination.

15
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:22,520
So the objectives are to really think about how ageism ageism affects the health of older adults.

16
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:28,610
It's been described as the last socially acceptable form of discrimination in society.

17
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:39,340
So we're going to really sort of think about different ways in which aging can affect health through aging stereotypes in different societies,

18
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:45,170
how they are internalized by older adults, potentially through self perceptions, and how that may impact health.

19
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:52,760
We're going to talk about age discrimination. So behaviors towards older adults, whether in society or in the health care system.

20
00:04:54,230 --> 00:05:01,580
And then finally talking about structural ageism. So what are the actual structures in society that create these or provide the

21
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:05,750
setting by which discrimination and stereotypes then can manifest themselves?

22
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:08,899
We'll talk a little bit about ageism during COVID,

23
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:16,490
because it's a good example about how these different aspects of ageism are actually manifested in the experience in the during the pandemic.

24
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:21,460
And then we'll finish up with a class discussion exercise in small groups and also a large group.

25
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:30,729
So ageism was actually a term that was coined by a gerontologist in 1975,

26
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:37,960
which was just recognizing that it's a process of systematic stereotyping and discrimination against people, people because they are old.

27
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,800
Just as racism and sexism accomplished as for color and gender.

28
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:47,890
So we're going to talk about these different mechanisms by which actually operates to affect health.

29
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:54,459
And it's considered to be this kind of multidimensional concept that operates through this kind of psychological process,

30
00:05:54,460 --> 00:06:01,540
through stereotypes, behavioral process, through actual discrimination, and then these institutional and cultural structures.

31
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:10,450
Ageism can be explicit in terms of actually discriminating potentially overtly to someone who is older, but it can also be implicit.

32
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:14,950
The implicit bias tests. There is one specifically for age.

33
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:17,650
I put the link here if you're interested in doing it,

34
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:25,510
it's trying to sort of get at how our perceptions of older adults are generally more negative than they are positive.

35
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:31,959
So it's kind of an interesting exercise to go through. But we're going to start with just a simple little exercise,

36
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:38,260
which is something actually that this is a question that is administered to on different surveys and different research agendas.

37
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:44,080
I'm going to ask you, what are the first five words or descriptions that come to mind when thinking of somebody old?

38
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,520
You don't have to say anything out loud, just kind of thinking yourself. You can write it down.

39
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:54,280
You know what five words come to mind immediately when you think of somebody old.

40
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,839
We're just taking a minute to kind of think in our heads the write down, if you like,

41
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,890
just one of the first five words that come to your head when you're thinking of somebody old.

42
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:54,630
So I have to say, I asked this to my daughter yesterday. She's 17 years old and her five words were wrinkly.

43
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:04,890
Can't hear, can't see slow and can't walk very well.

44
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:18,830
I mean, those aren't words, but they're phrases. Did anybody have any words they would like to share or phrases they would like to share?

45
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:24,630
Cold, cold, cold, cold.

46
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:29,680
I can explain that. Have I come off? You know, like temperature, cold flavor?

47
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:33,630
I don't know. Because when I was in. Yeah. Like cold fingers.

48
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:38,110
Like, I guess because when I worked at a hospital, they have a hard time signing them.

49
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:42,480
I iPads because their fingers were cold. Interesting.

50
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:49,570
I can also attest to the fact that my grandparents keep their apartment at like 90 degrees and it's,

51
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:53,110
like, intolerable for anyone who's not bothered to type this.

52
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:57,220
Yeah. Yeah. Old people get cold.

53
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:02,680
Colder, I guess. Is that, you know, do circulation, you know?

54
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:07,630
Yeah. Did anybody have any positive?

55
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:14,640
Words of our experienced and knowledgeable.

56
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,490
Great. Yeah. Anything else?

57
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:27,850
First of all, because compared to us have a fixed schedule like I,

58
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:38,260
this is especially for someone who retired like they have more time to arrange what they want to do and they can jump out of the big skip.

59
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:49,700
Great. Sometimes people will use words such as warn and, you know, kind of that'll sometimes come up.

60
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:58,550
But it's just kind of thinking, you know, what? What are, you know, what sort of our social context and how are we being, you know, what we are,

61
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:06,950
what we have experienced and thinking about those people and also just sort of how our beliefs about people have been shaped,

62
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:13,880
I think really from very early on. So that's the idea behind given this aging stereotypes and stereotype embodiment theory.

63
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:16,150
So Becca Levy, one of the readings for today,

64
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:21,830
she's really the guru in this area and done tremendous work in contributing to understanding ageism and health.

65
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:30,650
So stereotype and vitamin theory is, you know, is the way older persons are treated in the way age beliefs are expressed in a culture,

66
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:38,120
tend to be assimilated at a very young ages and they get reinforced over time without really even our awareness of it.

67
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:42,050
So this is really this kind of implicit bias that we might have or beliefs that we have.

68
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:49,250
And research shows that people that actually children develop these negative stereotypes about old age, really at the age of six.

69
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:53,360
So it's like something that we in our in societies,

70
00:10:53,360 --> 00:11:04,160
people develop perceptions of old people that they carry with them through their lives and also shape their own experiences as well.

71
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:09,709
So there's a large body of work that shows that negative stereotypes are associated

72
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:13,490
with worse health outcomes in terms of physical function and cognitive health.

73
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:18,740
There's some evidence to suggest that age stereotypes appear to be stronger and have more

74
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:23,990
negative effects on cognitive health so things like memory than other health domains.

75
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:29,990
But one of the big most of the literature really focuses on how older adults actually

76
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:33,950
internalize these negative stereotypes and the health consequences of that.

77
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:40,879
So, you know, we because I think because we carry these age beliefs with us throughout our lives,

78
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:47,300
when we actually become older, we start to actually process and internalize those stereotypes.

79
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:54,460
This is one of the set of questions that's in the health and retirement study.

80
00:11:54,470 --> 00:12:00,920
Remember I told you there was this leave behind questionnaire? So this is something that's self self completed by respondents.

81
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:05,389
This is given to the participants at the time that they're getting their physical assessments,

82
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:10,970
which are things like their height, weight, blood pressure. They get a hearing assessment as well, other things, blood draw.

83
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:18,770
And then the interviewer will leave this packet with the participant and say, Please, could you complete this and send it back to us?

84
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:23,660
So one of the it's quite an extensive packet. It's got really, really amazing, amazing data.

85
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:29,390
This is a question that's asking specifically about self sections of aging.

86
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:34,310
The first thing that they're asked is many people feel older, are younger than they actually are.

87
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:39,020
What age do you feel? I don't know if we even think about that yourself.

88
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:45,170
The next statements are about the way people feel about their age and about things that happen as they get older.

89
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:50,389
So they're asked to actually say How much you agree or disagree with each statement.

90
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:56,719
For you personally, these are the statements. These are coming from the Philadelphia Geriatric Center Moral Scale.

91
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,840
This is developed by Paul Lawton in 1975.

92
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:03,200
So it goes back a long way. But these are the items.

93
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:09,920
Things keep getting worse. As I get older, I have as much prep as I did last year.

94
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:14,390
The older I get, the more useless I feel.

95
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:21,710
I'm as happy now as I was when I was younger. As I get older, things are better than I thought they would be.

96
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:29,990
So far, I'm satisfied with the way that I'm aging. The older I get, the more I have had to stop doing things that I liked.

97
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,100
And getting older has brought with it many things that I do not like.

98
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:41,360
This is actually a very powerful predictor of health, sort of negative self perceptions.

99
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:48,170
I'm going to show you just some quick descriptors of some of the ways this actually looks in the data from HRC 2010, which is just what I had on hand.

100
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:55,340
But this is, you know, the distribution of the responses to that one item, which is the older I get, the more useless I feel.

101
00:13:55,970 --> 00:14:03,350
Most people strongly disagree with that. Most of these are adults over the age of 50, so they're 51 and older.

102
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:05,690
There's about 7000 in this.

103
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:12,710
The other thing to remember about the Leave Behind questionnaire is it's a given to a random half sample every cycle, every wave.

104
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:15,020
So this is half the age as participants.

105
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:23,300
And the other half would get it in 2012, and you could then combine them to actually have a complete sample of the rest participants.

106
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:30,350
But there's actually quite a distribution here, and people actually do start actually agreeing with this.

107
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:35,479
There are people that say, yes, I strongly agree. So it resonates with people.

108
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,020
There is this sense that when you get older, you become more useless.

109
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:47,090
And then just kind of just for your own interest. This is what this the distribution of what people say, the age that they feel.

110
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:52,520
The median is about 55. These are people that are over the age of 50.

111
00:14:54,110 --> 00:15:05,900
But that does range from 21 to 91. But these still perceptions are really, really important for health.

112
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:09,950
Older adults with more negative self perceptions, they live less.

113
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:17,629
They live to a younger age. They don't live as long they've premature mortality, they have more functional limitations.

114
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:23,660
So they have more difficulty getting out about moving, getting things done at home activities of daily living.

115
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:28,879
And they are less likely to recover from disability once they experience it.

116
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:33,770
So they are chronically experiencing disability without the recovery phase.

117
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:40,550
Why do you think the negative self perceptions of aging have these adverse health outcomes?

118
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:51,350
What is it about feeling bad about aging as you age that makes you actually sicker and more at risk for poor health?

119
00:15:56,110 --> 00:16:01,160
It's kind of like the soccer for. If you have the.

120
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:09,760
Negative self perception life. I'm just going to let you know your age.

121
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:18,030
At home, I think. Prevent that.

122
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:22,290
And then they said that you might get to that. Yes.

123
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:26,430
Yes. Excellent. Yeah, I think that's true. Other thoughts?

124
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:37,900
Patrician. It's like if you have negative perception as you are likely to do less physical activities, it seems like that.

125
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:44,500
And maybe when you got some real disease and you feel bad, you don't ask for help.

126
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:48,909
So it could develop into a chronic disease eventually.

127
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:51,090
So, yes. Great.

128
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:03,630
So some of the research that's being done on this to try to understand the pathways by which this negative cell perceptions impact health.

129
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:10,469
So there's this psychological piece which is understood as the fact that older adults who

130
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:16,020
have more negative views of aging are less likely to say things to their family physician,

131
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:22,600
or when they're being at a check up that, you know, I'm having some pain or I'm having some arthritis, I'm having some trouble thinking.

132
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:33,959
They don't want to identify as being old, so they're less likely to raise and to identify those symptoms they have as particularly age defining

133
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:41,210
symptoms that could be prevented or the treatments could be applied because they don't want to talk about it.

134
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:45,120
They don't want to admit that they are aging because they view it in a negative light.

135
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:55,489
Another way potentially is through behavioral mechanisms that people who are view negative or

136
00:17:55,490 --> 00:18:00,390
view aging as a kind of a bad thing will be less likely to seek preventive health services.

137
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:03,260
So again, the same idea. They don't want to be considered to be aging.

138
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:11,780
They're also more likely to if they actually need care and they being told they need to get care, they will delay going and getting that appointment.

139
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:19,700
So if they've been referred for, you know, cardiac problems or arthritis, they will delay getting that appointment.

140
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:24,910
They will actually identify all the reasons why they have been delaying that appointment.

141
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:29,809
It's because they've had to wait on the phone too long. They've had to actually, you know, wait for the appointment.

142
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:35,600
They couldn't get an appointment. They'll find all sorts of reasons they don't want to as much as they have this self-fulfilling prophecy,

143
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,400
like, oh, I have arthritis, I'm getting old, this is a bad thing.

144
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:49,280
There's also some work that Becca Levy has done recently that actually shows that negative stereotypes do actually affect brain changes,

145
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:53,600
so actually show up in the brain, which could have impacts for cognitive function.

146
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,120
So it's kind of an interesting, you know,

147
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:03,380
thing to think about in kind of understanding how our our stereotypes and our perceptions actually can can affect health.

148
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:15,350
But again, this is all age stereotypes in, I'd say, North American cultures or Western European cultures, but what about other cultures?

149
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:22,130
So the United States is considered to be this independent culture where you're regarded as separated from others.

150
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:26,270
Your personal goals are more important than whatever the social goals are.

151
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:34,190
In other cultures, such as Japan, there is more interdependency where the person is understood as connected to part of our larger social unit.

152
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:40,490
So there is we have to be aware that, you know, different cultures have different age stereotypes.

153
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,110
These are just stereotypes. They're things I just pulled from the literature.

154
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:52,219
Native American cultures consider the old people to be wisdom keepers, very similar to what sort of Mickey was saying,

155
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:55,430
that they you know, that there is a recognition that the longer you lived.

156
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:59,270
Yes. You're getting wrinkly. Yes. You can't hear. But wow, you really know stuff.

157
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,600
You've been there. You can tell me you can give me some advice about things.

158
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:09,750
Aging stereotypes in China. The literature says that the Chinese government and culture have a long

159
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:14,850
tradition of honoring their older people through practices of ancestor worship,

160
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:20,190
values of filial piety and among multigenerational households.

161
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:30,990
Similarly, in Japan, conceptions of aging are rooted in more philosophical traditions that characterizing that characterized aging as maturity.

162
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:38,850
They actually have an image of older person as a wise sage, so it's actually considered to be a socially valuable part of life,

163
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:48,300
a time of rebirth, and actually sort of recognizing that the value that older adults have in society.

164
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,290
So a very different way of thinking about older people than what we're used to and

165
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:56,820
what we're actually potentially stereotyped to think about in the United States.

166
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:08,460
Anybody have any other thoughts about this or perspectives or ideas about different cultures and views of aging in different countries?

167
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:12,350
I know it happens in many countries and they.

168
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:21,000
They call it the purge, which is where when we reach a certain age, they don't want to burden the next generation with their items.

169
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,550
I just think that's really the missing way of addressing our.

170
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:36,930
There are no impermanence and. We're all and we want a matter of fact about the fact you are hard to pass on.

171
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:43,560
And it's kind of I don't know if it's so much as honoring life just in a different way of looking at it.

172
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:50,490
I know I have a death purge, as in like selling all their things, like a big garage sale.

173
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,510
So they start calling their physical possessions.

174
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:59,490
Sort of a recognition of it as sort of a purpose.

175
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:03,730
Right. Other thoughts?

176
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:27,420
All right. So these different stereotypes and different perceptions and different cultures can actually then manifest themselves in behavior,

177
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:30,420
which in terms of discrimination and age discrimination.

178
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:36,690
So discrimination, a lot of the working discrimination comes from racism and racial discrimination.

179
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,030
The work by David Williams.

180
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:44,640
And we're going to look at specifically the scale that he developed to actually assess discrimination in the health retirement study.

181
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:53,120
The it's one of the ways and it's considered to be a mechanism by which it affects health through a form of stress.

182
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:59,520
So experiencing repeated discrimination on a day to day basis, you know, as an as an affront,

183
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:06,030
as an assault, as a kind of daily hassles, is actually thought to affect health through a stress process,

184
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:14,340
through that accelerates cellular aging, that actually causes dysregulation in different body systems leading to premature illness and mortality.

185
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:23,460
So a lot of this work, as I say, has been done looking at racial discrimination, but it also has been done extensively in terms of age discrimination.

186
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:29,729
So again, with the Health Retirement Study and this Leave Behind questionnaire asks participants

187
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:33,389
to fill out this question about and they're not told it's discrimination.

188
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:39,330
Right. They've got a whole bunch of questions that they're answering. And these are the questions that they'll find on a certain page.

189
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:45,150
So they're asked in your day to day life, how often have any of the following things happened to you?

190
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:49,500
You're treated with less courtesy or respect than other people.

191
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:54,240
You receive poorer service than other people at restaurants or in stores.

192
00:23:55,950 --> 00:24:01,380
People act as if they think you're not smart. People act as if they're afraid of you.

193
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:10,440
You are threatened or harassed. You receive poorer service or treatment from then other people, from doctors or hospitals.

194
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,700
And you have this range of responses almost every day to never.

195
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:21,360
You can create an overall index of discrimination, which is just basically averaging those responses,

196
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:27,150
which actually hangs together reasonably well as an internal reliability of the scale.

197
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:35,310
And this is if you then get those mean discrimination scores, employment, then by age, this is again coming from the health retirement study.

198
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:44,430
This is 2008 data, but aged 50 to 65 reports more discrimination, more experiences of discrimination.

199
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:53,070
But then that declines as you get older. Why do you think there might actually be more discrimination among the younger old than the oldest old?

200
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,910
They're still relatively active in society. Yes.

201
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:08,090
They're just encountering more people there and they're engaging in you know, they're engaging in stores and restaurants.

202
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:09,110
They're out and about.

203
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:16,430
They're being exposed to other people, opportunities for that social interaction that could allow them to have experiences of discrimination.

204
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:22,340
What about perceptions of discrimination, identifying that you are being discriminated against?

205
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:37,389
I wonder if, you know, the older you get your less, you're encountering less people,

206
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:41,410
but you're also less attuned to thinking about it as discrimination could be.

207
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:48,370
Cohort differences here. You know, the younger the younger cohort here might have been conditioned to be thinking about discrimination,

208
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:51,370
identifying it as they're interacting with people in society.

209
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:56,260
The older cohort might just consider that to be, Oh, that's just part of the way it's always been.

210
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,860
I don't have a name for it to call it discrimination. I don't I'm not aware of it.

211
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:10,370
But the second part of this survey and the sequence of questions in the Leave Behind questionnaire says if any of those things have happened to you,

212
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:14,750
things like being denied their service, you're not treated well in hospitals.

213
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:18,920
Right. What do you think are the reasons why this has happened to you?

214
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:26,629
And you can check any of these things. You can say it's your ancestry, your race or gender, your weight, the disability,

215
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:31,280
part of your physical appearance, your sexual orientation, your religion, your age.

216
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:36,140
And what do people say is the first thing? What's the most common distribution?

217
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:43,700
It's age. So in the United States, this is representative sample of older Americans.

218
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:50,390
The reasons people say that they're experiencing discrimination if they identify that there is discrimination that they've experienced.

219
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:53,570
The reason, most predominant reason is their age.

220
00:26:56,780 --> 00:27:01,910
And so if we think what that means, that means that someone says you're being treated with less courtesy or respect than other people.

221
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,650
That's because of my age. We see poorer service than other people at restaurants or stores.

222
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:11,090
That's because of my age. They think I'm not smart. That's because of my age.

223
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:15,350
People act as if they're afraid of you. Potentially.

224
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:16,910
Is that because of your age? Possibly.

225
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:25,760
You threatened because of your age, or you receive poor service or treatment from doctors or hospitals because they think because of your age.

226
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:34,550
So it's interesting how these kind of things play itself out. And I have to say, I don't consider myself old, but I'm 56 years old.

227
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:40,340
I mean, and I started to actually encounter experiences of this kind of discrimination.

228
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:48,230
So very subtle. It's, you know, not being treated with the same respect as other people receiving poor service in stores and restaurants.

229
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:53,770
People act as if you're not smart. It's the funniest thing.

230
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:57,470
As soon as you have to, you have trouble seeing something on a like when you're checking.

231
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:01,490
I was checking out at CVS Pharmacy the other day and you got that little,

232
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:05,810
you know, thing you're supposed to use to check out, listed your credit card in.

233
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:09,080
And it's really hard to see what all the instructions are.

234
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:13,760
And as soon as you have like slow down because you're trying to see something, I've forgotten my glasses.

235
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:18,739
People instantly, like the clerk was very much the cashier was very much, you know,

236
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:26,720
just just pressed the green button and just get on with it and you feel like like you you really become in it's so it's very subtle,

237
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:30,770
but it's this view that, oh, I'm too slow, I can't see.

238
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:35,060
It's all the things my daughter says because she can hear.

239
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:38,460
I feel the walking and you, you do experience this.

240
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:46,370
And so it is very subtle and it's not discrimination is not something that's necessarily overt in terms of,

241
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:51,920
you know, being unfairly divide denied a job. Those are major experiences of lifetime discrimination.

242
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:57,680
These are daily hassles and that as you get older, you start to experience them more.

243
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:04,220
I'm attuned to them because I study this. So I'm aware that I'm actually, you know, starting to experience discrimination.

244
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:08,690
But it it's very strange about how it operates in society.

245
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:16,160
Honoring the age old line is what you need.

246
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:26,360
What is the threshold where people start noticing or when other people are, you know, actively started discriminating against people?

247
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:31,909
Because I think to probably very young people have trouble with some of these things.

248
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:37,980
And then there's probably like a middle route that where you don't experience the

249
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,570
discrimination and then once you reach a certain threshold user experience that.

250
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:48,250
Again. I wonder if there are any studies that have. Identify that potentially.

251
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:53,259
Yeah, no, that's a good point. And I'll show you a graph later that actually shows exactly that this kind of high

252
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:58,209
discrimination or age discrimination experienced in younger adults and younger women especially.

253
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:03,100
And then as you get older, you experience it more. I also think it depends on what you look like.

254
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,760
You know, I think if you come across as you know, if you don't have glasses,

255
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:12,640
you have contacts, if you you don't have gray hair or you just don't have wrinkles.

256
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:20,040
My mother in law is like obsessed with plastic surgery and she's always telling me I have to get plastic surgery and I have to color my hair.

257
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:26,110
You know, I came it's like the stereotype that somehow if you don't if you look younger or if you look older,

258
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:29,850
if you look younger, you're going to be treated better. And maybe I would be, you know, maybe then you.

259
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:38,620
Yeah. And do you see like similar dynamics with them groups like relative groups or like a group

260
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:43,900
of 20 year olds with like 135 year old or a group of 60 year olds with like 190 year old.

261
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:50,230
See people, like, fill these, like, fulfill these, like, roles of, you know.

262
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:55,329
Yeah, that's a good question. I don't know any evidence of that. What's your what's your hypothesis?

263
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:59,740
What do you envision? Yeah, I mean, I would. I don't know.

264
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:05,360
Um. Yeah.

265
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:12,260
I mean, I think I'm very I have a very biased perspective on it, but it's not like I took ten years off before I started medical school.

266
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:15,770
So I'm like way older than my peers.

267
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:21,740
Um, and I think it's like wonderful that most of my friends are in their twenties.

268
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:27,650
Um, and I think it makes me a better, you know, the, like I give to them and they give to me.

269
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:35,600
But it also, like when I like, it just feels different when I am like catching up with a friend who's like also in their thirties and it's just,

270
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:43,850
yeah, it's like a relative age, you know, sort of age differences within like a smaller context.

271
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:47,570
Yeah, that's a good question. I don't know. It'd be really interesting.

272
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:52,870
Yeah. I wonder I wonder if I.

273
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,170
But that's a good sort of for what is the context in which those age comparisons are being made.

274
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:05,540
This is Nicky's answer. Good question.

275
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:12,589
Yeah. So this is we're talking this is talking about that we don't only experience discrimination based on age,

276
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:16,460
but there are other dimensions of discrimination that can occur simultaneously.

277
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:22,070
This gets back to the idea of intersectionality, that there's not just one dimension that we are exposed to,

278
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:26,300
but we are we carry multiple identities, multiple social identities.

279
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:33,469
These data come from Gill G's work, and that's a really great piece of anyone wants to read.

280
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:37,730
It actually is his what he's talking about in this paper is how time.

281
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:43,759
It's about just time over the life course and how it's actually a commodity that's not equally distributed.

282
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:50,959
But in any case, in this paper, he presents this data showing how this is just women,

283
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:59,270
only about 10,000 women in a survey called the National Longitudinal Survey of Mature and Young Women from 1972 to 89.

284
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:03,080
On the right hand side is the graph for white women or by age.

285
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:12,530
And then the black woman is on the left side. The curves, the red curve is experienced reports of racism over the life course.

286
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:18,800
The green curve is reports of sexism, and the blue curve is reports of ageism.

287
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:26,329
So what do we see exactly what Nicky was saying, that the experiences of ageism are typically,

288
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:31,190
you know, of this U-shape, where we report more ageism at younger, when we're younger.

289
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:38,360
And so when we get older and then it sort of dies out at this point, partly because we we don't have as much data at that point.

290
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:46,250
But also, you know, we see very different experiences in terms of sexism and racism that are overlaid on top of ageism.

291
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:55,940
So black women are more likely to experience racism at the same time as sexism in this middle period of the life course.

292
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:02,300
Whereas white women are really just experiencing sexism but reported more of it.

293
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:13,110
So just a way of thinking about how multiple identities and multiple experiences

294
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:17,670
of discrimination can actually add up and kind of contribute to greater risk.

295
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:36,910
Anyone have any questions or thoughts about this? I wonder if she thinks that for the black woman group actually because of their race.

296
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:49,510
Some of the others been nations they experience overview of race overlapped their their sexism because they've gotten

297
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:57,520
a higher prevalence of sexism but that doesn't really show that much in a black woman because of that high red line.

298
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:03,280
Of course, I think some there are some overlap there. Yes, I think that's a really good point as an excellent.

299
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,640
Because it's sort of what you attribute your experiences to.

300
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:13,030
If we have some kind of a discriminatory experience, whether you attribute that to your age, your gender or your your race.

301
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:15,430
That's part of the process.

302
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:22,300
And I think what you're saying is that black women may attribute a negative experience due to their race more so than their sex.

303
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:30,490
And then so essentially that's a combination of these two things together that add up that are not multiplicative but actually additive.

304
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:37,000
Great point. All right.

305
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:48,940
What about discrimination in health care? So Section 1557 of the ACA goes about explicitly prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race,

306
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:55,480
color, national origin, age and disability, even sex. So that's actually entrenched in the Affordable Care Act.

307
00:35:56,290 --> 00:36:05,750
They're actually going through a process right now of revising this Section 1557 to actually more explicitly address issues around sex and gender.

308
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:11,110
So it's going to be an interesting process where they're actually soliciting feedback and some comments.

309
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:19,120
But in terms of the data, what the evidence shows in terms of ageism and discrimination in the health care system,

310
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:23,080
the mechanisms by which is thought to operate are multiple.

311
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:26,560
One of them is through just at the in the clinical setting.

312
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:34,090
Physicians will often, you know, if they're with an older patient, talk to the family members instead of the patient directly.

313
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:41,919
There's evidence of ageism in pharmaceutical trials, in randomized controlled trials of pharmaceuticals,

314
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:45,910
where older patients are typically excluded from developing and testing new drugs.

315
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:52,060
Despite the fact that older adults are more likely to be at risk for cardiovascular disease and cancer,

316
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:56,980
people over age 65 are systematically underrepresented in clinical trials.

317
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:02,500
Older people are less likely to receive actually aggressive interventions, for example,

318
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:07,180
for cardiac problems, despite their higher prevalence of disease than younger people.

319
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:14,260
So there's some evidence that this kind of process is going on, actually, and we treat older adults.

320
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:19,540
Anybody have any experience or knowledge about this in the health care system?

321
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:25,820
Those of you that have worked in the health care system. Yeah.

322
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:32,800
I have a hypothesis of the reason why they exclude older adults in testing of the drugs.

323
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:44,719
It's probably because over the last year they have more other chronic disease like, um, like cardiovascular disease themselves.

324
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:49,470
And they may pay less attention of cure than they may what they want.

325
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:55,370
Maybe it's just so like them have better life experience instead of.

326
00:37:56,250 --> 00:38:05,219
Cure this disease. So when we're recruiting patients for this drought, drugs tests, all of us may tend to,

327
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:13,350
like, refuse that due to their basic ones hope for this future test.

328
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:16,730
Interesting. Yeah, that's. That's very plausible. Yeah.

329
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:25,560
And also, when I do my medical intern in China, like some of their class, their families refuse to do this because they have to take that risk,

330
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:35,400
because if something happened to this, older adults, their families will be the ones who'll take care of them or take care of everything.

331
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:39,930
So they didn't want to take this kind of risk. Yeah.

332
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:43,910
That's interesting. I was just one.

333
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:51,260
I was wondering, like with the to the last point about like not receiving echoes or like thrombolytic treatment,

334
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:58,180
um, like whether like contraindications, like medical contraindications is a confounder.

335
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:04,910
So like sometimes older people just have like a greater conglomeration of chronic disease which,

336
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:09,379
which makes them like not eligible for certain types of surgeries.

337
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:15,500
ACOs are like, extremely simple. And so I'm not really sure, like, like ACOs are just like ultrasounds of your chest.

338
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:21,139
So like that that does not kind of like fit the narrative I'm trying to describe.

339
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:31,250
But like I we, I just would be curious if, if the contraindications were like controlled for if you were to still see that,

340
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:36,799
guess it could just be more dangerous to, to me, like for people under anesthesia,

341
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,220
like these things are like actually more dangerous sometimes for older folks. Yeah.

342
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:41,180
No, that's a great point.

343
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:47,360
I don't know this literature at all, so I'm just like, you know, dabbled in it a little bit last night when I was putting this life together.

344
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:56,659
But I think, you know, there's quite a bit of research on this and sort of looking at it, trying to adjust as best they can for underlying conditions.

345
00:39:56,660 --> 00:40:01,910
But I think to the extent that they can actually, you know, rule that out, I don't think that's really been shown.

346
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:03,200
So that's that's definitely a point.

347
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:13,810
Um, as I studied in pharmacy, I found, I believe that older people are usually more sensitive to a higher dose of.

348
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:23,350
So I believe that the company may want to consider about the safety properties.

349
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:27,160
Yeah, typically, that's very interesting. Yeah.

350
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,950
Yeah. Like older people can metabolize medicines slow.

351
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:38,140
So. So it's like, more dangerous sometimes. Like, there's, like, we're tripling the testing that needs to go into, like, how to dose older folks.

352
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:42,250
So that can just be a scarier group to use.

353
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:49,959
Do you think that they will do more testing, like more specific testing in older populations or that you had done more testing

354
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:56,050
and testing specific to evaluate people and that will cost more money and resources.

355
00:40:57,750 --> 00:41:00,940
Interesting. Lexi Reeves Yeah. Sorry.

356
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:07,580
I was just going to say, like in the clinical setting, like I was, I would take patients back to like, I mean, a doctor or something.

357
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:14,020
The family would follow behind. And like you could tell the patient was like nervous or something about the test that they were going to have.

358
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:16,270
So I would like try and talk to her, make it more comfortable.

359
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:21,310
And this was more about the patient's family, like they would try and talk over me while I was talking to the patient.

360
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:30,040
So it was just kind of interesting, like seeing that like it wasn't even in just like the clinical setting.

361
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,840
It was like a family doing it themselves.

362
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:38,079
Family actually allowing you to communicate directly with the person because they were clearly able to hear me.

363
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:42,380
Interesting. I just I mean, sometimes I might have to speak a little louder, but it wasn't even all the.

364
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:45,620
So this discrimination on the part of the family.

365
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:59,630
The other issue that the sort of that people are concerned about is actually a lack of specific training in the health care workforce.

366
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:09,800
So these are just data showing that the number of board certified geriatricians in the United States actually fell by about 3000 between 2020 21.

367
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:17,120
Apparently in the 2020 national match, only 50% of the slots that were for geriatrics were filled.

368
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:20,600
So only half. I vaguely know what it matches.

369
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:25,690
Anybody can. It's the residents matching you for residency. Yes.

370
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:32,860
So you it's when you've actually graduated from medical school and then taking the next step about what specialty you'll be in,

371
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:38,990
very few great newly minted medical doctors will want to do geriatrics.

372
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:44,360
And it's a linear path. So if you don't have residence, then you're not going to have senior doctors.

373
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:49,220
What we mean by that. So it's like you have to go through residency in order to be a geriatric.

374
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:55,250
So like, if you don't have people going into the pipeline, no one's going to be coming out a little bit blind in five years.

375
00:42:56,270 --> 00:43:12,420
Yeah. And why do you think people don't want to do geriatrics? I think something is worried, right?

376
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:21,370
Apparently one of the biggest drivers is the lack of. Financial compensation is, of course, less.

377
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:25,670
They get paid less because it's mostly Medicare. And in the.

378
00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:34,550
So, you know, again, we think about with this what this means from a structure of society is, you know,

379
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:41,219
a capitalistic society that is, you know, not enumerating positions at the same level for treating old people.

380
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:46,380
It kind of devalues that work and devalues older adults in the process.

381
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:52,229
But then this recent commentary was that there's actually, you know, saying that we have a growing problem.

382
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:56,340
We have a lot. Remember, the baby boomers are hitting old age. We don't have enough geriatricians.

383
00:43:56,790 --> 00:44:04,020
And he also goes on to say, it's not just doctors, it's nurses, dentists and public health professionals only because.

384
00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:08,610
So we're talking about like some of the treatment, like older folks they don't get.

385
00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:16,250
Is it possible? It's because like the medical issues they have because like over 65, you know, way like you say what,

386
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:20,370
you will be left out of the workforce so the really good like benefits that probably

387
00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:24,360
brought to you by like your company but they are probably gone by this time.

388
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:28,380
So you're only like Medicare. And is that like a reason?

389
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:36,120
I know in California, like there was like a major complaining to the government that a lot of like elderly retired folks were

390
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:42,180
saying that they are not getting like fair treatment for such like something like novel procedure.

391
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:47,090
And the hospital kept telling them like the time slots, you know, they're filled.

392
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:50,160
Like we have to push it back for like years sometimes.

393
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:58,680
And they were saying that it was a lawsuit and they were saying that it was all because of like the, you know, the the the policy they have.

394
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:03,330
It's like governmental policy. So they were kind of treated differently in hospitals.

395
00:45:03,690 --> 00:45:08,819
Interesting. Interesting. Yeah. No, it sounds like it's it's quite entrenched, right?

396
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:14,820
I mean, it's sort of a whole kind of system, a systematic thing that operates with respect to,

397
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:21,210
you know, insurance as well as, you know, treatment, as well as risk for older adults.

398
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:27,940
This is geriatrics, a specialty that's more like found only in like urban hospitals.

399
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:32,620
Or is that something that can be found in a lot of rural areas, too? I don't know.

400
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:37,359
I would assume that it's everywhere that there should be geriatricians in urban and rural hospitals.

401
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:40,870
I know that there is just generally a shortage of physicians in rural areas.

402
00:45:41,410 --> 00:45:47,800
I would imagine there's even more of a shortage of geriatricians, despite the fact there's a high proportion of older adults in rural areas.

403
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:59,110
So go into geriatrics. Yeah.

404
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:04,460
No, I think it speaks to all of us. I mean, how many people, you know, actually learn about aging in public health?

405
00:46:06,450 --> 00:46:10,069
Just how many people learn about disability in public health? We don't have enough training,

406
00:46:10,070 --> 00:46:17,060
I think even of our public health workforce for training people and understanding aging and the processes of an aging professional.

407
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:21,640
So like I can think what I did, like my psychiatry walk like, like,

408
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:27,920
like there's just a lack of knowledge of how a lot of psychiatric disease presents in older people.

409
00:46:28,370 --> 00:46:34,790
Interesting. Like depression. You know, there's like I really like the computer cube nine or whatever it is.

410
00:46:34,790 --> 00:46:37,970
And like, there's like all of those things like, don't apply to, like.

411
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:39,830
Like, I don't want to say it.

412
00:46:39,890 --> 00:46:47,870
Like, I hate the word atypical because like, old people are not a minority population in the U.S., so therefore, like, that is not atypical.

413
00:46:47,870 --> 00:46:56,660
That's typical. That's normative. Yeah, but. Like during treatment isn't just isn't really too hot in medical school and it's not taught.

414
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:01,610
No. So, like, I think that, like, it's also less exciting to go into a field where, like.

415
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:06,040
There's just it feels like we know less about.

416
00:47:06,550 --> 00:47:15,060
Interesting. It would feel like I had a smaller toolset like tool coders and or like it would just be

417
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:18,660
more generic because like there was just like the nuances didn't exist or something.

418
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:25,049
I don't know. Yeah, it's interesting. Apparently there's being more education now about geriatrics than there has been in the past,

419
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:29,940
like more actually curriculum based in the medical school training now than it used to be.

420
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:35,350
But obviously it's not, you know, extensive and sufficient enough to give people,

421
00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:39,630
you know, to generate excitement about taking on a profession in geriatrics.

422
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:45,930
How much training do people in public health get about aging? Well, not a lot like undergrad.

423
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:58,739
We don't really talk about it banking undergrad, because I took I actually had public health as one for many years at UCSD and we didn't know.

424
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:02,550
And a lot of professors I know of, they don't really do.

425
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:13,790
What about in MPH programs and. This is a first class like talk about aging in this program.

426
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:23,960
Well, you guys are all going to make a difference. It's so important about how you helping in pharmacy.

427
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:36,630
Is there a focus on aging? Yeah, because there's a little difference in how do they use that drug at other people work.

428
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:43,650
Yeah. So yeah, because I have measured that and they may be different.

429
00:48:43,650 --> 00:48:46,680
Those are they may need special care.

430
00:48:47,490 --> 00:48:58,530
So like anticholinergic affect, so and so we have learned a little bit about how are you trained also in understanding polypharmacy.

431
00:48:58,710 --> 00:49:02,570
From what I understand, yeah, that's, you know, a major problem with older adults.

432
00:49:02,570 --> 00:49:10,350
So having a so many medications and different kinds of medication that try to move from different department and they not really interpret it well.

433
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:16,200
So that would be a big problem. They may it lots of redundant jobs.

434
00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:24,780
So this brings us to the source of all this.

435
00:49:24,790 --> 00:49:29,590
You know, we have all these things playing themselves out in the health care system and on the streets and the stores.

436
00:49:29,950 --> 00:49:35,420
Interpersonal reaction. What is the source of this so that this is a discrimination iceberg?

437
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:39,160
This is news mostly and thinking about racial discrimination.

438
00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:44,800
But the idea that there's this iceberg rate and we just we experience these kind of poor treatment in stores,

439
00:49:45,230 --> 00:49:50,100
know treatment in the healthcare system potentially. But what's underneath it is what we can't see.

440
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:57,730
But that's actually the structure that's setting the context by which we view or devalue older adults through processes of segregation,

441
00:49:58,390 --> 00:50:03,190
ageism, ideology and institutional policies. So we'll get into this a little bit and kind of think about it.

442
00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:08,799
So thinking about structural ageism, it's really thinking about, you know, in the United States,

443
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:12,610
essentially from a life course perspective later, life is structured as disengagement.

444
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:16,030
So older adults are experience expected to retire.

445
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:22,690
They experience loss in terms of their employment, their roles, their main occupational role.

446
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:27,999
That may have been a big part of their identity. They are at risk of widowhood losing a spouse.

447
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:36,549
So losing that identity in a marital or a partner relationship, they also are losing their friends through also mortality,

448
00:50:36,550 --> 00:50:43,720
but also just the inability to sort of be as active and engaged outside of the home in traveling and transportation.

449
00:50:44,110 --> 00:50:49,659
They're more likely to live alone and and they experience loss in terms of their their bodies, you know,

450
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:56,680
just declines in function, inability to hear and life just declines in just the actual ability to engage in the world.

451
00:50:57,130 --> 00:51:04,120
So this is a period of loss, you know, in sort of shrinking down is is is what's experienced by older adults.

452
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:09,250
Typically in the United States, there is you know, in the United States is this idea that,

453
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:15,190
you know, there's this American dream that people can go out and do what they need to do,

454
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:21,579
that you're actually it's individual achievement that you can accomplish what you need to accomplish and that you're responsible for your own actions.

455
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:26,379
So losing that sense of of being able to achieve what you want,

456
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:33,220
the individual individual achievement because you're losing function, because you are becoming disconnected from roles,

457
00:51:33,730 --> 00:51:37,990
can have, you know, very significant effects on one's health as you age,

458
00:51:38,650 --> 00:51:44,140
and also the sense of just being pushed off to the side and not included anymore.

459
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:52,690
So this was something that the early general logical theorists recognized and talked about aging as a social structures,

460
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:56,680
but also the idea that there was a structural lag. And I'll explain why that is.

461
00:51:57,460 --> 00:52:05,380
So they recognize that compared to social roles that people occupy early in their lives, later life roles are devoid of content.

462
00:52:05,410 --> 00:52:11,200
So they're just, you know, we become they're just empty to this idea that there's the role,

463
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:17,620
less role of the aged and so mental the way Riley decided that,

464
00:52:17,890 --> 00:52:22,719
you know, really look into this and develop these theories that recognize that there's this structural lag,

465
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:29,100
that there's a misfit between our social institutions that regulate aging, that, you know,

466
00:52:30,010 --> 00:52:37,690
have a retirement at age 65 that, you know, put people in nursing homes and long term care.

467
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:45,909
There's a disconnect between that structure and actually the productivity needs of emerging cohorts of older adults.

468
00:52:45,910 --> 00:52:51,280
So the baby boomers who had been expected to participate in society and are they going to go, you know,

469
00:52:51,310 --> 00:52:59,410
likely into their later years and be, you know, disconnected from social roles, not participating in social activities?

470
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:02,980
Are they going to go quietly into long term care facilities?

471
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:08,650
Potentially not. They might be the generation that actually pushes this and stops this structural lag.

472
00:53:09,010 --> 00:53:15,280
But at the moment we do that is the structures in which we in this society treat older adults.

473
00:53:17,830 --> 00:53:25,180
One of the things that that I think is going to be interesting is what we do with older people in our in our society.

474
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:32,470
What happens? What do we do with older people when they get old and and infirm and not functioning so well?

475
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:40,710
We put them in bed and we put them up. And we put them in institutions.

476
00:53:41,190 --> 00:53:48,120
We put them in a building. We my father recently went through this and was admitted to an institution.

477
00:53:49,230 --> 00:53:56,790
It's to watch that process by which the home setting is no longer able to manage and cope with an aging

478
00:53:56,790 --> 00:54:05,730
person and realize that the structure in our home settings are not equipped to to accommodate aging people.

479
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:09,990
So, you know, his wife didn't have the training to be able to look after him.

480
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:13,920
You know, I was in another city, not able to contribute,

481
00:54:14,190 --> 00:54:21,659
but it's part of this process of where children leave the home and they don't continue to be engaged with that parent.

482
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:24,790
In a collective home, there is a separation.

483
00:54:24,810 --> 00:54:29,850
Older adults become increasingly separated from from structures that can support them.

484
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:38,760
And so in our society, we just put them in a home and, you know, in a home, he was he he declined very quickly.

485
00:54:39,930 --> 00:54:45,780
He was put in restraints. He he has dementia and drugged.

486
00:54:45,930 --> 00:54:46,229
You know,

487
00:54:46,230 --> 00:54:55,680
that that's sort of the way to cope with so many demented people in a home are people with cognitive decline is to to tie them up and to drug them.

488
00:54:56,180 --> 00:55:02,339
And so it's a it's a really peculiar thing to watch that kind of system.

489
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:07,340
And that actually plays out. This is in Toronto. So. A different country.

490
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:13,350
Interesting. I don't like the government like people are caused for like institutionalized

491
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:18,240
such patients or if the family would have to pay out of their own pocket.

492
00:55:18,810 --> 00:55:27,060
There is it. Your family needs to pay because the what's provided by the state is abysmal.

493
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:37,200
It's just if you are relying on Medicare or Medicaid to support you in a home, it's going to be it's going to be a terrible situation.

494
00:55:38,010 --> 00:55:41,160
So it's usually required that you're going to have to be it's going to be need.

495
00:55:41,190 --> 00:55:42,749
And this applies in Canada, too,

496
00:55:42,750 --> 00:55:52,920
that you need to have your own funds to be able to provide a safe space for your older person in a in an institution that is really different.

497
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:56,020
Compared to in China, what happens in China.

498
00:55:56,050 --> 00:56:05,020
So it turns out that if you have like dementia, it's like you don't have like children are choosing to and choose to not take care of you.

499
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:10,310
There is actually like a government wide wrong for that.

500
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:17,110
We have to take people away. Of course, I wouldn't say it's like great, like living condition, probably that.

501
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:22,750
And like, they seem to like drug people and just, you know, restrain them if necessary.

502
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:26,850
That's like are paid by the government. Interesting.

503
00:56:27,030 --> 00:56:31,740
Yeah. But if you want a better living condition, that's out of your pocket.

504
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:40,930
But still, this process of putting people in an institution, not having intergenerational supports,

505
00:56:41,050 --> 00:56:50,680
it's actually like a choice that I can speak for, like the Shanghai government, because we do we do have like a similar case in the family.

506
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:57,450
And it depends on like your family, whether like you want to take care of that part of that.

507
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,770
And with my situation, I was actually my father's brother.

508
00:57:03,190 --> 00:57:08,440
So we were talking about what if my grandparents passed away and what should we do with him?

509
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:17,469
Because he's like mentally stabilized. He has like schizophrenia and we ask like the local, like the government facility.

510
00:57:17,470 --> 00:57:22,980
And they were like, Yeah, we can take care of him. But that's like the similar, like institution you're talking about.

511
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:28,530
I see. Yeah. Other comments.

512
00:57:35,030 --> 00:57:42,139
So one of the ways, although there's a structural lag and one of the ways that we try to assess or we can actually investigate this experience

513
00:57:42,140 --> 00:57:48,980
of being slowly and slowly isolated and pushed aside in society as we age is this measured measure of purpose in life.

514
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:54,290
This is a measure that comes from coral reef. It's a psychological well-being measure.

515
00:57:54,290 --> 00:58:02,060
But this is one domain which is called purpose in life. And it's been used quite a bit in older adults and older surveys of older adults.

516
00:58:02,570 --> 00:58:05,170
And this is how it's assessed in the health retirement study.

517
00:58:05,180 --> 00:58:12,980
There's these six one, two, three, four or five, seven items which tap into people's sense of purpose and belonging as they age,

518
00:58:14,150 --> 00:58:18,380
you know, and things like my daily activities often seem trivial and unimportant to me.

519
00:58:19,490 --> 00:58:25,250
I don't have a good sense of what I'm trying to accomplish in life. I have a sense of direction and purpose in my life.

520
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:32,329
And this is a game where you can take it and make it into a skill that's been quite a bit of work looking at this

521
00:58:32,330 --> 00:58:39,380
particular skill and how it shapes health and it's actually very strongly and repeatedly associated with death.

522
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:43,970
So if you have a low purpose in life, you have a higher risk of death.

523
00:58:45,650 --> 00:58:52,700
It's a pretty robust finding. You see this in actually quite a different number of studies and different cultures.

524
00:58:53,180 --> 00:58:59,090
But this is seems to be something that really is associated with longevity,

525
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:05,400
you know, potentially because you have a sense of of belonging, that you have a,

526
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:14,410
you know, a reason to a reason to live, a reason to take care of yourself, a reason to get up every day, reason to clean yourself, a reason to eat.

527
00:59:15,170 --> 00:59:20,630
You know, that that those all those things can have cascading effects then to actually increase your life.

528
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:32,940
And then, you know, one of the other ways in which this structural ageism operates is also,

529
00:59:33,210 --> 00:59:37,200
as we read about in today's readings, in terms of financial exploitation and older adults.

530
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:43,139
So recognizing overall, it's become more and more isolated that they are increasingly on their own,

531
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:49,500
without connections with other people, what they are at risk for financial exploitation.

532
00:59:50,070 --> 00:59:52,200
So this again is in the Health Retirement Study.

533
00:59:52,200 --> 01:00:00,520
Peter Lichtenberg at Wayne State University, a great geriatrician and gerontologist, has been done a tremendous amount of work on this.

534
01:00:00,540 --> 01:00:05,130
He was the one who actually said to us, Can you just put this one question in this survey?

535
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:10,220
Just one. I'll ask one question. And they did. Jackie Smith was when he said, sure, we can put this in.

536
01:00:10,230 --> 01:00:13,379
I don't even think she vetted it by any of the pictures.

537
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:18,930
So we'll put this in and it's you know, he's done all this work on it to show how how prevalent it is,

538
01:00:19,350 --> 01:00:25,650
who's at risk for fraud, who you know, what kind of older those people who I know who would be more at risk.

539
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:33,990
And so as we saw in the readings that the risk factors but it's being exploited and in saying yes I've been a risk of experienced fraud is that,

540
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:36,180
you know, there's limited support networks.

541
01:00:36,270 --> 01:00:43,460
So, you know, just being increasingly, increasingly isolated, older adults are more likely to have a landline as well.

542
01:00:43,470 --> 01:00:46,710
So, you know, are sort of susceptible to scams.

543
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:49,469
And they are they want to talk to people.

544
01:00:49,470 --> 01:00:57,180
They're they can be lonely and they're isolated and someone's calling them and they can easily be sucked into that.

545
01:00:57,930 --> 01:01:01,739
Interesting that younger old individuals, not the oldest old, they're the ones.

546
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:10,620
So people that are like 70, 65, 70 are the ones who are experiencing this more often than those who are sort of 85 or so.

547
01:01:11,370 --> 01:01:20,560
What do you think that might be? Like.

548
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:26,490
I like the suit, the ultra old, like. Have they already turned over finances to their children at that point?

549
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:30,730
Possibly, yeah. Yeah. Financial power of attorney.

550
01:01:31,060 --> 01:01:34,260
Yes. Victoria.

551
01:01:36,470 --> 01:01:40,230
Answer. Phones are independent. Yes. Yes.

552
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:49,870
Right. Do you know there's this one thing that's been going around for a number of years, this one scam, I'm sure you've heard of it,

553
01:01:50,260 --> 01:01:57,490
but that someone will call an older adult and say or text them and say your grandson, you know,

554
01:01:57,500 --> 01:02:02,460
and they'll have the name, you know, is in desperate trouble in some foreign country and needs money.

555
01:02:02,470 --> 01:02:10,490
Right. You've heard of this. And even older adults who have like a college education will go out and send that money.

556
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:16,420
I know they're kind of just driven. And I wonder if that's something about this young old that they have the ability to destroy.

557
01:02:16,420 --> 01:02:22,120
We've got the access to all their accounts. If we're going to go out, you know, go to Western Union, get the money, order send the money,

558
01:02:22,510 --> 01:02:27,670
and sort of being able to go to, you know, and implement that and make that happen.

559
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:35,290
Anybody have any older adults who have experienced this kind of financial exploitation?

560
01:02:35,830 --> 01:02:39,250
Yeah, my godmother's mother, she almost did it.

561
01:02:39,550 --> 01:02:47,920
Yeah. Heard that scam. Yes. And she was like 92, and she still could, like, you know, move around and do that.

562
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:51,430
So they were she was about to go to the bank and write the check, so.

563
01:02:52,810 --> 01:03:03,020
Yeah. Super scary. Scary. Okay.

564
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:10,490
Let's take a short break and then we'll come back and talk about how these things have all played themselves out during COVID.

565
01:03:10,970 --> 01:03:14,030
So we'll break for like, you know, 10 to 12 minutes and then we'll come back.

566
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:29,990
So here's your idea of how you actually get somebody coming in Taiwan.

567
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:36,710
Oh, yeah. So now I'm a master at the convergence of.

568
01:03:38,340 --> 01:03:42,570
Have you worked at the firm yet? What was.

569
01:03:42,810 --> 01:03:46,290
What was your. Wow.

570
01:03:46,620 --> 01:03:49,960
How was that great experience.

571
01:03:50,420 --> 01:03:54,260
We know how hard it to come in and the promises.

572
01:03:54,990 --> 01:04:00,310
It works. Yeah. Yeah. Do you have, like, a cancer?

573
01:04:00,450 --> 01:04:04,260
Oh, I was just.

574
01:04:07,210 --> 01:04:13,100
I believe it's called. Just dealing with dementia?

575
01:04:13,330 --> 01:04:18,210
No. Interesting. I remember.

576
01:04:19,490 --> 01:04:23,700
Interesting. Yeah, very long. Yeah, that's really hard.

577
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:27,169
Heard. Yeah. But mostly, I think.

578
01:04:27,170 --> 01:04:30,290
Is that, um. There is. Oh, wow.

579
01:04:31,670 --> 01:04:36,950
What do you like besides, like, people my to get, like, no anticholinergics, no benzos.

580
01:04:37,610 --> 01:04:47,930
What else? Yeah.

581
01:04:48,790 --> 01:04:52,390
Not necessarily on behalf of these farmers. Yeah.

582
01:04:52,430 --> 01:05:01,170
Yeah. Yeah. So we made headlines. They came breeds of drugs from out of place and as into that.

583
01:05:01,750 --> 01:05:06,900
And they evacuated before they could actually see.

584
01:05:07,930 --> 01:05:10,930
You don't know if that's so. It was just.

585
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:16,090
Yeah. Yeah, just things like that. Yeah.

586
01:05:16,570 --> 01:05:21,670
Yeah. Do you want to go? Do you want to be continue doing anything?

587
01:05:23,050 --> 01:05:30,170
Um, yeah, I actually, I, I may want to be studying digital, so I just kind of.

588
01:05:30,550 --> 01:05:34,450
Well, that's okay. That's all that the purpose of this first one is.

589
01:05:34,450 --> 01:05:39,820
Yeah. I always have a good for you. That's great.

590
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:47,170
Yeah. I mean, at first I have been, you know, when I graduated, so.

591
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:55,580
Yeah. Oh. Have.

592
01:05:57,620 --> 01:06:07,320
Right. The answer that people are referring to like her.

593
01:06:15,830 --> 01:06:32,410
That's. Yeah, but it was from a different experience.

594
01:06:33,130 --> 01:06:37,610
Is that what you're saying?

595
01:06:41,620 --> 01:06:54,670
I mean, she has it all along the way. What do you mean?

596
01:06:57,950 --> 01:07:07,530
Well, yeah, I just feel like a 14 year old lady.

597
01:07:07,570 --> 01:07:09,970
I mean, like, you know, I don't know that.

598
01:07:10,390 --> 01:07:26,470
That's why I didn't think it was great if I was married and then, just, like, you know, your email and everything.

599
01:07:27,010 --> 01:07:39,489
Yeah. It's what I have always enjoyed thinking.

600
01:07:39,490 --> 01:07:43,200
Just like sleep for me. How you doing? Great. Yeah.

601
01:07:45,530 --> 01:07:52,110
Yeah. Yeah, it's okay, because we are sort of used to it.

602
01:07:53,140 --> 01:07:56,860
Yeah. So I guess the buildings are.

603
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:09,210
Well, you could say that that's still scary because I have had so many for our faces.

604
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:15,810
I have always been very open about what your experience had before.

605
01:08:15,990 --> 01:08:20,030
Yeah, but not so often as though.

606
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:26,580
Yeah. I think as you haven't seen anything that me of barrels and minerals.

607
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:33,030
No, no, no, no. And you're not developing an explosion.

608
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:42,090
Yeah, I think so. Yeah. Yeah, I, I try not to use something that has to do with at least.

609
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:48,420
Yeah. I think people are so different.

610
01:08:48,650 --> 01:08:52,010
Even, like, I think, you know. Yeah. Yeah.

611
01:08:52,020 --> 01:08:55,319
You don't have a favorite line, but I think.

612
01:08:55,320 --> 01:09:02,960
Yeah, yeah. That's where you think you've got to do it.

613
01:09:05,070 --> 01:09:13,380
Okay. Okay. I'd like to tell you, the world is really going to get it all in your head.

614
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:17,980
Yeah. Yeah.

615
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:25,980
Okay. Okay. I'll do it. It's like that.

616
01:09:27,980 --> 01:09:32,970
It's like a like I said, it's civilians because they are terrorists.

617
01:09:34,140 --> 01:09:38,700
And they were trying to kill the University of Chicago just like that.

618
01:09:39,330 --> 01:09:46,979
Yeah, but it like, people just, like, spit on and then it's like, you know, has like these, like these things that,

619
01:09:46,980 --> 01:09:51,140
like, make it really hard to invent your shirt, like, on your elbows, and it changes your center.

620
01:09:51,150 --> 01:10:00,090
And like, when you try to come up with new hard to get up and it's like almost like you're like,

621
01:10:00,090 --> 01:10:05,490
oh, is there any places, stuff like that where things are like, hard to see.

622
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:15,030
But they were like trying to be like trying to do it like during Survivor, you remember,

623
01:10:15,330 --> 01:10:19,680
it was like a it was like a medical student told me about it, which makes me think of all the power.

624
01:10:20,180 --> 01:10:31,739
Right. Was to try to like, you know, it was like some alternative medicine because you don't have to train people like no, you've never experienced.

625
01:10:31,740 --> 01:10:37,810
And so to try to learn. Okay. Just like a greater understanding of, like, what they're actually feeling.

626
01:10:37,890 --> 01:10:48,460
I called my roommate and I've always tried to use, like, how I'm going to try and find it a little more.

627
01:10:50,460 --> 01:11:12,290
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Well. Really is.

628
01:11:23,190 --> 01:11:28,710
For them. It's helpful to talk to them about it.

629
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:36,370
Whoever is just behind me the first week.

630
01:11:37,780 --> 01:11:51,890
Oh, my. I mean, and other people aren't really jumping on.

631
01:11:55,810 --> 01:11:58,810
I knew it was ready to go. It's like.

632
01:12:01,480 --> 01:12:12,630
I don't know if I can like kind of share this stuff, but like it was on an NPR and like, you know, but like, you know, that's,

633
01:12:13,070 --> 01:12:19,000
you know, that's like you look at, I think you're going into battle and then there's like a whole, like, little mess.

634
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:23,580
I haven't watched them, like, a plane crash, but like the simulations.

635
01:12:24,730 --> 01:12:31,090
Oh, this is like a this is like an empire of, like, journalists who like to run and,

636
01:12:31,090 --> 01:12:36,550
like, you know, they just talk about like it's it's like, hard to, like, grip thing.

637
01:12:37,550 --> 01:12:45,970
But, um. So yeah, I guess they like war, the suits, the airport and trying to, like, you know, get around and like.

638
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:54,190
Yeah. It's like, it's like, you know, making the more like one of the driver goggles or like pregnancy, but yeah, like, whatever.

639
01:12:54,190 --> 01:12:58,930
Like, yeah, that's like a joke.

640
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:02,890
What is the. What's the website? Um.

641
01:13:03,940 --> 01:13:08,140
So I just searched like age simulation series.

642
01:13:09,210 --> 01:13:22,240
W If you are of the impression that they show the exact same thing and it's just like the video alone.

643
01:13:25,050 --> 01:13:37,610
So it's like this real human that's like, you know, but then you get to take it off.

644
01:13:37,780 --> 01:13:44,350
Yeah. Oh, okay.

645
01:13:44,410 --> 01:14:18,060
Yeah, I was. Oh, I think just a level of income for a parent has seen that.

646
01:14:18,090 --> 01:14:23,610
So. She's.

647
01:14:41,210 --> 01:14:46,150
Yeah. Organization.

648
01:14:47,790 --> 01:15:10,210
So. No.

649
01:15:19,490 --> 01:15:28,170
And the studio is just sharing something about this, a suit sort of to actually allow people to experience what it's like to be old.

650
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:33,450
You know, that actually makes it difficult for you to bend down and to hear and to see.

651
01:15:33,450 --> 01:15:38,850
And I think it suggests probably it could be used for training medical students.

652
01:15:39,330 --> 01:15:47,850
Yeah, I think just like you, when you're like treating people that you don't know what they're feeling, you know, like it's hard sometimes.

653
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:50,840
It's like being an OBE, but you've never given birth.

654
01:15:50,870 --> 01:15:56,429
It's like, you know, like and I think the idea is that I think at some medical schools, they're using it to just try to,

655
01:15:56,430 --> 01:16:01,920
like, help people just know what it was like to to be the patients that you're treating.

656
01:16:02,580 --> 01:16:05,690
But it's also cool and like such a blessing.

657
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:15,560
You get to take it off and return to your time. Like, Okay, we'll get going again to talk about it.

658
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:20,820
It's some of the ways in which all these different forms of ageism have sort of played themselves out over the pandemic.

659
01:16:22,020 --> 01:16:26,580
So we read the paper about what happened on social media with respect to ageism.

660
01:16:27,270 --> 01:16:37,889
So, you know, there was this sort of rise in ages and ages, sentiment over the social media during the pandemic,

661
01:16:37,890 --> 01:16:42,060
particularly the early months of the pandemic, which was really essentially.

662
01:16:44,020 --> 01:16:50,200
Assessing and saying that the elderly people were these, you know, taking resources from younger people.

663
01:16:51,100 --> 01:16:57,370
This hash tag boomer remover was actually like really focused on introducing intergenerational discord.

664
01:16:58,270 --> 01:17:02,860
This sentiment that older adults should actually sacrifice themself, not be using health care resources,

665
01:17:02,860 --> 01:17:08,470
not taking up beds, not taking of ventilators, allow that for the younger generation.

666
01:17:09,100 --> 01:17:14,890
In Italy, in Sweden, they actually said age limits for providing intensive care treatment or ventilator machines.

667
01:17:16,060 --> 01:17:21,940
And in the U.S., there is this big directive to begin conserving resources in the early stages of the pandemic,

668
01:17:21,940 --> 01:17:26,140
which actually kind of opened up a lot of possibility for for aged care.

669
01:17:26,470 --> 01:17:34,960
It also actually had a tremendous impact on people with disability who are also at risk for not receiving treatment.

670
01:17:35,980 --> 01:17:42,790
The idea that they didn't deserve the same level of treatment and care as people without disabilities do.

671
01:17:42,940 --> 01:17:48,610
Do people remember this? Is this something that people were conscious of decades of think about?

672
01:17:48,670 --> 01:17:52,210
Think back on the early stage of the pandemic and this kind of stuff in social media.

673
01:17:54,940 --> 01:17:59,110
Well, you know, it's kind of like PTSD. You have to go back and think about those eight months of the pandemic.

674
01:17:59,110 --> 01:18:06,790
And, um, and I, I wasn't, I can't because I'm not a social media user,

675
01:18:08,290 --> 01:18:10,959
but kind of reading over in the past and seeing sort of people out there

676
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:15,400
analyzing these data now and seeing what was coming out was really interesting.

677
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:19,180
Um, do people here, do you guys use Twitter?

678
01:18:20,780 --> 01:18:26,000
I mean, I don't really know anything, but I did read that.

679
01:18:26,210 --> 01:18:32,500
Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, so my kids don't use anything like Twitter.

680
01:18:32,510 --> 01:18:35,180
They're always on Instagram. So that's sort of a different, you know, platform.

681
01:18:35,180 --> 01:18:40,280
But I think it's with the same kinds of sentiment was coming out in different, across different platforms.

682
01:18:40,820 --> 01:18:47,510
Um, so it's kind of interesting actually to think about using Twitter and social media data to actually understand these things.

683
01:18:47,510 --> 01:18:54,409
They're really cool ability to actually get into social perceptions and things that we don't have access to.

684
01:18:54,410 --> 01:18:59,570
In terms of surveys, we don't actually collect this kind of information. It's getting this sort of sentiment that's in society.

685
01:19:01,220 --> 01:19:09,830
And if anyone ever worked with Twitter data and used it for research, I have people on my team that do this.

686
01:19:09,830 --> 01:19:13,940
And so the University of Michigan is pretty fortunate to have access to Twitter data.

687
01:19:14,330 --> 01:19:18,380
They have something called this DECA Hose, which is a 10% random sample of tweets.

688
01:19:19,250 --> 01:19:25,270
It used to be called the garden hose and it became the fire hose, now a hose.

689
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:28,970
So they get more and more of these like samples of tweets with big, big, big data.

690
01:19:29,870 --> 01:19:34,609
But it's really, you know, gives the people an ability to kind of work with, you know, analyzing tweets.

691
01:19:34,610 --> 01:19:40,850
Some of them are geo referenced. You can see the locations that they are actually posting and everything you can see in space and time.

692
01:19:41,750 --> 01:19:47,389
And then also, you know, you get into a lot of the kind of cool techniques that are taught in the school

693
01:19:47,390 --> 01:19:50,870
of information in terms of machine learning and natural language processing,

694
01:19:50,870 --> 01:19:55,669
to actually then analyze like so much data and then use those techniques to kind of get into it.

695
01:19:55,670 --> 01:20:05,270
So I'm working with someone on my team who's looking at Twitter data to understand attitudes towards cognitive function and disability,

696
01:20:05,270 --> 01:20:11,480
particularly sort of these sort of biased views that are, are being expressed in society.

697
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:19,120
There was also this not only sort of negative ageism,

698
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:23,620
but there was this kind of benevolent ageism that came up in the early months of the pandemic in that,

699
01:20:24,010 --> 01:20:31,240
you know, older adults were sort of perceived as being very vulnerable and, you know, key target for social distancing policies.

700
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:40,809
And really but the downside to that was that, you know, the risk of constantly being, you know, isolated, avoiding crowded places,

701
01:20:40,810 --> 01:20:49,660
fear of actually going to try to places more likely to have sort of long term consequences for older adults, cognitive and physical health.

702
01:20:49,660 --> 01:20:55,569
So being that experiencing that extended period of isolation, you know, disruptions in daily life,

703
01:20:55,570 --> 01:20:59,730
social interactions, you know, not being able to be employed and volunteer,

704
01:21:00,640 --> 01:21:09,879
lack of activity, participation in that sense of anxiety are likely to have long, long, long term consequences for for our aging population.

705
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:16,900
So keep your eyes and be aware of this and in your future research that you'll be really seeing these effects downstream,

706
01:21:17,050 --> 01:21:21,580
particularly for older, older adults and their risk for dementia in front of the functional decline.

707
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:30,860
And we talked a lot about sort of what happens to older adults in the practice of institutionalization.

708
01:21:30,870 --> 01:21:35,480
So I do this this kind of segregation. You know, we put older adults in in institutions.

709
01:21:35,990 --> 01:21:39,400
And that itself was a tremendous health risk in COVID.

710
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:49,040
So just the fact that older adults are kind of concentrated together in one place and then having to be at risk for COVID,

711
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:56,270
experiencing the greater mortality due to COVID inability to actually protect older adults from infection in that context,

712
01:21:56,630 --> 01:22:03,230
and then isolating them completely, reducing, you know, restricting any access from family members,

713
01:22:04,750 --> 01:22:11,570
cutting off their ties with their families and social interaction or, you know, sort of a double whammy of impacting their health.

714
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:20,250
So it's you know, I think it was a profound impact for older adults and largely, again,

715
01:22:20,270 --> 01:22:26,420
because of our structures and how we have treated older adults and how we've put them into interesting institutions.

716
01:22:27,290 --> 01:22:31,999
You know, that's the structure of society versus if they were more in an intergenerational,

717
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:38,960
intergenerational households, there wouldn't be this isolation and there wouldn't be this increased risk of infection.

718
01:22:41,430 --> 01:22:43,050
So again, we see it play itself there.

719
01:22:45,570 --> 01:22:52,800
One of the most amazing sources of data and understanding older adults since COVID is the study called the COVID 19 Coping Study.

720
01:22:53,490 --> 01:22:58,950
So Jessica Finley and Lindsey Kobayashi on the interior of a scene Department of Epidemiology.

721
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:03,599
Jessica was a post-doc. She's now a research investigator working with me.

722
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:09,720
And when the pandemic hit, these two people decided they were going to do something about it and they're going to start a survey.

723
01:23:09,870 --> 01:23:15,179
And they started a snowball survey online to recruit older adults over age

724
01:23:15,180 --> 01:23:19,920
55 and to ask them about their experiences of isolation during the pandemic.

725
01:23:20,310 --> 01:23:25,530
They surveyed people monthly. It's a snowball sample, and it just grew and grew and grew.

726
01:23:25,530 --> 01:23:32,130
I think there's, you know, actually 7000 about 4000 of these people have been actually followed over time.

727
01:23:32,940 --> 01:23:38,310
They actually the data come from not just the United States, but there is Canadians and people from other countries as well.

728
01:23:39,390 --> 01:23:44,340
I just gave a shout out to it because if you are ever interested in working with the data,

729
01:23:44,340 --> 01:23:50,370
they are desperate for people to come and analyze their data, take a lead on a paper, put in a request.

730
01:23:50,910 --> 01:23:55,400
They have a lot of quantitative data, but they also have reams of qualitative data as well.

731
01:23:55,410 --> 01:23:58,860
They did a lot of in-depth interviews and open ended questions.

732
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:03,060
So it's really interesting to see what's coming out of that study.

733
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:09,120
And one of the things that just came out recently is evidence of how these negative

734
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:14,159
self perceptions of aging can actually play out and have health consequences.

735
01:24:14,160 --> 01:24:22,290
So this kind of perception that, you know, in the early months of the pandemic, that older age is there, you know, old people are vulnerable.

736
01:24:22,530 --> 01:24:27,240
They need protection. And this was a pretty strong narrative in the early months of the pandemic.

737
01:24:27,750 --> 01:24:34,530
And in analyzing these data from the COVID coping, the study showed that older adults who are more likely to say that there was

738
01:24:35,190 --> 01:24:39,270
a disrespect for older adults and that that increased during the pandemic,

739
01:24:39,870 --> 01:24:43,380
experienced more rapid declines in their memory over time in their follow up.

740
01:24:43,390 --> 01:24:51,330
So they had this sort of long term impact of this self-perception that they were being disrespected, that they were, you know,

741
01:24:51,330 --> 01:24:58,350
this idea of internalizing these negative stereotypes that played itself out in declines in memory,

742
01:24:58,830 --> 01:25:00,659
again, through these potential mechanisms that they are,

743
01:25:00,660 --> 01:25:08,160
then, you know, if they feel that they're being, you know, devalued, they will, you know, less likely to take care of themselves,

744
01:25:08,490 --> 01:25:13,980
less likely to engage with others that could actually have these long term effects on their cognitive function through memory.

745
01:25:15,540 --> 01:25:22,710
Anybody work with these data? Don't know about it. It's a it's a super, super source.

746
01:25:24,870 --> 01:25:30,780
Okay. So we're going to take some time and do a couple of class discussion activities.

747
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:41,550
First of all. I want to do a pair activity where you pair up with someone and just share your ideas and what you put together for your slide deck.

748
01:25:42,030 --> 01:25:46,750
So what you actually put on your slide deck, what kind of thoughts you have, just have that exchange.

749
01:25:47,010 --> 01:25:52,320
We do that for about 10 minutes or so and then we'll review group again for for a group discussion.

750
01:25:58,370 --> 01:26:11,570
For. Okay.

751
01:26:14,300 --> 01:26:19,590
So you can tell me because I'm here.

752
01:26:20,340 --> 01:26:24,550
Okay. Yeah.

753
01:26:24,860 --> 01:26:28,230
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I guess.

754
01:26:30,820 --> 01:26:43,840
So I was. I was emotional over there, and I suppose I'm kind of my definition of emotional support and social support.

755
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:50,110
So I did use it there on some over to my friends and.

756
01:26:52,150 --> 01:27:00,959
This is. That's right.

757
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:08,600
Like, you know, for me, I think we should understand on this part of our system,

758
01:27:09,230 --> 01:27:15,820
because I think we're getting more social support and financial support.

759
01:27:16,410 --> 01:27:21,120
I refuse to and all this type of know.

760
01:27:21,270 --> 01:27:27,770
But yeah, I think that's how they are trying to achieve educate.

761
01:27:27,980 --> 01:27:34,190
And also, I know I was losing the poster.

762
01:27:34,200 --> 01:27:37,220
Yeah. Mm hmm.

763
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:42,110
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

764
01:27:42,760 --> 01:27:55,540
I mean, I guess I guess there are two factors driving factors that I discovered that I.

765
01:27:57,490 --> 01:28:01,440
So I see dogs. And so it's like, yes.

766
01:28:01,570 --> 01:28:07,120
And and y as they always saying it's because that's how.

767
01:28:08,260 --> 01:28:13,330
That's because they count the financial powers all the time.

768
01:28:13,540 --> 01:28:18,970
And I refuse to use their emotions in that matter.

769
01:28:20,290 --> 01:28:23,830
I don't have that discussion.

770
01:28:26,140 --> 01:28:29,290
So it's problem. You are so strong.

771
01:28:30,190 --> 01:28:44,420
Yeah. Read more how sometimes as I have experienced so much from my professor after my mother retired.

772
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:47,900
Seriously, though I don't have.

773
01:28:49,370 --> 01:28:54,380
Girlfriend. I just. Yes, I am.

774
01:28:54,590 --> 01:28:59,970
I just resolved to try and. What happened here.

775
01:29:00,370 --> 01:29:08,660
And as far as what I think is our responsibility.

776
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:12,750
I have to. Yes.

777
01:29:13,170 --> 01:29:19,080
And how do you know that? So I shouldn't have gotten married.

778
01:29:22,070 --> 01:29:26,110
It's funny how much you recall.

779
01:29:26,580 --> 01:29:33,889
I don't really remember that. I've been reading that very few because it doesn't just have their own business.

780
01:29:33,890 --> 01:29:37,520
They have to keep doing the same.

781
01:29:39,380 --> 01:29:48,330
What do you like other than what kind of they do? And I just think that you really like I mean, he may have changed a lot of things,

782
01:29:48,380 --> 01:29:54,380
but I mean, I don't really look at Richard so many times in the same cut issue.

783
01:29:54,740 --> 01:30:03,010
So I know he was just trying to survive, you know, like there's a book come out.

784
01:30:03,470 --> 01:30:08,930
Yeah, it's just like, I like movies.

785
01:30:08,930 --> 01:30:13,759
Everything is great. And it's just like a smart guy.

786
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:26,610
Like, that is just this. On the on October 1st, you may feel lonely, but you found that to be true.

787
01:30:27,240 --> 01:30:38,390
I've been out of the country when I was there, but you'll see various videos like.

788
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:43,590
I just didn't find out that it was in town.

789
01:30:44,180 --> 01:31:04,030
I read about the stakeout downtown after the situation, and I was like, Dude, you know?

790
01:31:04,290 --> 01:31:18,330
I was like, Yeah, so you know how, you know, I already know what my reaction was when I go out there.

791
01:31:19,080 --> 01:31:35,220
And you're just coming across. I'm just going to have to find out how they're going to narrow down when this thing happened.

792
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:44,540
So there's seven guys currently working now.

793
01:31:44,540 --> 01:31:57,710
They are now in need with the kind of collective evaluations empowered to ensure that

794
01:31:59,120 --> 01:32:06,710
some of these things can get down to that family that just occurs and actually change.

795
01:32:07,210 --> 01:32:14,000
So I think the way you read the papers is actually how.

796
01:32:15,340 --> 01:32:22,790
I know. You know, you are so very busy right now.

797
01:32:23,030 --> 01:32:26,740
How can I have little bit more attention?

798
01:32:28,720 --> 01:32:35,260
Because I already know that it's very important to get out there.

799
01:32:36,650 --> 01:32:42,250
But after a year of having to.

800
01:32:45,970 --> 01:32:51,540
Yeah. These are live in 1975, more than financially.

801
01:32:51,780 --> 01:33:00,160
I was not around that story, guys.

802
01:33:01,170 --> 01:33:18,400
I remember very well you brought me back to the way that we have ideas and we have ideas, and that's there.

803
01:33:19,230 --> 01:33:26,730
Yeah, I guess it is the way it goes inside your head.

804
01:33:32,510 --> 01:33:36,540
Yeah. Yeah. Well, what else?

805
01:33:36,750 --> 01:33:51,360
But at the same time, I have something which I think about, you know, so I needed to do more to this.

806
01:33:52,710 --> 01:34:00,210
And also, it's a very emotional driving and knowledge I really do need to know more about.

807
01:34:01,320 --> 01:34:04,530
Yeah. Yeah. It's a sort of thing that's like.

808
01:34:04,530 --> 01:34:10,320
I heard this crazy stuff because the. Yeah.

809
01:34:10,510 --> 01:34:14,350
I don't have a special skill.

810
01:34:15,590 --> 01:34:26,000
It's just a diagnostic test, so they don't feel like I'm not ready to try and I'm just happy right now.

811
01:34:26,090 --> 01:34:31,440
Yeah, it was hard to. Just over ten miles.

812
01:34:33,610 --> 01:34:43,780
This one just took place because they saw the opportunity to spread that nuclear energy.

813
01:34:44,410 --> 01:34:50,150
Unfortunately. I do think it's more like criminal justice.

814
01:34:50,630 --> 01:34:58,890
So. They have to started drinking more like, you know, maybe a higher penalty for such crimes.

815
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:07,540
Every now and then a host of social media scams around its target audience.

816
01:35:07,960 --> 01:35:12,830
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

817
01:35:14,600 --> 01:35:17,750
I think she's on my list right now. It's mostly like, how are you going to now?

818
01:35:18,220 --> 01:35:23,230
Yeah, I'm just trying to make friends, so.

819
01:35:23,240 --> 01:35:30,530
I don't know. It's like, Grandma, I need help.

820
01:35:30,770 --> 01:35:33,990
This type of scam. Yeah. Yeah. It's like. I know. So you're.

821
01:35:34,250 --> 01:35:41,120
How old is your 400,000?

822
01:35:42,350 --> 01:35:48,380
That's how much you have right now. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.

823
01:35:51,410 --> 01:36:00,710
So I tried not to be so fast when I know.

824
01:36:01,010 --> 01:36:09,940
Yeah. And sometimes, I mean, I know I sort of terrified because that's actually the whole experience, that type of discussion.

825
01:36:10,490 --> 01:36:19,819
Yeah, really. I imagine I was thinking, I was saying that would be like a big, you know, right now I'm Chinese.

826
01:36:19,820 --> 01:36:28,630
But yeah, I do like where you're doing background information and in some parts.

827
01:36:29,180 --> 01:36:34,220
Yeah, I just don't do it in general. Yeah. I think a lot of like elderly people there are, you know,

828
01:36:34,630 --> 01:36:42,350
the awareness of just like sometimes it really rises to be like every other graduate degree in English.

829
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:47,450
It used to be the word genocide.

830
01:36:47,620 --> 01:36:50,899
So get back together like say a U-turn.

831
01:36:50,900 --> 01:36:54,500
Like it's like she's such a great like you're like you're doing, like, do that.

832
01:36:54,800 --> 01:37:03,360
It's a very hard thing to do. Because I think, you know, I think we are experiencing a.

833
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:09,480
Lots of rain cover by now. Look at this.

834
01:37:09,960 --> 01:37:14,630
I think the fire was over.

835
01:37:15,270 --> 01:37:18,930
You can't really rely on them and the rationality they have.

836
01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:26,790
All right. So we are there's so many great conversations and I hate to stop them,

837
01:37:26,970 --> 01:37:34,080
but I just want to regroup and kind of move on and think about how we might we process all the information that you've just shared with each other.

838
01:37:34,590 --> 01:37:35,760
These are amazing slides.

839
01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:42,050
I thought they were really, really informative and thoughtful and you really kind of engage to really have some great thoughts and ideas.

840
01:37:42,060 --> 01:37:49,139
So thank you. I hope you learned a lot from just talking to your partner in this exercise.

841
01:37:49,140 --> 01:37:53,310
And it's been I've heard some great conversations, just eavesdropping a little bit.

842
01:37:53,310 --> 01:38:02,400
So it's really good stuff. Any questions or points Google wants to bring out that they they just discussed and share with the group?

843
01:38:09,070 --> 01:38:16,690
I just wanted to also like point out that, Justin, you did a slide that actually talked about language and use of different terms.

844
01:38:17,050 --> 01:38:21,010
I went to older adults and that was like really useful and thank you for doing that.

845
01:38:21,970 --> 01:38:25,270
There's the Gerontologist is actually a journal that I published in our.

846
01:38:25,630 --> 01:38:30,820
It's quite difficult to get into, but they are very explicit about words that you should not use like seniors.

847
01:38:31,330 --> 01:38:34,660
That's a bad word, you know. So I saw that.

848
01:38:35,140 --> 01:38:40,510
Yes. I don't say elderly, you know, elderly adults yet.

849
01:38:40,510 --> 01:38:44,140
Very sort of, you know, being aware of just terminology and language.

850
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:54,350
And then you had some really great questions and great ideas, and I hope we touched on some of this.

851
01:38:54,380 --> 01:38:58,610
I try to sort of be responsive to some of these Post-it notes when I was preparing the lecture.

852
01:38:59,300 --> 01:39:07,370
I did see that, you know, that there was especially Justin and also Nikki, you were asking specifically about, you know, what can we do?

853
01:39:07,580 --> 01:39:13,250
What can interventions like what can we do to kind of mitigate the impact of of ageism?

854
01:39:13,640 --> 01:39:16,820
And so if we can really put our heads together for a minute and just kind of think about it,

855
01:39:16,820 --> 01:39:25,790
like what are the some of the mechanisms that could be enacted to actually reduce ageism and improve the health outcomes for aging Americans,

856
01:39:25,790 --> 01:39:33,880
aging adults? But change your language, right?

857
01:39:34,150 --> 01:39:38,170
Be conscious of what we're saying in our written and our communication.

858
01:39:38,920 --> 01:39:43,180
What other things could be done? How can we? What are some of the mechanisms that we can use?

859
01:39:43,180 --> 01:39:50,870
Interventions. Thanks.

860
01:39:51,550 --> 01:39:57,160
You raised this, you know, just education in the health care system and the health care setting about just what it feels like to be all,

861
01:39:57,160 --> 01:40:00,190
you know, putting yourself in the shoes of someone else.

862
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:09,400
Yeah. I mean, I just I feel like the like this like system in the U.S. of like all people,

863
01:40:09,400 --> 01:40:14,820
just that happens to institutions is like terrible on so many levels.

864
01:40:14,830 --> 01:40:18,390
And. I don't know, I just feel like. That seems so.

865
01:40:19,390 --> 01:40:23,770
So dangerous to the health outcomes that like that would be,

866
01:40:23,770 --> 01:40:31,510
I think where I would first try to pick one area that is particularly a huge overhaul with policy and funding and.

867
01:40:34,450 --> 01:40:39,790
You know, that might happen. I mean, I don't know that the baby boomers are just going to say, okay, fine, I'll go live in a home.

868
01:40:40,510 --> 01:40:49,360
You know, put me in an institution. They might just put their feet down and say, no, I want to have a beautiful community with,

869
01:40:50,290 --> 01:40:53,300
you know, younger people, children, older people all together.

870
01:40:53,320 --> 01:40:57,300
When we're sharing ideas were in communal gardens. You know, who knows what they're going to say?

871
01:40:57,880 --> 01:41:01,750
But they could change that. I mean, they could actually put their foot down, say, I'm not going in this situation,

872
01:41:02,380 --> 01:41:06,850
and policymakers will need to be responsive if they want their votes.

873
01:41:08,710 --> 01:41:15,510
Because there's such a huge, you know, demographic. Let's just make it happen.

874
01:41:15,510 --> 01:41:21,399
And so going off like this, to be honest, it was like a pleasant experience in apartment.

875
01:41:21,400 --> 01:41:27,580
I lived back in San Diego. It's a really nice apartment complex and right across there there is like a

876
01:41:27,580 --> 01:41:33,940
luxury some years living here in city and but we still have like elderly people,

877
01:41:33,940 --> 01:41:38,410
like living in my apartment complex. And I became like a friend with several of them.

878
01:41:38,980 --> 01:41:43,360
And once I was having like a conversation with them, I was like, Why would you guys want to live here?

879
01:41:43,360 --> 01:41:50,800
Like, it's mostly like 20 students and you know, they race cars at night.

880
01:41:50,920 --> 01:41:58,149
So it was like a lot of them routinely driving out of the garage like like to where can you sleep?

881
01:41:58,150 --> 01:42:01,180
Even when it was like, you know what?

882
01:42:01,180 --> 01:42:05,740
I actually like that. So it makes me feel young again when you tell me.

883
01:42:06,100 --> 01:42:11,950
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And you races to see both.

884
01:42:12,100 --> 01:42:19,239
I don't know. But I do feel like going out with like, what can we do about like fighting, like ageism.

885
01:42:19,240 --> 01:42:27,610
It's really about, like your own, like, mentality. Sometimes it's not something that the older, like, environment can just counter for you.

886
01:42:28,300 --> 01:42:33,190
It depends on like how you see your life. But the sad thing is,

887
01:42:33,190 --> 01:42:44,290
I do feel like why the reason that he can have such a positive energy towards relate to is just like it's because he definitely has enough savings.

888
01:42:44,860 --> 01:42:52,870
Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Because I was going to ask like, Professor, have you ever heard about like any research being done in those,

889
01:42:52,870 --> 01:43:00,009
like, you know, those like really, really good like senior living community.

890
01:43:00,010 --> 01:43:11,020
So it's like an entire community, you know, like the developer just purchased a huge chunk of land and turned it into like a middle senior town.

891
01:43:11,530 --> 01:43:21,080
Yes. In Florida, yes. Have they been doing any like cohort like research on those communities thoroughly?

892
01:43:22,600 --> 01:43:31,030
I just wonder what the people would be like thinking what their aspect of like elderly life is, you know, in those community.

893
01:43:31,630 --> 01:43:38,710
Yes, exactly. There's quite a bit of research on this. And it is it is a very good life is extremely expensive.

894
01:43:38,980 --> 01:43:44,440
Yeah. So it's a big selection about the kind of people that end up in those places that can benefit from it.

895
01:43:45,970 --> 01:43:55,900
But I also wonder if you in a even if you're in a bougie, you know, very ritzy and retirement community with services and games and,

896
01:43:56,080 --> 01:44:03,010
you know, activities like one of the things I think we really need is an integration of people of different ages.

897
01:44:03,400 --> 01:44:10,000
So ah, how much are people even in that sort of ritzy luxury senior community engaging with younger people?

898
01:44:10,540 --> 01:44:17,410
And I think when you're talking about this guy that you met in your apartment building, he liked to just be around younger people.

899
01:44:17,770 --> 01:44:21,730
And that intersection can be a source of energy for older people.

900
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:27,790
It can also be educational and exposure for younger people to see, Oh, this is what old people are like.

901
01:44:27,790 --> 01:44:32,690
They're not just old and boring. And so when in those retirement communities, you know,

902
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:38,560
it's still it's it's still segregating older adults and keeping them away from the rest of society, I think.

903
01:44:38,620 --> 01:44:42,700
But I don't know this literature, but it's going to be interesting to look at.

904
01:44:42,910 --> 01:44:48,880
It's just a letter from Thomas. Oh, well, he well, I asked him about like that senior care facility across the street.

905
01:44:49,330 --> 01:44:54,680
And the two words that he used to describe that community is old and building.

906
01:44:55,410 --> 01:45:09,670
Yeah. Yeah, because my grandparents live in one of those retirement communities down in Florida, and they even have a certain pool that,

907
01:45:09,680 --> 01:45:15,530
like their grandkids, are not allowed to go to that have an indoor pool for people 30 and older.

908
01:45:16,310 --> 01:45:21,020
So even if like younger, like grandkids who are like 25 cannot go to that.

909
01:45:22,610 --> 01:45:27,530
Yeah. Yeah. So I'm not allowed to go there until I'm 30, but I have a cousin who just turned 30.

910
01:45:27,530 --> 01:45:32,120
He's like, I can go to the doctor. So yeah.

911
01:45:32,120 --> 01:45:38,920
Like restricting this interaction, right? Yeah. I think it's great to be around little kids just.

912
01:45:43,260 --> 01:45:47,730
What other interventions? What can we do?

913
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:57,870
Like in kindergarten? Hmm. Yeah, that was one of our points was start educating early on what successful eating looks like.

914
01:45:57,870 --> 01:46:00,840
And you've about some of these other things like the language and.

915
01:46:03,930 --> 01:46:07,920
Different things like that, just so that people aren't having a vacation when they're younger,

916
01:46:08,610 --> 01:46:14,010
you know, kind of early intervention for cutting off the ages would help.

917
01:46:14,610 --> 01:46:15,510
Yeah. Yeah.

918
01:46:18,010 --> 01:46:26,620
You know, simple things like having older people come in and read stories in a kindergarten classroom, you know, that they're part of the family.

919
01:46:26,620 --> 01:46:32,140
And I think, um, you know, obviously I think families try to do that within their own nuclear family,

920
01:46:33,160 --> 01:46:37,780
too, if they have the luxury of having an older adult that they can integrate in their families.

921
01:46:37,780 --> 01:46:46,960
But I think even just societal, just to have more of that interaction, opportunities for interaction, especially at those younger ages.

922
01:46:53,280 --> 01:46:58,390
Yeah. I don't know. I wonder. How many?

923
01:47:00,310 --> 01:47:03,310
I don't want to try on your name, C.J., but I kind of just thinking, like,

924
01:47:03,310 --> 01:47:11,080
how much exposure to older people do medical students have in terms of learning from them or losing their perspective?

925
01:47:14,130 --> 01:47:18,100
Like us, patients are just like it, just in our immediate environment.

926
01:47:18,570 --> 01:47:24,810
Just sort of. I mean.

927
01:47:26,810 --> 01:47:33,500
It's like one really nice way we learn is like, oh, this is like across the country.

928
01:47:34,100 --> 01:47:40,790
Like they call them standardized patients. So like, before you get to see real patients, you have to, like, you've trained on actors.

929
01:47:41,540 --> 01:47:44,659
Um, and like, it's, it's like really fun.

930
01:47:44,660 --> 01:47:52,639
So, like, it's mostly like, it's all volunteers. It's mostly like older folks from the Ann Arbor community who, like,

931
01:47:52,640 --> 01:47:57,230
they've been doing this for years and they really love it, and they have a community among themselves.

932
01:47:57,230 --> 01:48:03,680
And then they like, you know, they're given a script like I have chest pain and whatever, you know, this is my medical history.

933
01:48:03,680 --> 01:48:08,050
And so they like, um. Yeah.

934
01:48:08,060 --> 01:48:12,879
It's first time. I mean, I think just because of time, I feel like because I was like, availability.

935
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:19,330
Like they're always like above 60. Like, even though sometimes they're describing like younger diseases, like they're always like an older group.

936
01:48:19,900 --> 01:48:21,580
And so like, that's been nice.

937
01:48:22,240 --> 01:48:31,120
Everyone has to do rotations through like the veterans hospital, which is like disproportionately filled with older folks.

938
01:48:31,360 --> 01:48:39,099
Um, so there's like really structural mechanisms to actually expose medical students to older people.

939
01:48:39,100 --> 01:48:42,160
And so that's, that's positive. Yeah.

940
01:48:42,670 --> 01:48:55,020
Yeah. And like the people that are going to learn like dermatology or like, have the stereotype of being, like, the nicest.

941
01:48:55,830 --> 01:48:59,040
Oh, really? Yeah, like, just, like, the nicest people ever.

942
01:48:59,120 --> 01:49:02,760
Like. Yeah. Like, um.

943
01:49:02,850 --> 01:49:08,220
If you had a resident who was going into gerontology and, like, the word on the street was like.

944
01:49:08,790 --> 01:49:11,980
She's just, like, the best person to work with. She's so kind.

945
01:49:12,030 --> 01:49:15,540
Like, anyone who's going into it is just, like, so great. That's good.

946
01:49:15,700 --> 01:49:19,440
Yeah. Interesting. In public health departments.

947
01:49:19,530 --> 01:49:23,309
Let's say you had some time this summer. Did you have like, you know, exposure to older adults?

948
01:49:23,310 --> 01:49:26,820
Or what are the connections that public health departments are making with older adults?

949
01:49:28,230 --> 01:49:34,440
I worked with a lot of people who were more like working with LED exposure and kids.

950
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:40,300
So it was like the opposite. I guess they didn't. Yeah.

951
01:49:40,450 --> 01:49:44,770
I mean, they didn't really talk much about what they were doing.

952
01:49:46,460 --> 01:49:53,870
Adults, which I was kind of I asked if they had any programs and stuff, but it didn't really seem like there.

953
01:49:56,240 --> 01:49:58,350
I was also in the Environmental Health Division of.
