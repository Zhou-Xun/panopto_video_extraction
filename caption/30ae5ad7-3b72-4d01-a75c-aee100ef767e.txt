1
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:12,360
I will say one thing that's
on that card somewhat

2
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,250
implicitly that I think

3
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,020
is important for our
students to appreciate,

4
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,350
especially because our community

5
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,220
is very aware of market
failures and so on.

6
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,325
Is to understand there's
a systematic set

7
00:00:23,325 --> 00:00:25,620
of failures that occur in

8
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,750
government and among non-profits

9
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,255
that I think we have to
pay a lot of attention to.

10
00:00:30,255 --> 00:00:32,220
Some of the things
in that card which

11
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:35,760
Richard [inaudible] calls
non market failures.

12
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,710
I think are important.

13
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,170
We often say, "Hey, here's
the market's failure,

14
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,910
there's a public good or
there's an externality."

15
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:45,470
We should turn to
a government or

16
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:49,170
a regulatory solution to deal
with that market failure.

17
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:50,570
Well, you have to
weigh that against,

18
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:52,370
how is the government
itself going to

19
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:54,320
operate as it tries
to deal with that?

20
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,685
What are the incentives facing
actors within the system?

21
00:00:57,685 --> 00:01:00,170
Yeah, we can pretty much predict
there are constituencies

22
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:02,810
that benefit from
government action.

23
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:04,625
There are
characteristics failures

24
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:08,420
of government organizations
because they are

25
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:09,880
less accountable in some ways to

26
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,750
their very immediate
economic incentives

27
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,970
that private firms are.

28
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:17,540
That we need to pay
attention to if you

29
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:20,080
need a really fast response,

30
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,865
you'll very often saying
to a company, "Hey,

31
00:01:22,865 --> 00:01:24,910
we'll pay you a ton of
money if you develop

32
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:28,105
a rapid response to this
key social problem."

33
00:01:28,105 --> 00:01:30,070
They may actually
compare pretty well to

34
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:32,610
a government organization which

35
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:34,380
is not used to moving as fast,

36
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,370
and doesn't have the discipline

37
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:38,770
of capital markets
to back it up.

38
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:40,900
The big pharmaceutical
company goes on for

39
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,060
years and never develops
a successful drug,

40
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:46,210
they're no longer a big
pharmaceutical company.

41
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:49,030
If a big government
agency is dysfunctional,

42
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:50,530
but has very strong political

43
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:52,520
constituencies that support it,

44
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,630
it can last for a
very long time,

45
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,940
and the work that I do
that involves people,

46
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,590
very vulnerable constituencies

47
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,250
that need government services.

48
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,240
One of the bureaucracies
that serve

49
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,580
those humans, do a bad job.

50
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:12,230
We should be humbled
on both sides of

51
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:15,890
this corporate marketing world

52
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:18,155
and government non-market world.

53
00:02:18,155 --> 00:02:21,020
We should be humbled on
both sides by the ways that

54
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:23,090
organizations on both
sides are prone to

55
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,310
failures and moral blind spots.

56
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:28,115
I think I would

57
00:02:28,115 --> 00:02:30,440
really want to understand
as a policymaker,

58
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,640
what are the incentives facing

59
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,195
non-profit facing
government actors?

60
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:36,390
I know those align
with what we need

61
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:40,225
to see happen when
we're trying to help.

62
00:02:40,225 --> 00:02:42,730
Like add that last piece.

63
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,570
One of the things my students

64
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:46,010
will hear about in this course

65
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:48,020
is the difficulty of

66
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,795
getting pharmaceutical
coverage and Medicare.

67
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:53,480
It was after lengthy
negotiations left

68
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,345
out of the 1965 legislation.

69
00:02:56,345 --> 00:02:59,330
By the 1970s, there
was no such thing as

70
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:00,905
a private health
insurance plan that

71
00:03:00,905 --> 00:03:02,965
didn't cover prescription drugs.

72
00:03:02,965 --> 00:03:05,210
Yet Medicare
beneficiaries, those who

73
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:07,160
have the greatest need
for prescription drugs,

74
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:11,060
had to wait until 2003 for
the legislation to be passed,

75
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,765
2006 for it to be implemented,

76
00:03:13,765 --> 00:03:17,030
and then in such a limited
and confusing way that

77
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,530
the bill was actually extremely

78
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:21,210
unpopular, one of it was past.

79
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,320
We've got the failure of

80
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,020
universality if we rely
on the private sector,

81
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:30,715
but we've got the failure
of timely responses,

82
00:03:30,715 --> 00:03:33,470
if we rely on the
political world to have

83
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,210
that historic opportunity to

84
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:37,295
actually pass something
and get it done.

85
00:03:37,295 --> 00:03:40,475
Yeah. I think this is
a very good point,

86
00:03:40,475 --> 00:03:45,820
first to note as well
that we often think like,

87
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,420
I have many friends
who are advocates of

88
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:50,690
single-payer health care and

89
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:53,120
regard that as an alternative to

90
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,570
the messy and often

91
00:03:56,570 --> 00:04:00,874
unsatisfactory interest
group politics

92
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:03,835
of American health
care politics.

93
00:04:03,835 --> 00:04:07,130
The truth is a single pair
would have to be a product of

94
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:10,205
exactly that same process is
not an alternative to it.

95
00:04:10,205 --> 00:04:12,950
It is something that
legislators would have to pass,

96
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:14,690
that regulators would
have to operate,

97
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:19,480
that the executive branch
would have to implement.

98
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:22,925
It is not an alternative

99
00:04:22,925 --> 00:04:24,890
to a political system in

100
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,659
which people are
responding to incentives,

101
00:04:26,659 --> 00:04:29,250
not always in the way
that we would like.

102
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,930
I think that if we have

103
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:35,615
systematic problems with
our governing institutions,

104
00:04:35,615 --> 00:04:39,390
they will be present in
the single-payer system,

105
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:42,450
they will be present in our
existing Medicare system,

106
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:45,705
they will be present
in whatever we do.

107
00:04:45,705 --> 00:04:49,715
We have to have some
humility as policy analysts,

108
00:04:49,715 --> 00:04:50,975
and in some ways it gets back to

109
00:04:50,975 --> 00:04:52,040
your original question why are

110
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,405
you thinking at the margin?

111
00:04:53,405 --> 00:04:57,530
Would we be better off if we had

112
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,185
a somewhat larger public role

113
00:05:00,185 --> 00:05:02,300
for insurance than they have

114
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,160
now and I can guess
is probably yes.

115
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,340
In part because we could do
some mid-course corrections.

116
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:13,830
Though we should not imagine
there's a whether question,

117
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,320
there is an alternative
to the how much

118
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,600
question that would allow us to

119
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,655
implement a really awesome

120
00:05:19,655 --> 00:05:21,590
single-payer system as
the equivalent and say,

121
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:23,030
the best European single-payer

122
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,380
system that you could find.

123
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,460
Because we just don't have

124
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,630
the governance systems that are

125
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:29,680
going to produce that and
operate that if I call it.

126
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,075
kind of questions can
you get there from here.

127
00:05:33,075 --> 00:05:36,555
Yeah. There's always
the question.

128
00:05:36,555 --> 00:05:38,450
Yeah. Like I said
here we are for

129
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:41,030
whatever reason we gotten
here, here we are.

130
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:43,100
Yeah. There's lots
of reasons why we

131
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,290
got here that I might not
even fully understand,

132
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:47,970
but that I have to
respect are important

133
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:50,960
because it's not as if
people don't recognize,

134
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,970
for example, that people

135
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:55,960
need drugs when
they're really sick.

136
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,580
I'm sure people throughout
the whole history of

137
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,995
Medicare understood
this is a problem,

138
00:06:00,995 --> 00:06:03,080
that cancer patients
on Medicare don't

139
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,855
have access to the
medications that they need.

140
00:06:05,855 --> 00:06:08,720
There was a set of constraints
that prevented us from

141
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,465
dealing with that in a more
effective and timely way,

142
00:06:11,465 --> 00:06:13,310
we can understand what
those are so that we

143
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,925
can move past that.

144
00:06:15,925 --> 00:06:18,590
Maybe it's part of that
is political organizing,

145
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:20,690
and maybe there's groups
of patients who just need

146
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:22,130
more political power to push

147
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:23,710
through the things
that are needed.

148
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:26,650
But there could be
other things as well.
