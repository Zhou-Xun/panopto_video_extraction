1
00:00:10,107 --> 00:00:11,752
Hey, this is Matt Zawistowski.

2
00:00:11,752 --> 00:00:15,102
In this lecture we're going to talk
about longitudinal study designs.

3
00:00:15,102 --> 00:00:19,558
There are many ways an investigator might
design a study to collect data to answer

4
00:00:19,558 --> 00:00:20,933
the research question,

5
00:00:20,933 --> 00:00:24,879
and the specific question will dictate
the kind of study that they use.

6
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:29,468
If the investigator is interested in
studying changes and now come over time,

7
00:00:29,468 --> 00:00:33,989
they might choose a longitudinal design,
in which repeated measurements of

8
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:38,185
the outcome variable are taken overtime
on the same cohort of samples.

9
00:00:38,185 --> 00:00:42,653
In this lecture, we'll discuss the
longitudinal study design, including its

10
00:00:42,653 --> 00:00:46,938
defining features, common terminology,
and strengths and limitations.

11
00:00:46,938 --> 00:00:50,908
You might recognize many of the features
that we review because they're

12
00:00:50,908 --> 00:00:55,347
not unique to longitudinal studies, but
are important for many study designs.

13
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:57,690
First things first, like any study,

14
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:02,314
we need to determine who exactly will
make it into our longitudinal study.

15
00:01:02,314 --> 00:01:06,774
Who are the group of people that we
are most interested in learning about?

16
00:01:06,774 --> 00:01:10,994
It might be that one is interested in
the entire population of people, but

17
00:01:10,994 --> 00:01:11,742
more often,

18
00:01:11,742 --> 00:01:16,253
there is some subset of the population
that an investigator is interested in.

19
00:01:16,253 --> 00:01:20,920
For example, this might be preschool
age children, individuals of a certain

20
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:25,747
socioeconomic status, or people who have
been exposed to a specific chemical.

21
00:01:25,747 --> 00:01:28,793
This group of interest defines
the cohort definition or

22
00:01:28,793 --> 00:01:33,390
the criteria for who is eligible
to be enrolled in the study.

23
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:37,671
The cohort definition is important because
it determines the larger group to which

24
00:01:37,671 --> 00:01:39,824
results of the study can be generalized.

25
00:01:39,824 --> 00:01:44,064
For example, if the cohort consists
only of college aged women,

26
00:01:44,064 --> 00:01:48,243
we cannot be sure that results
are also true for middle aged men.

27
00:01:48,243 --> 00:01:51,779
Next, we need to think about how
the exposure of interest will

28
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:53,553
be administered in the study.

29
00:01:53,553 --> 00:01:56,724
The ideal strategy is in
an experimental design,

30
00:01:56,724 --> 00:02:01,565
in which the investigator randomizes
the exposure to study participants.

31
00:02:01,565 --> 00:02:05,527
By randomly assigning some participants
to receive a treatment and

32
00:02:05,527 --> 00:02:07,265
others to service controls,

33
00:02:07,265 --> 00:02:11,723
the experimental design minimizes
the potential impacts of confounding.

34
00:02:11,723 --> 00:02:16,687
In a longitudinal experimental study, the
investigator will usually take an initial

35
00:02:16,687 --> 00:02:21,107
measurement of the outcome on all
samples called the baseline measurement,

36
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:22,943
then administer the exposure,

37
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:27,913
then continue taking measurements overtime
on both the treated and control samples.

38
00:02:27,913 --> 00:02:33,082
Randomization however, is not always
possible due to ethical concerns or

39
00:02:33,082 --> 00:02:34,894
logistical challenges.

40
00:02:34,894 --> 00:02:39,184
The alternative strategy
is an observational design.

41
00:02:39,184 --> 00:02:43,251
In this design, the investigator has
no control over the assignment of

42
00:02:43,251 --> 00:02:47,546
the exposure and can only observe
the outcome in an uncontrolled setting.

43
00:02:47,546 --> 00:02:51,339
Study participants either
received the exposure or

44
00:02:51,339 --> 00:02:54,365
not based on self selection or by chance.

45
00:02:54,365 --> 00:02:58,916
In contrast, the cross sectional
observational studies where we often do

46
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:02,601
not know the temporal ordering
of the exposure and outcome,

47
00:03:02,601 --> 00:03:07,228
the repeated measure nature of
longitudinal observational studies allows

48
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:11,636
the investigator to observe changes
in the outcome after the exposure,

49
00:03:11,636 --> 00:03:15,932
which aids in establishing causality
of the exposure on the outcome.

50
00:03:15,932 --> 00:03:20,207
An important element of observational
designs that also applies to

51
00:03:20,207 --> 00:03:24,183
longitudinal studies is when
the data is actually collected.

52
00:03:24,183 --> 00:03:28,538
In a prospective design, the study
cohort is identified in the present and

53
00:03:28,538 --> 00:03:33,238
the investigator collects measurements
of the outcome overtime as they occur in

54
00:03:33,238 --> 00:03:34,014
the future.

55
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:38,176
The benefit of collecting measurements
in the future is that the investigator

56
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:41,972
has more control over the details of
how those measurements are taken.

57
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:44,862
A drawback is that
the investigator must wait for

58
00:03:44,862 --> 00:03:49,101
data collection to be completed
before they can begin their analysis.

59
00:03:49,101 --> 00:03:52,497
Although the prospective design
seems like the natural way to

60
00:03:52,497 --> 00:03:54,325
collect repeated measure data,

61
00:03:54,325 --> 00:03:58,319
longitudinal studies can also be
performed in a retrospective manner.

62
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:02,465
In this design, the investigator
defines their cohort in the past and

63
00:04:02,465 --> 00:04:07,468
collects outcome data up to the present
time, usually from existing data records.

64
00:04:07,468 --> 00:04:11,567
A great example of longitudinal
retrospective data collection would be

65
00:04:11,567 --> 00:04:16,204
using existing blood pressure measurements
stored in patient electronic health

66
00:04:16,204 --> 00:04:16,818
records.

67
00:04:16,818 --> 00:04:19,980
Since the outcomes have already occurred,

68
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:25,543
all data is available in the present and
the analysis can begin immediately.

69
00:04:25,543 --> 00:04:30,047
In designing a study, investigators need
to carefully choose the variables they

70
00:04:30,047 --> 00:04:33,062
will collect in addition to
the outcomes of interest.

71
00:04:33,062 --> 00:04:37,940
The investigator must have course collect
data for any exposures, treatments,

72
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,138
or conditions of primary interest.

73
00:04:40,138 --> 00:04:44,008
But they also need to be aware of
potential confounding variables that

74
00:04:44,008 --> 00:04:48,143
could affect the interpretation and
results of the study, especially for

75
00:04:48,143 --> 00:04:49,600
observational studies.

76
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,043
The investigator must collect measurements
on the potential confounding variables in

77
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:57,353
order to properly account for
them in the statistical analysis.

78
00:04:57,353 --> 00:05:01,757
Importantly, because we were following
study participants overtime,

79
00:05:01,757 --> 00:05:04,535
some of these variables
can change overtime.

80
00:05:04,535 --> 00:05:08,187
For example, smoking might be
a known confounder for a study and

81
00:05:08,187 --> 00:05:12,721
study participants could change their
smoking habits during the collection of

82
00:05:12,721 --> 00:05:13,552
the outcome.

83
00:05:13,552 --> 00:05:19,045
Variables that remain unchanged during
follow up are called static variables,

84
00:05:19,045 --> 00:05:24,632
whereas variables that can change are
called dynamic or time varying variables.

85
00:05:24,632 --> 00:05:28,928
Of course, the defining feature of
longitudinal studies is the repeated

86
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:32,473
measurement of an outcome
overtime on the same individual.

87
00:05:32,473 --> 00:05:36,793
The time over which measurements
are recorded is called the follow up time.

88
00:05:36,793 --> 00:05:40,871
It is the repeated measurement of
the same variable during the follow-up

89
00:05:40,871 --> 00:05:44,557
time that makes longitudinal
studies particularly effective for

90
00:05:44,557 --> 00:05:46,414
studying change in the outcome.

91
00:05:46,414 --> 00:05:50,051
It's imperative that in addition to
collecting the actual measurements of

92
00:05:50,051 --> 00:05:53,403
the outcome, the investigator
carefully captures the times at which

93
00:05:53,403 --> 00:05:55,132
the measurements were collected.

94
00:05:55,132 --> 00:05:59,233
This is important not only for
understanding the change within a given

95
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:04,730
subject, but also to allow comparison
between multiple subjects.

96
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:08,724
The actual duration of the follow
up time can vary dramatically.

97
00:06:08,724 --> 00:06:12,356
Some longitudinal studies can
have very short follow up times,

98
00:06:12,356 --> 00:06:13,710
perhaps only minutes.

99
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:14,541
For example,

100
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:18,705
a study that looks for immediate
allergic reactions to some exposure.

101
00:06:18,705 --> 00:06:22,804
Alternatively, follow up times
can be years or even decades.

102
00:06:22,804 --> 00:06:25,714
Perhaps the most famous
of all longitudinal

103
00:06:25,714 --> 00:06:28,388
studies is the Framingham Heart Study,

104
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:34,065
in which repeated measurements have been
collected on the same samples for decades.

105
00:06:34,065 --> 00:06:38,961
Framingham began in 1948 and has continued
recruitment in data collection to now.

106
00:06:38,961 --> 00:06:42,513
An important feature of
longitudinal studies is when and

107
00:06:42,513 --> 00:06:45,547
how many measurements
are taken on each sample.

108
00:06:45,547 --> 00:06:47,924
In a balanced longitudinal study,

109
00:06:47,924 --> 00:06:52,452
measurements are taken at the same
time on all study participants.

110
00:06:52,452 --> 00:06:56,148
In an unbalanced longitudinal study,
the number and

111
00:06:56,148 --> 00:06:59,853
timing of measurements
varies among participants.

112
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:04,127
A balance study requires considerable
planning and logistics to achieve.

113
00:07:04,127 --> 00:07:07,936
A study that was designed to be
balanced can unintentionally

114
00:07:07,936 --> 00:07:12,491
become unbalanced because of patients
being lost during the follow up,

115
00:07:12,491 --> 00:07:15,791
missed measurements, or
mistimed measurements.

116
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:20,801
In this lecture, we reviewed key features
of the longitudinal study design and

117
00:07:20,801 --> 00:07:22,980
defined important terminology.

118
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:26,635
To summarize,
let's go over some of the strengths and

119
00:07:26,635 --> 00:07:29,422
drawbacks of the longitudinal studies.

120
00:07:29,422 --> 00:07:34,032
The main advantage of longitudinal studies
is that the repeated measure design

121
00:07:34,032 --> 00:07:37,885
allowing direct observation of
changes in the outcome overtime,

122
00:07:37,885 --> 00:07:41,412
reducing the effects of
potential confounding variables.

123
00:07:41,412 --> 00:07:45,297
In longitudinal studies,
the temporal ordering of exposure and

124
00:07:45,297 --> 00:07:46,999
outcomes is usually known.

125
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:50,714
That is, we know that the exposure
precedes the outcomes.

126
00:07:50,714 --> 00:07:54,072
This allows more definitive evidence for
causality or

127
00:07:54,072 --> 00:07:58,017
proof that the exposure actually
caused the change in outcome.

128
00:07:58,017 --> 00:08:02,632
As far as drawbacks go, longitudinal
studies can take much longer to collect

129
00:08:02,632 --> 00:08:07,471
data than cross-sectional studies,
often making them expensive to perform.

130
00:08:07,471 --> 00:08:11,554
Participant drop out during follow
up can also be problematic.

131
00:08:11,554 --> 00:08:16,297
As with other cohort designs, longitudinal
studies are usually not the best method

132
00:08:16,297 --> 00:08:18,701
for collecting data on rare outcomes, and

133
00:08:18,701 --> 00:08:23,143
outcomes with long latency periods would
require extensive follow up times.

134
00:08:23,143 --> 00:08:28,024
Retrospective longitudinal studies
can solve some of these problems, but

135
00:08:28,024 --> 00:08:32,676
are of course prone to recall bias
since information from the past must be

136
00:08:32,676 --> 00:08:33,682
ascertained.

137
00:08:33,682 --> 00:08:37,564
In summary, longitudinal studies,
like all study designs,

138
00:08:37,564 --> 00:08:39,624
have strengths and weaknesses.

139
00:08:39,624 --> 00:08:43,224
Understanding these strengths and
weaknesses are important for

140
00:08:43,224 --> 00:08:48,384
proper design, analysis,
interpretation of longitudinal data.
