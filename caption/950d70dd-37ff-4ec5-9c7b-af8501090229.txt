1
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:09,370
Okay. We're recording. Thank you. Very nice of you to come to talk to our students again.

2
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:17,110
And I already told them about your being a very engaging, funny speaker.

3
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:25,210
I'm sure they were short. Okay. I word that you start to tell more.

4
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,910
Okay. Career. Thanks anyway. Hi everyone.

5
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:36,690
So sorry about the technical difficulties this morning by the zoom appointments that I needed a commercial zoom account.

6
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:41,230
And although Ascension has a commercial zoom account, it wasn't letting me log in.

7
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:45,520
So that is why we are a Google shop at Ascension.

8
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:54,790
So fortunately we were able to default to Google and thank you all for your flexibility and being able to jump over to the Google appointment.

9
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,940
So my name is Lisa Sturm. Yes, derm rhymes with germ.

10
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:02,050
It's totally awesome that I married somebody with that name.

11
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:09,310
I am a U of M School of Public Health. School of Public Health graduate 1992.

12
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:18,879
I was the first graduating class from U of M space in the Hospital and Molecular Epidemiology Program in 1992.

13
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:28,510
It started in 1990. At the time, they did not have any hospital, epi courses or speakers or professors.

14
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:35,079
It was all molecular epi. So I learned a lot about that, but very little about infection prevention.

15
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:45,910
I just got exposed to infection prevention when I was a nuclear medicine technician at a hospital, Beaumont Hospital in Michigan.

16
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:53,229
And the lecturer came the lady came from that department to teach us about OSHA blood borne pathogens.

17
00:01:53,230 --> 00:02:00,610
This was in the eighties, 1980s. And I thought, wow, that looks like a really cool profession because it you know,

18
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:08,920
it seemed to marry everything I loved and it had a little bit of excitement and sleuth to it as well, which is always fun.

19
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:19,299
So I pursued my MPH and eventually got a job in infection prevention and have been doing it for almost 30 years now.

20
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:27,850
And I'll tell you, every single year brings something new and exciting and hopefully I can give you some tips and tools.

21
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:33,190
If you are slightly interested or maybe really interested in getting into this profession,

22
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:38,979
I'll expose you to some ideas, suggestions, recommendations.

23
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,459
This is all just based on my experiences.

24
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:45,670
So none of this is from the literature or research.

25
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:52,060
This is Lisa Sturm coming to you live with tales from the front and in.

26
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:58,930
For whatever it's worth, you can use my advice and and see if you can pursue a career in this.

27
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:02,530
So just starting out our titles, there's a lot of different titles.

28
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:10,930
So the actual Department of Labor, the federal government, Department of Labor does not have the title profession.

29
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:16,659
Infection prevention is we the national organization APIC, which I'm a part of.

30
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:24,879
We are working on this to get them to recognize the actual job description or code, but right now there isn't one.

31
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:29,410
So you cannot find it in any like OSHA register or anything like that.

32
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:35,860
So we are called a number of different things. It's totally based on what the hospital or health system or entity wants to call you.

33
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:44,379
So IP is kind of the leading term infection prevention is, but you might be still hear references to infection control practitioner,

34
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:51,280
infection control coordinator, clinical infection prevention or even epidemiologist salary ranges.

35
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:57,190
Right now, this is based on what we are paying our infection prevention list at Ascension.

36
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:06,820
So I lead an infection prevention program that has about 180 infection prevention is working at Ascension across the country.

37
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:13,300
This is about our salary range depending on experience and and degree.

38
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:18,670
So there is also some entry level roles in infection prevention.

39
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:25,450
These people are either called analysts or data assistant surveillance assistants, and they make a little bit less.

40
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:33,520
Of course, those roles are good if you're looking to maybe break into the job and want to see if you even like it or get a little experience.

41
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:39,970
They're not as plentiful and a lot of hospitals don't have those roles, but some do.

42
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,690
So if you bump into something like that, it is a good entry level.

43
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:50,380
Which is not to say you can't just jump into an infection prevention roll out of your program, you can.

44
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:55,030
But if you are struggling, you could look at an entry or a lower level job.

45
00:04:55,690 --> 00:05:01,180
There's also, you know, a lot of administrative advancement opportunities in.

46
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:06,050
The field so you could go to lead infection prevention is they make a little more money.

47
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:10,429
Project manager supervisor manager, director, senior director.

48
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:15,690
All the way up to vice presidents from across the country. We have some infection prevention, vice presidents.

49
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,740
And then, of course, you know, the pay is is about there.

50
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:24,950
I mean, this I was just kind of sort of guessing based on what I make what I know others make in these job titles.

51
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:32,269
So it's not like, you know, based on any website or salary.com or anything like that.

52
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:38,209
This is based on my personal knowledge. And then, of course, if you get a medical degree like an M.D. or a D.O.,

53
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:44,130
then that's you could become a hospital epidemiologist, which then makes like a physician's salary.

54
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:48,890
So it is a young field infection prevention.

55
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:59,570
Has that been around forever? Although infection prevention was practiced in different ways, whether it's Lister or Semmelweis,

56
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:03,649
you know, there there's hand hygiene and antisepsis and all that has been around forever.

57
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:12,500
But the field itself started in the seventies. So, you know, it was first it was mostly just laboratories that had access to the microbiology reports.

58
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,240
Eventually it became the nurses out on the units.

59
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:20,660
Typically a nurse with a bad back, maybe that needed like a desk assignment.

60
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:25,129
But now it's a wonderful blend of different people.

61
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:28,940
It's nurses, it's like health. You know, I said I was a nuclear medicine technologist.

62
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:33,050
It's grids like you all going to be.

63
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:40,580
It's also other types of masters graduates, community health graduates, things like that.

64
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:50,299
As far as where you can get a job. Well, you know, COVID really helped expand our opportunities so you can get jobs in infection

65
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:54,379
prevention pretty much wherever there is a need to prevent the spread of infections.

66
00:06:54,380 --> 00:07:00,770
So, of course, the hospital setting, long term care, ambulatory settings, rehab, behavioral health jails,

67
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:09,169
prisons, public health departments, county public health, state public health CDC.

68
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:12,170
So as all entities of public health and then of course,

69
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:18,890
vendors and manufacturers and industry is hiring, they hire infection prevention is now as well.

70
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:27,440
And even the newest one I just lost an IP lead to a software company that sells infection prevention software.

71
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:32,750
So opportunities are expanding and quite endless.

72
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:36,020
So let's talk about, you know, where you're sitting right now.

73
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:43,370
And if you're thinking like, wow, this might be something I'm interested in, you know, what can you do to learn a bit more about it?

74
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:49,370
The best probably universal web source to learn about infection prevention is epic.

75
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:54,379
That org EPIC is our National Organization for Infection Prevention.

76
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:58,670
It's really 100% focused on infection prevention.

77
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:03,350
So that stands for the Association for Professionals and Infection Control and Epidemiology.

78
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:11,870
So epic that I'm a national chair of a national organization with AIPAC, the Public Policy Committee,

79
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:21,890
where we try to leverage and influence legislation and regulatory around infection prevention with our legislators in Washington,

80
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:26,930
D.C. So I'm very active with APIC and I put my PC there.

81
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:31,999
That organization was a local Michigan organization that has since been sunsetted.

82
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,729
So don't look for that MCI PC website.

83
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:42,770
That little organization went out of business, if you will, but HP dot org, they have all kinds of resources there.

84
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:48,799
In fact, there's actually a video somewhere on that website of me doing this lecture because they

85
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:55,250
are trying to get the message out about infection prevention is to students just like you,

86
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:58,190
we're trying to grow the field. We're trying to expand.

87
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:03,290
There is a job shortage, as you probably know, in health care, but in infection prevention as well.

88
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:11,810
Good qualified candidates are really hard to come by. So we're trying to recruit and of course, retain who we have.

89
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,220
So that's one place you should go and do some research.

90
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:20,830
APIC Also, you can become a national member. It's kind of expensive.

91
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:28,399
It is about 200 bucks. But then through that national membership, you can join a chapter in every state has chapters.

92
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:33,740
And that's how I actually got started was by joining when I was a student at UVM,

93
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:39,380
I joined the National Epic Organization and then I joined the Epic Great Lakes chapter,

94
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,300
which it generally meets in like the Detroit and surrounding areas.

95
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:50,030
But that's how you can kind of like really ingratiate yourself to other people

96
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:55,190
in the community that are working already in infection prevention and network.

97
00:09:56,310 --> 00:10:04,320
So you can read about infection prevention products. You know, just basically, you know, learn about the prevention and what it's all about.

98
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:14,290
There's different organizations that are that have pulled together formally or informally, that work on infection prevention.

99
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:19,650
There's a corporate IP network that I was a part of that actually APIC just absorbed.

100
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:29,370
That's just large. Infection prevention leaders like me that have come together to network programs, conferences, things like that.

101
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:35,140
The CHIP Internship through your School of Public Health is a very, very successful program.

102
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:42,959
I actually when I was at U of them as the director, I was the pilot site many, many years ago for that internship.

103
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:53,160
We took to two or three of them as students and kind of piloted what that was going to look like through a formal internship program.

104
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:59,549
And it's grown ever since. It's really successful. I know they're coveted positions and I'm at a function.

105
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:09,840
We usually take one or two ship interns every year for our Michigan market, and we do look for when we go through those applications.

106
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:14,850
We do look for people that want to carve out a career in infection prevention.

107
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:23,190
So if that is your fancy, I definitely recommend pursuing one of those internship spots.

108
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:28,040
You can also look for other things are there's research opportunities.

109
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:31,530
You know, you can even just try to get a job, an infection control department.

110
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:34,590
They hire, you know, secretaries, assistants, things like that.

111
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:41,100
Volunteering is great work, you know, to get your feet wet in infection prevention during COVID.

112
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,170
There was lots of volunteer opportunities.

113
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:50,250
You could be a contact tracer for the state of Michigan, participate in vaccination fairs or anything like that.

114
00:11:51,210 --> 00:12:00,330
So basically, just try to expose yourself as you would in any career opportunity to what the people in that field do for a living.

115
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:07,290
You know, you could ask to shadow infection prevention is it's funny because sometimes I get people to ask to shadow me.

116
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:16,110
Well, most of my time is in my home office here but there is most infection prevention is do not work full time in a home office like me.

117
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:27,000
So there's that, you know, also, if you are non-clinical, you don't have any clinical experience, but you want to get some exposure.

118
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:31,830
It would behoove you to maybe try to volunteer in a hospital or a nursing home

119
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:38,370
just to be around a health care setting to even see if that even appeals to you.

120
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:43,890
Because most infection prevention is work, do work, like I said, in a clinical setting.

121
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:47,700
So you might not you might find you don't like that.

122
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:52,890
And that would be important to know before you try to get a job in infection prevention.

123
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:57,810
Of course, your capstone or your epic 565 if you can do it, infection prevention.

124
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:05,520
I when I was you in your chair, I there were no opportunities for me to do that.

125
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:17,060
But my coat, my friend, my student friend, she did get her up at 565 over at U of infection control department infection prevention.

126
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,819
So I just like joined her as I was like her assistant.

127
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:27,570
It was kind of funny, but it helped because it got me like exposed to the people there and what the work was.

128
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:30,870
And so it helped and it built my resume.

129
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:36,100
So you do have to start thinking about building your resume and your profile.

130
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:46,090
If you do want to be in this field, you do have to start showing some track record, if you will, on your resume of what it means to that.

131
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:53,020
You really have an interest in this. You just don't want to come out and just, you know, have no kind of evidence.

132
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:59,950
You need just like a breadcrumb trail. So if you're nearing graduation, you know, you should keep doing all these things.

133
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:07,600
But I would definitely recommend if you really now have like an interest in this is like kind of your direction,

134
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:14,319
you should start to join those professional organizations so you can start to really get in there,

135
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:21,820
dig in deeper, and start to get to know people and names and challenges within the field and things like that.

136
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:29,079
Do your research. Where do you want to work? There's there's jobs in every every corner of the world for infection prevention.

137
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:33,700
And you need to start thinking about where you want to land after you graduate.

138
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:40,200
In the start, networking and calling people connect with headhunters a Galileo search.

139
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:47,790
I'm not promoting them, but they do seem to be a headhunter company that does seem to specialize in infection prevention jobs.

140
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:51,389
So you can look them up. They're always looking for IPS.

141
00:14:51,390 --> 00:15:01,720
IPS are really in demand. So, you know, during the pandemic, we were paying $200 an hour for IPS from the temp agency.

142
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:07,360
So they were a hot commodity. That was like what the nurses were making in the ICU.

143
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:19,200
So you can, you know, most large health systems, you can go into their job board site and set up keyword job alerts so you can get emailed.

144
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:24,870
Want a job with that? Those words pop up in a job description.

145
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:34,500
So that's a good idea. Share your CV and tell people you're interested in opportunities, but don't be like a stalker.

146
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:41,459
BET stalkers over the years and that can be really offensive.

147
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:49,560
So don't you know one and done type of thing don't keep pounding people you know it's okay so say give you an example.

148
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:58,649
Say you want to move to San Diego after you graduate and you find out you can connect with me for names of

149
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:07,049
people I know pretty much every a large health systems infection prevention manager director and you can say,

150
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:11,370
hey Lisa, I am thinking after I graduate, I want to land in San Diego.

151
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:16,350
Can you hook me up with the infection prevention people in San Diego?

152
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:19,200
And I can give you a name, a contact,

153
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:26,760
and then you can email said contact with your CV and you can name drop and say, I was in Lisa's lecture, whatever.

154
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:34,440
And that's and then then they would like write back and say, We don't have a job opportunity, but I'll keep your CV on file.

155
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:38,280
Or Oh, it just so happens I'm working on filling a position right now.

156
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:43,889
Well, you know, well, you know, put you in the queue so that but then like that's it.

157
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:49,200
Like, leave it alone. Like don't go, you know, nutso on it. So, but that's just an example.

158
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:55,980
But I have had people over the years that somebody has given them my name and then like every three months they're like,

159
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:59,610
you know, pinging me and I'm like, whoa, you know, take a chill pill.

160
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:04,169
Okay, so let's talk about your resume and your CV. This is really important, right?

161
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:11,880
This is your you know, the first thing people are going to see about you aside from maybe if you send them an email.

162
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:17,280
But so let's talk about that. It's really, really important.

163
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:25,380
So recognize your assets and don't sell yourself short. So when you're going to go into a potential job opportunity for infection prevention,

164
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:32,429
your competition might be a clinical nurse, it might be an ICU nurse, it might be an experienced infection prevention.

165
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:35,430
It might be a microbiologist from the hospital lab.

166
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:45,000
You never know what it's going to be, right? So you'd have to like really go in very confident that you are coming in with a certain skill set,

167
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:53,460
a certain background, a certain training, and don't ever sell yourself short like I've had, I've interviewed.

168
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:59,180
And grads and they're like, well, you know, I don't have any clinicals, so how am I?

169
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:04,610
I'm never going to get this job over like, you know, Betty Sue, the ICU nurse.

170
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:08,180
And I'm like, well, that's not true. You don't know what they're looking for.

171
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:11,540
You don't know. Maybe they already have five. Betty Sue's right.

172
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,430
And they need somebody like you.

173
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:21,580
So never, ever, ever underestimate what you're coming out of the school of Public Health with and what you can bring to the table.

174
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:31,530
You have to be very, very solid on that. Now, a resume should highlight your strengths, but not be overly fluffy and flowery.

175
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:35,570
I you know, I this is personal.

176
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:41,360
I've looked at, you know, thousands resumes over the years. I always look for schooling and job experience.

177
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,680
Those are my two big things.

178
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:50,870
I hate it when, like, the first page is just a bunch of adjectives of how your mother would describe you like a strong team member.

179
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:54,530
Hardworking, honest, loyal, competent. Yeah, right.

180
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:59,990
So let's just, you know, cut that fluff and put the meat on your page one,

181
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:06,650
because sometimes that's all a person or an H.R. person is going to look at, might be page one.

182
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:15,110
So make sure, you know, I can't stress this enough, you guys, that it is professional and typed professional, you know, typos,

183
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:21,650
grammars, have other people look at it for you because you might there might be a typo in there that you just gloss over.

184
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:28,340
Have more than one other person, take a look at it and just make sure it's clean formatted.

185
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:35,930
It looks like nice. It makes sense. It's not too wordy, but it's wordy enough to give a little bit of meat about you.

186
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:44,329
And then in your cover letter, you know, may, you know, try to draw, you know, you really like read the job description.

187
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:47,510
And unfortunately, job descriptions are getting more and more generic.

188
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:52,639
In the past, they used to be a little bit more granular about what the job entailed.

189
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:58,790
But now they have like these almost canned job descriptions that tell you very little about the job.

190
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:05,959
And that doesn't help you, because I've always told people to use those little cues and clues in those job descriptions to write your

191
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:12,740
cover letter and extract out one or two key things that they are looking for and put it in your cover letter.

192
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:16,280
So it's like a match, right? Like, Oh, when I win or chicken dinner.

193
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:20,209
So it's still try to do that as best you can.

194
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:26,780
It depends, like I said, on the job description, if it's super, super cut and paste meant I have that ability.

195
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:37,160
Now your cover letter don't make it like, you know, size eight font like expanded margins with like a trillion words on it.

196
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:42,710
Like that is just nobody's going to read any of that, you know, keep it short, keep it to the point.

197
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:46,370
Really hit on what you want them to know about you.

198
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:53,870
And like I said, you know, people are reading, you know, sometimes for a job opening, you might have 200 applicants.

199
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:58,009
So you don't have a ton of time to like, you know, you're really flying through these things.

200
00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:01,790
So you got to keep it really what you want them to know.

201
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:04,940
And no baloney fluff in there.

202
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:11,950
Now what I've always looked for, you know, I do look at what college the person went to.

203
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:15,390
I mean, it's not to say that I'd be like, oh, they went to Michigan State.

204
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:18,300
I'm not interviewing them. Oh, they went to U of M, I am. I'm not like that.

205
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:24,090
But like, I have to have some some knowledge of the university or the institution.

206
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:29,430
And I don't look at GPAs in the past. Some times candidates would put their GPA on their resumé.

207
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:38,250
I once interviewed somebody that had like 2.2 or something and and I didn't find that on the committee, but it was somewhere in the h.r.

208
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:43,200
Job application. But so I don't put a lot of weight on GPAs.

209
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:51,480
You know, you can always tell somebody level of intelligence and critical thinking when you interview them resumes too.

210
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:55,950
I do look for gaps and holes or what we call red flags.

211
00:21:56,250 --> 00:22:05,819
So, you know, job hoppers can be concerning concerning red flags like, you know, you're young girl probably.

212
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:14,670
So you don't have a ton of this going on yet. You haven't probably established this long running record of job hopping.

213
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:21,899
But as you gain experience, you know, if you you know, it's okay in the beginning to maybe have a little bit of like job hopping,

214
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:27,630
but eventually you should start showing some length of time at the positions.

215
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:35,970
Otherwise, you know, as, as a hiring manager, I start to think, well, you know, hiring somebody is a great investment, right?

216
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:40,710
The whole process is is expensive and then training them and onboarding them and etc.

217
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:47,040
So when you hire somebody, you want them to stay with you a while, you know, not like six months or a year.

218
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:50,340
And if they're just like flitting around that to me.

219
00:22:51,430 --> 00:23:03,700
There's always been a red flag. So if you do have that going on or you do have long gaps on your resumé or you've never worked it, that's okay.

220
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:08,470
But you should probably try to have some volunteer experience or some other explanation, you know?

221
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:12,910
Well, I was in the Peace Corps for three years and that's why this gap here.

222
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:16,900
So it's it's like I said, it's it's okay to have those.

223
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,950
But try to have like a plot, like a laudable explanation.

224
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:26,220
I interviewed a guy once who had a ten year gap on her resume, a microbiologist.

225
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:29,830
And then I said, oh, you know, what were you doing in this ten year gap?

226
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:36,250
Not like drilling into, like, personal, but she was like, oh, well, I, I what did she say?

227
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:40,450
I was a stay at home mom, something like that, you know.

228
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:45,430
And then at the end we were chit chatting and it came up I how about my kids?

229
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:50,650
And she's like, Oh, I don't have any kids. And I was like, Oh, how are you staying home?

230
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:59,860
It turned out she was just managing some renovations on her house, which is fine, but like a lie, you know?

231
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:03,250
So anyways, just, you know, have an explanation.

232
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:05,410
Okay, let's talk about the interview.

233
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:13,570
There is one more thing I added to this section that I didn't put on the handout, but I think it's important, so I'll I'll mention it.

234
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:19,270
So, first of all, preparing for the interview, I really think it's helpful if you can do a mock interview,

235
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:21,940
especially if you don't have a lot of interviewing experience.

236
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:33,040
So if you can unless if you know somebody in your friend or family circle that is a hiring manager for what it doesn't matter like what profession?

237
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:36,340
Just somebody with those skills of being a hiring manager.

238
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:40,390
I think it's a great idea to try to do a mock interview with them.

239
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:46,270
I offer my friends and family, my nieces, my nephews mock interviews all the time,

240
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:55,960
and I always have them send me their CV and resume in advance so I can take a look at it and frame my questions.

241
00:24:56,140 --> 00:25:02,200
I send them like a fake job description, or they send me the job description of the job they're going for.

242
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:05,589
And then we just do it fake. We've done them in person.

243
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:07,570
We've done a remote or, you know, virtual.

244
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:17,200
I think it helps sometimes, you know, if you have any jitters, it can help work those through, but also if they are an experienced hiring manager.

245
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:26,490
They can ask you those maybe curveball questions that you might not be prepared for that maybe they use when they interview people.

246
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:32,100
And I think it just it helps you. I have gotten feedback from people.

247
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:35,400
I've done that through that. Those mock interviews really help them.

248
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:40,170
So I didn't put that here, but I'm going to add it after, but I definitely recommend that.

249
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,620
So research the institution, you know, it's good to know.

250
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:47,779
About the place that you maybe want to get a job with.

251
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:52,879
Right. So, you know, what? Is there such a we can get so much information on the Internet now.

252
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,000
So what's the situation? What's their financial situation?

253
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,210
If it's a health system, are they are they growing? Are they shrinking?

254
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:06,500
You know what what's going on there? Are they shifting their focus from acute to ambulatory or ambulatory to surgery or whatever?

255
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:10,459
So are they potentially on the chopping block?

256
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:14,720
Are they maybe folding or are they being acquired by somebody else?

257
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:19,940
Right. Look what happened in Michigan with Bowman and Spectrum and now Caldwell Health, and they're letting people go.

258
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:25,600
Those kind of dynamics are important to know just to keep in the back of your brain for the interview.

259
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:30,829
It's not lesser, you know, bring it up on the interview like, hey, I heard you guys are cutting positions,

260
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:37,580
you know, so but just have that knowledge working, not research the profession and the position itself.

261
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:43,819
I remember when I was a student undergrad and I wanted to become a nuclear medicine

262
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:52,880
technologist and I was interviewing for the the student school position at that health system.

263
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:59,450
They're like, what do you think a nuclear med tech does? Lisa And I didn't know because I was 19 years old.

264
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:03,320
I didn't research. I just picked it because I thought, Oh, it sounds cool.

265
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:08,719
I'm like, Well, I think like they do like barium enemas and stuff and they're like, No, that's an x ray tech.

266
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:15,110
And then I was really like, Oh gosh, probably should have research that in advance, know what I'm going for.

267
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:21,409
So anyways, do that, you know, and then prepare intelligent questions.

268
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:28,850
So I would say, you know, like read up on some challenges in the field right now, like right now in infection prevention.

269
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:37,370
I have a question for you guys and I want to know, do any of you know, what do you think are the top two challenges right now in infection prevention?

270
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:42,980
Put it in the chat box. There's that little like little, you know, box, comment box.

271
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:48,860
You could click on that. And what do you think are like? There is a huge new challenge right now in infection prevention.

272
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:53,479
It's emerging, came out of COVID. We're all struggling, right, Ellie?

273
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,630
Good guess. Antibiotic resistant. You are on the right track.

274
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:04,080
Any other guesses? Not that I have a prize vaccination.

275
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:08,290
There is a good one else and that's not a huge thing.

276
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:11,639
Funding. Yes, Chris, that's always a problem. Yes.

277
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:21,240
I mean, that's our life. There's a specific emerging pathogen that is actually a really big problem in Michigan right now.

278
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,290
Yes. Stephen, winner, winner, chicken dinner.

279
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:32,760
Candida auris is the i'm telling you, you guys, this is the next explosion problem.

280
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:46,650
C auris the order is a highly resistant strain of Canada that is mostly colonizing patients, but it is like coming out fast and strong.

281
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:52,710
It spreads like nobody's business. It is running like wildfire through our nursing homes.

282
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:56,159
And it's now because, you know, right, there's crossover.

283
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:00,680
It's now hitting the hospitals. So things like that.

284
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:09,870
That's what I would recommend. You look up before your interview and then you can like without going to crazy

285
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,920
ask like frame like an intelligent question around that in your interview.

286
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:21,419
So for example you're in if you knew that you could say if you were say you were interviewing with me, you could say, oh, is this sentient?

287
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:25,110
You know, at the end when there's open it questions, you can say, you know,

288
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:29,340
I understand handed or this is a huge new challenge in infection prevention.

289
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:32,780
How is Ascension dealing with that or something like that, you know,

290
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:41,160
so you don't want to go like so detailed that you're going to make the person interviewing you feel stupid or you're not like to like stump them.

291
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,260
But all the other things you guys put in the chat box are really good.

292
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:52,139
Discussion points to funding health care, acquired infections, antibiotic resistance.

293
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:57,230
Those are all really good things that you could also drive a question around.

294
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:03,240
So don't feel like you have to have like the one thing, but do do you know some research.

295
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:07,139
I read that like I said, read the job description carefully.

296
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:10,110
That used to be more possible in the past. Now it is.

297
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:16,780
It's getting a little bit more generic, especially as health systems merge and become bigger and bigger.

298
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:21,089
Are you guys things are becoming a little less personal because, you know,

299
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:27,870
at Ascension we have 100 and any given day, 142 to 153 hospitals, it's always changing.

300
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:35,370
So, you know, when you're dealing with that many hospitals, things do become a little bit more diluted and generic at the system level.

301
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:40,769
So now research the person interviewing you.

302
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:47,220
Okay, so not the so a lot of times now, especially with these larger places, you're going to have a screening interview with H.R.

303
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:52,320
The H.R. screening interview is more just to see. Do you do you fit the minimum requirements?

304
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:56,820
Like I've had construction workers apply for infection prevention jobs.

305
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:59,910
So that's like two more screen out, like the big filter, right?

306
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,780
And then they would kick them, kick their resumé over to you.

307
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:11,610
Now, there's been times where H.R. I ask that I tell them I want to see all the resumes, not the ones, just that you filter out.

308
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:13,499
Because a couple of times I've caught things,

309
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:19,890
what they filtered somebody out and I wanted to interview them so that, you know, that could be the case, too.

310
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:24,629
So you can look at people, you know, Google them on LinkedIn, Facebook, etc.

311
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:32,240
So. You know, remember on LinkedIn, people can especially if the premium account, they can see who's looking up their profile.

312
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:36,589
But to be perfectly honest, you know, I that's okay.

313
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:43,610
I get probably 60, 70 profile looks on me, you know, every time I get a LinkedIn report, I don't care.

314
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:49,260
Like, do I really care that, you know, LinkedIn is the professional platform to do that?

315
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:55,830
So it's okay. So Facebook, the nice thing is they don't know, you know, you're looking them up on Facebook.

316
00:31:55,850 --> 00:32:00,890
Same with I think the other platforms, Instagram and TikTok.

317
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:04,420
You know, I've been using TikTok lately to look people up.

318
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:11,750
So I, you know, you could call it stalking, but I'm going to tell you what I'm doing the reverse stalking on you, too.

319
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:19,430
So it cuts both ways, right? So if you're, you know, applying for a job with me, I'm going to be looking up you on social media as well.

320
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:23,660
If I especially if I'm getting close to offering you a job, I want to know that, you know,

321
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:32,650
you're not some weirdo that you know, your profile picture is you holding like, you know, AK 47 aimed at puppies or something.

322
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:37,450
So just remember that. Okay.

323
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:43,140
So when you're setting up an interview, whoever you're setting up, you know, now it's probably a lot like online setting up.

324
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,380
But if you're actually on the phone with somebody,

325
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:50,660
remember the person you're talking to could be sitting right next to the person that's interviewing you.

326
00:32:51,050 --> 00:33:03,800
I had a candidate that we were when I worked at U of M or she was so difficult to my secretary about where was she going to park.

327
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:08,660
Where were you going to pay her for parking? I had another one that we were that was coming in from Texas.

328
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:13,790
She wanted to know if we were going to pay for her airfare. She was so rude and mean to my secretary.

329
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:15,229
Those were like red flags.

330
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:22,620
Like if you can't even get along with the support person, how am I going to ever predict that you're going to get along with my whole team, right?

331
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,970
I like 17 people at U of M, you know, I have a big team.

332
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:32,510
So it's really important that you treat everybody with respect and kindness and you're very accommodating.

333
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:36,200
Don't ask about reimbursement for parking or anything like that.

334
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:42,860
Don't sound tacky, arrogant. All those like yucky things try to build a rapport, you know, be nice.

335
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:49,340
Like I've always done that, like, right, these are people that it's okay to be nice.

336
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:54,020
And I wouldn't say bring them chocolates and flowers, but, you know, you could bring me chocolates.

337
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:57,769
I got my flexible with your scheduling. That was another thing.

338
00:33:57,770 --> 00:34:01,849
This one girl, she was so inflexible with her scheduling for the interview,

339
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:07,219
my secretary would come and complain to me all the time about it and I was like, How is that possible?

340
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:11,180
Like you have to, like accommodate everybody really busy.

341
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:14,990
So try to be flexible. Ask about parking in advance.

342
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:20,630
You don't want to have any last minute surprises or be late for your interview because you didn't know where to pucker.

343
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:25,370
You didn't have, you know, like, oh,

344
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:31,639
like I went to Michigan State once for a big meeting and I don't remember I was trying

345
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:36,260
to park in the parking structure in either it only took cash or it only took a card,

346
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:40,790
but I didn't have one or the other and I was like late for the meeting and it was just a hot mess.

347
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:44,899
So just, you know, check it all out in advance, take a test run.

348
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:51,980
In fact, now I'm funny story about a test run, so I set up an interview with a candidate.

349
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:57,219
That I had stopped appropriately in advance.

350
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:05,440
So I knew what he looked like. I'd seen him on social media, and the day before the interview we were at UVM.

351
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,940
Our offices were a dead end. Hall This is one. Hall I got to the end of the stairwell.

352
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:16,000
You had to go back. So I see this guy, like in the interview room was right across from my office.

353
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:22,600
This guy walking back and forth down the hall because he'd get to the end of the hall and he'd get, you know, turned around.

354
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:27,090
And I looked out and I was like, Oh, my God, that's it.

355
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:36,490
And I'm interviewing. And it was the next day when I saw him, I was like, Were you walking up and down my hall yesterday?

356
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:39,840
He's like, Yeah, like, okay, now, funny story about that.

357
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:45,700
He ended it as well, you guys. And this is very true in interviews.

358
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:48,940
A lot of times you'll interview like you go through a series of interviews, right?

359
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:58,340
But sometimes it will end with like a team interview. So I had interviewed that guy and he did great, like swimmingly great super interview.

360
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:03,490
Right. And so I advanced him to get a team interview, follow up with the team.

361
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:08,090
And when they interviewed him, it was a completely different situation.

362
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:14,120
At the whole interview, he bragged about how he was president of his frat houses,

363
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:25,120
beer pong committee or something with beer pong and did not talk anything about, you know, his skills, his training, his education, nothing.

364
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:34,700
It was all about like his partying. And I think he was trying to, like, be friends with them, like, you know, but they were all very put off by it.

365
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:39,130
And their feedback on him was, do not hire. So he did not get hired.

366
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:41,870
So just remember, like be consistent.

367
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:52,520
Try to, you know, toe the party line in all the different interviews and don't completely change who you are and brag about your beer pong.

368
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:59,130
Committee roll. All right. The interview itself. So things are changing now because of the remote thing.

369
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:07,710
So let's talk about remote interviews first, because I have interviewed a number of people now because of COVID, you know, through remote.

370
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:12,740
So, you know your background, it's okay. Like you could see my background, right?

371
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:17,280
It's I've got dollhouses. I've got a couch and a cat and all these things.

372
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:21,750
Right? And that's you know, to have that background is fine. Some no no's, though.

373
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:29,010
So if you are taking an interview from your bedroom, which is not uncommon, because if you live in an apartment, you might just sit.

374
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:34,140
That's the only place you can get to close the door, make sure your bed is made.

375
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:42,389
I cannot tell you how many times I've been on calls, even a session with high level professionals, and for whatever reason,

376
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:47,100
they're taking a call from their bedroom and their bed is in the background and it's like a mess.

377
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:50,400
And it's like, could you not at least have made your bed?

378
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:56,489
So that's number one. The other thing is you might not want like yucky things in the background.

379
00:37:56,490 --> 00:38:02,520
I was at a meeting recently with a guy at Ascension and his cat litter box was right behind him,

380
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,299
and every so often the cat would come in and like do its business.

381
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:13,170
And I was like, Really? You couldn't move the cat litter box, so just try to be aware of what's behind you.

382
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:16,350
But it doesn't have to be like, you know, picture perfect.

383
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:22,770
Now, the other thing about those like artificial backgrounds that you can bring up, those are great, but be aware too.

384
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:28,080
When you move, you know, you might disappear out of the background.

385
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:33,209
And sometimes I've seen them do funny things to be like it'll make like it'll cut

386
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:37,080
off your hair and make you look like you have a halo or you're bald or something.

387
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:38,219
So just beware.

388
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:45,270
If you're going to use an artificial background, you can't really move around and you can see I move around a lot, so that's why I don't use them.

389
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:49,620
But also, it might do funny things to you.

390
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:58,140
Yeah. Another. Another funny. When I was on a call with somebody and they had, if they were room with a ceiling fan,

391
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:07,230
but the way their head was just positioned that the ceiling looked like the ceiling fan was sitting on top of their head and it was spinning.

392
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:11,760
So it looked like they had one of those assigned with like spitting firelight told.

393
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,540
I said, Marcus, I have to stop this car. There is like a spinning thing.

394
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:20,969
And so just like maybe even do like if you do your Mach interview with somebody,

395
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:28,350
do it in the space you're going to do and try not to do like an interview in a public place or an airport or something like that.

396
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:34,409
It, you know, use your common sense also remote does not mean casual, right?

397
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:38,309
So, you know, we've all heard those funny stories from the waist down.

398
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:44,390
You can be in shorts. Just remember you might like you might have to, like, leave for what?

399
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,670
Like some maybe something falls off the wall and you say, excuse me.

400
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:53,940
You do want to be dressed head to toe in something that would be seen by others.

401
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:57,750
You don't want to, you know, be in shorts or your whatever.

402
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:03,210
And then dogs and kids and cats, they're all very cute.

403
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:09,240
We all have them. Right. But it's like I think I've been on calls with people.

404
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:16,230
Like they think it's cute to have their baby in their lap or their cat in front of them and try to avoid that like it's yeah,

405
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:18,269
your cat might jump up, get rid of it, right?

406
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:24,630
Your dog might and make sure your dog if if dogs they're secure like I have two dogs, two huskies that bark.

407
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:28,979
They're secure right now because I don't want them, like, barking and interrupting us.

408
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:33,900
So just like distractions and stuff like that, try to keep to a minimum.

409
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:39,280
Okay. So moving on. Okay.

410
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,329
It's dressed professionally. You're not a student anymore, right?

411
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:46,620
You don't have to be like full, full, formal. But moderation is best.

412
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:54,210
I mean, you know, I say overly trendy. It's okay to have colorful and fun clothes, but don't be like really crazy out there.

413
00:40:54,540 --> 00:41:00,180
I've interviewed candidates from MPH. You know, this applies to your chip internship too.

414
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:10,680
I interviewed a girl a couple of years ago and she showed up in this like micro mini dress, like mini Tobi skirt thingy.

415
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:17,370
And I was like really like I don't want to be seeing that like, you know, so use moderation.

416
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:29,250
I don't smell, you know, no body odor, no smelly hair products because the person interviewing you is also assessing consciously or subconsciously.

417
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:33,360
Is this somebody I can see in my team? Right. Is this somebody I can see?

418
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:39,450
Unless you're a 100% remote, I'm not going to hire somebody that is doesn't smell good.

419
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:44,849
You know, people have to, like, work with you and be with you sometimes long, long hours.

420
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:48,270
So most health systems are fragrance free now.

421
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:52,110
So you have to keep the cologne and smelly hair products to a minimum.

422
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:58,300
Moderate makeup. I mean, you know, if you do your eyes one way or whatever, that's fine.

423
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:04,750
But like, don't be, like, crazy about it. Cat and piercings are fine, but moderation.

424
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:08,109
You know, health systems in general are more conservative.

425
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:12,820
Health settings. Jails and prisons. If you're going for a job, there's probably a little bit more leeway.

426
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:19,670
So just know what you know, what is kind of acceptable in that setting and match that in your interview.

427
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:26,830
Ring questions to ask. You know, like even if it's just a few, I hate it when I'm interviewing somebody and you're at the end and you say,

428
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:30,100
Do you have any questions for me about the job?

429
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:33,909
And they're like, No, you know, you don't want to have that like deadpan.

430
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:41,049
You want to have like some enthusiasm and questions, show interest and enthusiasm, make sure that, you know, you're not just looking for a job.

431
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:45,700
Like I'm just going through the motions and I just need a paycheck, you know? This is like a thing for you.

432
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:48,910
This is your show, your passion. This is where you want to go.

433
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:55,600
So I'm interested. Take notes. You know, obviously try to be as relaxed as possible.

434
00:42:55,600 --> 00:43:05,530
That's, you know, pretty rhetorical. But, you know, it's okay to be nervous, you know, especially if you're not, you know, advanced at this.

435
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:06,849
It's okay.

436
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:13,330
You know, people interviewing you should understand that I've interviewed hundreds of people that are nervous and that's perfectly acceptable.

437
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:20,199
I've even interviewed people that like like dripped sweat in person interviews.

438
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,390
And, you know, I understand we're human.

439
00:43:23,050 --> 00:43:31,930
Take extra copies of your your cover letter and your resumé because you never know if more than one person is going to be interviewing you.

440
00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:40,540
So you need to if it's an in person, you need to be prepared for that. You know, after the interview, obviously it's remote, it's a moot point.

441
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:43,239
But if in person you can say, do you have a business card?

442
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:52,330
Or, you know, if you get little cards from your you or make your own, bring know, share those, it never hurts to have that.

443
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:56,890
Just that little calling card that, you know, they can throw on their desk, they might forget.

444
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:04,930
And then, oh, there it is. It's the little reminder if it's in person, don't change the environment or the seating.

445
00:44:04,930 --> 00:44:11,290
I interviewed a guy once who before I got into the room, he changed the whole room.

446
00:44:11,290 --> 00:44:15,579
He like opened the window, he moved the chairs. I was like, Really, dude?

447
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:20,860
Like, why are you doing that? It's it's not, you know, you're a guest, basically in somebody's home.

448
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:24,160
So, you know. Think of it that way.

449
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:30,370
You know, as far as generally in person, they'll offer you maybe, you know, drink a water or something.

450
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:34,930
It's fine that but don't like if you're so like scattered and nervous, don't take it.

451
00:44:34,930 --> 00:44:38,260
If you think you're going to spill it, go to the bathroom in advance.

452
00:44:38,350 --> 00:44:40,600
Get that taking care of show up 30 minutes earlier.

453
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:47,590
But no earlier than that, because you show up too early, especially if they're doing like succession of candidates,

454
00:44:47,830 --> 00:44:51,310
you could be bumping into the other candidates and that's super awkward.

455
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:56,499
So don't try to namedrop. I've had this happen a number of times.

456
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:59,260
I hate it. You know, it's okay to namedrop.

457
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:08,799
Like, let's say you're interviewing at Coral Health, you know, Beaumont Spectrum and you know me, it's okay just to be like,

458
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:17,320
Oh, Lisa Stern gave me your number, but don't be like, oh, you know, my dad is president of blah, blah, blah.

459
00:45:17,350 --> 00:45:21,940
And the other surgeons at this hospital do business with him, blah, blah.

460
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:25,059
So kind of like, you know, quid pro pro like don't do that.

461
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:28,690
That's like a that's really to me very offensive.

462
00:45:28,690 --> 00:45:31,000
In fact, I had an employee that used to do that to me all the time.

463
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:36,520
Her dad had some connection and I had to sit her down and like tell her, like, you need to stop.

464
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:42,640
She even had a surgeon email me to get her promoted. And I'm like, If you don't stop this, like you're out of here.

465
00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:47,860
And it didn't end well. So don't do that. It's okay.

466
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:54,280
Like I said, the name rap within the profession now right during the interview, show your strengths.

467
00:45:55,030 --> 00:45:58,120
You know you are the bee's knees. You're graduating with you again.

468
00:45:58,180 --> 00:46:01,839
School of Public Health MPH degree. This is awesome.

469
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:12,309
You have to really, really highlight it. Stress whatever skills you've hopefully built up to this point, try to figure out who your competition is.

470
00:46:12,310 --> 00:46:17,799
A lot of times, like, you know, some larger infection prevention programs,

471
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:21,970
they'll have their teams like on their website, like who else is on the team? Like Johns Hopkins.

472
00:46:21,970 --> 00:46:26,710
You can look up their entire team right now who works, what their jobs are, what their backgrounds are.

473
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:31,030
So if that's, you know, situation, you could do a little bit of research about the department.

474
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:35,570
It's okay to ask who will I be reporting to in this position?

475
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:39,980
It might be the person interviewing you. It might not. So it's okay to ask that.

476
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:48,080
Take samples of your work if you have samples. Maybe from your capstone or from a researcher volunteer project.

477
00:46:48,490 --> 00:46:53,450
Always take samples or have them available if it's a remote or an online interview.

478
00:46:54,170 --> 00:47:00,770
Like I said, try to listen for keywords from the job description and try to exploit that to your benefit.

479
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,750
And then remember it for later too, because I want you to weave that into your thank you notes.

480
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:09,530
So you're you're building like you're planting little seeds because really,

481
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:13,220
at the end of the day, the person interviewing you is looking like who's best for this job?

482
00:47:14,150 --> 00:47:18,680
Right. And they might have a certain thing in mind and you might just hit on that certain thing.

483
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:26,120
I've interviewed people based on that. So it's okay to bring along references, but don't offer them unless asked for.

484
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:31,130
Because generally the way I always rolled was I would interview a bunch of people and

485
00:47:31,130 --> 00:47:37,070
then I would only ask for references and make my top two choices because that means,

486
00:47:37,070 --> 00:47:40,070
you know, you're going to take it one step further and call on references.

487
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:45,800
Now, there's been a new trend, and I think it's because of COVID and the rapidity of having to fill positions.

488
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:50,780
A lot of times people aren't even checking references anymore, which I find shocking.

489
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:58,129
But the last couple of apps we've hired at Ascension, I was told by the hiring managers they didn't even check the references.

490
00:47:58,130 --> 00:48:06,110
And I was like. But sometimes references, you know, it's kittens and cupcakes, so they're not helpful anyways.

491
00:48:07,490 --> 00:48:10,340
It's okay to ask, you know, what the timeline is for filling the position.

492
00:48:10,350 --> 00:48:16,190
Sometimes they're interviewing and they don't even have the position like funded yet or it's a grant position.

493
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:19,610
So, you know, it's okay to say what is the timeline? Because you need to know, right?

494
00:48:19,610 --> 00:48:22,820
You need once you graduate, you might have student loans piling up.

495
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:26,150
So it's okay to know, you know, you're planning your timeline.

496
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:32,990
It's okay to say, ah, is there the possibility that there's going to be subsequent interviews after today?

497
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:35,389
Don't assume you're going to get one, because like I said,

498
00:48:35,390 --> 00:48:40,520
I would only advance people through those levels if I thought they were qualified to go forward.

499
00:48:40,530 --> 00:48:48,110
Not everybody got a team interview or etc. You know, what I always looked for was energy, enthusiasm.

500
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:54,320
Now, look, I know some of you might be introverts, right? Or maybe not have that, like, media personality.

501
00:48:54,410 --> 00:48:58,250
That's okay. But you can still show energy and enthusiasm.

502
00:48:58,250 --> 00:49:06,620
My daughter is an introvert, and she can still I can still tell when she has enthusiasm about something, even as an introvert.

503
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:13,790
So, you know, try to have that sparkle about the position, even if you're not just generally like that in general,

504
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:19,280
try to show that excitement about the position no matter what it is.

505
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:23,360
Right. You know, you got to figure that nobody wants like that dead fish on their team.

506
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:28,220
And then how are you different and what do you bring to this team? What is special about you?

507
00:49:28,370 --> 00:49:30,560
You know, there's got to be something special about you.

508
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:35,780
And it's really important to bring that up because especially if you're interviewing like 20 people,

509
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:42,450
you know, when you go to hire, you're trying to think who stood out, right? Who grabbed my attention after the interview?

510
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:48,470
Send a quick follow up. No email is fine, but handwritten is always special to try to weave into that.

511
00:49:48,470 --> 00:49:53,660
Thank you. Know what? You know, those key words were those little buzz words.

512
00:49:53,900 --> 00:50:02,690
And like I wanted to mention sometimes in the you know, I said in that job description, there is no key word or buzzword for you to like go glob.

513
00:50:02,690 --> 00:50:07,040
I do. But oftentimes if you get the interview, there will be something.

514
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:14,480
And you know, they might mention I specifically were looking for somebody with a skill or talent here.

515
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:19,549
And you're going to try to figure out how do you have said skill or talent?

516
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:21,530
And, you know, it's like a puzzle piece.

517
00:50:22,530 --> 00:50:32,970
So just to continue that theme, put that skill or talent in your thank, you know, and I did this one guy I hired at U of M who's still there.

518
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:35,550
He was really adept at doing this.

519
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:47,220
When I, I was losing my information in from infection prevention analyst that ran my third out, which was our infection surveillance software.

520
00:50:47,370 --> 00:50:50,980
And he was like, amazing. And I was so sad I was losing him.

521
00:50:51,570 --> 00:50:54,899
And so I kept bringing it up in the interview with this new guy.

522
00:50:54,900 --> 00:51:02,280
And he caught on to it and in his little thank, you know, he put that and I was like, winner, winner, chicken dinner.

523
00:51:02,550 --> 00:51:07,800
And I hired him and he's very successful. So that is just a little tip.

524
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:16,090
Don't stop the person. This goes back to the earlier thing. Like one thank you is not like you don't have to keep bugging them.

525
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:19,959
They if they've interview you, they have everything they need, right?

526
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:25,150
They've got your contact information. They know how to find you. Don't send repeated.

527
00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:31,480
You know, you want to look enthusiastic and energetic and interested, but you don't want to appear like too crazy, desperate or stocky.

528
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:37,140
I've had people stalk me and it's not fun. Okay.

529
00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:43,770
Don't be surprised if it takes a while. Like, you know, the interview process and the whole job hiring process can take months.

530
00:51:44,130 --> 00:51:47,190
And the bigger sometimes the bigger the place, the longer.

531
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:51,989
So things move slow. And then, you know what?

532
00:51:51,990 --> 00:51:58,709
If you didn't get the job, it's okay. There's going to be more interviews, there's more opportunities, like there's more fish in sea.

533
00:51:58,710 --> 00:52:02,180
Right. But try to learn, at least from the experience.

534
00:52:02,190 --> 00:52:06,210
Why try to, like, do a root cause analysis? Why didn't I get it?

535
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:12,240
Now, maybe it was just a bad, you know, you completely weren't even close, but that's fine.

536
00:52:12,570 --> 00:52:16,500
You know, you could call if you really, really are, like, stumped.

537
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:20,400
You could call the person who interview you and ask for feedback.

538
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:26,250
You could also ask or this could be an email. Would I be considered for a future?

539
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:31,020
Was it just maybe the poor job fit for now, but maybe for the future?

540
00:52:31,950 --> 00:52:39,720
And I've had people email me What can I do to better position myself to get a future with you, a job with you in the future?

541
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:44,980
And I would be honest. I had a gal do that.

542
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:50,560
I interviewed her and she didn't get the job. And she was an internal candidate.

543
00:52:50,570 --> 00:52:58,190
She was coming from the lab, microbiology lab at U of M, and she did she did ask me for feedback.

544
00:52:58,190 --> 00:53:04,580
And I actually met with her for 45 minutes and gave her feedback and told her, you know,

545
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:09,650
this is where you probably could have excelled or done a little different or better.

546
00:53:09,650 --> 00:53:14,209
So it depends on the person that interviewed you, you know, if they're going to be willing to do that.

547
00:53:14,210 --> 00:53:17,450
But you can always ask, you know, you can only be told no.

548
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:26,210
But and keep looking. And then in the meantime, it's okay to take a job in something else to pay the bills.

549
00:53:26,230 --> 00:53:31,130
I had to do that when I graduated from UVM. I could not get a job in infection prevention.

550
00:53:31,150 --> 00:53:38,260
I tried and tried and tried and everybody said We need experience. And all I had was my volunteer experience and that Appetite 65 assistant thing.

551
00:53:38,770 --> 00:53:45,309
So I took a job at a filter company doing some tissue culture work and biotech work.

552
00:53:45,310 --> 00:53:51,880
And, you know, it paid the bills. It was fine. It wasn't my dream job, but it got me experience and a little bit of a different area.

553
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:58,360
And then I just kept at it and finally got a job in infection prevention a year and a half later.

554
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:05,740
So it don't despair. Just, you know, if this is your thing, just keep stay focused and keep driving towards that goal.

555
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:18,660
Stay motivated now. Once you do, if you do get in the field, there are a couple of opportunities to keep to keep advancing yourself, of course.

556
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:23,050
The first one is certification and infection control and CIC.

557
00:54:23,070 --> 00:54:28,950
They just offered a brand new one called an associate CERT Associate CIC.

558
00:54:28,970 --> 00:54:36,530
So there's three tiers now, really. There's the associate one, which is four brand new like IV, some new IPS.

559
00:54:36,790 --> 00:54:40,140
They're looking at that right now, the associate certification.

560
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:50,580
And then there's the regular CIC, which is two years in the field, and then there's a higher tier through APIC called Fellowship of AP Fellowship.

561
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:55,740
And that's after many years with research and speaking and things like that, you get your fellowship.

562
00:54:56,160 --> 00:55:00,360
So in all of those, you have to renew at some regular frequency.

563
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:04,470
So I have a great book that I recommend to people.

564
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:10,850
The book is called What Got You Here Won't Get You There. And I think it's a good book because.

565
00:55:11,930 --> 00:55:17,990
You know, every stage of life, really, you know, work and energy.

566
00:55:18,770 --> 00:55:23,960
You did got you to this point. Right. But that's not necessarily what's going to get you to the next point.

567
00:55:23,990 --> 00:55:29,420
Right. So everything you did an undergrad, everything you did with your experience that you you were on school, public health.

568
00:55:29,750 --> 00:55:36,560
But now you have to do more to get to that next level, which is a job or career in your chosen field.

569
00:55:36,830 --> 00:55:41,870
So I like that book because it really goes through really drills that in your head.

570
00:55:41,870 --> 00:55:56,510
And even me, you guys, you know, I'm like top of my profession, but I still every single day do something to continue to move myself up.

571
00:55:56,870 --> 00:56:03,200
Every single day I read an article. Throughout COVID, I stayed current on every single thing published.

572
00:56:03,470 --> 00:56:07,570
You know, so you have to, like, continue. You can never rest on your laurels.

573
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:16,250
That is the worst thing ever to do. So continue to continue to grow, expand your brain, your mind about that profession,

574
00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:22,100
because especially health care, now, it's rapidly changing and it's constantly moving.

575
00:56:22,250 --> 00:56:26,300
So you have to stay in front of it or you will get plowed over.

576
00:56:26,630 --> 00:56:31,459
So good luck. There is my email address there.

577
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:35,210
You can connect with me on LinkedIn, make sure you find the right LinkedIn.

578
00:56:35,210 --> 00:56:38,480
Actually, because I have an old one floating around out there.

579
00:56:39,350 --> 00:56:43,160
I think my background picture is actually the peonies in Ann Arbor.

580
00:56:43,190 --> 00:56:46,490
So you'll know you find me when you see those peonies.

581
00:56:48,050 --> 00:56:51,830
And then that's my face in my profile. Oh, you know what?

582
00:56:51,830 --> 00:56:55,140
I wanted to mention that to you guys about your LinkedIn. You should.
