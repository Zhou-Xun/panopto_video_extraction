1
00:00:01,157 --> 00:00:10,417
So talk to talk about my journey. Sort of going into graduate school again, my name is Mislael Valentin-Cortes.

2
00:00:10,417 --> 00:00:17,757
I am a past participant of the future public health leader I participated back in 2015.

3
00:00:17,757 --> 00:00:26,927
So it's sort of to start off by giving a little bit of background as to sort of the things leading up to graduate school.

4
00:00:26,927 --> 00:00:32,227
So I did my bachelors at the University of Puerto Rico in MayagÃ¼ez,

5
00:00:32,227 --> 00:00:38,327
and there I focused on social science and English.

6
00:00:38,327 --> 00:00:49,917
I think especially sort of like in the beginning of my undergrad, I knew very little about public health.

7
00:00:49,917 --> 00:01:00,437
And I think I always had an interest for health work and social justice issues.

8
00:01:00,437 --> 00:01:08,217
However, I didn't always know how to sort of combine

9
00:01:08,217 --> 00:01:16,617
those areas. I think Especially sort of growing up in my community

10
00:01:16,617 --> 00:01:20,297
public health was never something that people talked about.

11
00:01:20,297 --> 00:01:24,827
And so that definitely something that I never considered when. I thought about public health

12
00:01:24,827 --> 00:01:32,747
I thought about like vaccines about like medicine and things of that nature?

13
00:01:32,747 --> 00:01:36,697
And that was something that I was particularly interested back then.

14
00:01:36,697 --> 00:01:49,717
I had a lot of interest in mental health and equity, so I thought about a lot about social board psychology as potential careers.

15
00:01:49,717 --> 00:01:56,707
However, I got involved with a health promotion program in undergrad, and I think that was

16
00:01:56,707 --> 00:02:07,087
sort of really the foundation for thinking about prevention and thinking about population health issues and all of that.

17
00:02:07,087 --> 00:02:14,077
However, I definitely did not have the framework in public health and I didn't even consider

18
00:02:14,077 --> 00:02:23,927
it until a faculty member suggested that I should look into a public health career.

19
00:02:23,927 --> 00:02:27,487
And again, my initial impression was like, no I don't think that's a good fit for me.

20
00:02:27,487 --> 00:02:38,967
But then he insisted that I should look into public health. And so that's sort of how I ended up finding out about FPHLP and then applying to FPHLP.

21
00:02:38,967 --> 00:02:41,227
And it was all sort of worked out,

22
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:50,677
FPHLP with something that was really foundational for my understanding of public health and where I could see myself within public health.

23
00:02:50,677 --> 00:02:58,547
But again. Public health is really something that wasn't talked about in my community,

24
00:02:58,547 --> 00:03:04,517
and my undergrad, for example, did not have any course offerings in public health.

25
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:15,887
So it didn't really have that sort of feel that I could really go in and work in the public health field?

26
00:03:15,887 --> 00:03:20,447
Like I mentioned, my bachelors was in social science and English,

27
00:03:20,447 --> 00:03:25,517
and they were all sort of like all the coursework that I took was really theoretical and practical.

28
00:03:25,517 --> 00:03:34,127
So I didn't feel like I had the skills necessary to really go in to to doing to go work.

29
00:03:34,127 --> 00:03:44,457
So that was sort of like the main thing that prompted me to pursue a graduate degree.

30
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:54,937
And the FPHLP was really a thing that sort of bolstered my confidence in terms of feeling prepared to go to graduate school.

31
00:03:54,937 --> 00:04:05,077
I definitely considered a lot of different factors. I think the particular the primary thing that I considered was the program fit,

32
00:04:05,077 --> 00:04:11,827
particularly because I was always interested in pursuing a dual master's of public health, master's of social work.

33
00:04:11,827 --> 00:04:19,747
So I looked into schools that have that program available and sort of had the research areas that I was interested in.

34
00:04:19,747 --> 00:04:35,087
So at that time, it was more mental health or equity or social justice oriented work, particularly work with Latino and Latinx communities.

35
00:04:35,087 --> 00:04:39,577
And so, yeah, that was sort of like the primary things on my mind

36
00:04:39,577 --> 00:04:45,037
when I was thinking about applying to graduate school, I decided to go for a masters of public health and masters of social work

37
00:04:45,037 --> 00:04:50,887
because I really wanted to have a diverse skillset.

38
00:04:50,887 --> 00:05:02,227
I wanted to sort of have that sort of dual combination of having the macro perspective for public health, the population health perspective,

39
00:05:02,227 --> 00:05:09,337
and then also having sort of like the clinical knowledge and the individual one on one from the masters of social work.

40
00:05:09,337 --> 00:05:14,167
I thought that could provide a unique perspective for my or my career

41
00:05:14,167 --> 00:05:24,247
and then it would really be helpful when I was looking into working. You know, things changed

42
00:05:24,247 --> 00:05:35,287
and I think especially the first year or so in my graduate degree, I can get from Puerto Rico.

43
00:05:35,287 --> 00:05:39,097
And I started my my masters in 2017

44
00:05:39,097 --> 00:05:49,347
And so about a month after I moved to Michigan to start my masters, Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico and costs a lot of devastation.

45
00:05:49,347 --> 00:05:57,367
You know, a lot of areas were without power for eight months. We had about 3000 deaths and there was a lot of

46
00:05:57,367 --> 00:06:05,747
Issues with health conditions and death It was a very difficult time.

47
00:06:05,747 --> 00:06:15,917
And I think that really changed my perspective. That really made me think more about research, more about empowerment,

48
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:25,577
and more about how I could further advance my skillset so that I could tackle a lot of those issues.

49
00:06:25,577 --> 00:06:29,957
I think Puerto Rico, even though it's received some national attention,

50
00:06:29,957 --> 00:06:38,267
there wasn't a lot of research going into the area, especially from Puerto Ricans.

51
00:06:38,267 --> 00:06:48,977
We saw a lot of researchers from the US who were trying to go in and may not necessarily have contextual background knowledge about community needs.

52
00:06:48,977 --> 00:06:58,547
And we're potentially using a lot of different research tools and research instruments that might be biased

53
00:06:58,547 --> 00:07:05,867
in the sense that you may not accurately reflect people's values and people's definitions of things.

54
00:07:05,867 --> 00:07:13,787
And that sort of had me thinking more and more about pursuing a PhD.

55
00:07:13,787 --> 00:07:25,307
But I had I didn't have a lot of research experience prior to my masters, so I decided to work as a research assistant for a professor.

56
00:07:25,307 --> 00:07:30,027
And I think that really validated what I was thinking about.

57
00:07:30,027 --> 00:07:39,557
I gained a lot of interest in research and different methods, especially community based participatory methods.

58
00:07:39,557 --> 00:07:43,637
And I felt like they were not employed enough,

59
00:07:43,637 --> 00:07:55,127
especially within public health and particularly areas like epidemiology that were a lot more methods based and population data based,

60
00:07:55,127 --> 00:08:03,377
but did not necessarily have community input. But they are very well respected areas.

61
00:08:03,377 --> 00:08:09,677
So that also sort of made me move away from my masters which was in behavioral health education,

62
00:08:09,677 --> 00:08:21,817
to a more methodological and statistical program like a PhD in epidemiology. And really what made me

63
00:08:21,817 --> 00:08:25,297
think about different programs and which one was a good fit for me

64
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:29,107
I think I had a very unique interest in public health.

65
00:08:29,107 --> 00:08:38,017
So, again, thinking about climate change, thinking about environmental disasters and all these things.

66
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:42,757
These are areas that are not particularly studied within public health.

67
00:08:42,757 --> 00:08:51,837
So it was really difficult to find a program that I felt like had faculty and had research centers

68
00:08:51,837 --> 00:09:02,637
and different resources that were helpful for that research area that I was interested in.

69
00:09:02,637 --> 00:09:12,057
So I narrowed it down to about two or three programs, but decided for Michigan because I felt like

70
00:09:12,057 --> 00:09:20,247
I had that sort of research area support and I had faculty that went off with my interest.

71
00:09:20,247 --> 00:09:26,037
But I think especially with doctoral programs and PhD in particular,

72
00:09:26,037 --> 00:09:37,797
who your advisor is is really key because that sort of shapes your experience since you working with this person for four to five years.

73
00:09:37,797 --> 00:09:44,577
And I felt like the adviser that I would have had in Michigan was extremely supportive,

74
00:09:44,577 --> 00:09:51,417
was really understand and was really invested in my personal and professional development.

75
00:09:51,417 --> 00:10:01,677
And so ultimately that was the deciding factor and deciding to pursue my future and epidemiology at the University of Michigan.

76
00:10:01,677 --> 00:10:04,147
OK. Thank you.
