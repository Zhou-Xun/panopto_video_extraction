1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:04,120
Double single, anything single, single.

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:13,559
We still don't know what to say and we got up to do what.

3
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:19,610
To me, it's like when I go out across the street.

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,860
Oh. Oh, I see.

5
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:51,880
But then, yeah. So she's like, yeah, for a while, you're like, Oh, you're always, always, always like my friend on Friday night.

6
00:00:51,910 --> 00:01:08,930
And I was like, Oh God, I don't like to think about anything like that happen.

7
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,520
Like it all, like standing right in the front.

8
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:35,250
Yeah, I go to school, like watching the girls go back, I guess, which teams are out in the squad.

9
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:47,610
Like, you know, maybe that's why I was like, Yeah, but that's the way the whole game yesterday.

10
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:53,310
All right, let's get started. I think I scared the people off last on Tuesday.

11
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:03,300
So few announcements. One, the first thing I put this in announcements, Peterson, he's doing our department seminar today at 330.

12
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,389
He will also be doing this is the abstract.

13
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:14,040
So today it's like I think it's kind of going to be fun and likes and not super happy, it sounded like from the abstract.

14
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:22,079
And then tomorrow at nine in speech, 1375545803, he's giving a more technical talk.

15
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,880
It looks like that specifically talking about Bayesian methods in breast cancer.

16
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:37,049
And so, again, he is super experienced, so much knowledge about clinical trials and statistics.

17
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:40,860
He's a great, entertaining person to go into your talk.

18
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,950
So another plug for his seminar today and tomorrow.

19
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:48,390
The other announcement that I also put because I've gotten several emails,

20
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:53,040
so please don't think that whatever is in your project grade right now is your final project.

21
00:02:53,040 --> 00:03:00,149
Great. So I haven't actually finished the grading. And then for whatever reason, Yellow Dick did push some grades over,

22
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:06,690
but they're not do like all of the due dates are correct in yellow digg and canvas it's all due the

23
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:11,850
13th so you have a few more days to complete your yellow Digg engagement and your peer reviews.

24
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:21,140
So anything in canvas right now is unfinished. All of the grades will be completed on the 14th when I have all of the information.

25
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:31,560
Okay, because I need all the peer reviews, all of the yellow Digg engagement, etc., etc., to give you all the project guides, any questions on grades.

26
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,750
So if you have any other questions on grades, you can email me.

27
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:41,370
But all the project stuff isn't going to be complete until next week.

28
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:49,920
Again. Input. I haven't checked the number who have done the teaching evaluations, but again, please complete the teaching evaluations.

29
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:59,870
Today is the last class. So just as it's fresh in your mind and before you get into finals and or leave, please do that.

30
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:05,130
The signings going around. I just love seeing all of your faces.

31
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:12,240
On Tuesday, when I asked you to come up here, everybody was like, Oh, those who are going today, right?

32
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,990
Had a lot more notice. And so we prepared a little bit more.

33
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:22,500
So we'll see how the discussion goes. But don't worry, it was didn't reflect poorly on whatever.

34
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:27,300
But it is, you know, you're probably not used to that having to necessarily speak up or being put on the spot.

35
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:32,759
But for any of you who are going into a job, that could definitely happen.

36
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:36,090
You work on a project, somebody shows up in your office, starts asking you questions.

37
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:43,139
It's good to know what you're talking about, right? So just thank you for being good players in that.

38
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:50,460
And again, this is all just to help us learn these few designs that we have left that we weren't able to spend more time talking about.

39
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:55,530
With that said, let's move on to Project four.

40
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,880
So these groups, these individuals here, if you want to come up.

41
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:04,200
We've got the seven and eight.

42
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,850
And this was about patient,

43
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:12,900
including patient preferences and clinical trials that is looking at four different treatments for chronic lower back pain.

44
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:19,469
And just as a reminder, this is a trial. So something like this trial is something I'm working on.

45
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:26,610
Currently is funded maybe two years ago and I did trial and when I was initially having the conversations,

46
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:30,659
the physicians were asking, how do we consider patient preferences?

47
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:42,480
Because we have four treatments, a drug, a like cognitive, a mindfulness based therapy, physical therapy and acupressure acupuncture.

48
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,380
Right. These are all four different, very different modes of interventions.

49
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:51,420
And people will have specific ideas about what they do or do not want to take.

50
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,840
And so this this project was built out of that.

51
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:59,730
This project ended up being a smart design, but I don't want to add to anything.

52
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:04,230
So this is just thinking about one stage of treatment for different modes of treatment.

53
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:07,620
What do we do if patients have specific preferences?

54
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:18,420
And so I think I don't know if you all got to watch the other video, but you had you both did a great job presenting similar designs.

55
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:23,160
Right. What were some of the designs that you talked about that took into account patient preferences?

56
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:29,270
The one we incorporated was the episode that strikes me.

57
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:32,700
We also talked about munitions,

58
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:42,629
toys and different romanization techniques that like incorporating both a little bit of right opposition and yeah, so both groups.

59
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:47,970
Right decided to present primarily on something called an equipoise, randomized stratified design.

60
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:52,170
This is something that probably isn't used as much as it could be.

61
00:06:52,200 --> 00:07:00,060
I think there's one seminal paper about it and then several studies which have used it, but there's not that much literature.

62
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:02,670
I think as you all found, as you were looking into it,

63
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:12,330
I think the primary thing that differed between your projects were was the how you set up the sample size or what your primary hypothesis was.

64
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:17,750
And this wasn't super well defined in the in the description of the project.

65
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:24,210
Right. So you each interpreted it a different way. So group seven, which is this top group.

66
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:30,990
Yes, Greece. Your group. Right. How what was the what did you decide was your question of interest?

67
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:43,890
Or want to compare the VCR to the other three treatment because we found and this is our it has an advantage like cost or increment than others.

68
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,170
So why don't you tap the effectiveness of MSR? Yeah.

69
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:53,290
So, Ambassador, just as reminder is the mindfulness based stress or stress reduction and so.

70
00:07:53,320 --> 00:08:00,639
Right. You want to say how does that compare to the drug and to the acupuncture or acupressure versus the physical therapy?

71
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:04,000
Right. And then what did your your group do?

72
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:09,910
So we focus on this for three months and we did like six paralyzed tests.

73
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:16,900
Yeah. So. Right, yeah. You decided that there are four treatments and maybe we're interested in all pairwise comparisons.

74
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:21,549
So if you have, for example, three tests versus six tests, right.

75
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:24,610
What's one of the big repercussions of the design?

76
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:30,440
What would be a big difference? Anybody from the audience or you all?

77
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:36,620
Sample size. Sample size, right? Yeah. Right. So you have you have three tests versus six tests.

78
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,240
There's also a difference between counting for multiplicity versus not accounting for multiplicity.

79
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:46,729
Right. You all applied a bonferroni correction, I think, and you all did not.

80
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:50,770
Right or not. We have mentioned that there might be some like double comparisons, but.

81
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:59,990
Yes, right. Yeah, you've talked about it. And actually, you know, there's not a one answer for a should you account for multiplicity or not?

82
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:04,100
If you read the literature, you'll see that there's a lot of, you know,

83
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:11,389
somewhat controversy about what are what would count as multiplicity and or how important it is to account for etc.

84
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:14,720
So both were totally fine and you justified them.

85
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:22,639
So I think in either design your sample sizes were relatively high, right?

86
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:28,400
And you had like thousands of, of patients. And I think for most of the other groups, the sample size as well.

87
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,020
Of course, you have phase one designs, right?

88
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:36,559
Phase two, the sample sizes were smaller and when we talked in class, sample sizes were generally smaller when we were talking about designs.

89
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,240
And so I think several of you or some of you from the group said, oh my gosh, this isn't thousands.

90
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:48,530
Like, is this good? Are we doing the right thing? What do we do? So part of that is because we have these patient preferences, right?

91
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:55,999
And you're trying to account for different strata of some prefers what when would either you guys or

92
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:04,610
anyone else like when does this high sample size outweigh the the complete randomization design?

93
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:11,450
Like when would you use a patient preference design even if it involves thousands of participants versus saying, actually,

94
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:17,329
I'm just going to not include the preferences, I'm just going to do a randomized trial without considering preferences.

95
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:23,209
And maybe in that case, maybe somehow or maybe if I power it some other way, right?

96
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:30,440
I wouldn't need so many people when why would you use a patient preference design and why?

97
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:37,969
I guess that's my question. I think like someone that we notice noticed that is that it's like a very realistic thing to

98
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:43,100
account for and that people might have preferences that they don't want a specific treatment.

99
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:47,839
So if you did randomization, they wouldn't even enter in the study in the first place because they're like,

100
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:53,629
I'm not going to take medication or whatever, right? Or they would enter right and then not take it right.

101
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:58,730
Some issues with noncompliance. So there are some clear benefits for using this design in terms of being able

102
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:02,780
to incorporate people that wouldn't otherwise be able to be in the trial.

103
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:14,210
Right. And if you didn't include patient preferences but had your same hypotheses, would that have changed your sample size?

104
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:21,970
Yeah, right. And it did because you were counting in your sample size for these particular strata.

105
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:28,200
Right. So that kind of inflated the sample size. But the on the other hand.

106
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:34,680
Right. The downfall would be that then you would be excluding all these people under have potential issues with noncompliance.

107
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:43,770
Right. So the bias. So in almost all of your classes or any model, there's there is this massive bias variance tradeoff.

108
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,829
Right. This happens again in clinical trials.

109
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:54,510
And in terms of when we're thinking about these estimates, who we can generalize these to, how many people we can include, etc.

110
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:08,840
All right. So then so can you explain in case these people didn't watch again, like I keep saying, strata or equipoise strata.

111
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:20,940
Can someone explain what are the equipoise strata? So the main idea dying is when keep as many patients as we could in the study.

112
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,250
And then we also wanted to use the randomization.

113
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:30,000
So we designed some different strata and strata patients agreed to receive any of their treatment industry.

114
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:35,069
For example, there was only two treatments and you saw that being solved,

115
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:38,940
that strata and there are three strata that street treatment in South Australia

116
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,080
and there are social strata which patient agreed to all of that for treatment.

117
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:46,410
So we designed the strata and the presence.

118
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:51,480
Protest stage of each strata are based on privacy information from clinicians.

119
00:12:51,930 --> 00:13:00,090
So in history now we can use randomization so we can keep the minimization to increase the volatility of our design.

120
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:07,770
Great, great. Right. So we have these four treatments. Some people might say I'm I have equipoise where it all four treatments you grandma's

121
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:12,690
randomized me all for alternative life might say I don't want this particular treatment right.

122
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:18,120
They could be randomized to the three others and that could happen for any of the combinations of three treatments.

123
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:23,040
Right. Or they might just want to consider two of the treatments and could be randomized to any of those two.

124
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:34,120
Now what happens if you reject particular proportions of people and strata and then that doesn't happen in a trial.

125
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:36,790
What could be some potential issues?

126
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:49,980
I would say that in any influence our policies test because our sample size calculation is based on the percentage of each strategy based on that.

127
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:55,650
And if the percentage have changed, they might influence on another hypothesis test.

128
00:13:55,770 --> 00:14:01,919
Yeah, right. The power. It might change substantially because their sample size was based on the specific expected

129
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:06,360
proportions of individual and each shadow which you try to collect some preliminary data about.

130
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,540
But then you never know exactly what the people in the trial are going to do.

131
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:12,190
Right. And so for everyone, right?

132
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:20,280
All sample size calculations are handling all sample size calculations have all of these assumptions that we don't know are exactly true.

133
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:24,720
And that's why when we talk about sample size calculations, we said it might be better to do like a table, right?

134
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:30,500
Well, we expect the variance to be there, but what if it's larger or we expect the effect size to be less?

135
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:36,660
But what if it's smaller? Larger? Right. And similarly here, I didn't expect you to do multiple tables because it gets very.

136
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:42,389
There are a number of possibilities. It increases substantially.

137
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:48,750
Right. Because you had many, many strata and then you had all these per se comparisons.

138
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:54,170
But it's definitely something that once you're off just even a little bit, it can really affect your power.

139
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:57,629
So that's one real disadvantage with this design,

140
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:03,780
is that if you design it with some expectation and the actual proportions are quite different, there can be an issue.

141
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:10,709
Also, I think some of the maybe some of the comments under your videos had this as well.

142
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:15,600
So there were some strata where you didn't expect a lot of people right now.

143
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,319
What do you do in the actual study, in the actual clinical trial?

144
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:24,080
If you don't expect people in natural to do, if they come in and they're in that strata, do you say, no, no, thank you.

145
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:27,630
We don't want you in our trial or do you let them in? Like what happens?

146
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:35,100
What do you all think? So they might take a really small proportion of the population.

147
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,530
We just don't use the information.

148
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:49,800
If they take some proper approach and we can randomizing the alpha recruiting so we can still use them in accommodation, maybe two.

149
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,649
Yeah. So you're saying we don't we wouldn't exclude them, right.

150
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:58,530
So even if we didn't say they were going to be a large proportion, our sample size, we'd still allow these people in our trial.

151
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:02,129
Right. And still randomize them within whatever strata they're willing to be.

152
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:07,650
And perhaps we could find out that we were so wrong in our proportions of of expected strata.

153
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:10,770
Right. That that becomes much more prevalent than we previously had thought.

154
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:14,630
So we don't want to just, you know, even if beforehand we say we don't, you know,

155
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,750
we think maybe 1% or 2% of people are going to think this is an acceptable strata.

156
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:22,499
We don't want to then say, okay, so there are an exclusion criteria, right?

157
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:33,010
We still want to include them in the trial. The other thing I think that was commented on too was like, okay, so you have these strata, right?

158
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:38,800
People come into these strata, they're willing to be stratified, they're willing to be randomized to specific treatments.

159
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:45,280
Now, what happens if those strata of the people in each strata are super different?

160
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:51,040
It's. Can you still pool across strata.

161
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:56,229
Can use. You know what happens to any of the analytic methods that we use to analyze this data?

162
00:16:56,230 --> 00:17:04,750
Are they are they are there issues or. And he is a fine matter.

163
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,010
I think women are focused on the preference of the officials,

164
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:16,540
but I think there are able by design something like that so we can consider some other you'll see them too.

165
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,030
But that would be much more complicated.

166
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:23,950
So you're saying there could be a perhaps if we're worried about that, we might want to try a different design.

167
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:29,549
Is that okay? Different as in how like they're like,

168
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:39,540
what if all the people who say they are willing to be in this particular strata with these two treatments are old and have severe disease,

169
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:48,269
and all the people in this other strata are young and have, you know, very like, you know, new, less severe disease.

170
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:51,420
And in this strata, they're all former smokers.

171
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:56,460
Right. Like what if there's not a lot of overlap? Is that a problem?

172
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:05,010
Yeah. And for anybody out there.

173
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:14,030
I think it depends on what your question or what your generation to be.

174
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:22,620
I mean, if there 40% of older people in the whole population, they're younger people and there is also a 30 and 30.

175
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,659
That's how how the proportion is in a general population.

176
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:31,110
And that's how popular the property is in our strategy.

177
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:34,400
So if that's a thing, I don't think there is a profit there.

178
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,460
So it depends on what your generalization.

179
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:41,900
Yeah, I think it also depends on like the disease or the outcome that you're looking

180
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:46,520
at because for some it might just be like that or like if it's something,

181
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:50,120
anything or I don't know, you know. Yeah, well you can get it right.

182
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:54,860
And then in the analysis of any of it, you're actually pooling across strata.

183
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:58,310
Right. You're taking strata which have the either.

184
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:02,149
So in the analysis, I think you all presented right.

185
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:08,750
You said you would take any strata that had the same two treatments in your pairwise comparison.

186
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:14,270
Right. And then you could use those in a and you were kind of doing more like a, you know,

187
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:17,360
then you could use it in like a t test or a chi square test or something. Right.

188
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,679
But you could also, I think at the end of yours and maybe in yours too, you presented a model, right?

189
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:26,330
And that model can actually pull across all of the strata regardless of whether they share those two treatments or not.

190
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:34,910
Right. And so the design actually gains some power and or some not as big of an issue of having separate and strata,

191
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:39,470
because then you're going to combine people across different strata. So in two strata they might look quite different.

192
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:46,400
But once you put the strata together that share the same treatment, right, it might have a nice distribution of the characteristics of the individual.

193
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:54,440
So there is potential not as big of a deal as that as in a trial where you had like randomize to A versus

194
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:59,000
B and randomization went wrong and all the people in it are old and all the people in B are young.

195
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,950
Right. That would be a problem. But and here we have the strata that we're going to pool across the strata.

196
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:07,940
So it might not be a big issue. All right.

197
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:15,860
Um, how many of how many of you all have heard about ever incorporating patient preferences into trials?

198
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:21,890
Few of you feel right, but this is new. Did you know that this was a possibility?

199
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:26,050
Right. Isn't it interesting that this possibility and there are other designs, too, right?

200
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:32,510
Like you guys talked about other designs and I presented them the other day where you can ask people, do you have a preference or not?

201
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:37,819
And then you can either randomize them to allowing them to use their preference or not,

202
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:41,450
or you can give the preference people their preference versus not.

203
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:48,560
So would you ever use the equipoise stratified design in future clinical trials in the future?

204
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:52,910
What do you think? I think it's too complicated.

205
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:59,690
I think that what you noted before is there's only one paper that talks about it and

206
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:04,280
then there all there's a lot of papers that reference it and they say they used it,

207
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:07,670
but we can't really find like the details of that.

208
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:13,070
That's why it was like hard for us because they said they used it and they cited it, but they do it in detail.

209
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:18,860
And so I think that's maybe it's it feels more complicated because there's just not that much out there about it.

210
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:23,480
Yeah. So that yeah. I will use the equipoise stratified randomization.

211
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:27,960
Why. Consider the multiple trials. Yeah. Yes. You see each of you do.

212
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:33,139
If I received one for them. Yeah. It's definitely right. It's you can't use it in two arm trials.

213
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:38,570
Right. So it's only appropriate in multiple trials and it's really appropriate when there are multimodal treatments.

214
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:44,600
Right. Because that's when you start getting a lot more of these, the very strong preferences.

215
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:52,130
And so you have to have this tradeoff of generalizability versus, you know, potential bias, I guess, in there.

216
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:58,160
But it also shows you maybe that there's room for improvement on this design and or methods.

217
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,430
Right, because there's not a lot of papers out there about it.

218
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:06,169
And it also shows you that sometimes when people use designs,

219
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:10,579
they still don't write their article well enough about how what they did and how they did it.

220
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:15,560
Right. So there are a bunch of trials that use equipoise stratified design, but yet you could still couldn't figure out what they were doing.

221
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:23,360
And so that's an issue with just like as you saw, some of you saw that homework of match, the sample size and you couldn't write.

222
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:30,520
It's an issue with publication. All right. Anything any questions about patient preferences, own scripts.

223
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:38,110
So so yeah, I know. I know you asked them about the the negative impacts about mis estimating that.

224
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:45,740
Yeah. Or mis guessing the the percentages strata. So I haven't watched the other group, but at least how, how age explained there and his group.

225
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:51,500
You guys just picked the you guys generated a sample size for every single comparison and you

226
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:55,430
just use the sample size from the comparison that required the largest number of patients.

227
00:22:55,430 --> 00:23:04,430
Right. So what do you think at least singer design went into it only matter the the it matters that you get the percentages for the,

228
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:09,379
like the most unbalanced or like most imbalanced group.

229
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:21,380
Right. Yeah. What are your you guys are assuming I was still way used before on the correction so actually we can also we

230
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:33,319
currently use the average like for our our a comparison we offered them same type of error rates but actually

231
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:46,969
we can generate a little better and I see often like the treatment with other ratio is the least correlation

232
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:56,270
the more a large value of our also we can somehow decrease expected some slides a little bit above.

233
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:04,400
We just use the average length because we assume you mentioned that the.

234
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:14,950
Expectation of the shot throughout time is might be different from what we are using to calculate the sample size.

235
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:21,940
So we just leave some space for the inflation of the sample size so we can.

236
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:43,140
So I can deal with stuff. Do is the difference of the strong tone from factor showing and a real case.

237
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,930
Yeah. So right as you're saying,

238
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:53,280
they they're doing all these pairwise comparisons and then they chose they use a bonferroni correction rate of six Perez comparisons.

239
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,999
And within those you're taking into account how many you expect in the strata.

240
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:03,720
And then you chose the sample size which was the largest out of work required largest out of all of those Perez comparison.

241
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:07,120
So you have some room one because right.

242
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:10,679
That comparison ended up only using some of the strata.

243
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,469
So as you say, right, you could be wrong on some of the other ones,

244
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:19,350
but as long as your okay on those ones used for your the ones that led to the larger sample size, perhaps you're fine.

245
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:25,079
You also have room for error because you're using a bonferroni correction, which we know is conservative, right?

246
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:30,090
Because it assumes independent tests and you know that you're using the same data, same outcome rates in people.

247
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:37,169
These are not independent tests. So it might not be as bad that you could power on these specific proportions,

248
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:41,460
get very different ones, but you might still have power for all of your procedures.

249
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:49,290
EX Yes. Any other questions about patient preferences?

250
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:59,879
All right. Great job. All right.

251
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:04,320
So we're going to move on to Project two, the factorial design.

252
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:25,399
It's going to be opioid misuse. All right.

253
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:31,700
So we're in for it. Actually, if you watch both of these videos, they were, I would say, out of all the projects.

254
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,030
So you're two groups. Oh, oh, oh.

255
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:40,120
It's a hand-waving thing now. So it's okay if you stay on there, you're going to open.

256
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:46,490
Sorry. I thought you were having a special guest, as it were.

257
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:53,510
So. So you all had very similar presentations in terms of.

258
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:58,880
Right. The hypothesis, the sample size. I think the sample size matched exactly between your two groups.

259
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:04,640
Very good, you know, descriptions of what the project were, etc.

260
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:15,620
Can somebody briefly remind everyone else would a factorial design is about field design is a type of

261
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:22,790
design that allows you to compare what what are the functions of the streets and their balance designs.

262
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:30,349
So like every like combination of treatment has like the same number of patients on it, right?

263
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:33,410
And yours in particular was a two by two factorial. Right.

264
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:40,790
And I think maybe one of the questions left and some of you address this,

265
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:45,409
but just asking you to get in here so you have a two by two factorial, right?

266
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:50,120
So you're randomizing equal number of patients. So like one of four cells of the combinations of each of these.

267
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:53,240
Right. Two treatments and two factors.

268
00:27:53,600 --> 00:28:05,450
How does that design differ from just a forearm trial where you would have randomization to one of these four treatment combinations?

269
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:13,250
Does it or does it not? Yeah, I think the main difference is that this kind of two by two design in this two by two design,

270
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:18,110
we can consider the interaction effect of the two factors,

271
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:26,809
but the for desire we can only take like every level or say every factor as one single thing.

272
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:30,320
Now the interaction, we cannot consider the interaction.

273
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:37,879
So why can't you consider the interaction if you randomize to like placebo a, b, an A-plus?

274
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:46,610
B, sorry, you mean that two by two design or like could that just be a form trial?

275
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:50,929
You randomized to nothing only b only a plus.

276
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:59,270
B I did that just before on trial. I suppose you could, but the factorial trial is preferred because it's a lot more efficient than doing that.

277
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:07,730
So in our trial or in our design, you get to average over all the conditions rather than just an individual condition.

278
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:12,319
So it's a lot more efficient with kind of the same number of people.

279
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:22,010
You get to include more people in that analysis and it's not going to be as kind of bloated as a forearm asked, analyzing those interactions with you.

280
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:28,000
Right. So from a design standpoint, a on trial versus a two by two factorial right.

281
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:32,480
Look different, right? But to a patient, would they look different?

282
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:39,040
No, you wouldn't. You would have no right, because you just be getting one of those options.

283
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:43,510
Right. But there would be like less people on the two by two because you designed it differently.

284
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,290
Right.

285
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:59,170
Um, let's see, what about you talked about that this design was balanced so that there are the same number of individuals in each of these cells.

286
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:04,660
Would you ever would it, could you ever have an imbalance factorial design?

287
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:12,070
Like, would it ever be that you would decide to have less people, say, on like placebo and you would randomize like 1 to 2 to 2 to 2?

288
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:15,880
Could you do that? Does that exist or is that not a good idea?

289
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:26,740
I think it can be done, but we didn't look into it too much because the map or that type of design just gets like exponentially more complicated.

290
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,820
Yeah, right. What do we know about when we start having in in equal numbers across treatment groups?

291
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:40,329
Yeah, right. It can affect the power. We know that it's most efficient to do equal randomization.

292
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:45,520
Right. So that's why that's why it does it there. But you could you could on an equal right.

293
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:49,870
And it's you all are well equipped to handle all of that math right after this program.

294
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:54,460
So you could do it. Maybe not. Maybe not in the period of this project.

295
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:58,480
Okay. So rethink that reasoning. All of you could do it.

296
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:00,970
It is important that you don't.

297
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:08,140
So it's important to know that when you get approached to do a trial, that you design a trial you know how to do or you feel comfortable doing right,

298
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:15,730
or you could feel comfortable doing, but you don't necessarily weed out really good designs because they seem too complicated.

299
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:19,390
However, if you actually have to do it, you need to know that you're doing it well, right?

300
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:24,280
So it does have to come into play a little bit, but there's always opportunity to to learn.

301
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:30,639
All right.

302
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:38,890
So you do you want to talk a little bit about what the interventions were like, what the disease setting was for everyone here and just remind us.

303
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:46,240
Yeah. So there are two interventions, one at intake and one post in 30 days post and take follow up.

304
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:57,040
So at and take the treatment was like a health coach and then the control was like a standard of care.

305
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:59,650
I think it's called like a brochure is a brochure, right?

306
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:09,160
So they were randomized to one of those two and then post intake, it was like an online portal as a treatment and another brochure as a control.

307
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:16,149
And then the outcome was opioid misuse and the target population was at risk.

308
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:24,340
Adolescents and young adults. Are there questions about factorial designs for these groups?

309
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:28,020
Yeah,

310
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:35,860
I think he does mainly focus on Interaction VI and he also mentioned that it can increase its efficiency when you're not looking interaction as well.

311
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:40,240
So I mean, this is the only one of your groups that you're inspired by.

312
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,530
What is the consideration?

313
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:47,500
I mean, if you have two treatments, whether you use a factorial design or that you separate arms and you're not interested in the interaction,

314
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,769
if you're not interested in the interaction,

315
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:56,830
then I think you would definitely want to go for a factorial because you know you're going to get that gain in efficiency.

316
00:32:57,190 --> 00:33:05,770
It's just like this is something that's used often in agriculture and like engineering, but not like super common and clinical trials.

317
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:09,960
Yeah. So is there, like, any reason not to do it? I think it's just, like, not common enough.

318
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:16,510
And the other thing is too, that some interactions aren't possible, like especially with drugs, like you can't interact chemically, some things.

319
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:19,389
So if you're considering interactions, you can't really do that.

320
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:25,530
And that's where you get loss of efficiency, because if you drop one of your combinations that doesn't really have an efficiency like you want,

321
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,420
if you kept the complete case like that as well. Okay.

322
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:37,540
Yeah, there is on my slides from the other day, there is these certain assumptions you need in order to run one of these factorial designs.

323
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:40,810
And so you have to be you have to be able to do the combination, right?

324
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:44,860
And you have to be somewhat interested, even if it's not your primary interest.

325
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:53,350
So for four factorial designs, usually your primary interest is not in the interaction because then it would require you are participants.

326
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:59,139
But if you're interested in seeing what that estimate is,

327
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:06,370
but primarily interested in the two factors by themselves that difference, then you have a huge power gain, in fact real designs.

328
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:11,320
So I wouldn't say that they're uncommon. Maybe they're not used as much as they could be.

329
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:17,020
I've been involved with at least two factorial designs my ten years here.

330
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:21,129
Maybe I don't know if that's common or not, but I've definitely been.

331
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:28,570
So this was a real factorial design that is funded that I'm working on currently that's accruing patients.

332
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:35,140
So it does exist, but you have to be able to have the factor and know factor, right?

333
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:44,200
And in two or more treatment levels or interventions and then you have to be able to combine them, which isn't always possible.

334
00:34:46,610 --> 00:35:00,040
Are there other questions about factorial design? So what did you what's something that you all learned about factorial designs that

335
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:04,360
you didn't previously know or was different from the rest of the class that we did?

336
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:12,109
I think for me it was a it took me a while to kind of grasped the whole efficiency aspect

337
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:17,330
of it and why it was more efficient than doing like a four hour randomized trial.

338
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:21,530
I've never seen anybody else.

339
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:26,480
I learned that, like how you cope, the variables is very important.

340
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:34,940
Oh, yes. So like in a factorial with two levels, these affects coding where like if you don't have it, you're negative one.

341
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:41,000
And if you do have it, you're a positive one. So that it translates to just like an elbow that we will use.

342
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:47,089
And I think part of the reason that the SAS macros used in the our package they

343
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:51,559
use might be different is because the our package can handle more than two levels.

344
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:57,320
And so that coding might be different and that might be why the models entirely parameters different.

345
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:08,750
Right. So how many of you if you had a binary variable, how many of you would use dummy right off the bat?

346
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:11,900
Right. That's like that's what we learned in school.

347
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:16,009
Right. And for most of biostatistics, I think for most of this program,

348
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:22,100
you could go through thinking that's like the only way to decode a binary data about a binary variable.

349
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:27,560
Right. But if you watch these presentations, both of them nicely explain effects coding.

350
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:35,390
Right. There are different ways to code binary data, one of which is that one of the levels equals one and one equals negative one.

351
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:43,960
Right? So that they add up to zero. But is a different way of coding that can right you just when you look at the equation,

352
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,100
you'll see how if you put those levels in, how you can get the different estimates for the different groups.

353
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:54,830
But it's just it sort of is more intuitive in some settings, right,

354
00:36:54,830 --> 00:37:03,440
to use this type of coding and there are other types of coding exist as well, but primarily and biased out.

355
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:10,070
We always learn dummy coding and almost always use it, but just know that sometimes it's not the best way to move forward.

356
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:15,620
And actually if you took like a start class in social science like psychology or something,

357
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:21,380
you'd probably automatically learn effects coding, contrast coding as opposed to coding.

358
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,210
Yeah, just coding it differently. Change assessments. No.

359
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:31,670
So you'd still get the same estimates, right. The mean estimates for each treatment.

360
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:35,840
But you're it just changes the way in which you derive them.

361
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:41,329
Yeah, but that would be bad, right. The type of coding change your estimate.

362
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:41,989
That would be bad.

363
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:47,300
You wouldn't want to use that coding if all of a sudden you change your coding and now you get different answers that something went wrong.

364
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:53,990
Um, it's not good coding, so it makes sure that you do check that if you're going to play with the coding.

365
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:59,680
All right. Anything else? All right, let's clap it out for you.

366
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:11,800
All right. So we're going to go on to Project five, which is a smart, smart design.

367
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:23,110
So these are groups nine and ten, that sort of thing.

368
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:26,140
In the beginning. At the end.

369
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:31,990
Yeah. So, yeah, it looks like this is, you know, did.

370
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:44,650
All right. So the first thing what what a smart stand for on the smart is is sequential adaptive recognized.

371
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:51,380
I think the call. You forgot the end. Yeah.

372
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:54,580
All right. Sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial.

373
00:38:54,850 --> 00:39:00,370
Smart design. Yes. And so smart is actually related to a factorial design.

374
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:06,250
Can anyone explain to me how a smart is related to a factorial shape?

375
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:14,900
Let just talk about that real time that we have to adapt to that issue.

376
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:21,760
It's going to be one minute. Oh, you could code like you could use effects coding.

377
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:26,180
Yes. But how are the factorial designs?

378
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:36,500
So not thinking about the analysis but the designs of factorial design in a smart similar is it after treatment or non-response or response done?

379
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:41,989
So in factorial designs we do not necessarily write.

380
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:46,630
The outcome could be binary. It could be continuous. You don't take into account responder sadness.

381
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:50,659
We're interested in the interaction of the treatment. Right. So you could be interested.

382
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:54,770
Both factorial designs and smart designs can look at interactions of treatments.

383
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:59,420
And in fact, smart designs are what we call sequential factorial designs.

384
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:05,240
So factorial designs would be looking at like two levels of a treatment by two levels of a treatment.

385
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:08,230
Right. And you could have four different options in a smart design.

386
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:14,000
You could have two levels of treatment and two levels of treatment, and you'd be looking at them in sequence instead of all together at one time.

387
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:22,190
You can say, Well, what if we got A followed by B, right? What if we got a followed by not a what have we got B followed by A?

388
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:33,130
So a smart design is is related because it's a you can think of it as a factorial in sequence first thing, which isn't actually really a smart design.

389
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:40,280
I'm just curious to everyone's reaction. So you all what was the disease setting for you and your aid?

390
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,670
Was that stand for alcohol use disorder?

391
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:46,130
That's right. Alcohol use disorder. Okay.

392
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:52,430
And do you remember what the definition of alcohol use disorder was actually really, really hard to find one.

393
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:58,250
Yeah, because the DSM five, which is like the psychiatric manual, has so many different like moderate drinking,

394
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:04,090
heavy drinking, stratified by gender, like days of the week, number of drinks per day, drinks per month.

395
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:09,020
Yeah. So odds of complicated and trying to figure out what it is.

396
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:12,620
But I think both of you used a similar definition. Do you remember what it was?

397
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:20,890
I think what defines us whole, like drinking per week or per day for both men and women.

398
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:26,360
Yes. And it differs for men and women. So for women, it was eight or more drinks a week.

399
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:30,850
I think for men it was 15 or more drinks. Yeah.

400
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:39,310
I also thought that apparently men can handle seven more drinks before they're considered to be have an alcohol use disorder,

401
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:43,000
which I found interesting. General.

402
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,780
General feelings about that definition. Right.

403
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:52,030
Why is this gender based? Wouldn't it be more appropriate to be like, weak face or something?

404
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:59,409
And. Yeah, isn't that. Yeah. But that their definition was totally right.

405
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:04,000
That's what they do. But I just, I, I know and I, this is a real thing I worked on as well.

406
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,480
This is a real trial that's, that's accruing.

407
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:13,480
And I was also like, that is a large difference. It's like they think all women are five feet tall.

408
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:18,810
And I really didn't understand the difference there.

409
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:26,140
Oh, so you have you have the smart design, right?

410
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:31,800
And you had different treatments and you're interested in potentially how they interact in terms of how they interact in sequence.

411
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:32,110
Right.

412
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:40,390
So you can give something initially and then you see if they respond or not and then you can re randomize participants to a subsequent treatment.

413
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:51,819
Now in a smart right, you have people that maybe get a and respond and then get B or they get A and they don't respond and get C, right.

414
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:57,360
Or they get B and they respond and maybe they get A or B and they respond and maybe get C, right.

415
00:42:57,370 --> 00:43:05,230
Can you actually just compare like A, respond B versus B or not respond C?

416
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:16,699
Could you compare those pathways in a smart design? Are you a, b, c?

417
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:23,010
They are different in that in treatment. So. So first you get A and if you respond, you get C.

418
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:32,090
Can you can you compare that to like first you get B and you don't respond and you get C, and you know what?

419
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:41,060
Yeah. When they're not in the same randomization block I think, and there could be a balance.

420
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:45,919
Yeah. So, so they these these are called pathways.

421
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:50,870
Right. Which differ from what many of you talked about in your in your presentation,

422
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:56,510
that they're what our primary interested in smarts is what we call adaptive interventions or dynamic treatment regimes.

423
00:43:56,780 --> 00:44:02,150
And they always include two pathways. They include the people who respond and the people that don't respond.

424
00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:09,250
Because once we start just thinking about pathways, you get a you respond, you get this thing, you get B don't respond.

425
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:13,940
You get this thing right. Response All of a sudden, is this like confounder?

426
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:19,759
It's actually called a collider in this pathway of interest.

427
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:27,650
And so your treatment, A right affected or B affected response, which then affects your next treatment, which then affects your outcome.

428
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:34,190
Right? And so you have this issue of that. You can't you can't just say, well, a response.

429
00:44:34,430 --> 00:44:40,610
B, right. That's not going to be a very similar group, potentially characteristics for B, nonresponse.

430
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:44,540
C Right. You have very different response versus non-response happening.

431
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:45,770
And so you can't just say,

432
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:50,870
let's just take these pathways and compare their outcome because there's something very different happening in the middle, right?

433
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:56,060
So you have to be very careful about that. And so we have to instead, right?

434
00:44:56,060 --> 00:45:00,450
Our interest might be in comparing like what was your primary hypothesis?

435
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:14,330
Do you remember? The Smart design for Nonresponders if the enhanced treatment heated engagement are better than the ATM CBT.

436
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:21,130
Step up intervention so is like among all the non responders.

437
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:24,640
Those are two stage to intervention.

438
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:27,760
And which one is better? Yeah. So among all the non-responders,

439
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:37,360
is it better to like do a little bit more of what you first got or or switch right or add on something else to see what you first got.

440
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:45,040
And so if we if we, we can say, well, given response right now, we can compare these strategies.

441
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:48,680
And then another your secondary aim, right?

442
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:53,379
What was that one do you remember? It was really the first.

443
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:58,570
It was really the first objective. But it wasn't. It was you're not what you powered on the first one.

444
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:07,810
I think the aim one in the trial is that compare the effectiveness of to first see first stage intervention.

445
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:13,540
Yeah so on a smart if you remember the picture there's all this like branching it's randomized to initial

446
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:18,190
treatment and then re randomized not responding to the subsequent treatment and the responders would continue.

447
00:46:18,550 --> 00:46:25,020
So you would power on this non responder question but you might also be interested in what what's the best thing to start with.

448
00:46:25,030 --> 00:46:27,310
Right. And you could average over the rest of it.

449
00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:35,380
Now why would you power on the non responder question versus just the first stage question if that was like your first time?

450
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:42,880
Why might you power on the non-responders and not just the comparison of the first stage treatments?

451
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:45,280
I feel like for this trial,

452
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:56,320
the first thing come into our mind is because the first stage response rate is very low and we are more interested in like among those now responders,

453
00:46:56,320 --> 00:47:00,880
how we can better help them. So we power for this AIM tool, which, as I said,

454
00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:07,960
like the first target to powerful this non-responders and see the sequential like interventions

455
00:47:08,290 --> 00:47:15,130
which one is can be better like helped them helpful to them and to that we probably want to.

456
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:22,920
Based on the sample size we calculated and see if all the power we got for the first AME like

457
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:30,610
the first stage interventions are large enough to also support the first stage target or aim.

458
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:31,680
Yeah. Right.

459
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:37,589
So you you powered on this comparison of the non-responders and then when you went back to look at the power between the first stage treatments,

460
00:47:37,590 --> 00:47:40,760
what did you find? Did you have enough power? Yeah.

461
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:44,250
Yeah. Right. By by powering on the second stage treatment,

462
00:47:44,550 --> 00:47:49,770
you are basically inflating the sample size so that you would have enough power for the first stage comparison.

463
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:55,469
So again, kind of similar to the equipoise stratified design where you might look across

464
00:47:55,470 --> 00:48:00,060
multiple hypotheses of interest and then you choose the largest sample size,

465
00:48:00,070 --> 00:48:06,570
right? That would be one way to go for the power trial to make sure that you have enough power to answer multiple questions.

466
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:10,710
Okay. So a sequential, multiple time, a randomized trial.

467
00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:17,730
This means that you have sequential randomization right down to randomization in sequence in order to be a smart.

468
00:48:18,210 --> 00:48:23,970
Now, here's a question for the groups and for everybody thinking about the randomization in practice,

469
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:29,370
do you when a patient comes in, do you randomize that patient?

470
00:48:30,270 --> 00:48:35,400
Right now, they're just starting the trial to what they get first and what they could get second.

471
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:42,810
Or do you randomize them to what you get first and then later when they're ready to figure out what second do you randomize them then?

472
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:47,210
So do you do the randomization in sequence or do you do the randomization upfront?

473
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:53,810
What would be your reasons for? Let me ask this a different way. What would be a reason for why you would do this randomization upfront?

474
00:48:55,330 --> 00:48:59,860
Could you do it? Could you do randomization up front? And what and what would be some reasons to do it?

475
00:49:00,130 --> 00:49:04,340
Who thinks you could do randomization upfront? Right.

476
00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:08,750
The thing is, you can't just randomize to like you don't randomize the response.

477
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:14,989
Right. That's that's given. So you would randomize the person to like you get a and if you respond, you get B and if you don't, you get C, right?

478
00:49:14,990 --> 00:49:18,170
You randomize them to the adaptive intervention that they follow.

479
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:26,230
Right. So why why would you do that randomize upfront what would be a benefit of randomizing them upfront?

480
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:35,040
Usually having more equal balance across your. So you get more equal balance at least across the initial baseline characteristics.

481
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:39,330
Right. But you could you would have that if you randomize them separately to the like.

482
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:42,239
The first outcome is influence.

483
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:52,620
Your decision later in might give you a bias if you're random done after like if the patient response like using is better to.

484
00:49:53,530 --> 00:50:01,960
I mean, like the first, if you're randomized after some outcomes come down, your decision might bias a little bit.

485
00:50:03,010 --> 00:50:04,240
Yeah. Should it. Right.

486
00:50:04,270 --> 00:50:11,349
Because like you, if you see that they're non responder and that's where the randomization is, hopefully you just do what the randomization says.

487
00:50:11,350 --> 00:50:16,480
But I guess there's a possibility that maybe you see their response as you randomize them and then you ignore it.

488
00:50:16,870 --> 00:50:22,600
It'd be like terribly unethical, right? But I guess it could have been more that way sequentially than otherwise.

489
00:50:24,030 --> 00:50:29,790
Other reasons why you would do that. Yeah, they might go by faster.

490
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:34,770
Like if somebody comes and shows response, they could be randomized in the next room immediately.

491
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:41,609
Totally logistical reasons, right? So if you randomize them once upfront, you don't have to worry about getting that response.

492
00:50:41,610 --> 00:50:44,970
Got it. And redoing the randomization. Right. You adjust.

493
00:50:45,210 --> 00:50:48,510
You already know what they're going to get as soon as you get that response to say, okay,

494
00:50:48,510 --> 00:50:52,070
here it is, you have to like feed it back into something and get the randomization frequency.

495
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:58,320
Anything else I was going to say? Yeah. So primarily the reason why you would do this upfront randomization would be logistical.

496
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:06,540
It is be something feasible and make it faster. You wouldn't have to wait for a lag for the randomization designation.

497
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:11,010
Now why would you not want to randomize upfront but randomize sequentially?

498
00:51:11,010 --> 00:51:13,229
What would be the reasons why you would say, okay, well,

499
00:51:13,230 --> 00:51:18,030
I'm going to randomize you to A or B first and I'm going to wait to see if your spot and then randomize between B and C.

500
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:22,530
If you're a non responder, you're like highly unequal arms.

501
00:51:23,010 --> 00:51:33,389
Yeah, right. It could be that while we know we'll be balanced in A versus B, regardless of whether we randomize upfront or not, what if, you know,

502
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:41,520
then people drop out with specific characteristics and more of those people that dropped out were upfront randomized to C versus D, right?

503
00:51:42,210 --> 00:51:48,900
You're going to all of a sudden not have a lot of people on C, but if at the time of randomization you apply the randomization,

504
00:51:49,230 --> 00:51:53,150
right, anybody who dropped out or dropped out and you're randomizing those who are there.

505
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:58,140
And so you can ensure balance across those characteristics in that second randomization.

506
00:51:58,650 --> 00:52:07,740
Right. So there is there is a tradeoff between the logistical feasibility quickness of the trial versus the potential for bias.

507
00:52:08,490 --> 00:52:11,760
Okay. And so again, it's something you have to talk about with investigators.

508
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,589
Yeah, it could also be like, say,

509
00:52:13,590 --> 00:52:21,629
like ALM c or something that there's like an efficacy stop or like a toxicity events like where you're not even using this arm anymore for sure.

510
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:25,680
If you have some sort of interim analysis where you could drop arms or something,

511
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:32,759
that it wouldn't make sense to do that upfront because you wouldn't want to not have some subsequent treatment to give these people.

512
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:38,459
Yeah, so you'd have to like if you did that and then you decided maybe, maybe it's not even an interim analysis.

513
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:43,140
It's like a DSM-V, right? Maybe that's what you're thinking. Like a DSM says, Oh, my gosh, this isn't safe.

514
00:52:43,470 --> 00:52:51,180
Shut that down. Or you'd have to rebrand myself for sure. And so in that case, maybe it just makes more sense to sequentially randomize.

515
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:04,710
Any questions about smart design for these groups?

516
00:53:05,130 --> 00:53:08,610
Yeah, I have a question on the. We actually have different analyzes.

517
00:53:08,670 --> 00:53:10,240
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

518
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:18,000
Actually, the biggest the biggest difference between your group with different analytic plans, I think also you had massively different sample sizes.

519
00:53:18,390 --> 00:53:22,470
Did you see that? Yeah. Yeah. What was the sample size for your group?

520
00:53:23,010 --> 00:53:26,820
I think two for you or something. Yeah. What was the sample size for your group? Six numbers.

521
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:30,330
Yeah, it was like 240 versus 670.

522
00:53:30,690 --> 00:53:34,200
There are very, very different. Do. Do you know why they were different?

523
00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:39,460
Because we focus on different options. Yeah.

524
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:41,670
What did you what was your outcome?

525
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:53,520
We focus on the real one and they focus on but they actually choose the maximum sample size they get from continuous.

526
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:59,489
And finally we just take it to the other. Yeah, we did.

527
00:53:59,490 --> 00:54:02,940
It continues in a binary outcome and then we picked the maximum sample size.

528
00:54:03,930 --> 00:54:08,980
So that one we just had different parameters I think. Yeah. Because you actually you had like co-primary endpoints didn't you.

529
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:13,300
One was, was it, was it worded like that one was binary and one was continuous?

530
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:17,180
Yes. Yeah. And so did you watch each other's like do you know,

531
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:27,420
I actually I tried to repeat introduce the error outcome that seems like the the Argo they use probably they use one sided test.

532
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:36,510
I'm not sure. I just try to. Yeah. And also our like for assumptions of the like effect of size and everything's different.

533
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:40,079
So it's interesting. That's probably be the. Yeah. So I think.

534
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:44,430
Right. Maybe in your description it wasn't well defined wasn't it wasn't the effect size.

535
00:54:44,430 --> 00:54:47,909
Not well-defined. You all know the right. Yeah. Yeah.

536
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:51,030
And then I sent it to you, but I think you had already done your project. Yeah.

537
00:54:52,830 --> 00:54:59,069
So I think that was one of the reasons the fact size is very important in a sample size calculation.

538
00:54:59,070 --> 00:55:02,070
So if you have different effect sizes, you will get very different sample sizes.

539
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:10,910
And then we're using the analytic plan was also different for just the sample size for NGS that we in the lab to complain is actually so different.

540
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:15,659
Oh yeah. So then there's a right. So you had to aim one which was compare the initial treatments.

541
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:15,890
Right.

542
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:25,410
What, what, how does the outcome differ based on which treatments you start with and your aim to was what's the best strategy for non-responders.

543
00:55:25,650 --> 00:55:32,220
And then your aim three was, well, there are certain groups for whom we think may benefit more from particular treatments.

544
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:37,440
Right. And so how did how did each group go about each of those?

545
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:47,490
They actually use two sided hypotheses, like we used the one side because we expect that we have better outcome.

546
00:55:47,490 --> 00:55:58,220
So, um, I think the issue is, it's like for the reason we used to decide because we think it's like a superiority test, you know,

547
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:04,230
if you want to test whether it's good or not, but you cannot tell the direction which one, which party is good is better.

548
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:07,799
Right. So we still use a two sided test for that. Yeah.

549
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:15,810
So primarily in clinical trials unless you're doing animal research and or maybe.

550
00:56:18,610 --> 00:56:22,959
Maybe mostly just animal research. Almost always we use two sided tests.

551
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:27,600
So even if we expect superiority, we're always going to say we expect this.

552
00:56:27,610 --> 00:56:30,640
However, we don't know. Right? It could be worse. It could be better.

553
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:36,820
And so we do almost always allow for a two sided test unless we're like super restrictive on sample size for some reason.

554
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:40,929
And often, like they're doing mouse studies, they'll use one side of tests.

555
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:49,150
But even now, usually reviewers don't like to see one side of the tests unless it's like a non-inferiority, right, or something, something like that.

556
00:56:50,470 --> 00:56:56,590
But yeah, there are these questions of heterogeneity of treatment effects and how do you deal with it.

557
00:56:56,590 --> 00:57:01,540
And actually this is much more complex than this class.

558
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:10,509
And what you learn, even I think, in your master's level courses is but how you would deal with a with subgroup treatment effects.

559
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:18,430
When you have treatments in sequence, you actually have to do specific regression that you've never learned, which you all touched on.

560
00:57:18,430 --> 00:57:27,010
It's called Q learning and it's backward regression because you have to account for the sequential nature of what you get first effects,

561
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:30,070
your response effects, what you get, second effects, your outcome.

562
00:57:30,310 --> 00:57:35,320
And so if you're now going to try to figure out what are the characteristics that are related to having the best outcome,

563
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:42,070
you actually have to start from the end and figure out what characteristics affects the second treatment to get that lead to the

564
00:57:42,070 --> 00:57:49,600
best outcome and then pretend that you got that best second treatment and and impute to your outcome if you didn't actually get it.

565
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:53,469
And now see what characteristics are related to the first treatment so that you

566
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:57,790
can figure out this entire treatment sequence that leads to the best treatment.

567
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:02,440
And so that. Q Learning is something that is specific to smart.

568
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:09,490
Well, specifically using smart design actually comes from like computer science, machine learning world.

569
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:16,460
So what's something you guys learned about smart designs that you didn't previously know?

570
00:58:18,030 --> 00:58:22,470
There are a lot more accessible than I thought they were at first because as you look at the graph of what is going on.

571
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:28,379
Yeah. So it's easier to not say that it is easy, but.

572
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:32,580
Yeah. But you could handle it. Yes. What do you all think?

573
00:58:32,730 --> 00:58:34,830
And any other comments about smart?

574
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:47,580
Smart design can can prevent a huge loss of a lot, because if some person has, they just don't respond can take the next step.

575
00:58:48,570 --> 00:58:51,930
Yeah, that's one of the main arguments for using a smart design.

576
00:58:51,930 --> 00:58:56,500
So primarily if you want to use a smart sign, you should say I'm really interested in these treatment sequences, right?

577
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:57,840
These Taylor treatment sequences.

578
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:06,870
But also a lot of people say and and using a smart we're likely to have better follow up right or less loss of follow up because we're saying oh,

579
00:59:06,870 --> 00:59:12,059
if you don't respond, here's something else, right? Instead of in a regular term trial, we say, oh, you didn't.

580
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:18,209
We're sorry, I'm sorry. Can you just please give me your outcome at the end of this reason and right, you go do whatever you need to do.

581
00:59:18,210 --> 00:59:26,670
But let me just get your your information. And so that is one of the arguments that smart researchers use for using a smart design.

582
00:59:26,670 --> 00:59:33,479
Now, I will say it's a little unclear whether that's really true or not, like whether smarts actually have less loss to follow up or not.

583
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:40,620
That's to be decided from smarts in the field that no one has really talked about yet.

584
00:59:40,650 --> 00:59:45,980
But there was a seminal paper that said this is one of the reasons, and then it said and we'll try to explain it to you.

585
00:59:45,990 --> 00:59:49,890
So we're actually we don't have enough data, so we'll just say that this is one of the reasons why we should use this.

586
00:59:51,570 --> 00:59:55,080
And any other thoughts, any other questions about smart design?

587
00:59:56,900 --> 01:00:00,650
Would you ever consider implementing a smart design in the future? Yes.

588
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:04,400
Great. And made you smart researchers.

589
01:00:04,430 --> 01:00:08,030
Okay. All right. Let's talk about over project.

590
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:15,890
All right. The last one is Project three.

591
01:00:17,090 --> 01:00:45,560
That why it's designed? Okay.

592
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:53,960
So you all had Project three, which was a step wedge design for in what disease area delivery?

593
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:58,340
Yes. And do you remember what the intervention was?

594
01:01:00,190 --> 01:01:04,060
[INAUDIBLE]. Yeah, it was called help, right? Or family help.

595
01:01:04,090 --> 01:01:07,510
What? What? What was that? What does that mean? Is it a drug?

596
01:01:07,510 --> 01:01:11,220
Is it a therapy or. Do you remember, like, anything about it?

597
01:01:11,230 --> 01:01:16,180
What was it? It's kind of like a treatment plan that's more like holistic.

598
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:20,589
So there's, like, care by doctors and nurses in the help and then in the family help.

599
01:01:20,590 --> 01:01:24,249
They replace some of the nurses with family members instead. Yeah, right.

600
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:29,319
So this is about a lot of people, especially older individuals who come to the hospital for treatment.

601
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:34,500
They end up like after anesthesia. They might experience delirium.

602
01:01:34,510 --> 01:01:39,310
Right. Things are not as they things seem as they are not.

603
01:01:39,610 --> 01:01:43,990
Right. And so it's trying to figure out what's the best way to treat this.

604
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:49,420
And so they said there's this this type of treatment, right.

605
01:01:49,420 --> 01:01:57,570
Which involves nurses, physicians, doctors helping patients realize, you know, maybe it and or administering something, but generally.

606
01:01:57,580 --> 01:02:01,420
Right. Trying to help them with that versus getting family members involved.

607
01:02:01,420 --> 01:02:07,030
Right. And so the main the the standard of care is what family are not family.

608
01:02:07,660 --> 01:02:14,170
You're not family. Right. And then the the actual intervention that they're trying to say is like, well, what if we actually use family in this?

609
01:02:14,170 --> 01:02:19,630
Right. And so remind us again, what is a stepped wedge design?

610
01:02:21,550 --> 01:02:27,160
Why does a cluster minimize designs? So you have different sites like different hospitals who are implementing this,

611
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:34,930
and then those clusters get randomized to either the treatment and the randomization is for timing of the treatment.

612
01:02:34,930 --> 01:02:40,300
So everybody gets the control and everybody gets the the new treatment.

613
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:46,960
But it's just depending on when you get a new treatment so you can get it really early in the study or you can get it pretty late in the study.

614
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:50,950
And then we're looking longitudinally across and the reason it's called such,

615
01:02:50,950 --> 01:02:55,359
which is that like the actual figure of timing looks like a set of ones, right?

616
01:02:55,360 --> 01:03:01,720
Yeah. So the timing of when this think about think about a big table, right?

617
01:03:01,990 --> 01:03:07,870
And the timing of when each center, each cluster turns on this family help.

618
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:14,110
Right, steps down in time. Step one Some people go to step two, step three, step four, survive, etc.

619
01:03:18,890 --> 01:03:27,230
Why could this not be? Why could this family help or, you know, in implementing this or comparing it to regular help?

620
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:39,450
Why did that not be individually randomized? Why were they using a step wedge design instead of like a parallel individual parallel group design?

621
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:44,460
This patient gets family help, this patient gets regular help, etc.

622
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:53,319
Any ideas? I feel like it has to do with like the infrastructure because they were implementing this in hospitals that already had help.

623
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:58,060
So they already have this like program and they'll have people who know how this program was supposed to run.

624
01:03:58,090 --> 01:04:04,389
But if you're doing it individually, you have to get a whole team to train people to do the specific only help things.

625
01:04:04,390 --> 01:04:10,840
Whereas if you do a cluster, then it's like, All right, the hospitals are doing those things and it would just be a little bit easier logistically.

626
01:04:10,870 --> 01:04:15,399
Yeah, for sure. So a big reason for I use the stepwise design, right.

627
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:20,110
And this cluster randomization is because individual randomization doesn't make as much sense.

628
01:04:20,110 --> 01:04:24,579
It's maybe not feasible. There is possible contamination.

629
01:04:24,580 --> 01:04:28,659
Like imagine you're the nurse on duty, right?

630
01:04:28,660 --> 01:04:35,530
And you have all these patients that are eligible for this trial and all of a sudden you have to be like, okay, this this patient.

631
01:04:35,530 --> 01:04:38,620
I engage their family. Oh, this patient. I do not this patient. Right.

632
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:43,989
You could very well become confused as well as you're trying to keep this the same.

633
01:04:43,990 --> 01:04:47,200
Right. And accidentally do one thing the other way.

634
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:52,749
Right. There's a lot of room for what we call contamination if we use individual randomization.

635
01:04:52,750 --> 01:04:57,639
And so therefore this cluster randomization and then the stepped wedge piece

636
01:04:57,640 --> 01:05:02,620
comes in that maybe we can't train everybody on family health at the same time.

637
01:05:02,950 --> 01:05:07,450
And so therefore if we can do it over time, we can use the stepped wedge design.

638
01:05:08,290 --> 01:05:15,879
Now, you all actually had some very different your groups had different assumptions about your stuff.

639
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:17,980
It was design and if you got a chance to watch it.

640
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:25,030
So there's two main types of stuff which designs they could be closed cohort or they could be cross sectional.

641
01:05:25,930 --> 01:05:30,820
One group chose a close cohort design and one group chose a cross sectional design.

642
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:35,860
So remind us what is a closed cohort step to edge design?

643
01:05:36,430 --> 01:05:41,409
So close cohort is like you recruit patients at the beginning of the study and

644
01:05:41,410 --> 01:05:46,720
you continue follow up with those patient and compare them for each period.

645
01:05:47,140 --> 01:05:54,490
And a cross sectional is like you recruit different people at different periods and assign them to different treatment and then

646
01:05:55,390 --> 01:06:05,140
comparing them for like every time you are now comparing a longitudinal study or comparing a new patient for the same cluster.

647
01:06:05,470 --> 01:06:13,900
Yeah. So in a close cohort, right as it sounds, you have a cohort of patients and you watch them over the entire number of steps for that cluster.

648
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:20,139
Right. And then a cross-sectional design as it sounds, every new step you get new patients, right?

649
01:06:20,140 --> 01:06:23,799
So you're not interested in longitudinal measurements on people, right?

650
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:29,020
But you're taking longitudinal measurements on cluster which which has different people at each time.

651
01:06:29,350 --> 01:06:33,819
And so your group assume cross sectional step wedge design.

652
01:06:33,820 --> 01:06:43,990
Why did you do that? I think we have two main reasons. The first one was that the delirium is supposed to peak a few days after operation,

653
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:49,329
but our observation period for each time is about seven months and we thought that

654
01:06:49,330 --> 01:06:54,010
that's a bit too long to be observing the same group of people across the entire study.

655
01:06:54,580 --> 01:06:59,860
And then I think that's a good one.

656
01:06:59,860 --> 01:07:05,170
Yeah, that's a good one. Right. So the outcome was actually almost like immediately available, right?

657
01:07:05,380 --> 01:07:09,100
Patients get surgery generally they will experience if they're going to have delirium,

658
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:13,750
they'll experience it within hours, if not a day or two from surgery.

659
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:22,599
And so it's the each step is a month and or was each step seven months or each step was seven months.

660
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:28,179
Right. Then probably those patients have gone home right within seven months.

661
01:07:28,180 --> 01:07:34,000
And so they're now going to experience delirium. So it makes sense to keep looking at new patients and new patients and new patients over over time.

662
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:44,470
Right. I think both of the groups mentioned that there are kind of two main models used to analyze this data.

663
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:50,060
Do you remember what they were? Extreme form of extreme.

664
01:07:50,530 --> 01:07:57,430
Oh, those are correlation structures. Sure. But I think I think maybe let me wear this more specifically.

665
01:07:57,640 --> 01:08:03,670
So there are two types of models that you hopefully talk about in 653 where you can

666
01:08:03,670 --> 01:08:07,840
analyze not just longitudinal data because you might not have longitudinal data here.

667
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:12,580
Right. But you have hierarchical data right here. Your interest is in individual outcomes.

668
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:16,720
However, all the individuals are nested within each cluster, right?

669
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:24,400
Which then you also have step across time. So what are two main ways to account for this hierarchical data in modeling?

670
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:32,740
G And yeah, g right. Generalized estimating equations and glm generalized linear makes models gel and right.

671
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:37,330
Do you remember from 653 why you choose one over the other?

672
01:08:40,430 --> 01:08:52,540
Actually. You guys talk about that? Yeah. Like 653 Professor but it's like, it's all this, like a decision to.

673
01:08:52,940 --> 01:08:58,760
I'm lucky. Yes. The he would've preferred G then G on them.

674
01:08:59,300 --> 01:09:04,070
Yeah. So what's it mean. What's, what are you modeling in glamor.

675
01:09:04,070 --> 01:09:10,100
No you're not modeling in G. I think G is like a large.

676
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:16,940
Yeah. Population average marginal model is G. You are modeling unconditional.

677
01:09:17,030 --> 01:09:23,660
Oh yeah. What do you what are the actual things that you're modeling in jail that you don't model in G anybody.

678
01:09:24,710 --> 01:09:28,790
Yeah. Random effects, right. You have these random effects that you're modeling in jail. I'm right.

679
01:09:28,790 --> 01:09:33,559
You're not you don't model those. And because you have these random effects, you have to account for correlation structures.

680
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:37,190
Right. And G do. You don't have to do that.

681
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:40,549
Right. You have this like robust sandwich estimate.

682
01:09:40,550 --> 01:09:51,820
Ah, right. And I actually can help a bit in terms of assumptions, particularly if you're thinking about design and sample size and power, right?

683
01:09:51,850 --> 01:09:57,260
If you have this Gell-Mann that you're going to implement, you have to choose a correlation structure you want it to be.

684
01:09:59,890 --> 01:10:04,730
Somewhat robust to that, right? You make me these extra assumptions, whereas if you have a genie,

685
01:10:04,780 --> 01:10:10,510
you actually can have a few less assumptions and you know that you'll be robust to the core of the word and correlation matrix, etc.

686
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:15,220
And so that can come into play in terms of the power and sample size.

687
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:21,200
I think you both actually you also chose different outcomes.

688
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:25,340
Maybe like I think one group had a binary outcome and one group had a continuous outcome.

689
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:29,360
We held a closed battery, but you could have both.

690
01:10:31,490 --> 01:10:35,510
But yeah, I think a primary difference was a cohort versus a cross sectional.

691
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:40,910
And then I'm pretty sure both of you suggested G and or GLM or you put them up as options.

692
01:10:41,210 --> 01:10:47,420
Right. And what's one of the biggest things, one of the biggest issues in terms of modeling, step to edge design,

693
01:10:47,420 --> 01:10:52,309
but you have to make sure that you take into account confounding by confounding by time, right?

694
01:10:52,310 --> 01:10:56,000
So towards design, the time of the intervention differs, right?

695
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:05,450
Which can be an issue in terms of like everything else going on in the in the world affecting the treatment efficacy.

696
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:11,260
Right. It might be that maybe there are now new treatments that are also used that could help delirium.

697
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:19,940
Right. And so you have to make sure that you're accounting for this time difference of one treatments turn on in any stepped wedge design.

698
01:11:22,190 --> 01:11:25,940
Are there questions about step to edge design for groups up here.

699
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:36,139
Yes, sir. Was founding by time to kind of differ depending on close quarters cross-sectional

700
01:11:36,140 --> 01:11:41,120
or is it more of like the issue of like different patients at the time?

701
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:50,840
Does that mean. Yeah. So you think that the issue of confounding by time or accounting for confounding by time,

702
01:11:50,930 --> 01:11:56,480
does that differ for whether your design is a closed cohort design, whether it's a cross sectional design?

703
01:11:57,110 --> 01:12:00,260
Yeah, I think it's kind of different for a crossover.

704
01:12:00,410 --> 01:12:08,090
There is the top confounding at the top schools, like if you go from period one to period two that you received,

705
01:12:08,090 --> 01:12:13,249
the loss after treatment you receive is different that you need to account for that.

706
01:12:13,250 --> 01:12:22,430
But if it is a cross sectional, you don't need to account for it like the loss of treatment because a lot of them are getting one period of treatment.

707
01:12:23,090 --> 01:12:27,350
You just account for the time effect of different period.

708
01:12:27,410 --> 01:12:32,030
Maybe like the different period have different effect of treatment.

709
01:12:32,750 --> 01:12:38,329
Hmm. Yeah. So you're saying that there's a difference in terms of potentially what you're calling confounding by time and

710
01:12:38,330 --> 01:12:43,160
such that a confounding by time in a close cohort could be the length of time you're receiving the treatment.

711
01:12:43,700 --> 01:12:50,030
Right. And in cross-sectional confounding by time might be like, what period are you in?

712
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:53,750
Is this being collected in for which the intervention was given? Yes.

713
01:12:55,120 --> 01:13:00,819
Could also that also can matter right in the close cohort because different yet different clusters are still getting different.

714
01:13:00,820 --> 01:13:04,720
But there might be this extra additional length of treatment that the matter in close cohort.

715
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:12,510
Are there other questions. So would you.

716
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:17,340
Would you think about using a stepped wedge design in your future collaborations?

717
01:13:18,190 --> 01:13:25,900
No. No. Why not? Like at a first glimpse, I see all step designs can all feel good design.

718
01:13:26,490 --> 01:13:29,880
It's at last. Everyone can get a treatment.

719
01:13:30,150 --> 01:13:35,830
I will be great. But like, as in cross sectional, it doesn't happen that everyone gets treatment.

720
01:13:35,850 --> 01:13:38,960
It just every set gather treatments that of everyone.

721
01:13:38,970 --> 01:13:44,390
And as you model the girl goes deep into the modeling.

722
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:50,910
It's like I'm finding more and more stuff that needs to be adjust for and there is like more bias.

723
01:13:50,910 --> 01:14:00,510
And most of that confounding to the outcome that I was like as going into, I was less confident that I can really get the true outcome.

724
01:14:00,780 --> 01:14:05,040
Yeah, there's a lot of potential for bias right there, but I saw some nods.

725
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:08,909
Yes, I would consider stuff wedge. I think it wasn't so long.

726
01:14:08,910 --> 01:14:15,810
Like this particular trial was seven times six. So like a long like 42 months is a pretty long period of time for trial.

727
01:14:16,290 --> 01:14:20,790
But if it was a shorter trial observation window, I think it could be pretty efficient.

728
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:24,570
And like you said, like everybody gets if you do a close care, everyone would get the treatment.

729
01:14:24,730 --> 01:14:26,520
Yeah. And even when you don't do a close to it.

730
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:31,710
Right, it's all the individuals get it, but all the centers, clusters get it so they might be more willing to participate.

731
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:37,020
Right. So anybody any.

732
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:41,490
Any other questions for a stopwatch? All right. Well, thank you very much.

733
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:46,430
No comments about designs.

734
01:14:46,450 --> 01:14:53,410
You can definitely have opinions on which guys you like or dislike, but you should always be open to using any design, right?

735
01:14:54,130 --> 01:14:59,390
So I definitely now after working on a few stuff, Wedge don't really want to work on stuff, which is.

736
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:08,020
However, I know that there are available designs and the setting is ripe for a stepwise

737
01:15:08,020 --> 01:15:11,530
design and I think you should definitely consider it and potentially implement it,

738
01:15:11,530 --> 01:15:16,540
because if you have something that cannot be some intervention,

739
01:15:16,540 --> 01:15:22,240
that has to be instrumentally implemented in clusters and you can't roll out at the same time, right?

740
01:15:22,250 --> 01:15:30,310
Like that might be something that is really the only way to study this question, in which case perhaps biased answer is better than no answer.

741
01:15:30,670 --> 01:15:36,129
So in all of our designs, whereas I might have had some bias about what I projected to you,

742
01:15:36,130 --> 01:15:41,170
I hope that you take all of that information and you have it in your toolkit and you're ready to like pull them

743
01:15:41,170 --> 01:15:48,040
out and think very critically about your scientific question and about whether that design matches or not.

744
01:15:48,550 --> 01:15:48,879
Okay.

745
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:55,240
And then also think critically about the bias that could come in so you can make sure that you analyze it as well as possible for robust results.

746
01:15:56,470 --> 01:16:04,480
All right. So great work on your project. Remember that you have to do your, you know, your yellow day engagement, your peer reviews.

747
01:16:04,870 --> 01:16:08,800
It's all due by the 13th, but the sooner the better. And then I can get your grades in.

748
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:18,930
I will post your grades on campus by the 14th, and then I will put them into Wolverine Access like the 16th.

749
01:16:18,940 --> 01:16:25,000
So if you want to look on the 14th and 15th, if you have a problem with your grade, email me immediately.

750
01:16:25,260 --> 01:16:29,420
Okay. Otherwise, it's going to get posted on your transcript.

751
01:16:33,220 --> 01:16:38,290
Anything any other? Go to the seminars today to complete the teaching evaluations,

752
01:16:38,290 --> 01:16:46,179
and thank you for enjoying maybe or engaging some of you, most of you in clinical trials.

753
01:16:46,180 --> 01:16:51,549
And I hope that you found this this course useful. And I look forward to hearing about your features ahead of you.

754
01:16:51,550 --> 01:17:04,520
So thank you. Good luck on exams. You know, I thought about it, like we just.

755
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:13,900
All I know is.

756
01:17:21,950 --> 01:17:29,520
I will be notified tomorrow night that it was my.

757
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:53,680
They're different looks to make sure you know where you were.

758
01:17:53,820 --> 01:17:58,440
And you know, yeah, yeah, yeah.

759
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:19,370
You know, I got to go out there and there is a sign in sheet where I go, okay, if you decide to sign is I'm going to have a 30 day.

760
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:30,490
It's like, well, I have something to say about that.

761
01:18:31,970 --> 01:18:48,010
Well, I don't think you know, I don't I'm not directly on it, but it's ready to go.

762
01:18:49,030 --> 01:18:54,069
I think it's only like declaring a date is not the your husband is.

763
01:18:54,070 --> 01:18:57,340
That already has been. Yeah, I know.

764
01:18:59,380 --> 01:19:11,870
What are you going to do overall in my life cycle where I feel like he doesn't give us like, really that good.

765
01:19:11,890 --> 01:19:16,420
It's like somewhat related to the first question and it's very similar.

766
01:19:16,440 --> 01:19:21,050
Like I'm just saying, it's like you date so well.

767
01:19:21,580 --> 01:19:27,940
But the other thing is I don't really know what I'm going to bring after that.

768
01:19:27,940 --> 01:19:49,180
I just know like what you know, I mean to ah, you know, if to see your, our student, the thing that we realize is that your ass is your girls.

769
01:19:49,420 --> 01:19:53,420
Yeah, you do now. Yeah.

770
01:19:54,370 --> 01:19:58,170
Which are you guys against each other today? I know. That is pretty weird.

771
01:19:58,180 --> 01:20:01,570
It's. It's like of us and.

772
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:08,650
Oh, well, you're gorgeous. She was like, so.

773
01:20:09,660 --> 01:20:13,350
What did you learn that you didn't know before?

774
01:20:13,470 --> 01:20:16,740
Because you was like, she didn't have any questions. She didn't have any questions.

775
01:20:16,740 --> 01:20:20,680
She's like. So it's pretty straightforward. You guys both did a really good job.

776
01:20:20,680 --> 01:20:23,580
And the same though, was like, really, like, really similar.

777
01:20:23,940 --> 01:20:27,780
She just, like, did have a question that's funny and was like 10 minutes and we were done.

778
01:20:27,870 --> 01:20:30,899
Yeah. 5 minutes or something.

779
01:20:30,900 --> 01:20:34,380
Yeah. No, I think a while we take one of the groups are like they're out there forever.

780
01:20:35,460 --> 01:20:42,660
Yeah. It's like she can't have saying things. I was just like and I was just saying, yeah, you were five and I was just like, I can't tell you.

781
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:47,590
How are you feeling? I'm just weak. She's, like, pretty isolated.

782
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:53,249
Yeah. I was just like, I can't stand for. Like I said, I just.

783
01:20:53,250 --> 01:20:56,610
I thought it was like, well, I feel bad because she asked. That was so.

784
01:20:56,610 --> 01:21:03,440
So you're asked a question about you're just like, I was trying to ask, but I know you're going to like the other day.

785
01:21:03,690 --> 01:21:06,960
Yeah. And I was like, I didn't even notice asking about.

786
01:21:07,020 --> 01:21:10,770
I was like, what was something like that?

787
01:21:11,580 --> 01:21:14,580
Yeah, it wasn't easy.

788
01:21:14,580 --> 01:21:20,010
It was like, you know, my parents.

789
01:21:20,130 --> 01:21:23,310
Yes, it was. No, no, that's why I wasn't.

790
01:21:23,310 --> 01:21:25,470
And you would have answered it so much faster.

791
01:21:26,010 --> 01:21:35,940
Yeah, I don't know, I, I was like, I did not ask you about your boss for any person to ask that question my way.

792
01:21:35,940 --> 01:21:42,450
Just how we use about battery question. Okay, we didn't use like I said, I only want to read it for.

793
01:21:42,780 --> 01:21:49,829
Yeah, yeah. So today was our shortest what was our video conference?

794
01:21:49,830 --> 01:21:53,219
Where were you? So I was I said, I answered what eventually.

795
01:21:53,220 --> 01:21:57,520
Oh yeah. Oh yeah, yeah. Explicitly said I was only asking.

796
01:21:57,520 --> 01:22:02,400
So that's why I felt like I actually understood.

797
01:22:03,540 --> 01:22:07,020
Which is like not true about oh, are you signed to arms?

798
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:11,680
Are you? I was assigned to the other group, like in the summer.

799
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:15,989
Now I just like to hear you talking about going to so much.

800
01:22:15,990 --> 01:22:25,620
So once again, I feel like I come into my office like, you know, like they said, you just said you need to watch them.

801
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:29,350
Oh, you know, I said there's a oh, you didn't either.

802
01:22:29,460 --> 01:22:34,260
Watch. This is not something you should just do to me.

803
01:22:34,260 --> 01:22:40,880
Yeah, this. I really want to hear you complaining about. Watch having to watch. This is what, like about making for comedy videos?

804
01:22:40,890 --> 01:22:47,670
Oh, he's just going to comment twice on his own. I don't know. But, you know, she said, like watch to others to like you suggested.

805
01:22:48,090 --> 01:22:52,090
Yeah, exactly. I don't know what. 40 more minutes of additional video now.

806
01:22:52,170 --> 01:22:59,370
Do you get it? He's like, oh, you should watch the video. 5 hours of video for comments and the reply comments.

807
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:03,740
Yeah. Yeah. Thank you for saving my life. Okay?

808
01:23:05,990 --> 01:23:09,170
Yeah, no problem. Everything else? I'm a little.

809
01:23:09,350 --> 01:23:22,050
Hey, you guys. Yeah. Why? It has to be a very concerted project that could take months.

810
01:23:22,470 --> 01:23:25,700
So so far, the deadline is 6 p.m.

811
01:23:27,020 --> 01:23:30,470
Or are you in like the Saturday next Saturday.

812
01:23:30,530 --> 01:23:33,820
Yeah. So we have a lot we're presenting.

813
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:42,320
Okay. Like we're not present. We don't like like what kind of the whole project, but preliminary, like the data set and some preliminary results.

814
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:49,070
Okay. So we're going to present some preliminary I so we're going to only present a proposal.

815
01:23:49,460 --> 01:23:55,240
Yeah, that's how we like that. So he said at first, like now groups are like presenting their preliminary results as well.

816
01:23:55,580 --> 01:24:00,090
Like I feel like we should present a little bit results. Oh.

817
01:24:01,650 --> 01:24:05,900
So what? What type of prisoners like SHU offers go to prison?

818
01:24:05,910 --> 01:24:09,180
Or is this one of those like I. Yeah.

819
01:24:09,180 --> 01:24:12,450
Can you make it? Yeah, I can make it. Yeah, I just wanted to talk to you.

820
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:15,840
Okay. Okay. Okay. Like a one. Talk about data. Set another.

821
01:24:17,130 --> 01:24:21,000
Yeah. Just. Okay, whatever. Okay. Okay. As long as everyone talks.

822
01:24:21,090 --> 01:24:24,270
I was just curious about the format. It's ungraded, so.

823
01:24:24,780 --> 01:24:30,120
Okay. Oh, I don't like. It's ungraded. There's, like, a lot of people that seem like they've been taking it seriously.

824
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:35,010
Oh, my gosh. Why? Why?

825
01:24:35,310 --> 01:24:42,560
Why do you want to do this? Like. I mean, are we going to have a final presentation for the.

826
01:24:42,590 --> 01:24:46,700
No, those is our presentation. So only one presentation.

827
01:24:46,700 --> 01:24:51,170
And we don't we just like trying to get rid of the hard marks on every project.

828
01:24:51,350 --> 01:24:55,040
Oh, my gosh. I, I looked at a report.

829
01:24:55,310 --> 01:24:58,340
A do you finish homework for. I haven't started yet.

830
01:24:58,700 --> 01:25:03,110
Okay. So, I mean, I have my late days, so I'm going to tease those. Oh, how many ladies don't you have?

831
01:25:03,380 --> 01:25:07,690
Okay, got it. So I'm probably not even going to do it till the weekend, which is like, literally after it's you.

832
01:25:10,040 --> 01:25:14,340
Okay, I'm gonna do it tonight because it's due tomorrow.

833
01:25:14,370 --> 01:25:18,290
Yeah. You know, like, I forgot that.

834
01:25:18,350 --> 01:25:21,870
I forgot to submit my quiz, too. I saw. Oh, yeah.

835
01:25:21,870 --> 01:25:25,520
It'll ultimately submit it. That says losing your ladies on a quiz.

836
01:25:26,030 --> 01:25:29,749
Yeah. So stupid. All right. Do you want to find a room?

837
01:25:29,750 --> 01:25:33,980
So. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That would be great. I have a I have a meeting, too, but like.

838
01:25:34,460 --> 01:25:39,770
Oh, you mean me? It's you. Yeah. Like, I'll also go to the peanut sauce segment, you know?

839
01:25:40,040 --> 01:25:44,659
Oh, yeah. So I go, oh, maybe.

840
01:25:44,660 --> 01:25:48,860
No, I wasn't planning on when we get stuff before that. Oh okay. Well what's the details of every meeting.

841
01:25:48,860 --> 01:25:52,669
It too. Is it you know, it's also with people sorry. It's 30 minutes.

842
01:25:52,670 --> 01:25:55,880
Like, oh, it was like just because.

843
01:25:56,670 --> 01:26:02,840
Yeah, because I'm trying to do all the futures of political.

844
01:26:15,930 --> 01:26:19,610
Are you planning on planning implant for me or I have.

845
01:28:03,470 --> 01:28:07,730
It's this kind of luxury. Yeah. It's like this country is home with the kids.

846
01:28:08,780 --> 01:28:12,500
This is all we could do. That sucks.

847
01:28:12,980 --> 01:28:19,900
Okay. People can really make small slices like that.

848
01:28:19,940 --> 01:28:23,490
Maybe, by the way. I won't tell you to forget what I think. I don't even you.

849
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:26,800
A little bundle of 24 dogs.

850
01:28:27,050 --> 01:28:31,460
Yeah, but they're all wrong. The kids have a positive effect on my own.

851
01:28:31,850 --> 01:28:37,340
That's why I didn't talk about that. So, you know, it's hard for me to say that.

852
01:28:39,050 --> 01:28:43,460
Yeah, well, I do that in public because it's a little for me.

853
01:28:45,230 --> 01:28:48,800
Oh, you just look like I told you. Yeah, I mean.

854
01:28:48,840 --> 01:28:55,910
I mean, I think. Yeah.

855
01:28:56,090 --> 01:29:04,889
I probably have to tell the senator from early. You know, I lost my way.

856
01:29:04,890 --> 01:29:09,610
And I think. We from the world.

857
01:29:10,340 --> 01:29:17,000
Oh, everything is a little bit different.

858
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:29,490
Both of you. Sorry. I think we're really, really just looking at my car.

859
01:29:30,460 --> 01:29:34,860
A lot of people move. I think it's fair weather in Mexico.

860
01:29:34,980 --> 01:29:41,130
Are you serious? Yes. I keep you covered. I want to move the guys from the Cross River.

861
01:29:41,580 --> 01:29:46,080
Yeah. Can we do it? I'll give you a picture of it.

862
01:29:59,250 --> 01:29:59,400
And.
