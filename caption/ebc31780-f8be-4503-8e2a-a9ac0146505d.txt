1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:03,920
So lastly,
let's talk some about how we prevent and

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:07,290
respond to infectious disease outbreaks.

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:11,220
In the movies, we often see
disastrous pandemics onscreen and

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:15,100
we might wonder if this could
actually happen in real life.

5
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,420
So let's start by defining some terms.

6
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:20,500
A disease can be Endemic which
is when there is a usual or

7
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:24,090
constant presence of a disease
within a given geographic area.

8
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:28,070
Alternatively, an Epidemic is when
there is an occurrence of disease

9
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:31,220
that is larger than what you'd
normally expect for that region.

10
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:34,720
You may also have had the term
outbreak which is a broader term

11
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,240
that might be used to
refer to an epidemic or

12
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:41,880
to a smaller increase in cases or
a more limited geographic area.

13
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:46,273
And lastly, you can have a Pandemic which
is a worldwide epidemic affecting high

14
00:00:46,273 --> 00:00:51,553
proportion of the global population.

15
00:00:51,553 --> 00:00:53,780
So why investigate outbreaks?

16
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:56,850
Well, one is to prevent additional cases,

17
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,910
you need to be able to identify and
eliminate the source of the problem.

18
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:05,273
You may also want to identify risk
factors associated with infection

19
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:09,350
that need to be contained or
to be prevented in the future.

20
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:14,948
And additionally, Outbreak investigations
can provide new insights into research

21
00:01:14,948 --> 00:01:19,767
into a disease, and can also identify
new pathogens that affect people so

22
00:01:19,767 --> 00:01:25,773
that we can prevent them in the future.

23
00:01:25,773 --> 00:01:30,260
Disease Surveillance is key to
recognizing and responding to outbreaks.

24
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:34,110
There's a large comprehensive network
around the world of disease surveillance

25
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:37,800
efforts by doctors, nurses,
epidemiologist and more.

26
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,300
And within the US we have an extensive
disease surveillance network through

27
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:46,160
hospitals, clinics, local and state
level health departments and the CDC.

28
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:50,410
These efforts keep track not just cases of
disease but other kinds of data on health

29
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:55,240
care, natural disasters, environmental
conditions and large gatherings of people.

30
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,530
And all of this data can
help in prevention and

31
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:03,010
response to infectious disease.

32
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:06,710
Outbreak investigations are conducted
by local and state level agencies,

33
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:10,120
like health departments, and
also the Centers for Disease Control and

34
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,950
Prevention or CDC at the federal level.

35
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:15,440
And also,
agencies at the international level,

36
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,170
like the World Health Organization,
or WHO.

37
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:23,080
Conducting an outbreak investigation
involves a number of steps in order to

38
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,490
identify the existence of the outbreak and
verify the diagnosis.

39
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:30,600
Create a case definition to define
who is included as a case and

40
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:35,200
determine the spread, extent and
importantly, the cause of the outbreak.

41
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,640
So, outbreak investigators
will develop and

42
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,870
test the hypothesis as to what
might have caused the outbreak.

43
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:44,370
And then based on that,
they'll develop and implement control and

44
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:50,980
prevention systems, and release their
findings to the broader communities.

45
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:53,560
There are many different types of
outbreaks that might need to be

46
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,270
investigated.

47
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:59,680
For example, one quarter of Americans
get a foodborne illness each year.

48
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,550
Hospital acquired infections
are another important issue.

49
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:06,700
With 1.7 million hospital
acquired infections each year,

50
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,070
which cause around 100,000 deaths.

51
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:12,140
There are increasing concerns
about antibiotic resistance for

52
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:15,260
these infections as well.

53
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:20,090
Outbreaks can have wide-ranging social,
political and economic consequences.

54
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:24,570
Taking us back to historical epidemics for
a moment, in the wake of The Black Death,

55
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:28,850
various group were targeted because they
were thought to blame for the crisis.

56
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:32,710
Jewish communities were accused of causing
the disease and were persecuted and

57
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:35,190
massacred in a wave of violent attack.

58
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:39,070
Other minority populations, as well
as individuals with skin diseases or

59
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:41,210
leprosy, were also targeted.

60
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:44,848
The aftermath of the Black Death led
to an enormous range of religious,

61
00:03:44,848 --> 00:03:50,832
social and economic upheavals that
changed the course of European history.

62
00:03:50,832 --> 00:03:52,608
And so in case of an outbreak,

63
00:03:52,608 --> 00:03:56,450
communication is key to mitigate
sociopolitical effects.

64
00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:00,120
We wanna make sure that people
are informed, prepared and ready.

65
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,170
And we wanna reduce fear by
giving people information.

66
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:05,970
So there are four key pieces to this.

67
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:10,620
You wanna make sure people are informed,
in order to build trust and stem panic,

68
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:15,160
you wanna announce things early to prevent
rumors and misinformation from spreading.

69
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:19,200
You wanna be transparent,
candid, factual, and accessible.

70
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,597
You want to bring public concerns
into the decision making, so

71
00:04:22,597 --> 00:04:30,474
that people feel that they
have a say in what's going on.

72
00:04:30,474 --> 00:04:34,930
Finally, breaking the chain of infection
is crucial in preventing outbreaks.

73
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,780
And there are many different pieces
of this to pay attention to.

74
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:43,120
So that might mean thinking about
the agent, the bacteria, virus, fungi,

75
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,355
parasite or protozoa itself, looking
at what reservoirs might be involved.

76
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:51,730
Then interventions in this case
could mean improvements in hygiene,

77
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:56,610
sanitation, disinfection and sterilization
looking at the portal of exit.

78
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:59,990
So, looking at hand hygiene,
trash disposal,

79
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:03,410
waste disposal or
looking at the mode of transmissions.

80
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:07,512
So is it contract transmission,
is it droplets airborne,

81
00:05:07,512 --> 00:05:12,050
vector-borne, water-borne, and
depending on what mode of transmission

82
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:15,320
you might alter what kinds of
interventions you would propose.

83
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:19,960
And lastly, the portal of entry,
how the pathogen gets into the host

84
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,930
can be intervene on by thinking
about hand hygiene, wound care,

85
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:26,950
catheter care,
all of these types of things.

86
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:29,870
And finally, host susceptibility so

87
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:33,520
different groups of people may be
more at risk to a particular disease.

88
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,210
And so

89
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:39,830
by identifying high risk individuals
you can help prevent disease that way.

90
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:45,667
And so that's the end of the lecture,
thank you for your time.
