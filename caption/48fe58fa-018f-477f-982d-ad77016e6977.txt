Laura Power: So So while we I think most of you are here so welcome back to day, two of our class I hope everything's going well, first let me just see if there's any questions or or anything on your mind any logistics, you need help with everything going okay.

18
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:30,030
Laura Power: All right, good okay very good, well, let me start by sharing my screen.

19
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:35,130
Laura Power: yeah first i'm just going to look at the canvas page with you.

20
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:43,620
Laura Power: So if you see my screen right yes okay cool so we're on day two today so day two we're focusing again on.

21
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:53,670
Laura Power: leadership and kind of general leadership yesterday, of course, we talked about public health 3.0 trying to introduce the concepts and how they all sort of weave together as we get through.

22
00:05:53,670 --> 00:06:07,860
Laura Power: Leadership for public health, specifically, we start bringing in concepts of systems thinking and some other leadership principles that are important for public health, today, he will focus in a little bit more about leadership principles that are.

23
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:12,780
Laura Power: That, I think, are really important for public health and kind of think about it in that way today.

24
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:17,760
Laura Power: we'll start off by doing some follow up on the self assessments you all did yesterday.

25
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:25,110
Laura Power: And we'll talk about that, together, I do have a couple of slides to show you related to that, but I do also want to just get your your input what you guys thought about it.

26
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:40,320
Laura Power: Then you'll be getting together in teams, because of course love to do team projects during these classes and you will have a team that you'll work on something with through the rest of the week, and so you'll see that you'll get together with your team now and then in each day.

27
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:51,780
Laura Power: you'll meet each other first really and when that you'll just meet each other and you'll think about your own strengths together as a team and you'll do so that sort of your follow up on the clifton strengths.

28
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:55,980
Laura Power: And just thinking about team dynamics and how those come together.

29
00:06:55,980 --> 00:07:03,450
Laura Power: Then we'll do a little bit of lecture and that will be where I kind of zero in on some of the different leadership styles that are sometimes thought about for public health.

30
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:16,140
Laura Power: And about some of the leadership styles and skills and help us with cross sector collaboration that idea of public health 3.0 and needing to work across sales and how that how we might think about that and public health.

31
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:24,870
Laura Power: will definitely get a break in and then we'll come back and we'll talk about the case study, maybe some of you had a chance to review it.

32
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:32,130
Laura Power: Yesterday, if not, you can pick it up during the break and you'll have time to think about it with your team together to so you can kind of help.

33
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:42,060
Laura Power: Make sure everybody's on the same page and then the very end of the day, your team will get together to choose a public health challenge that you will focus on through the rest of the week.

34
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:48,540
Laura Power: And i'll tell you more about all those as we come along, but I just wanted to give you an overview of what to expect.

35
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:57,960
Laura Power: So that's the day and just a reminder that the slides are attached here and there's a bunch of resources listed here.

36
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:10,380
Laura Power: I will say for day one, I added on a couple podcast Bernie Brown and what does it was a jocko willing, can I seen it right Clinton I added his link to his podcast is that right.

37
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:18,450
Laura Power: yeah Okay, do you want to tell the group we talked about burn a brown yesterday quintin who is jocko when tell them.

38
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:29,370
Quintin Solano: yeah jacko so he was a navy seal commander in the battle of ramadi and Iraq, which is one of our Afghanistan, which is one of the most contested territories at his time.

39
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:37,290
Quintin Solano: He was a commander, so he oversaw multiple platoons as well as not just navy, but army, as well as marines.

40
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:52,050
Quintin Solano: And took a lot of his leadership lessons that he learned on the battlefield and dealing with not just you know moving people around and stuff like that, but ultimately many men and women, you know sacra giving the ultimate sacrifice, while they were serving underneath him.

41
00:08:52,050 --> 00:09:01,590
Quintin Solano: So he takes those leadership lessons that kind of brings them back into the business world he's written multiple books on this, and he runs a company now called Echelon front that does a lot of leadership and development.

42
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:06,420
Quintin Solano: For anybody in the business world, and that includes you know medical professionals as well.

43
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:13,890
Quintin Solano: and his podcast he brings on you know former military generals people that were in the military or have gone through some pretty amazing stuff in their lives.

44
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:27,180
Quintin Solano: And just get some you know talk about it they're pretty long podcast I recommend his books if you're actually really trying to dig into a lot of his leadership lessons The first one is called extreme ownership and then there's leadership strategy and tactics tactics as well, so.

45
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:35,250
Laura Power: that's great Thank you thanks for pointing that out, so I put the link, I found it I googled it after we talked about it, and I put belief that is the answer Bernie browns on.

46
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:46,050
Laura Power: The first day one additional resources, so those are there for you to check out there's all kinds of podcasts to check out alright so that's the two.

47
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:55,680
Laura Power: So, first, I wanted to get your thoughts about doing the self assessments and we'll just kind of stop and give you all a chance to.

48
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:15,060
Laura Power: reflect on on it in general and then i'll kind of go through i'll spend a little time just talking about the clifton strengths Finder and then briefly about the leadership sound skills, but any comments or just feelings after after you did this yesterday.

49
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:23,970
Quintin Solano: You know i'll say I think it was pretty difficult, especially in the clifton one, at least to decide between some of the options we were presented with.

50
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:35,040
Quintin Solano: Because, at times, I found that I like both options, and it was very much like I incorporate you know both into my thinking or would like to incorporate both of my thinking.

51
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:40,770
Quintin Solano: I think that was pretty interesting but and then some of the questions I felt like repeated that had the similar.

52
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:51,000
Quintin Solano: Or the same options and then I would also pick like the opposite one at that time, so I chose that one earlier, and then I would go and choose the next one that says like well I guess i'll factor and somehow.

53
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:59,520
Quintin Solano: But I thought this officer, the assessment that it gave at the end was actually kind of spot on with what i'm trying to develop and so, so I thought that was interesting.

54
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,220
Laura Power: interesting for you felt like yours with.

55
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:09,570
Laura Power: Others and feeling and greed and sound from nodding heads the word talking quintin on there is going to comment.

56
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:26,070
Anam: yeah I felt similar the final list was pretty like I could go through and kind of find examples of times, where i've sort of used either like these kind of strengths, or whether that's the approach that I take.

57
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:34,920
Anam: So it was interesting to realize that like I don't actively necessarily think about it on a day to day basis, but like Maybe those do come out.

58
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:43,320
Anam: And also just the order was like just to think through what they were and then for the second one, we did just to think through the order as well, was.

59
00:11:43,320 --> 00:12:01,680
Anam: To see what like the main strength was and go through the list was interesting because I may not ever necessarily have thought about the order that I would put them in, but it was pretty accurate, I would say, for me.

60
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:11,520
Samantha Lyons: I did this strengths Finder about like eight years ago, and my greatest strength, then was positivity is nowhere on the list now.

61
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,790
Samantha Lyons: And so I thought it was really interesting there was only.

62
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:25,050
Samantha Lyons: Two of five from the first time I did it eight years ago we're actually still on the list of strengths and I commented on this in my reflection, but I think.

63
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:30,150
Samantha Lyons: The strengths, that I have now are the reflection of the environment in which I find myself.

64
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:44,850
Samantha Lyons: Rather than the environment that I found myself in when I initially took the strengths Finder eight years ago, and I think that makes a very strong difference in terms of what qualities of my personality.

65
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:52,680
Samantha Lyons: And my actions that I choose to kind of exaggerate on depending on where I am.

66
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:58,410
Laura Power: Today we don't have the whole with the vm because it would be so interesting to see how they really do change over time.

67
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:07,110
Laura Power: Of course, if you pay a fee you pay more money, you can get the whole thing i'm sure that it would give it to you if you paid for it, but I could only afford the top five guys.

68
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:09,990
Laura Power: So Aaron.

69
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:18,480
Erin Thompson: I like to I like taking these types of assessments i've actually taken this one twice before first time was.

70
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:25,830
Erin Thompson: For college for my undergrads a little over 10 years ago and then again I took about three or four years ago and i've had the.

71
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:38,160
Erin Thompson: input responsibility and achiever appeared on each assessment, so I thought that was kind of interesting and just reading like I can see how those like big drivers for me.

72
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:46,260
Erin Thompson: Just like personality wise input is just like the collecting of things and i'm like an information sponge and love to read and that kind of thing and.

73
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:57,840
Erin Thompson: The achiever and responsibility areas kind of really drive me and, like my work and kind of always wanting to keep moving latter nothing.

74
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,220
Laura Power: seems like.

75
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,600
Laura Power: So far, you've.

76
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:16,440
Laura Power: found it to kind of align with what you know you read it is that okay yeah this is me, I felt when I did it the first time I sent it to my mom like mom this is so me check it out i'm not everybody feels that way you know, sometimes people are surprised or.

77
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:28,830
Laura Power: Even sometimes disappointed i've had people expressed disappointment that they had a certain idea about strengths that they perceived as a better strength kind of and in their words.

78
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:34,770
Laura Power: So sometimes people actually feel disappointment or disagreement.

79
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:38,040
Laura Power: anybody else wants to share anything.

80
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:50,670
Ahya Sajawal Ali: i'm definitely spot on with the with the final result, I have no qualms about that, but this may be an unpopular opinion, I felt like when I was doing the quiz.

81
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:59,940
Ahya Sajawal Ali: There was a way SEC back into the questions and I feel like some personality traits were very heavily tested.

82
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:20,190
Ahya Sajawal Ali: and honestly like I felt like that was, I mean I knew exactly what they were going to come out as for just a few that one or two personality traits maybe it's introspection I know that there are a big part of me, maybe that's the bias coming out but I felt like.

83
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:33,690
Ahya Sajawal Ali: need to put in questions which are outside the outside the way top personality traits per se, because not everyone is like there's no cookie cutter so.

84
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:45,630
Ahya Sajawal Ali: I don't know that's what I felt like I was doing and I was like Okay, this is, this is a repetitive thought that is really going to come out in the results and I wasn't surprised when they were there.

85
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:50,490
Laura Power: yeah definitely there's definitely some skepticism I think for people and.

86
00:15:50,490 --> 00:16:02,460
Laura Power: Actually, the first time I started doing this with with groups was you know when I would hear people's responses and that's kind of what inspired me to just try to learn a little bit more about these and I do take these with a grain of salt.

87
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:11,010
Laura Power: You know i've come across some things, although the research is posted on their webpage so it's still might be biased research but it talks about.

88
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:25,830
Laura Power: You know that sometimes certain strength patterns, sometimes people will tend to have a certain reaction towards the results, but I think it's good to have some skepticism about these and I will say I think I like using these I think they're.

89
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:44,190
Laura Power: You know kind of fun and even can give you some insight I try not to take them too seriously, but I do think there's some interesting things to point out about the strengths Finder so let me go back to my slides here real quick and just kind of pull out a few things.

90
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:46,260
Laura Power: Oh.

91
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:53,340
Laura Power: let's see here some specifically for the strengths Finder and you may have figured this out, as you were.

92
00:16:53,340 --> 00:17:00,780
Laura Power: Doing these, but this is something so Donald clifton as part of the Gallup organization had studied.

93
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:08,910
Laura Power: These categories, they are he was studying human strengths and they came up with these different themes of talent that were most among many individuals.

94
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:13,950
Laura Power: And so, this process, as opposed to identify your dominant themes of talent.

95
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:24,270
Laura Power: And supposedly their research shows that people will tend to exhibit the same top 10 talents throughout their lives, so sadly we don't know where your others were maybe they were still in your top 10.

96
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:30,120
Laura Power: But maybe not because I like I said I got cheaper version and I don't only know the top five.

97
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:43,980
Laura Power: But the idea that some people have natural talents and then you can kind of think about how you put your time in and how you use those talents and that can be kind of maximizing and then having using your strengths.

98
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:50,520
Laura Power: So they have 34 different strengths that they list here and.

99
00:17:50,520 --> 00:18:01,050
Laura Power: I I have done it before where i've done with groups and then i'm like Oh, maybe, maybe I did as an epidemiologist students, maybe we all have similar strengths, because we're epidemiology and.

100
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:05,070
Laura Power: There were still kind of all over the place, and people have wondered.

101
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:11,970
Laura Power: You know what does it mean to you what, if you have strings have fallen different domains, or you don't have a certain one so.

102
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:26,370
Laura Power: The way the strengths are you know all these different 34 themes that they have their in different buckets some are executing influencing relationship building and strategic thinking.

103
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:37,830
Laura Power: And I actually can't remember all of my I have it, you know I gotta pull it up, actually, but I definitely did not have one, I think, in influencing I didn't have any influencing.

104
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:51,240
Laura Power: And so I wondered well gosh Does that mean i'm horrible influencing people or you know what you know what happens if I don't have a strength and one of these domains, and sometimes people wonder about that.

105
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:58,230
Laura Power: And they also point out that, though this domains of leadership, you know, depending on where you are, you might be more.

106
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:12,630
Laura Power: present or future oriented more person or task oriented sometimes you hear about leadership styles that are more person oriented or task oriented you know thinking about myself i'm I think that I.

107
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:21,660
Laura Power: I mine were 1010 has to be more here and I when I reflect upon myself I realized I do tend to be more present oriented and very i'm very task oriented.

108
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:33,870
Laura Power: I think, with, but if Sammy was saying, I think, with different jobs, so my previous life as a hospital based physician and infectious diseases and now is more of a.

109
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:42,630
Laura Power: mentor teacher program developer definitely i've been learning how to do and i've been probably.

110
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:55,830
Laura Power: You know, harnessing these skills, a little more than I had in the past, so I really, at least in my experience, I think that you know your strengths, they come out differently depending on what your environment is like.

111
00:19:55,830 --> 00:20:03,990
Laura Power: So as they're saying there's lots of different reactions, what happens if you don't have strings in all the domains.

112
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:15,030
Laura Power: You know, can they change over time, so this is what when when I went back to learn a little bit more like you know how seriously we take these findings, what do we do with this.

113
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:18,750
Laura Power: I don't know about you, but i've actually been in organizations, where.

114
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:29,580
Laura Power: Like I was with one group where they they they like put their strengths out on their name tags and even the other doors like where you could walk in this is Henry Ford health system.

115
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:34,590
Laura Power: Where actually you'll end will you're where you're going to rotate out eventually.

116
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:38,280
Laura Power: They were really into the strings Finder and that's actually where I did it for the first time.

117
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:44,010
Laura Power: And they had it on a name tag so they were like really portraying there's their strengths and trying to think about that.

118
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:54,390
Laura Power: So some places take it really seriously some you know, but some are maybe more skeptical when you read about how to use these and what to do with them, the way that it clicked in and others talk about it.

119
00:20:54,390 --> 00:21:00,300
Laura Power: Is one it's helpful to know your own strengths and that's helpful because you can kind of.

120
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:06,450
Laura Power: acknowledge and build on those strengths, that you have and it's a way for you to articulate what your strengths are, I think.

121
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:18,120
Laura Power: For many of us, and I felt like we were doing this yesterday to we're trying to put words on some of the things that we were thinking about or how we thought about how we felt about leadership concepts sometimes it's helpful to have.

122
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:24,990
Laura Power: Have the right words to show what your strengths are or if someone was to ask you, you could say, well, this is where I am and I.

123
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:27,570
Laura Power: This is how I have these strengths.

124
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:38,550
Laura Power: And you can try to intentionally try to use your strengths, I think this will take practice, I admit that I will, I think about it, I think about I want to do this class and then I you know you have to intentionally try to.

125
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:47,490
Laura Power: build on your strengths, if you really want to use them, but knowing what your strengths are can help you as you navigate and try to practice, building on them.

126
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:55,770
Laura Power: I think it's also helpful just to know how your energy is spent and recognizing that if you're doing something that is.

127
00:21:55,770 --> 00:22:08,550
Laura Power: aligned with what your strengths are it may not require as much energy as doing something that maybe is not your top strength like it doesn't mean you're weak at it, but it just maybe it's not your top strings in so.

128
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:12,450
Laura Power: You might need a little more energy to still do a good job at it.

129
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:18,720
Laura Power: I think it's a similar way of thinking about introverts and extroverts it's not the same thing, but it's a similar concept, where you think about.

130
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:27,960
Laura Power: How people use their energy and where they get their energy from so i'm definitely an introvert but I really do enjoy.

131
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:36,570
Laura Power: Working with people and having social interactions and things like that, but my energy is different, you know I need my quiet time sometimes to.

132
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:50,130
Laura Power: build up my energy again I think it's a similar concept here so just understanding that maybe if you're doing something that's not your top strength, you know just be a little easier on yourself and understand that you might need a little more focus or energy to do that.

133
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:58,890
Laura Power: And if there's something that you'd like to do that's not your top string you can still learn and kind of coach yourself are focused on that so one that's I think that's a helpful.

134
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:04,050
Laura Power: tool is just knowing your strengths thinking about the strengths based leadership.

135
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:09,600
Laura Power: The other thing is is helpful, maybe to recognize other people's strengths and aside from.

136
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:16,380
Laura Power: You know, having everyone in your organization take this test, like the one place, I was just talking about sometimes you can try to notice.

137
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:23,070
Laura Power: Or at least have an idea of you, not necessarily kind of pinpoint all of your strengths by you know meeting you and talking to you, but maybe I could.

138
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:34,380
Laura Power: If I was leading a team, I could start to try to understand or feel, what are the things that make people come to a world of those things they like doing Where do they fall in the string so we try to understand what other people's strengths are.

139
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:49,140
Laura Power: You might be able to help build on their strengths and help them see what they're good at doing and kind of help them excel in that way, so, as they say, this could build a positive climate by focusing on strengths.

140
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:54,270
Laura Power: I thought this was interesting and I student had asked me this question in the past, like.

141
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:58,290
Laura Power: You know, do you need certain strengths to go into a certain profession.

142
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:08,550
Laura Power: I think if I remember, I think it was a MED student who was asking me about this and wondering like are there, certain strings that really help people in the medical field, or in the surgical field, or something like that.

143
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:13,590
Laura Power: So this quote I took from the strings website and they say it's not.

144
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:26,010
Laura Power: designed to direct you into specific professions in our research we discovered many individuals who are excelling in the same profession, would have been very different top five themes so it's not like you know you need to have.

145
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:36,540
Laura Power: Certain strengths in order to have a certain profession or do a certain activity it's just understanding how you use them to get something done.

146
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:40,800
Laura Power: So here's here's where I say taking yeah Please go ahead.

147
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:49,290
Ahya Sajawal Ali: I think this perspective has really, really, I think the quiz makes more sense to me.

148
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:55,530
Ahya Sajawal Ali: I might be the pessimistic voice there but i'm meaning it in a very positive way, that you should be aware of what strengths, you have.

149
00:24:55,530 --> 00:25:07,980
Ahya Sajawal Ali: But also, if you're expecting results in a certain category which aren't your strengths like on like i'll be honest with mine I didn't have any in the executive.

150
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:18,180
Ahya Sajawal Ali: sort of block at least right now in my line, for whatever reason, and I think it's really healthy for me to know that I could either work super hard on.

151
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:39,450
Ahya Sajawal Ali: There or sort of you know, get help in in those areas, so I definitely think from a learning perspective it's it's great not just to acknowledge what's good but to acknowledge that the there's something, then you know you should do, maybe one.

152
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:43,470
Laura Power: yeah I think it's a good it's a good tool, it gives you some insight.

153
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:47,520
Laura Power: I will say remember you could have you know number, six, seven and eight.

154
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,650
Ahya Sajawal Ali: yeah yeah no I hear what you're saying.

155
00:25:49,650 --> 00:26:04,020
Laura Power: yeah but just for you all, and the other thing I like to point out, and I thought about this is sometimes though the way to achieve something, maybe you think of it like I didn't have any influencer but maybe i'm able to.

156
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:11,340
Laura Power: influence or persuade people through my other strengths so maybe it's the other things about me that can help me get those things done.

157
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:26,160
Laura Power: So sometimes you know talk about how can I use my other strengths and still accomplish the same goal, instead of using it, where I had this preconceived notion that I needed to have like the influencer domain in order to do that.

158
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:31,710
Laura Power: Other comes.

159
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:43,740
Laura Power: Right well a couple things to point out, and this has come up in some discussions i've had in the past is one just thinking about you know how is this test structure where did it come from test has been around for a long time.

160
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:55,680
Laura Power: And so, some people have wondered about what about different social identities and how is that taken into account, this was an opinion article, you can click on that link to get to read the whole thing but.

161
00:26:55,680 --> 00:27:17,940
Laura Power: Basically, there wasn't a specific answers to do they affect the test, but was really wondering in questioning you know what are different social identities and how might that affect the results of the test and also thinking about you know how we interpret the results, so I think just.

162
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:24,180
Laura Power: Just acknowledging that there can be bias in the way that we think what we think are positive, like.

163
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:32,940
Laura Power: mentioning that some people have expressed feeling disappointment because they thought they needed I don't know visioning or whoo or something that sounded.

164
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:40,560
Laura Power: more positive to them, so there can be bias about how how we perceive strings or strengths and other people.

165
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:49,440
Laura Power: And how sometimes the words that are used to describe these strings are sometimes associated like some might be thought of as more masculine or more feminine.

166
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:56,580
Laura Power: And what do we do with that and then so so say for me if I was to use these strings as a supervisor.

167
00:27:56,580 --> 00:28:09,780
Laura Power: But, yet you know, maybe I have some whether I know it or not, some bias about what I think, who should be an achiever or you know if I have a certain strength, maybe I tend to see that one is more positive than the other so.

168
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:20,490
Laura Power: I think this is just pulling out, but this is, you know they're they're fun to do but also take it with a grain of salt, think about these other things and.

169
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:33,600
Laura Power: You know there's other ways of looking at it and I have some articles posted on the canvas page too, if you want to delve into that a little bit more, so any thoughts about that.

170
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,580
Okay.

171
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:45,480
Laura Power: yeah no definitely had so I remember having a class one time, where a group of students definitely got there were focused on on this idea of.

172
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:51,930
Laura Power: The social identities and just very was very skeptical that group took this test very.

173
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:58,860
Laura Power: had a lot of skepticism about it and I, and I agree with them, I think that you know take it with a grain of salt, but it's also fun to.

174
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:08,820
Laura Power: Try to learn about yourself and then you know take from this what works for you, and maybe those suggestions of what will help you going forward.

175
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:15,360
Laura Power: how you can use the strengths Finder results so and you have an opportunity to take in the future, you can always compare it.

176
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:27,780
Laura Power: The other self assessment that was that kind of quick online quiz reminds me of like the numerology quizzes or your horoscope quiz you can do this was for that it was like numerology for leadership so.

177
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:33,060
Laura Power: Anyone going to come, I usually people tend to be democratic.

178
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:41,250
Laura Power: I think that's often how the group goes but anybody have any reflections on that one.

179
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:46,050
Laura Power: Okay i'll read your reflections tips on what you're really thought.

180
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:49,320
Brandon Ellsworth: About this, one may be needed.

181
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,430
Brandon Ellsworth: who's going two one.

182
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:52,590
Quintin Solano: Go ahead brandon.

183
00:29:52,590 --> 00:30:01,140
Brandon Ellsworth: I thought this one may be needed more questions, it was tough because I felt like a lot of the questions if you were just like I don't know.

184
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:07,500
Brandon Ellsworth: Not like a nice person, you would probably pick like there was a pretty simple answer that got you to democratic.

185
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:15,630
Brandon Ellsworth: I feel like they're they are our people they're good people they're more autocratic leaders, but you'd have to like to admit to some things that a lot of.

186
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:26,670
Brandon Ellsworth: You know, good people probably wouldn't want to admit to on this quiz I thought they could have asked the question is a little different or maybe included more questions.

187
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:34,830
Quintin Solano: I agree with brandon I was also gonna say I think like it's all circumstantial you know it's nice to be democratic, or even laissez faire if you can.

188
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:41,130
Quintin Solano: trust your team to do things, especially when it's like a low pressure environment, but if things need to get done right away and.

189
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:55,320
Quintin Solano: You are on a time crunch and things like that you might be more autocratic in those situations, so I just whenever I think of like leadership style for myself or other people, I always just see a combination of all of them just dependent upon circumstances yeah.

190
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:59,670
Laura Power: I think I agree with both of you, I think that's why I said this was kind of like the new right.

191
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:07,230
Laura Power: see if I can find a better leadership style quiz because it does kind of reminding us like magazine quizzes that you know take take and relieve them but.

192
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:17,850
Laura Power: And most of you do end up with a certain result and I think you're right brandon it's probably the way it's asked and just yeah just the way you feel it's kind of leads you to answer the questions.

193
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:25,050
Laura Power: and recognizing that there are different styles and ideally were able to move between style depending on the situation.

194
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:33,750
Laura Power: We all may have certain ways that come naturally to us, but it definitely depends on what's going on, too, so.

195
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:36,930
Laura Power: And then the next one, was the.

196
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:50,430
Laura Power: leadership skills and I have not analyzed all of yours, yet, but in the past, so I usually will look at them all they've all turned him in I haven't had a chance to read through all of yours, but in the past.

197
00:31:50,430 --> 00:32:01,230
Laura Power: The top leadership skills were time that people wanted to work on or time management managing performance mentoring, creating vision and managing conflict.

198
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:14,220
Laura Power: They tend to be similar every year, so i'm curious to get through all of yours and see whether any of that stood out or, especially for those of you working on my public health practitioners on here.

199
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:27,540
Laura Power: Are there certain ones that stood out to you as your leadership skills that you were hoping to work on or or were many of these things you can learn on the job.

200
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:40,080
Anthony Mack: One of the things that, at least for me personally, the two that I needed to work on the most was decision making in negotiation and I felt that that was a very interesting.

201
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:54,090
Anthony Mack: combination, because just reflecting on some of the leadership positions i've had on the past, and makes complete sense because I don't necessarily know when to stop negotiating and just make a decision.

202
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:56,460
Anthony Mack: So being able to look at.

203
00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:05,610
Anthony Mack: This as a whole as as my leadership strength, it was it was really interesting yeah it's great.

204
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:18,450
Kate E Schedel: I can share I thought my three lowest were managing conflict negotiating and advocacy and I think it's like I work for the Department of Health and there's a lot of like.

205
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:31,110
Kate E Schedel: What you can do and what you can't do in politics involved, and so, while I may feel comfortable in them it's not part of the culture of work, especially in a public health field and the State health department and so.

206
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:35,490
Kate E Schedel: Even if i'm improving my skills, I think I would always raise those my three Louis.

207
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:37,200
yeah.

208
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:49,080
Laura Power: yeah and the constraints of just like the governmental agency, how to you know work within the bounds that you have sometimes and can be heard.

209
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:56,430
Quintin Solano: And with a Anthony on that and Kate as well, I put negotiation was my first one i'm.

210
00:33:56,430 --> 00:34:02,460
Quintin Solano: Like negotiating for the team essentially you're negotiating for like better position or.

211
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:07,170
Quintin Solano: More resources or something like that is most of and then.

212
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:21,030
Quintin Solano: The other ones were like evaluation of TEAM members and being able to like critically evaluate instead of doing the whole like good job you did this really well my thing positive actually providing some you know more critical feedback.

213
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:25,020
Quintin Solano: For TEAM members.

214
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,280
Erin Thompson: For me.

215
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,390
Laura Power: To go ahead Aaron.

216
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:33,240
Erin Thompson: Please like one that is kind of always at the top of my list of the building is networking.

217
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:49,380
Erin Thompson: Because i'm more introverted so actually kind of you know, forced myself to play extrovert and it's just like so easy to avoid networking, you know opportunities so then like I never really know what say so that's always what am I.

218
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:51,720
Sharing.

219
00:34:51,720 --> 00:35:07,560
Yolaine A Civil: I also had networking on there to be killed for that similar kind of reason, I also think some of the environments that i've been in sort of self selected for me to develop certain skills and to develop their skills, depending on what a.

220
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:12,360
Yolaine A Civil: Month minimum, and I also say my social identity.

221
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,530
Kate E Schedel: That also.

222
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:17,730
Yolaine A Civil: or with those same thing some skills get pushed ahead and others don't.

223
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:19,530
Laura Power: mm hmm.

224
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:22,710
Laura Power: it's a great point you know.

225
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:39,480
Laura Power: Sometimes we just have that we learn, we have to learn Oh, you know just depending on what we're doing and some some things we just don't get a chance to do, maybe they're just not part of our role, or we don't get a big opportunity to do those things.

226
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:49,470
Laura Power: it's a long list there actually and you know this class of course we're not going to go through all of these with everybody, but I what I hope is that, having.

227
00:35:49,470 --> 00:36:00,930
Laura Power: One at least you know, having the having done the inventory for yourself and trying to think through what you want, and then think having some of the general concepts that will talk about.

228
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:07,110
Laura Power: And I think, especially when we get to the systems thinking and just even for your own self like, how can you.

229
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:20,460
Laura Power: Think about the bigger picture and how how you can plan to get things done, and even then having your own your own vision for where you want to go, so you can lead yourself to work on some of these things.

230
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:33,240
Laura Power: And hearing about some of the tools along the way, so if, after class quintin and I yesterday were talking about how like I have met most of us don't get training in negotiating and I had to negotiate something.

231
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:38,760
Laura Power: For myself, and so I decided to start I just searched podcasts and found.

232
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:54,900
Laura Power: found one that helped me and it actually did give me some strategies, I found very helpful and in my negotiation went well, I was in a good position as I told you yesterday, should have won that one, but you know i'm could be timid, at times, and I wanted to make sure I went in.

233
00:36:54,900 --> 00:37:00,540
Laura Power: And it was helpful gave me a strategy of how to bring up what I was trying to do so.

234
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:17,220
Laura Power: so good, I think I appreciate hearing about all the skills that you're trying to advance i'm excited to read through your reflections as well, and then you know really think about how your strengths can help you as you go forward so.

235
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:23,280
Laura Power: Yes, thank you, Kate I see that book there so very good alright.

236
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:31,290
Laura Power: Alright, so we are going to go into the portion now where you get to meet your team, and this team you'll be meeting with through the rest of the week.

237
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:40,590
Laura Power: And summer this part of activity really you're just kind of meeting greeting with each other, I mean i've heard your introductions yesterday, but you can kind of just chat a little bit more get to know each other.

238
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:58,350
Laura Power: And then think through your leadership experiences and then I want you to share what your strengths are so there's a little there's a worksheet and i'll show you on the canvas page actually kind of same thing here you go to your canvas page and see here.

239
00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:01,290
Laura Power: you'll go to meet your team.

240
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:10,740
Laura Power: And you can download this team's strengths grid, I think I have up already, let me see if I can.

241
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:13,140
Laura Power: Here we go.

242
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:18,750
Laura Power: So you'll fill this out together and it looks like a lot, but all it really is is putting your name.

243
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:30,900
Laura Power: So your team members names go here, and you can kind of put an x or something as to which strengths, that person has so then you'll see your whole team and how your team lines up with their strengths.

244
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:35,340
Laura Power: The creative part is I want you to come up with a team name.

245
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:42,450
Laura Power: it's very there's not much structure around that but, whatever you want to call yourselves you'll make yourself a team names that's your first group decision.

246
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:50,820
Laura Power: Together, and then just kind of summarize, you know what is your like, if you think through all the strings you have, what are your team's strengths and.

247
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:54,840
Laura Power: Maybe, based on the I do you see any challenges, or anything that might be ahead.

248
00:38:54,840 --> 00:39:01,650
Laura Power: And because you don't really know what you guys are getting into you know together, I guess, I should give you a little forewarning so.

249
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:09,120
Laura Power: you'll be thinking through that public health talent, so at the end of the day today you'll think about some topic that you want to focus on.

250
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:16,740
Laura Power: and through the class, you will apply systems thinking tools or like mapping the system and trying to understand the parts of the.

251
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:31,320
Laura Power: issue that you're interested in you'll think about a policy related to that and you'll be coming up with some visioning like vision and mission and thinking about values related to that would be kind of going through that kind of stuff together.

252
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:39,930
Laura Power: So that's what i'm going to ask you to do we've got your groups that pre assigned, and so let me just stop there and see if there's any questions.

253
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:42,060
Laura Power: But what i'm asking of you okay.

254
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:45,690
Yolaine A Civil: Oh, for the strengths to we use the clifton ones.

Laura Power: Yes, yeah yeah yes yep user and clifton's one.

256
00:39:51,870 --> 00:40:01,950
Laura Power: I think most of you done on a few if you weren't able to do them or, if you have an old one, you just do do what you can with what you have with your team.

257
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:05,310
Laura Power: Other questions.

258
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:25,080

259
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:36,570
Joshua Bosman: yeah i'm good to go, I just wanted to I was typing on a message, just now, I just wanted to let everyone know that there are, I think two groups where not everyone is here right now, and so.

260
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:43,260
Joshua Bosman: If you have like three people in your group, you can expect to have four or five by the end of the week.

261
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:45,780
Laura Power: Perfect thanks josh.

262
00:40:45,780 --> 00:41:08,640
yep.

263
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:12,450
Laura Power: You can pause the recording if you want now josh.

264
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:14,520
Laura Power: person now you.

265
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:17,280
Laura Power: Thank you josh I always forget.

266
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:24,750
Laura Power: Let me get back to sharing my screen and go back to my slides.

267
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:27,450
Laura Power: alright.

268
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:35,760
Laura Power: So so more kind of general leadership, but really trying to hone in on it specifically for public health.

269
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:46,950
Laura Power: And, and also, I think, for you know I just i'll say the public health system is very large so some of you that might be in more healthcare settings to I think a lot of us can apply as well.

270
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:57,750
Laura Power: So leadership for public health, and you guys gave your definitions of leadership yesterday, and I think specifically that in public health that makes sense to.

271
00:41:57,750 --> 00:42:09,120
Laura Power: But often it said that leadership is about mobilizing people organizations communities to tackle and take on the complex problems that we have today i'm.

272
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:20,010
Laura Power: Thinking about public health it's you know oftentimes are we're trying to do things at a more upstream approach right maybe compared to the traditional medical approach so.

273
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:33,420
Laura Power: You know, really trying to get to the upstream factors to try to may have a bigger population impact and so leading people and mobilizing communities to do that that's where we need leadership and public health.

274
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:43,680
Laura Power: I should share with you one textbook yesterday another one leading public health, they have different competencies they talk about that are important for leadership and public health, and again.

275
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:50,130
Laura Power: Many different ways of looking at it, but what this group, points out, is they think that some of the important competencies are.

276
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:59,490
Laura Power: To be able to invigorate bold pursuit of population health so being able to help people move forward and create these foundation and public health programs.

277
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:05,310
Laura Power: To engage diverse others are thinking about lots of different partners and lots of different viewpoints.

278
00:43:05,310 --> 00:43:14,490
Laura Power: And this idea of giving up control to the partnership and I will be, I think, a concept that just be in some of the leadership styles for public health.

279
00:43:14,490 --> 00:43:24,030
Laura Power: Effectively wielding power so thinking about where who has authority and where it's used to for people in government and public health.

280
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:35,970
Laura Power: mean oftentimes public health codes or the law will establish the authority and sometimes certain positions have authority with them so it's where you use and how you use that authority.

281
00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:45,900
Laura Power: Preparing for surprise, and I think we're probably people working in public health know this better than anybody, but in many, many things people things don't go as according to plan.

282
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:55,710
Laura Power: pandemics happen, you know all kinds of things happen that kind of interrupt you know, maybe the planned out activities, you may have had so preparing for surprise.

283
00:43:55,710 --> 00:44:05,760
Laura Power: And then driving execution for continuous improvement and a lot of this is about thinking about kind of quality improvement processes having established metrics holding others accountable.

284
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:15,210
Laura Power: And having to skew I processes to go for it, so these are the competencies that this group thinks is important for leading public health.

285
00:44:15,210 --> 00:44:24,330
Laura Power: And also They point out different traits that may be important for public health leaders, and I know, yesterday we went through lots of different descriptions of types of treats there's you know.

286
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:38,490
Laura Power: On ending list of what might be important traits from the same textbook leading public health, this is what they point out, is what traits might be important for public health leaders, some of these you talked about yesterday I think Aaron mentioned integrity.

287
00:44:38,490 --> 00:44:47,760
Laura Power: Courage also was a word you all thought of yesterday, being able to make difficult decisions, and I think you'll end you actually use the word courage and persistence.

288
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:54,960
Laura Power: um someone said persistence, was it, I think, yesterday you might have said persistence.

289
00:44:54,960 --> 00:45:04,950
Laura Power: comfort with ambiguity that's coming out very clear as we've gone through the pandemic and not having the answers are not always knowing what the right approaches.

290
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:20,940
Laura Power: Initiative empathy kind of a Human and People approach to things and passion which I think you see in any people in public health well that's just from this textbook again you've all thought about different trades that are important in general.

291
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:29,100
Laura Power: we'll talk more about values again later in the week, but when you think about leadership and how you come to your vision and your mission there's often.

292
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:35,910
Laura Power: An established set of values or or values that are intrinsic to you as a person or maybe to your organization.

293
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:48,630
Laura Power: And again from the same textbook they talk about what values might be important to leaders in public health and so these are some there are listed i'm sure you could come up with others, this is not just a perfect list but.

294
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:58,770
Laura Power: I think you know social justice reliance on evidence for sure interdependence, knowing that things are all connected respect transparency.

295
00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:14,640
Laura Power: The understanding the role of the government and understanding how the Community can be self determining I think our values of do stand out in public health and are important to public health, and maybe to other professions as well.

296
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:23,100
Laura Power: So we'll get into we've talked about some leadership approaches and leadership styles yesterday, I want to mention a few others that are often talked about in public health.

297
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:33,060
Laura Power: So as you're studying leadership styles, these are a couple that I want to just have you kind of remember as you when you when you leave this class and you talk about if you can remember anything from.

298
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:38,490
Laura Power: Class about leadership and public health, what what is some of the leadership styles that you might see in public health.

299
00:46:38,490 --> 00:46:47,190
Laura Power: And some of that stand out to me our servant leadership adaptive leadership, especially we start talking about complex problems which we face in public health.

300
00:46:47,190 --> 00:47:02,280
Laura Power: and collective leadership which is you heard me, we talked about public health 3.0 yesterday, the idea of really you know working across sectors and working with many people to move forward so we'll go through each of these in a little bit of detail.

301
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:12,420
Laura Power: And for each of these I have videos to show you so we'll do some some some videos first is servant leadership, and this is where really The focus is on.

302
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:18,360
Laura Power: Other on the people that you're serving so as a leader or as a leading organization.

303
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:29,940
Laura Power: This is really about doing what is needed for the people that you or your organization are serving as sometimes described as a social style of leadership and.

304
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:44,610
Laura Power: It can even be to the point of sacrificing the goals or needs of the leader or the leading organization in order to serve the people or or the Community that you're trying to.

305
00:47:44,610 --> 00:47:57,570
Laura Power: work with and so sort of a different way of looking sort of traditional leadership is sometimes i'm like top down and servant leadership really is kind of flipped around in the other direction.

306
00:47:57,570 --> 00:48:08,760
Laura Power: So here i'm going to stop and play a video, and this is one as we talked about podcast I do want to highlight and I have the link on the canvas page but it's.

307
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:17,940
Laura Power: I think it's called voices and yeah voices and leadership series there's the link on the canvas page, this is really a nice one it's done by Harvard School of Public Health.

308
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:31,230
Laura Power: And in this one they're interviewing Dr David satcher, who was a surgeon General of the US and his the title of his was about servant leadership.

309
00:48:31,230 --> 00:48:35,310
Laura Power: So let me i've got all my.

310
00:48:35,310 --> 00:48:42,810
Laura Power: videos lined up here, so I mean this one.

311
00:48:42,810 --> 00:48:52,050
Laura Power: All right, and i'll think a thumbs up to me there's nothing to fear it's such a pleasure to have this opportunity to speak with you today and hearing.

312
00:48:52,050 --> 00:49:12,330
Laura Power: This wonderful history and journey your leadership training i'm wondering if you could share with us a little bit about your early life experiences and how they help to both frame and to motivate us in certain directions and pass and how you link that to the path that you've chosen.

313
00:49:12,330 --> 00:49:16,770
Laura Power: Well, thank you, gentlemen delighted to be with you.

314
00:49:16,770 --> 00:49:22,380
Laura Power: I grew up on a farm outside of anniston Alabama.

315
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:33,270
Laura Power: happiness had 10 children to that early on, but I think, for me, it was a very severe illness, when I was two years of age.

316
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:45,420
Laura Power: I guess it started with the call and and pneumonia and my parents had already lost a child by your earlier for similar illness, so they made a major effort.

317
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:54,120
Laura Power: To get the one black position and allison to come out to the farm, it was Dr Jackson and he did he came out on his all day.

318
00:49:54,120 --> 00:50:13,410
Laura Power: and spend almost all data from what i'm told, but he also won my parents that he didn't expect me to survive this illness but took the time to show them what to do to give me the best chance of surviving and and being comfortable and they must have done really.

319
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:23,130
Laura Power: Well, my mother told me the story almost every day so by the time I was five years old, because the one thing I wanted to do is meet that Jackson.

320
00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:32,010
Laura Power: So they promised me that for my for my 50th birthday they're going to take me an autonomy, Dr Jackson, so I was really excited.

321
00:50:32,010 --> 00:50:42,810
Laura Power: I never met him he he died that you had age of 54 stroke, but then, by the time I was six I was telling her about I was going to be done, just like Dr Jackson.

322
00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:52,770
Laura Power: And I meant it and I knew that I was assured that is in thing i've been in my life so that was sort of how it started, for me, my parents were great people.

323
00:50:52,770 --> 00:51:00,690
Laura Power: Neither one didn't finish elementary school, but they were great parents and much of who I am relates to that experience.

324
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:06,930
Laura Power: When you think about who you are in those experiences, but you also think about the times you think about.

325
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:14,010
Laura Power: What it was life in Alabama and rural Alabama at that time, and as you move forward to your time at morehouse.

326
00:51:14,010 --> 00:51:25,710
Laura Power: Can you speak a little bit about how the times helped shape who you are and an opportunity to just you know, Dr Jackson could not admit patients to the hospital announced, and if they didn't take black patients and Sunni.

327
00:51:25,710 --> 00:51:33,660
Laura Power: Like physicians he was the only black physician around cannot admit it, and that continued throughout the south don't for many years.

328
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:44,190
Laura Power: So I think the the segregation and discrimination, certainly helped define my early years I mean not even being able to go in store and buy an ice cream Cone.

329
00:51:44,190 --> 00:52:02,760
Laura Power: Those were things that you had to come to excel because that's the way it was it was really not until I got to to morehouse college in Atlanta, but I really got the opportunity for first time to do what our call confront racism people like.

330
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:10,110
Laura Power: Marian Wright element, who went on the phone children's Defense fund, they were upperclassman oldest Moss and others.

331
00:52:10,110 --> 00:52:22,980
Laura Power: They they will leaders and I got involved in the student movement went to jail four times went to prison once so following them and because Martin Luther King jr and his brother ad.

332
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:30,720
Laura Power: So I was a serious student, I will make that very clear very serious student I was determined to go to Medical School.

333
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:38,280
Laura Power: But I had to confront racism, it was the best opportunity that I would ever hang out, and so I took the risk.

334
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:46,680
Laura Power: of doing it, even though I didn't know how it would affect my my my progress in school, and I was fortunate, I mean not everybody who.

335
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:58,440
Laura Power: participated in the movement went on to finish school and, as you know, some people are still lives, so it was a very serious movement, but it has a lot to do with who I am and what I stand for.

336
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:17,520
Laura Power: When when I see that you talk about being willing to take risk and take a stand, I also think about a career being first so being a pioneer of of being first in your class in high school to be one of three to graduate from the high school and going to college.

337
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:26,370
Laura Power: The first African American to earn an mdm PhD from case, the first African American at CDC as being a pioneer.

338
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:38,910
Laura Power: What does it take to be a pioneer and what what What did you how did you experience it, and most of that well, to be honest Madonna was set out to be a pioneer.

339
00:53:38,910 --> 00:53:51,240
Laura Power: It happened because of what I hear about to set you up leadership institute at my school medicine, we have a saying, and it is that, in order to.

340
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:59,850
Laura Power: eliminate disparities in health and to achieve health equity, we need leaders who first care now they need leaders who knows enough.

341
00:53:59,850 --> 00:54:08,910
Laura Power: leaders who have the courage to do enough and leaders who will persevere until the job is done so with me It started with caring.

342
00:54:08,910 --> 00:54:19,980
Laura Power: And tearing about the problems that i've grown up with caring about getting myself in a position where I could make a significant contribution to solving those problems.

343
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:34,380
Laura Power: So I would say what came when I came out of Alabama with was an unusual commitment to to helping to solve those problems and making things better, and it was better.

344
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:37,290
Laura Power: It is a few more minutes.

345
00:54:37,290 --> 00:54:39,960
Laura Power: to reflect reflections on this.

346
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:45,690
See.

347
00:54:45,690 --> 00:54:50,100
Laura Power: Patricia team when I went to the CDC.

348
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:56,640
Laura Power: They had never had a woman to serve as the deputy director never had a woman to serve as Director of an institute.

349
00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:03,180
Laura Power: So, looking around our printed club room who was eight months pregnant, but away from now pointed her.

350
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:18,090
Laura Power: To be not definitely brilliant Anybody who knows the name classroom hows about her work with toxic shock syndrome so she became a deputy and just did an outstanding job Helene gayle a name that most you probably know.

351
00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:26,370
Laura Power: was ultimately appointed to hit the first instituted to CDC on HIV, AIDS and scd TV so.

352
00:55:26,370 --> 00:55:46,830
Laura Power: I did extend that i've been successful in leadership roles, it has been because i've been successful at being able to appoint strong leadership teams and to really win now managing a leadership team is not easy, I mean, especially if they're good people they have big egos.

353
00:55:46,830 --> 00:56:00,630
Laura Power: Which is why some people have trouble pointing strong people because they have been they get nervous about people who is strong may be stronger than you in certain areas, but it's a part of appointing a strong leadership team managing that team.

354
00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:03,660
Laura Power: So i've had some great experiences.

355
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:16,530
Laura Power: Right so i'll stop there for this one um any any thoughts, especially as to why he might be an example of servant leadership.

356
00:56:16,530 --> 00:56:24,270
Laura Power: What did you hear in his interview that seemed to fit that model.

357
00:56:24,270 --> 00:56:26,850
Quintin Solano: Every time, he said he did something.

358
00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:36,060
Quintin Solano: Typically, followed it up with like a reason of why he did it and it was almost always because of the Community or trying to combat larger issues things bigger than himself.

359
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:45,300
Quintin Solano: And it sounds like he really worked towards putting himself in positions, where he was a part of something that was moving towards.

360
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:54,480
Quintin Solano: You know it's like a team based environment that was moving towards a mission that was bigger than the sum of its parts is the idea I got from him.

361
00:56:54,480 --> 00:57:00,510
You.

362
00:57:00,510 --> 00:57:06,090
Anne Victoria Lee: seem very motivated by his empathy and caring.

363
00:57:06,090 --> 00:57:08,550
Anne Victoria Lee: sounds like cancer really big heart.

364
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:12,120
Laura Power: agree yeah I think that definitely fits in the model of.

365
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:14,490
Laura Power: passion.

366
00:57:14,490 --> 00:57:26,610
Yolaine A Civil: And I was gonna say also that I agree with everyone else, but also really shocked me was how courageous, he is because it's not easy to be my mother's family's from rural Alabama to.

367
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:35,820
Yolaine A Civil: It is not easy to come from that background, and to fight the barriers that he had to fight and to be the first, the only one in certain positions that he.

368
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:52,920
Yolaine A Civil: Is it, and he you know, obviously succeeded with you know grace and integrity and all these other things, but you first have to be really you know, like, I was saying, you have to be okay with being the only one lot of situations, and it can be hard.

369
00:57:52,920 --> 00:58:00,270
Laura Power: We.

370
00:58:00,270 --> 00:58:08,910
Laura Power: Just to add all your comments, I think, to just the risky he took so kind of following along with what you Linda said.

371
00:58:08,910 --> 00:58:17,490
Laura Power: Putting yourself at risk to serve this purpose, and this thing that was very important to him so.

372
00:58:17,490 --> 00:58:28,140
Laura Power: I think you know another example of Martin Luther King jr is often cited as an example of a servant leader and sometimes sometimes when people talk about servant leadership.

373
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:42,750
Laura Power: It almost sounds intimidating like it's hard to be a servant, we are and what you're striving to be some kind of leader, you know, maybe this is hard, and it may really depend on what it is you're trying to lead and where you.

374
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:51,930
Laura Power: how you feel about something how important it is to you, but those are just some of the comments i've heard so I like reflecting on that example.

375
00:58:51,930 --> 00:59:03,690
Laura Power: let's see here, I will so just a couple slides at the next level servant leadership there's another type of leadership that's called adaptive leadership and.

376
00:59:03,690 --> 00:59:07,650
Laura Power: I don't know if you've heard of this one before, but it really gets at some of how.

377
00:59:07,650 --> 00:59:16,350
Laura Power: it's really about how we handle complex problems and how we make decisions around that, so this is recognizing that in this leadership style.

378
00:59:16,350 --> 00:59:25,380
Laura Power: You you kind of recognize it, you know there's not one expert who can answer all the difficult questions that people have to come together and find solutions.

379
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:32,880
Laura Power: And leaders with this style tend to be more open to feedback ready to change and are able to handle adaptive challenges.

380
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:40,890
Laura Power: tell you a little more about in the next slide but they're kind of basically ready to try to keep moving things in a positive direction taking feedback.

381
00:59:40,890 --> 00:59:46,800
Laura Power: and understanding that things are like seeing the bigger picture and understanding how to.

382
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:57,810
Laura Power: adapt to that or change to that this will get into some of the ideas of systems thinking so I I like pointing this one out one because it does get mentioned in different public health literature.

383
00:59:57,810 --> 01:00:04,890
Laura Power: But to because it ties into the idea of systems thinking and complex problems which we'll talk more about tomorrow too.

384
01:00:04,890 --> 01:00:15,810
Laura Power: But this is basically hoping to have purposeful evolution in real time, based on how people are making decisions and just to point out like these.

385
01:00:15,810 --> 01:00:26,250
Laura Power: technical problems versus adaptive challenges, so a technical problem can be something where you know, there is somebody there's always an expert it might even be a very.

386
01:00:26,250 --> 01:00:40,050
Laura Power: Challenging problem or something that requires great expertise, but there is someone who knows the answer to it or or you know, there is an answer somewhere and it just you have to like figure out that answer, and then you go in and do it so.

387
01:00:40,050 --> 01:00:45,150
Laura Power: That can kind of be worked out pretty quickly, because there is a right answer somewhere.

388
01:00:45,150 --> 01:00:57,870
Laura Power: But what's thought to be these adaptive challenges as they're not really that clear, they can be nebulous there's not really one right answer this kind of gets to the idea of complex problems and how you define complexity.

389
01:00:57,870 --> 01:01:07,800
Laura Power: This really is about people coming together understand the values and beliefs and where there's resistance and trying things and learning from what worked and what didn't work.

390
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:18,810
Laura Power: And going forward so an adaptive leader is aware of these differences and is able to kind of bring people together and respond in this way to help move things forward.

391
01:01:18,810 --> 01:01:33,180
Laura Power: And i've got this this I do a video for this one as well this one's a little more a little more cheesy than the other one but i'm still going to show it to you, I think it because I feel like this adaptive leadership, can be a little bit nebulous to understand what it is.

392
01:01:33,180 --> 01:01:37,800
Laura Power: So see if this helps I tried to skip the commercials but let's see.

393
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:44,640
Laura Power: let's see if at all, if I waited leadership explained in less than four minutes.

394
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:54,780
Laura Power: matter our position, our role, our context for each of us the opportunity for leadership is, on the other side of the question, what should I do.

395
01:01:54,780 --> 01:02:04,230
Laura Power: An important first step in personal leadership is dead to understand our perks and the alignment of overall purpose with.

396
01:02:04,230 --> 01:02:12,900
Laura Power: metal be able to see everything all the things we know in our position to be true of the facts, we can collect all the things we see.

397
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:25,770
Laura Power: In one simple case, this is the pool of data, our reality, a lot of our own context and it's a place we don't spend much time in because we want to leap into action.

398
01:02:25,770 --> 01:02:47,190
Laura Power: But when we when the urge to get things done immediately and start entertaining multiple interpretation of what we see multiple explanation on what happens, little by little, we climb up the ladder we start seeing more than one thing more than one reason, more than one way things are.

399
01:02:47,190 --> 01:02:56,430
Laura Power: We are on our way to the balcony about the day to day for a fresh, new perspective, where we begin to see different.

400
01:02:56,430 --> 01:03:05,280
Laura Power: Two very distinct kinds of work, getting too far is from the balcony the kind of work is dealing with technical problems.

401
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:15,690
Laura Power: The expertise expertise driven deliverables that require efficient execution based on current know how controller, following all procedures.

402
01:03:15,690 --> 01:03:38,550
Laura Power: The technical work is the work that you do every day for 90% of the time, in your day to day job for this work clear authority structures provided routine protection order and direction great work like this is performed every day to procedures plans known responses in every organization.

403
01:03:38,550 --> 01:03:42,060
Laura Power: Yet this is not the work of leadership.

404
01:03:42,060 --> 01:03:50,760
Laura Power: There is another kind of work much smaller and much harder to make out and very murky is the work of dealing with adaptive challenges.

405
01:03:50,760 --> 01:04:06,750
Laura Power: Very disentangle work we don't have yet an instruction manual for work, for which much more than a quick fix because even my work requires people to retain their own values loyalties and habits.

406
01:04:06,750 --> 01:04:15,480
Laura Power: This is the work of leadership, and the only way out is engaging consciously and collectively learning and learning and relearning.

407
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:23,520
Laura Power: To build was next in the middle of uncertainty and ambiguity now this work is no more than 10% of what you do every day.

408
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:32,520
Laura Power: But this work is about dancing on the edge of what you know, or what you expect or to consider true or what you would do by default.

409
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:39,480
Laura Power: it's a place where you need to experiment with a sense that things may go well or things might go wrong.

410
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:50,250
Laura Power: And you can do it alone you gather a group of people willing to roll up their sleeves and factions quickly surface group of people are in favor people they're against.

411
01:04:50,250 --> 01:05:02,730
Laura Power: Other they're Okay, with the status quo, they sense the danger and do an unspoken calculation or let's just take the prognosis make the risk of the status.

412
01:05:02,730 --> 01:05:08,700
Laura Power: Is a point people they care about look back inevitably conflict arises.

413
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:18,960
Laura Power: Your job will be to orchestrate the conflict as people in this world become fearful their expertise authority security being challenged insufficient or not helpful.

414
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:35,910
Laura Power: Yet the work leadership here is holding people through this loss imagine having a hand on a thermostat turning the heat up and down to keep people fired up enough around purpose, without having them boil over their own Sir so uncertain.

415
01:05:35,910 --> 01:05:44,370
Laura Power: Finally, you reach a sweet spot of leadership, where innovation flows and people start asking you questions speaking the unspoken.

416
01:05:44,370 --> 01:05:58,950
Laura Power: Western their own assumptions describing novel practice building fragile new partnership across organizational life and, in doing this, they start making progress on critical issues together.

417
01:05:58,950 --> 01:06:01,980
Right.

418
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:03,420
here.

419
01:06:03,420 --> 01:06:20,460
Laura Power: And, Kate and quintin I see you put some books in the chat so thank you for that i'll try to remember to go back and add those to our resources, everybody has some leader to you want to make any comments about the about the books or the just idea of adaptive leadership.

420
01:06:20,460 --> 01:06:31,470
Quintin Solano: yeah that book dichotomy leadership was written after the like extreme ownership book that jacko had wrote written he had a lot of feedback about that first book it's.

421
01:06:31,470 --> 01:06:44,520
Quintin Solano: kind of on the more I mean extreme is in the title, but it is a little bit more on the extreme end of like taking ownership of responsibility and stuff like that, and so the dichotomy of leadership talks a lot more about being adaptive.

422
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:56,340
Quintin Solano: Essentially, in your leadership style and knowing when to take on more back off give more to your team give more to certain TEAM members who are selling and things like that.

423
01:06:56,340 --> 01:06:59,670
Quintin Solano: kind of relates to a lot of this.

424
01:06:59,670 --> 01:07:06,000
Laura Power: is helpful.

425
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,120
Laura Power: Okay, thanks for sharing that too.

426
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:23,670
Laura Power: I think this style I think it's important to understand this one, I think some of it is probably feels a little bit nebulous, but it is about that you know how you handle these complex problems and I do want to point out that.

427
01:07:23,670 --> 01:07:33,540
Laura Power: This is also recognized by some of our public health societies, this is the National Association of county and city health officials are neato.

428
01:07:33,540 --> 01:07:51,240
Laura Power: And they talk about the importance of adaptive leadership in you know, trying to move things forward, and they have some other kind of in their literature talking about what's an adaptive organization and how how that may be needed for public health transformation.

429
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:59,160
Laura Power: Okay, so that's adaptive leadership and then the other one I think it's important for us to remember is this idea of collective leadership.

430
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:09,090
Laura Power: has actually many names you mean distributed shared collaborative participatory integrative spread leadership there's a lot of different ways that people talk about this.

431
01:08:09,090 --> 01:08:18,420
Laura Power: I tend to use the term collective leadership, but you'll find that this described in many different ways, and this is idea of lots of people working together toward a shared goal.

432
01:08:18,420 --> 01:08:29,880
Laura Power: With collective action and with the you know, trying to maximize and get everyone together kind of on the same page for this idea of achieving the common good.

433
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:37,260
Laura Power: And so it's really about collaboration there's a big focus on collaboration.

434
01:08:37,260 --> 01:08:48,930
Laura Power: So again, this is kind of having a joint and flexible leadership and is the idea that it's embracing diversity of people and perspectives and.

435
01:08:48,930 --> 01:09:07,080
Laura Power: Creating a sense of interdependence and deeper trust within an organization and across sectors as well, creates conditions for social learning and begins with a shared dream and emerges from relationship so a lot of this is about building trust working together, having a shared vision.

436
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:18,270
Laura Power: Sometimes these are compared is what individual leadership looks like versus collective leadership, and you know there's a leader of followers or it's kind of get that.

437
01:09:18,270 --> 01:09:22,650
Laura Power: I think what a Leo was commenting on yesterday, just like the different levels of leadership.

438
01:09:22,650 --> 01:09:37,380
Laura Power: In this way, collective leadership it's almost you know there's many leaders coming together in some ways you're kind of leading yourself, as you all work together towards a common agenda so there's some differences here.

439
01:09:37,380 --> 01:09:48,450
Laura Power: There, so this may not be a surprise, but there can be a lot of challenges, when you bring lots of people together and you're trying to share leadership or spread the leadership around different organizations and different people.

440
01:09:48,450 --> 01:10:03,390
Laura Power: trust and respect is a big one, making sure the right people and i'll do the need to be there are there in participating in this there can be lots of conflict, sometimes or just even getting people on the same page can be hard.

441
01:10:03,390 --> 01:10:11,070
Laura Power: Just not and not really be able to make decisions together, and there can be a lot of other differences culture.

442
01:10:11,070 --> 01:10:13,350
Laura Power: Religious.

443
01:10:13,350 --> 01:10:23,700
Laura Power: Ethical viewpoints that can be challenging and just inability to agree or implement so it can be very slow.

444
01:10:23,700 --> 01:10:34,890
Laura Power: So there's lots of ideas about how to try to improve this well i'm leading up to some different frameworks that I want to introduce that's why i'm kind of leading up to this idea of collective leadership that's the concept of it.

445
01:10:34,890 --> 01:10:46,560
Laura Power: Then, how do you do it, maybe i'll stop and ask the Group if those of you may be does anybody have any experience trying to use this style doing collective leadership.

446
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:57,780
Laura Power: or using approaches of collaboration, maybe with practice with other partners.

447
01:10:57,780 --> 01:11:00,540
Right.

448
01:11:00,540 --> 01:11:04,950
Laura Power: All right, well, if you think of anything along the way to maybe you've seen something.

449
01:11:04,950 --> 01:11:17,520
Laura Power: And I think a lot of times our public health agencies are trying to do this at the end and there's an offer there's academic partnerships with different organizations that are also trying to support this i'll give you a few examples coming on to.

450
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:23,790
Laura Power: But anyway, here are some conditions for effective partnering which follows with the collective leadership idea so thinking about.

451
01:11:23,790 --> 01:11:35,520
Laura Power: You know intention individually individually intention individual behavior thinking about the culture of organizations and how they're how that's communicated and all the different viewpoints that might be there.

452
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:45,330
Laura Power: And really having some structure and bringing people together, and I think structure is one way to think about how to approach doing collective leadership.

453
01:11:45,330 --> 01:12:03,750
Laura Power: i'm pointing out here that there's just like me, Joe pointed out the importance of adaptive leadership, who and other organizations pointed out the importance of collective aka participatory leadership and that you know there's.

454
01:12:03,750 --> 01:12:13,050
Laura Power: Not having like just domineering agencies or individuals taking things on but recognizing that things are complex and that we are all interconnected.

455
01:12:13,050 --> 01:12:24,720
Laura Power: And so, this idea of distributed, but not disconnected as a participatory leadership so it's this is being talked about and certain public health organizations as well.

456
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:31,560
Laura Power: And they in this in this report, they actually give some examples of where collective leadership has been successful in global health.

457
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:37,230
Laura Power: And it gives these are pretty large examples, actually, if you read the case studies talking about.

458
01:12:37,230 --> 01:12:47,820
Laura Power: Big agencies coming together to work on tobacco control the global framework convention alliance, the HIV, AIDS response it's kind of a very large example.

459
01:12:47,820 --> 01:12:52,350
Laura Power: Antimicrobial resistance and preventing road traffic injuries So these are.

460
01:12:52,350 --> 01:13:05,850
Laura Power: Different examples of how in these are large global health like different you know agencies different countries, different all kinds of different large organizations coming together but that's how they talked about in this who report.

461
01:13:05,850 --> 01:13:15,930
Laura Power: Okay last video, so I know one video for each leadership style this one kind of get that collective leadership and then some of the challenges around it.

462
01:13:15,930 --> 01:13:44,100
Laura Power: there's a different group sharing their experiences about it.

463
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:54,390
Laura Power: The shortest distance between two points is always collaboration is always partnership.

464
01:13:54,390 --> 01:14:10,770
Laura Power: We began the project with everybody thrilled with one another and so excited about what it was, we are embarking upon brand new Public Private Partnership not anything we had ever done before.

465
01:14:10,770 --> 01:14:18,720
Laura Power: We began to work with the partners who we'd already been working with on affordable housing developments to say.

466
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:37,500
Laura Power: How can we better align our work of the early conversations really go with this concept could this be done could a private institution in the city former private, public partnership that could work in the beginning, everyone was a skeptic I was a skeptic everyone was a skeptic.

467
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:41,370
Laura Power: Nobody ever done it.

468
01:14:41,370 --> 01:14:50,940
Laura Power: One of the things that we've learned is that Colocation doesn't by itself equal coordination or collaboration, there were so many different dimensions to this.

469
01:14:50,940 --> 01:15:00,300
Laura Power: design the programming, the use of the land, the financing of the project very different cultures very different operating styles.

470
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:08,520
Laura Power: So all of us approach issues from the neighborhood level some from an institutional level, something that governmental level.

471
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:14,790
Laura Power: None of us use the same data system so some use salesforce some years I picked the outcomes.

472
01:15:14,790 --> 01:15:22,500
Laura Power: to excel to like completely different systems we went back and forth about the allotment of parking spaces for staff one point.

473
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:39,480
Laura Power: When we were talking and we thought we were talking about the same thing, but we weren't perfection can be the enemy of the very, very good, we know that we're never going to get everything right in every community, the first time, but we've got to try some new things.

474
01:15:39,480 --> 01:15:51,180
Laura Power: it's just critical that the leaders in these organizations understand in value that partnership, what has made it work is that we're all committed.

475
01:15:51,180 --> 01:16:02,190
Laura Power: To stay at the table until we find the third way, I think, having trust early on, is critical and you develop trust by getting to know each other by being honest.

476
01:16:02,190 --> 01:16:08,490
Laura Power: By being forthright was strong point for us to come back to what our vision is around creating this healthy neighborhood.

477
01:16:08,490 --> 01:16:20,670
Laura Power: And then, working with the coalition and working with the partners around understanding the vision and about year three or year for you will have felt you're doing a whole lot of work and you haven't seen much change yet.

478
01:16:20,670 --> 01:16:27,660
Laura Power: But what happens when you get about your five you blow right through that wall.

479
01:16:27,660 --> 01:16:30,300
Laura Power: it's really exciting.

480
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:38,760
Laura Power: it's exciting work because people's lives are really cheap in terms of what we will be able to bring to the neighborhood.

481
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:52,980
Laura Power: The additional services increase access to all kinds of services, we absolutely think this without this collaboration will paying a pound of cure.

482
01:16:52,980 --> 01:17:08,070
Laura Power: for things that an ounce of prevention will address you're naive to think that you can do something like this alone, you can the magic is the partners forming them maintaining.

483
01:17:08,070 --> 01:17:16,050
Laura Power: More resources more innovation, more creativity and if we can get down the silos that we billion.

484
01:17:16,050 --> 01:17:29,670
Laura Power: I think it's gonna be much more effective and the different great opportunity, so I think it's an interception that and it's really is what the driver and what will really change communities for for.

485
01:17:29,670 --> 01:17:39,780
Laura Power: All right, so they kind of took us through the challenges of bringing everyone together and they ended on a positive note that they stuck with it, but you know I point that one out.

486
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:53,340
Laura Power: Because I think it does highlight that it takes a long time you think about bringing all these different organizations together, and it can be challenging to build trust and the relationships and.

487
01:17:53,340 --> 01:17:56,190
Laura Power: develop things further.

488
01:17:56,190 --> 01:18:03,510
Laura Power: So I do want to point out there's a lot of different tools and frameworks that can be used to think about collective leadership.

489
01:18:03,510 --> 01:18:12,300
Laura Power: And that will lead to one that I want to focus on a little bit more, which is called collective impact, but i'll just point out that there's just different tools that you can use and.

490
01:18:12,300 --> 01:18:22,260
Laura Power: I think, from what talking to other people that have done this more in the field, you know there's many different tools and sometimes after you get more experience with it, you might pull.

491
01:18:22,260 --> 01:18:30,150
Laura Power: Once you once you like from all these different frameworks together and kind of use them as you need, but there are some frameworks, you can follow this.

492
01:18:30,150 --> 01:18:42,810
Laura Power: This guide here do some tips about how to do collective leadership and they talk about you know how to build teams, the importance of trust and managing power dynamics and thinking about innovation.

493
01:18:42,810 --> 01:18:55,050
Laura Power: Taking a systems approach, how you use data and how you achieve impact working across so why aligning your values and using leverage points sharing knowledge and learning.

494
01:18:55,050 --> 01:19:03,120
Laura Power: All these principles you'll hear about again with systems thinking as well, so I think kind of lines up with what we're trying to learn in the class this week.

495
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:08,670
Laura Power: And again so there's these different frameworks, because this can be very complex and messy.

496
01:19:08,670 --> 01:19:16,500
Laura Power: And frameworks can at least help or give you some approach to how you do it so here's a workbook that will go through different stages.

497
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:21,390
Laura Power: This link is here if you're interested in this a couple others to point out, is this.

498
01:19:21,390 --> 01:19:27,960
Laura Power: map framework, which is always forget what it stands for, I have to look at the title mobilizing action through planning and partnerships.

499
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:41,730
Laura Power: Has anyone used this approach of occasional had students through internships or three jobs that have done map with local health departments or others, sometimes I see Laura has okay.

500
01:19:41,730 --> 01:19:46,110
Laura Power: i'm going to say anything about Laura was it easy was a hard.

501
01:19:46,110 --> 01:19:52,800
Laura Grage: No, I haven't necessarily use it i've just heard of the concept and of its use in my case that's familiar.

502
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:57,390
Laura Power: yep exactly, so this is one I think I feel like I hear about this one, a lot, too, and I.

503
01:19:57,390 --> 01:20:05,730
Laura Power: i've had students that were doing an internship locally use this approach, I forget what they were I forget what they're working on, but I know they use this approach.

504
01:20:05,730 --> 01:20:11,610
Laura Power: Trying to bring partners together, so this is one framework that sometimes you hear about so like laura's heard about.

505
01:20:11,610 --> 01:20:22,350
Laura Power: The other one that I think has become popular is like and it's like I think because it's sort of easy to understand is one called collective impact and collective impact has these different.

506
01:20:22,350 --> 01:20:34,260
Laura Power: Parts of it, where there's a common agenda that's used to bring people together their shared measurement so everyone's having access to the same data and kind of knowing how they're doing.

507
01:20:34,260 --> 01:20:43,950
Laura Power: mutually reinforcing activities, which means like things are good for every like trying to do, participating in the partnership is helping everybody it's mutually beneficial and reinforcing the work.

508
01:20:43,950 --> 01:20:52,740
Laura Power: But there's good communication that's continuous continuous and consistent and this idea of a backbone support organization which is meant to be like a neutral.

509
01:20:52,740 --> 01:21:08,010
Laura Power: organization in the models i've seen have tended to be academic or health system type partners where they're meant to be neutral or they're supposed to be neutral anyway and they're kind of trying to support different organizations out there.

510
01:21:08,010 --> 01:21:10,080
Laura Power: So.

511
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:16,470
Laura Power: This, I think it's kind of just become like the buzzword now, sometimes for this type of leadership collective impact.

512
01:21:16,470 --> 01:21:30,120
Laura Power: Again there's other ways of doing this and some critics of this will say that you know we've been doing this for a long time is just somebody kind of coined this term and it's sort of stuck, but this is one framework that you can look at, and I think can be helpful.

513
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:40,740
Laura Power: So then, this the collective impact model basically with those five pieces of it that I showed you in the last picture to here's more of the same.

514
01:21:40,740 --> 01:21:51,480
Laura Power: And you know here's a, this was an article talking about in you know collective impact was really beyond just collaboration, they use this to try to help have the outcomes that they wanted to have.

515
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:58,320
Laura Power: And just a couple examples, these are some local examples where i've seen some organizations working on this.

516
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:14,370
Laura Power: Are Henry Ford allegiance health is health system near Mary Ann arbor that has participated in Community collective impact often serving as that backbone the backbone support organization.

517
01:22:14,370 --> 01:22:25,740
Laura Power: So, with many other Community partners have worked on things, looking at, so these different initiatives cradle to career health improvement organization and financial stability network.

518
01:22:25,740 --> 01:22:32,010
Laura Power: So one was just like looking at basically kind of supporting children that was one collective impact model.

519
01:22:32,010 --> 01:22:42,090
Laura Power: On this other was a health improvement organization, bringing together multiple communities, and then a really interesting one on this one I happened to be able to observe their very start.

520
01:22:42,090 --> 01:22:45,990
Laura Power: And they were bringing together they're trying to address poverty in Jackson.

521
01:22:45,990 --> 01:22:57,720
Laura Power: And the health system was serving as the backbone organization and I got to observe during some of the very starting or meetings where they were just talking about the causes of poverty in our neighborhood and.

522
01:22:57,720 --> 01:23:01,170
Laura Power: What really struck me was how challenging it was.

523
01:23:01,170 --> 01:23:08,580
Laura Power: And just to me it felt like it was going to be really slow process so as i've gone back that that was several years ago that I said, another so there's still.

524
01:23:08,580 --> 01:23:16,020
Laura Power: there's still working on, and I think they have made progress, at least, like the group's continue to meet and it's going on but it's like in that video I said Okay, maybe.

525
01:23:16,020 --> 01:23:28,650
Laura Power: Your four you're going to feel like you've done a lot of work and you haven't done anything, maybe by your five you'll kind of break through so this group has been added for quite some time and thinking about how to address poverty and how they bring people together.

526
01:23:28,650 --> 01:23:37,560
Laura Power: So just pointing out that those last few slides, slides are just to point out some local examples of collective impact, but you can find these across the country many different places.

527
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:48,000
Laura Power: I point out this resource, because this is a nice resource that you can, I think I have the link on the canvas page and then I like this toolbox and you'll see here they have.

528
01:23:48,000 --> 01:24:04,890
Laura Power: Collective impact in here they got the map tool and here, other things that we talk about sometimes, of course, the 10 essential services, so this is a nice tool to know about if you're doing some work with Community or other partners.

529
01:24:04,890 --> 01:24:19,380
Laura Power: Okay, so we're going to stop here and take a break, but first any questions any questions or comments let's see here.

530
01:24:19,380 --> 01:24:24,180
Laura Power: Okay okay OK, I just saw your comment about the map and the.

531
01:24:24,180 --> 01:24:28,350
Laura Power: Return time.

532
01:24:28,350 --> 01:24:37,980
Laura Power: All right, I think everyone's ready for a break it is 312 let's say let's come back at.

533
01:24:37,980 --> 01:24:48,840
Laura Power: i'm sorry, what do you think 333 30 or eight long enough okay 330 let's come back.

534
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:53,370
Laura Power: And when we come back it'll be a case study that will work on.

535
01:24:53,370 --> 01:25:04,560
Laura Power: Alright, see you then.

536
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:07,890
Laura Power: dog is barking.

537
01:25:07,890 --> 01:25:34,050
Laura Power: Hopefully it will quiet down in a minute here welcome back okay so just some general impressions of the case study to this, what did you think about it, and I just love to hear any general impressions.

538
01:25:34,050 --> 01:25:36,600
Quintin Solano: You know one thing that we discussed.

539
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:45,570
Quintin Solano: A bit about when it comes to you know why was back you know, Jim a good public health leader there's a concept that.

540
01:25:45,570 --> 01:25:48,810
Quintin Solano: jacko actually talks about in his book called belief in the mission.

541
01:25:48,810 --> 01:25:58,080
Quintin Solano: And how important it is for the leader of a group to believe in what they are doing and not only believe in it, but feel a lot of passion for it and feel like there's a you know higher cause.

542
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:04,170
Quintin Solano: Because it's hard as a group, if your leader isn't really behind the work that you're doing.

543
01:26:04,170 --> 01:26:21,540
Quintin Solano: And it feels like Paul no Jim was really passionate about the work that he was doing, and that you know I think kind of trickled down into a lot of the Members that we heard from in the videos they seem pretty passionate about the projects that they were doing as well.

544
01:26:21,540 --> 01:26:29,340
Laura Power: very committed to to the Community.

545
01:26:29,340 --> 01:26:34,980
Laura Power: Welcome, I like this one, because a non traditional example was, I think, someone was gonna say something.

546
01:26:34,980 --> 01:26:40,290
Ahya Sajawal Ali: So I feel like it also gave me a lot of hope.

547
01:26:40,290 --> 01:26:50,130
Ahya Sajawal Ali: Like it's a fun sort of case in point, in the sense that we can change some things and most times we can't make drastic changes.

548
01:26:50,130 --> 01:27:10,920
Ahya Sajawal Ali: But it just goes to show that if you even look at the micro level real efforts can have such huge contributions towards people generally today life that it gives you hope in starting more projects and actually getting out there and trying to help people yeah definitely.

549
01:27:10,920 --> 01:27:18,030
Laura Power: that's a nice that's a nice positive takeaway from that I like that.

550
01:27:18,030 --> 01:27:22,440
Laura Power: Good well let's go through the questions, then.

551
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:30,360
Laura Power: let's see starting with Question one so thinking about the ideal value values for meaningful partnerships.

552
01:27:30,360 --> 01:27:37,380
Laura Power: And so what are those and then might look different are there, different values may be needed for a non traditional public health partner.

553
01:27:37,380 --> 01:27:46,920
Laura Power: So we'll ask him one to tell us what they thought about this one, and we can also see, on the other, responses in there as well.

554
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:55,380
Samantha Lyons: i'll start so we talked a little bit about of creative thinking when defining the boundaries of roles and that was.

555
01:27:55,380 --> 01:28:01,380
Samantha Lyons: To one of paul's statements about how grocery stores can do more than just sell food.

556
01:28:01,380 --> 01:28:15,720
Samantha Lyons: The other one would be direct engagement with the communities members and the example was brought up about how he specifically spoke to some of the teams in the area, about the gang violence and their thoughts on how to kind of rectify the situation.

557
01:28:15,720 --> 01:28:30,480
Samantha Lyons: And then we also looked at collective impact, which is something that they talked about on page five of the article and overall that involved having a common agenda align goals mutually reinforcing activities you're not operating in silos and that they.

558
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:41,280
Samantha Lyons: The activities support each other shared measurements and understanding what those measurements are and the learner Center had done that, by learning the landscape of operations.

559
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:49,980
Samantha Lyons: For the grocery store and then also having a backbone organization which in this case kind of felt like Paul.

560
01:28:49,980 --> 01:29:01,200
Samantha Lyons: And the learner Center but it seemed to be like it was almost like a tried tripod and Paul was one of those.

561
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:11,190
Samantha Lyons: Three one of those three primary actors and then I we also talked a little bit about boundaries of projects and keeping.

562
01:29:11,190 --> 01:29:21,600
Samantha Lyons: It contained so that you can actually do the work that you want to do, and then being accessible to constructive feedback and I think that was one of the things that happened with.

563
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:32,790
Samantha Lyons: The project or the learner Center when they realized that the project, they were doing was no longer going to be feasible and they had to pivot and they pivoted in support with the.

564
01:29:32,790 --> 01:29:47,970
Samantha Lyons: funders of that original grant so they had to get them on board as well, which I think speaks to their communication and then the trust and accountability that each partner, are these projects developed with each other.

565
01:29:47,970 --> 01:29:49,350
Laura Power: Thank you, those are all the green.

566
01:29:49,350 --> 01:29:51,660
Laura Power: Comments there.

567
01:29:51,660 --> 01:30:04,710
Laura Power: I like the idea about thinking about the boundaries to that that's a good point now one doesn't always come up that often I think that's a good point anybody want to add anything else.

568
01:30:04,710 --> 01:30:18,720
Laura Power: Okay, good examples yeah and we'll think more about the collective impact, part two coming up, so how about examples of public health 3.0 that you sign here, and that will be from our team to or midwesterners.

569
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:28,350
Laura Power: I see some listed here.

570
01:30:28,350 --> 01:30:33,150
Laura Power: How did this showcase public health 3.0.

571
01:30:33,150 --> 01:30:35,880
Quintin Solano: I have to get incorporated.

572
01:30:35,880 --> 01:30:43,140
Quintin Solano: Quite a few If not you could probably argue all public health 3.0.

573
01:30:43,140 --> 01:30:46,320
Quintin Solano: kind of.

574
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:49,050
Quintin Solano: Actions or things like that that are included in all the.

575
01:30:49,050 --> 01:30:53,490
Quintin Solano: different components at different components I couldn't think of a word for that.

576
01:30:53,490 --> 01:31:02,010
Quintin Solano: You know equitable access was a really big one that was the first one that came to mind, even before reminding myself of what was in that.

577
01:31:02,010 --> 01:31:14,010
Quintin Solano: circle leveraging existing resources utilizing you know, members of the community and stuff as well, and then obviously addressing health disparities that really big one.

578
01:31:14,010 --> 01:31:18,240
Laura Power: yeah Those are all good examples, one that.

579
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:27,360
Laura Power: stood out to me here to is the idea of like non traditional data sources, which is one of the public health 3.0 of them, you know many different ones.

580
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:35,280
Laura Power: The big one, I think, is the Cross sector collaboration that's why I brought this woman specifically after we talked about collective leadership that's why I chose this case study.

581
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:39,450
Laura Power: But when you reflect back to public health 3.0 some of the other.

582
01:31:39,450 --> 01:31:48,810
Laura Power: Things that are in there, one of them is thinking about traditional non traditional data sources i'm trying to use like the you know your grocery card scanner things and linking up.

583
01:31:48,810 --> 01:32:00,330
Laura Power: Different data sources, I think they weren't all successful, but they were trying to think through these different ways of like linking data or getting data and like moving forward, so I thought that was kind of an interesting example.

584
01:32:00,330 --> 01:32:08,040
Laura Power: good night focusing on equity there and trying to address health disparities in the Community.

585
01:32:08,040 --> 01:32:25,440
Laura Power: All right, and I see lots so for the next one number three the trades and practices and me, Paul public health LEADER I see lots of different trades there so group three if you want to make any comments about that.

586
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:27,570
yeah I can start.

587
01:32:27,570 --> 01:32:33,900
Brandon Lee Ellsworth: So, as far as being a public leader, some of the things we're talking about is one just like having the.

588
01:32:33,900 --> 01:32:40,560
Brandon Lee Ellsworth: Like having the courage to embark in this like risky project, I mean this is a.

589
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:57,630
Brandon Lee Ellsworth: store that meant a lot to his family that he was kind of risking a lot by embarking on this, and then there was a lot of other things that came up that you can kind of read through out there by think for me at least the the courage to do it was the biggest one I like.

590
01:32:57,630 --> 01:32:58,950
Laura Power: mm hmm yeah.

591
01:32:58,950 --> 01:33:17,640
Laura Power: yeah for sure, was a risk, I mean this is a business is business, you know so to to you know, I think, but maybe he was able to see sort of the bigger picture and understand that how maybe something benefiting the Community was it was all kind of mutually reinforcing so that makes sense.

592
01:33:17,640 --> 01:33:32,670
Laura Power: All right, and then the last one so thinking about those components of the collective impact model, so we went through some examples, but team for do you want to add anything to that, from what we've already talked about.

593
01:33:32,670 --> 01:33:38,760
Laura Grage: um yeah I can share, let me scroll down, so I see what we.

594
01:33:38,760 --> 01:33:42,960
Laura Grage: wrote.

595
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:52,860
Laura Grage: There was one you know, there was a common goal to support the local community there was more than one leader involved.

596
01:33:52,860 --> 01:33:59,760
Laura Grage: The University was involved hospital was involved Community Center was involved.

597
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:04,110
Laura Grage: So a lot of cross sector collaboration.

598
01:34:04,110 --> 01:34:11,790
Laura Grage: There was a greater need in a particular part of Syracuse that was underserved.

599
01:34:11,790 --> 01:34:25,740
Laura Grage: There was also a school partnership program for leadership with adolescents who are at risk that utilize the university program as well and i'm not sure I wrote these up there, the most perfect way, but we were just trying to capture as.

600
01:34:25,740 --> 01:34:27,360
Many.

601
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:33,180
Laura Grage: Parts of the collective model, and then I think the last one that we wrote in the box with.

602
01:34:33,180 --> 01:34:45,330
Laura Grage: The trust between and among Community members and the organization's led to a lot of by end so that the way that trust was built was clearly pretty effective.

603
01:34:45,330 --> 01:34:47,790
Laura Power: Thank you.

604
01:34:47,790 --> 01:34:48,900
Laura Power: Father.

605
01:34:48,900 --> 01:34:49,980
Laura Power: kind of added about the.

606
01:34:49,980 --> 01:35:01,050
Laura Power: Consistent communication and the mutually reinforcing activity, so I think there's a lot of examples here, so the reason I pulled this one i'm like I said is it's kind of really brings home the idea of leadership.

607
01:35:01,050 --> 01:35:10,950
Laura Power: across different partners, bringing lots of people together cross sector collaboration, the health department of health systems were in there, you know so they were supporting as well.

608
01:35:10,950 --> 01:35:19,200
Laura Power: So I think it just helps us think about personal leadership skills as well as leading across sectors and then that's why I like this example.

609
01:35:19,200 --> 01:35:22,590
Laura Power: And now I become Paul Williams fan because i've been following him so.

610
01:35:22,590 --> 01:35:34,200
Laura Power: I do know you feel a business like a business leader somewhere else, and now it was who saw his building has been sold to another farmers market or another market faith based organization So hopefully there'll be able to continue.

611
01:35:34,200 --> 01:35:46,410
Laura Power: The good work, because it was like a bummer at the end of the story, to find out that you know he had to close so but Paul still doing well, it seems like from my Google sacking of him after.

612
01:35:46,410 --> 01:35:59,130
Laura Power: Alright, so that was the case study, so the last thing we have to do now is for you to think about a challenge that you all want to think about going forward, as we saw in my next activities.

613
01:35:59,130 --> 01:36:08,310
Laura Power: In day, three, four and five, when you do systems thinking or when you think about policies and how you apply systems thinking to that or when you think about.

614
01:36:08,310 --> 01:36:17,340
Laura Power: A vision and values and setting goals and strategic plans, what is a topic or a challenge that you want to think about.

615
01:36:17,340 --> 01:36:28,020
Laura Power: So i'll will put you back in your teams, this is the last thing that we want you to do so, your assignment for this i'll just let me i'll share my screen to show the.

616
01:36:28,020 --> 01:36:38,940
Laura Power: canvas page and keep us on the same page here we finished the leadership talent now where's the teamwork, is my dog coming in to say hi.

617
01:36:38,940 --> 01:36:46,680
Laura Power: So we're at the last one teamwork public health tian so like I said you'll kind of think of this topic.

618
01:36:46,680 --> 01:36:53,220
Laura Power: Oh, and I guess I should mention I would be important thing is all of this will lead to a presentation on the last day.

619
01:36:53,220 --> 01:37:08,790
Laura Power: And so to tell me, in order to do this assignment just choosing your topic, you can just put in the text box and canvas just tell me what it is just in a couple words it doesn't have to be super detailed just.

620
01:37:08,790 --> 01:37:15,450
Laura Power: I don't know why had teams pick things like climate change, which is a very large problem or things like.

621
01:37:15,450 --> 01:37:17,520
Laura Power: You know.

622
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:25,350
Laura Power: A whole like housing issues in a certain city, so it can be very broad, it can be very specific i'm kind of leaving it to you.

623
01:37:25,350 --> 01:37:30,690
Laura Power: You will it's Okay, if you shape it during the next couple days, so you can kind of choose your topic now.

624
01:37:30,690 --> 01:37:38,580
Laura Power: And you know it can evolve in the next day or so, as you see more what you're getting yourself into so I just want like a general topic from this one.

625
01:37:38,580 --> 01:37:48,420
Laura Power: And then, just to give you a feel so towards the i'm Friday, basically, you will have worked on these components here.

626
01:37:48,420 --> 01:37:58,470
Laura Power: And you're going to be building up the presentation that you all you'll do as a group, in your groups on Friday so right now you're just choosing your topic.

627
01:37:58,470 --> 01:38:09,930
Laura Power: Maybe your homework for tonight is really just after you choose a topic just maybe think about it, you know, maybe do a little Google search or kind of read about it just so you have some more ideas about your topic.

628
01:38:09,930 --> 01:38:20,490
Laura Power: you'll kind of think about that together so you'll be able to put together a very brief background about the challenge and then, as we get into like systems thinking you'll do activities during class where you.

629
01:38:20,490 --> 01:38:32,670
Laura Power: You make a concept map or a causal loop diagram you'll review, a policy and think about a policy logic, while you'll do these in class but you'll present them and share them with everybody on Friday.

630
01:38:32,670 --> 01:38:40,980
Laura Power: That makes sense, so the activities you're doing in the next couple days will build into the presentation on Friday.

631
01:38:40,980 --> 01:38:53,430
Laura Power: So i'll help you with that I made a template that you can use it's a very boring template so you are welcome to spiff it up, if you like, or make it more exciting.

632
01:38:53,430 --> 01:39:00,390
Laura Power: So this is very basic it's fine to follow the basic one to you can just plug them in and that's certainly fine but i'm just.

633
01:39:00,390 --> 01:39:17,250
Laura Power: letting you know you're welcome to change it change the order change it, make it look nicer make it fit your topic better, but that way you've got something started, because I know you're doing it in class and it's you know, can be a lot of work to to put a presentation together.

634
01:39:17,250 --> 01:39:35,070
Laura Power: There are some examples here from a previous class, if you want to take a look at them to to help you get some ideas so that's what this is going to culminate in, but you will work on this through like I said, through the classes so right now, you just need to choose a topic.

635
01:39:35,070 --> 01:39:39,900
Laura Power: So let me just stop and see if there's questions.

636
01:39:39,900 --> 01:39:46,530
Laura Power: If I can clarify anything.

637
01:39:46,530 --> 01:39:53,130
Laura Power: it's pretty pretty good pretty straightforward okay so we're going to put you in your groups.

638
01:39:53,130 --> 01:40:02,130
Laura Power: Just one person has to upload this as a group assignment to so one of you just enters the text box of like whatever you chose, it should be the answer for all your whole group.

639
01:40:02,130 --> 01:40:12,810
Laura Power: And now we all know what you chose, you are welcome to sign off after that, or you are welcome to come back and say goodbye whatever you like, but that's your final task for the day.

640
01:40:12,810 --> 01:40:22,290
Laura Power: And then we'll let you go i'll be hanging out here, if you have any questions and if not, I will see you tomorrow at 130.

641
01:40:22,290 --> 01:40:42,780
Laura Power: Alright sounds good.

642
01:40:42,780 --> 01:40:48,570
Laura Power: I think everyone's getting tired.

643
01:40:48,570 --> 01:40:53,670
Joshua Bosman: yeah they're getting a little quieter for sure.

644
01:40:53,670 --> 01:41:01,470
Laura Power: that's why I salon it's a long session so they'll get done early.

645
01:41:01,470 --> 01:41:12,600
Joshua Bosman: yeah but you're breaking it up in like a an interesting way you know it's opposed to I don't want to dunk, on the other, class, but you know it was much more quantitative and dry so.

646
01:41:12,600 --> 01:41:21,600
Laura Power: it's just so did like this class is just so different I don't even know how I would do a mat like a quantitative class for so long.

647
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:22,200
Laura Power: We heard.

648
01:41:22,200 --> 01:41:25,230
Joshua Bosman: It was intense.

649
01:41:25,230 --> 01:41:40,020
Laura Power: yeah i'll be married and if you know, like for students and maybe it was challenging for you know, maybe some students are in the zone and they get that and they're like coding coding coding, but for some students like remembering myself when I did the summer session.

650
01:41:40,020 --> 01:41:48,960
Laura Power: It can be you know hard to follow sometimes and up the long day and let's say you know of assignments, you have to work on and stuff so.

651
01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:52,320
Joshua Bosman: yeah for sure, should I go ahead and stop the recording.

652
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:56,010
Laura Power: Or do oh yeah yeah we can do that yeah Thank you.

653
01:41:56,010 --> 01:41:57,056
Joshua Bosman: No problem.
