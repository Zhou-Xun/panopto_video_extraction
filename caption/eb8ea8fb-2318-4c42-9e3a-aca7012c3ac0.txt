1
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,690
In this video, we will
describe the example that we

2
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:16,550
will use for learning how
to analyze survey data.

3
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:19,170
The example we're going to use

4
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,090
to learn the analysis
of survey data,

5
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:25,560
is a survey conducted in
Equatorial Guinea in 1997,

6
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,510
in which the sampling design is

7
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,775
a multistage cluster sampling.

8
00:00:29,775 --> 00:00:31,545
The outcome is going to be

9
00:00:31,545 --> 00:00:34,260
overweight in children
less than five years

10
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,480
old and the predictors
are going to be

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,540
similar socio-demographic
and health variables.

12
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,720
Let me give you a little
more background on

13
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,685
the design and the
outcome variable,

14
00:00:43,685 --> 00:00:45,140
since that's important for you

15
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,485
to understand the
following videos.

16
00:00:47,485 --> 00:00:51,290
The intention was to select
a representative sample

17
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:54,680
of the country using
complex sampling.

18
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,370
We chose 30 villages and
neighborhoods randomly,

19
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:00,650
and then we chose 30 households

20
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:04,250
randomly in each village
neighborhood and finally,

21
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:08,365
we chose all children younger
than 5 in those households.

22
00:01:08,365 --> 00:01:12,080
We measure weight and height
in the children and were

23
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,460
able to estimate those

24
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:15,655
anthropometric
indicators in children.

25
00:01:15,655 --> 00:01:18,020
Note that the one
we will focus in

26
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,600
this example is
weight for height,

27
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,910
which measures body weight
relative to height.

28
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:28,460
Anthropometric indicators
are derived using

29
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:32,515
population references and they
are measured as z-scores.

30
00:01:32,515 --> 00:01:34,580
That is, there are
standardized as

31
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,980
a normal distribution with mean

32
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:39,980
0 and a standard
deviation equal to 1.

33
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:42,530
Weight for height
z-scores greater than

34
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:44,240
1 standard deviation can be

35
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,440
used as a measure of
overweight in children.

36
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,620
Going back to our example,

37
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:52,350
our design is a
complex design that

38
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:55,370
uses cluster sampling
in more than one stage.

39
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:56,810
We will need to use

40
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:59,830
a clustering variable to
take that into account.

41
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:02,535
Our design is not
equiprobablistic.

42
00:02:02,535 --> 00:02:03,800
That is, every child has

43
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,500
not the same probability of being

44
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,540
selected into the study and

45
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:11,395
therefore we will need
to use sampling weights.

46
00:02:11,395 --> 00:02:13,625
Our outcome is a binary variable,

47
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:15,920
overweight defined with a cut-off

48
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,550
of the weight to height
z-score and is coded as 0,

49
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:21,260
no and 1, yes.

50
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,970
Our predictors are some

51
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:24,920
socio-demographic
and health variables

52
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,295
that we will see
in the next slide.

53
00:02:27,295 --> 00:02:30,680
Here you can see the
first 10 observations.

54
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,300
The first variable called

55
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,680
cluster is the
clustering variable.

56
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,000
This is also called the
Primary Sampling Unit,

57
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,190
or PSU and represents
the first cluster.

58
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:44,255
The second variable called

59
00:02:44,255 --> 00:02:46,495
weights are the sampling weights.

60
00:02:46,495 --> 00:02:49,075
Then we have our
outcome variable.

61
00:02:49,075 --> 00:02:51,385
First, as a continuous variable,

62
00:02:51,385 --> 00:02:53,560
the weight to height z-score and

63
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,180
then a sub binary
variable, overweight.

64
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,980
Remember that the weight
to height z-score is

65
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,940
a z-score variable derived from

66
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:03,525
comparing with our
reference population.

67
00:03:03,525 --> 00:03:06,165
Then we have
potential predictors.

68
00:03:06,165 --> 00:03:10,640
We have MONTHS is the age
of the child in months,

69
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,365
sex, is the sex of the child.

70
00:03:13,365 --> 00:03:17,220
Bottle, is if the child
was bottle-fed or not.

71
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:21,980
SICK, is if the child was
sick during the last 15 days.

72
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:24,675
AGEMO is the age of the mother,

73
00:03:24,675 --> 00:03:28,560
AGEHH the age of the
head of the household.

74
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,980
SEXHH, is the sex of

75
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,290
the head of the
household and finally,

76
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:35,060
ELECTRICITY is if they had

77
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,585
access to electricity
in the house.

78
00:03:37,585 --> 00:03:39,470
In summary, in this video,

79
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,360
we'll describe the
example that we will

80
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,955
use for learning how to
analyze survey data.

81
00:03:43,955 --> 00:03:46,400
In the next video, we
will start learning

82
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,656
the PROC surveys to analyze
survey data in SAS.
