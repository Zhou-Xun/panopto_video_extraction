1
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:20,750
How are you all feeling this week? Poster session is next week for the MBA students.

2
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:29,280
Are you ready? Hey.

3
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:34,600
I thought you had snotty. I'm excited for an in-person one.

4
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:40,840
This is the first one we've had in a couple of years, so it will be nice to go see the posters in real life.

5
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:53,960
Right. Um, so you should be getting feedback on your full draft of your proposal by today if you haven't gotten it already.

6
00:00:54,620 --> 00:01:02,000
So you've got about four weeks, I think, left to incorporate any edits.

7
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:06,440
If you want to meet with me to talk about it, sign up for office hours.

8
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:10,180
We can talk about it if you have questions based on the feedback that you've gotten,

9
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:17,660
we start presentations next week so you won't have to do any more reading for this class.

10
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:26,420
You're done. That should give you back some time. Um, there's one person who hasn't signed up, I think, for the presentation.

11
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:30,920
So if you haven't signed up, make sure that you take a look at that.

12
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,790
The only time that's still open is next Friday.

13
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:42,170
So if you didn't sign up, you're presenting next week, but you've already done your you know, you've already done a version of your proposal.

14
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:47,180
So you're not starting from scratch. You're just going to pull pieces out of your proposal for this presentation.

15
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:53,600
So I wouldn't anticipate that it would take a huge amount of time to get ready for this presentation.

16
00:01:54,680 --> 00:02:04,670
I do want to remind you to practice that before you come to class, because it's really easy to underestimate how long it is.

17
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:10,880
And I am going to time you because, you know, we have a lot of presentations to get through.

18
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:16,790
So make sure that you, you know, read the time requirements and that you practice that you're not going over.

19
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:24,830
That's my best advice. Are there questions about what to include in the presentation or.

20
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:37,070
Style, love it or anything like that. No.

21
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:44,870
Okay. If you have questions, you can email me or come to office hours.

22
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:53,450
We'll see what else. I want to remind you that we will go in the order.

23
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:57,080
That's on the sign up sheet. So just make sure you take a look at that.

24
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,510
So, you know, kind of where you are in the order.

25
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:09,470
I will pull up the presentations from Kansas, so upload your PowerPoint slides or your PDF or whatever you want to use for the presentation.

26
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,739
Upload that to canvas and then we'll just pull those offers.

27
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:18,380
Each person goes, That seems to work pretty well. Okay.

28
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:28,750
All right. I anticipate that will finish a little bit early next week because we don't have all of the slots filled.

29
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:36,280
So that will give you a little more time if you are doing a poster presentation next week to go get prepared for that.

30
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:42,040
All right. So let's talk about social networks.

31
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:52,340
Before I start, does anybody want to comment or say anything about these readings or the idea of social networks?

32
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:02,650
Anything that was particularly on your mind after reading these or after participating in the discussion board?

33
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:20,370
I know there were a lot of comments about this in the social media reading, which we're going to talk about after the break and groups.

34
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:25,860
And so we can get into some of those questions that people have about social media

35
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:32,879
and things that might modify the impact of social media exposure on health outcomes.

36
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:39,840
And then also questions, I think that ran throughout for this week's readings about interventions.

37
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:47,250
Is this something that you can intervene on? And if you did, how would you do that?

38
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:57,299
There were questions about causation and work on social networks.

39
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,840
And do we believe that us do we believe that this is causal?

40
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:12,120
Definitely talk about that. Then I think, Sarah, I think you mentioned that you and when you started reading the chapter,

41
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:17,430
you were thinking it was all going to be about like virtual networks.

42
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:22,709
But then seeing that, we really are talking about real life social networks too.

43
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:28,620
And most of the research was really rooted in that, not in these sort of online networks,

44
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:34,050
although that has come to dominate our way of thinking about social networks through social media.

45
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,240
Okay. All right. Well, let's just get started, then.

46
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:44,770
So this is what we're going to talk about today, and I'm going to break it down into different pieces as we go through.

47
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:51,169
But this is kind of the full model in terms of thinking about social networks and health.

48
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:56,300
So kind of what are the things that the pattern or shape social networks?

49
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:01,410
And then how is it that social networks influence health?

50
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,259
So we're going to kind of go through this.

51
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:10,670
We're going to start at the macro level and go down to the micro level to really start with social structural conditions,

52
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:21,229
thinking about how culture, socioeconomic factors, politics and social change might influence the formation of social networks.

53
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:26,000
Who is in your social network? Then we're going to talk about the social networks themselves.

54
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:32,750
What are the structure of networks and the characteristics of ties, and why do those things matter?

55
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,650
Then we'll talk about the psycho social mechanisms.

56
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:43,670
So what do social networks impact that could be having influences on health?

57
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:47,990
So things like social support, which we've already talked about a little bit in the past,

58
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:54,920
social influence, social engagement, person to person contact, access to resources and material goods.

59
00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:03,020
And then the sort of the more immediate or direct pathways by which those factors,

60
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:06,740
those social and psychosocial factors would influence health outcomes.

61
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:11,150
So things like health behavior, psychological well-being and physiology.

62
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:17,590
Okay. All right.

63
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,880
So we're going to start here thinking about the social structural conditions.

64
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:28,639
So I just want us to start by thinking about these aspects of social structure that are kind

65
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:36,620
of listed up here and how these things might influence the formation of social networks.

66
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:50,120
What are some aspects of culture or socio economic factors or political factors that might influence social networks?

67
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,380
We just had the midterm elections this week. Right.

68
00:07:55,390 --> 00:08:03,400
So if you've been reading the news, then you've probably read a lot about politics and political factors.

69
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,300
Yeah. There's an empirical finding that, like, attracts like.

70
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:16,320
Mm hmm. So, uh, we are more likely to be in networks that were similar to us.

71
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:20,400
Like, culturally, probably demographically is the exception.

72
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:28,629
Yeah. Yeah. So these things might influence the extent to which we form relationships with others

73
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:37,110
who are like us in terms of culture or socio economic factors or or politics.

74
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:43,180
Right. So things like.

75
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:51,190
So. So there's the homophily piece about being attracted or forming relationships or networks with people who share similar circumstances.

76
00:08:51,610 --> 00:09:00,610
But these things can also just sort of influence things like norms and values

77
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:06,100
that could shape the formation of social relationships and social networks.

78
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,790
Also, social cohesion is a part of this.

79
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:23,380
And so you can imagine that if you live in a more socially cohesive environment, that might foster the formation of social networks.

80
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:32,380
There's also things like racism and sexism that influence the formation of networks.

81
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:39,069
So homophily is sort of the idea that you're you're choosing to affiliate with people who are like you.

82
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:49,120
But we can also think about how things like racism and sexism matter, who you're exposed to and the extent to which you can form relationships.

83
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:59,790
Also, there may be things in a particular society around competition versus cooperation and what the norms are around that.

84
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:07,049
And you can imagine that could have a really big influence on the ability to form social ties and social networks.

85
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:10,110
If you're in a society that's more cooperative,

86
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:16,920
you might have different types of networks than if you're in a society or a micro environment, even that's very competitive.

87
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:25,600
In terms of socio economic factors, there's kind of your own socio economic status,

88
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,520
but there's also things like at the macro level, socioeconomic inequality.

89
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:37,530
So if you live in a society with a lot of inequality that can then be related to things like social cohesion,

90
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:40,210
that can influence the formation of social networks.

91
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:50,570
Other socioeconomic factors at the macro level that might matter are things like labor market structure and poverty.

92
00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:02,240
And then we've got politics, which we've heard a lot about how the politics can include things like laws that can shape social interactions,

93
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,640
public policies, differential political participation and political culture.

94
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:11,720
So I was listening to a story on the radio this weekend.

95
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:17,090
Maybe you heard it. It was super interesting about I think it was in New Zealand.

96
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:21,500
They have compulsory voting in New Zealand.

97
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:28,760
Did you know this? You're required by law to vote, but it's also they make it really fun.

98
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:36,950
So when you go to your polling place, they have they call it what did they call it?

99
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,790
Sausages and something I don't know. It's like a it's like a barbecue.

100
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:44,080
And they have veggie burgers, too, because they ask that question.

101
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:54,310
So like so you go and people are grilling and they're kind of having fun and there's music and it all, it takes less than 10 minutes.

102
00:11:54,320 --> 00:12:01,010
And basically everyone does it. They have this really, really high rate of participation, like over 95%, I think.

103
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:10,159
And they have means in place to like to really encourage voting among all groups.

104
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:18,740
So if you can't get out to vote, right, because you have mobility limitations, they come to you and bring you the ballot.

105
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:27,079
So this is a completely different idea and system about voting.

106
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:33,140
Right. And this idea that everybody's voice is really important in the society.

107
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:42,020
And then they find that that strongly influences politicians to be more responsive to the needs of people who,

108
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:44,060
like in the US, are less likely to vote.

109
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:53,990
And so, you know, this political scientist was talking about how when you don't have compulsory voting, it's generally higher income people who vote.

110
00:12:54,320 --> 00:13:00,800
And then politicians, to the extent that they feel like they owe their voters,

111
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:07,250
are like pushing forward an agenda that really promotes the interests of higher income people.

112
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:15,739
And then that creates this sort of sense that it doesn't matter who you vote for and politicians don't care about people like me.

113
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:19,340
And then people are less inclined, even less inclined to vote over time.

114
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:27,649
So it was I mean, to me, it was this really interesting idea about how this kind of these macro level conditions

115
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:36,950
that involve wars but also culture really shape sort of the nature of the country.

116
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:43,060
And you can imagine that this could have implications for the formation of social networks as well.

117
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:46,580
I mean, there's just a really different way of being.

118
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:55,939
And if you think also back to the video that we watched about childcare in Canada,

119
00:13:55,940 --> 00:14:02,600
that right we were talking about how there was a very different kind of culture

120
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:11,239
there that shaped a lot of sort of health outcomes and parent and child outcomes,

121
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,330
but that could also influence social networks.

122
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:21,980
So this macro level piece is important, but probably one that we don't think about very often when we think about social networks,

123
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:25,780
because typically we're thinking this is just like an interpersonal phenomenon

124
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:30,649
in the way that we often think of behavior as an individual or personal thing,

125
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:32,600
but it's really socially patterned.

126
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:50,930
So again, thinking about social networks themselves and we'll talk about a lot of different characteristics of social networks as we go forward.

127
00:14:51,470 --> 00:15:00,410
So social networks are just defined as the web of social relationships that surround an individual and the characteristics of those ties.

128
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:10,760
And so we're going to talk about different aspects of those that we can measure and that we can use in research to understand how they shape health.

129
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:27,100
So first we can think about the structure of social networks, and that includes things like range or size, density, boundaries of homogeneity.

130
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:33,939
So let's talk about what that means. So in terms of range or size, that was pretty obvious.

131
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:37,329
It's like just the number of ties in your social network.

132
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:42,850
If you have a large social network or a small social network or a social network, so how many people are in it?

133
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:49,690
This is much easier to think about in the context of social media because you

134
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:53,800
can open your phone and you can see how many people are in your social network,

135
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:59,290
but you can also think about it in your real life. Right? But it would be a little harder to quantify.

136
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:05,530
But you can think about what is the size of your social networking. It would probably vary a lot across people in this class.

137
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:12,850
Right. And so we can think about is having a larger network or a smaller network better for your home.

138
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:19,449
So it's something we can measure and test. We can also think about the density of your network.

139
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:24,490
So that would be the extent to which members in your network are connected to each other.

140
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:31,930
So you could have a lot of friends who don't know each other.

141
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:39,220
They're just you're the only thing that connects them. Or you could have a network where everybody in it is all connected to each other.

142
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:49,570
And so you could think about whether the density of the network has implications for health or other outcomes.

143
00:16:52,990 --> 00:17:02,469
Can you think of a reason why you might be interested in. Actually don't have an answer for this.

144
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:03,220
I'm curious what you think.

145
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:19,960
Are there ways that having a more dense social network might influence health outcomes versus having a less dense or more diffuse social network?

146
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:45,219
Yeah. Yeah.

147
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:53,650
So he sent me to a sense of like, if you're very densely connected in this one group, like, have everybody thinking the same way?

148
00:17:54,310 --> 00:18:00,350
Yeah. No. Yeah. I was just by the time when I.

149
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:08,040
Although he was great. But there were things that.

150
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:15,590
But when it was first, it was just one person.

151
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:23,310
Now everyone buys a bit and then they profit from the hype.

152
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:33,130
So they put people in. So I can see how someone's done something and they just.

153
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:46,250
And if there's a dense network, you could get a cluster of that behavior which could influence sort of the health within that group, but also.

154
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:53,940
A larger area. Yeah. There.

155
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:18,000
Yeah. That's really an important point, right? A lot of these these things don't really tell us anything about the quality of social ties.

156
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:27,960
And so we have to think about that also as potentially moderating the impact of these things.

157
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:34,260
Right. Because you can imagine a small network that's highly supported by you, you know,

158
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:39,350
better for health in a large network where you really don't have people, that you get very little support.

159
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:50,460
So then in this is about the degree to which your network is defined on the basis of traditional group structures like Ken.

160
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:55,890
So people who are related to you work and neighborhood.

161
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:09,910
So I kind of think about this and how much is your social network kind of very local and related to people that you have?

162
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:18,519
What's the word I'm looking for? The word that comes to mind is natural relationships, but that's not really what I mean.

163
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:24,969
I mean, sort of like you're guaranteed to be exposed to these people, right?

164
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:28,120
Because they live next door to you. They're in your family,

165
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:37,540
you work with them versus how much do you have people in your social network that are outside of these kind of more obvious or immediate places?

166
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:44,530
And I think social networks have really changed those because they've allowed people to have

167
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:50,910
networks that extend well beyond the kind of traditional networks based on can or work or.

168
00:20:53,680 --> 00:21:03,240
Yeah. Of what? Yeah.

169
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:12,330
I mean, I think it would probably still depend on like if your family's family or your chosen family are people to work with,

170
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:15,940
um, or something like people you go to school with.

171
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:27,330
Think we would still consider that at work cause you're interacting with those people through or through those particular.

172
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:32,320
But like, yeah, but I think if you like,

173
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:44,000
if you join a mountain biking ride and you have that kind of network that's further out with traditional like.

174
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:55,250
And then in terms of homogeneity, that's the extent to which individuals in a network are similar to one another.

175
00:21:57,630 --> 00:22:11,010
On whatever characteristics you want to measure. And then we can think about and there's other structural elements.

176
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:14,100
The chapter that you read goes through a lot of different ones.

177
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:18,330
I'm just picking out some that I think are particularly kind of relevant.

178
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:27,000
We can also think about the characteristics of the ties and the social networks so we can think about the frequency of contact.

179
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:38,229
So it seems kind of obvious, right, that if you have more contact with someone in your social network, you might have a greater influence on them.

180
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:47,440
They might have a greater influence on you. And there can be all different kinds of contact that you might measure.

181
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:52,720
So you might measure things like face to face interactions or phone calls or something like that.

182
00:22:54,340 --> 00:23:03,250
Then there's a multiplex city, so that's the number of types of transactions or support flowing through a set of ties.

183
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:15,130
So I'm trying to think of an example here.

184
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:28,660
If you think about family ties, there's probably a lot more types of transactions that are going through family ties versus friendship ties.

185
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:40,589
So family members might be doing things like providing emotional support, providing financial support, that kind of thing.

186
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:50,730
Whereas with friendship ties, it might really just be sort of like the example of the, of the bike riding group.

187
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:56,970
That might just be somebody where really the interactions that you're having or going biking together and that kind of.

188
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:04,479
Then we've got duration. Let's just leave the time.

189
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:12,970
People who know each other and reciprocity the extent to which exchanges within the network are even.

190
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:26,600
And so you might again, thinking about family relationships versus friendships, we tend to expect friendships to have higher reciprocity, right?

191
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:32,600
If you do something nice for your friend, you expect them to do something nice to you.

192
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:40,249
Or if you contact them, sometimes they contact you. And if that's not if the reciprocity isn't there, that relationship probably goes away.

193
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:46,309
Whereas in family relationships, oftentimes there is not reciprocity.

194
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:50,540
Right? Like if you think about parents of young children.

195
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,620
Parents of young children are giving much more than they're getting back.

196
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:57,769
But that may change over the life course, as we've talked about.

197
00:24:57,770 --> 00:25:02,929
And then when parents are older and they have adult children, it may be the other way around.

198
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:07,310
The adult children may be providing more support to the parents than the parents are providing for them.

199
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:22,629
So the psycho social mechanisms, how do networks influence health?

200
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:28,840
And so we're going to talk about social support, social influence, social engagement, person to person contact,

201
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:36,490
access to resources and material goods, and also negative interactions, which we've learned about a little bit in this class previously.

202
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:46,660
So in terms of social support, we can think about four types of support emotional, instrumental, appraisal and informational.

203
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:52,480
The first two were probably the most important in the literature around social support.

204
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:57,370
So when you think about emotional support, what comes to mind?

205
00:25:57,550 --> 00:26:02,020
What are some examples of emotional social support that you've gotten or given?

206
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:18,280
Yeah. It's somebody's adventure. Okay, so somebody you convert or complain to, is there somebody listening to you as a form of social support?

207
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:23,059
What else? Emotional support. Yes.

208
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:30,890
They're going through the. Yeah.

209
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:37,060
Yeah. If you go through something difficult, like a breakup, your friends are there to support you.

210
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:44,690
Maybe they. Maybe they listen to you, try and think of how else they could provide emotional support.

211
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:49,879
Maybe they just come hang out with you or go watch a movie with you or something.

212
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:56,900
You don't want to talk about it, but they come and they're there for you. And the other kinds of emotional support examples you can think of.

213
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:02,150
Yeah, it's just. Just what? A hug.

214
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:10,429
Yeah, sure. So maybe your friend or your mom or somebody gives you a hug as a way to provide emotional support.

215
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:14,510
They can tell your you're struggling and so they, they give you a happy that makes you feel better.

216
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:21,350
Yeah. So this is love and caring, sympathy and understanding.

217
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:28,009
This usually comes from people who are very close to you. This is not your Facebook friends you've never met or whatever.

218
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:31,520
Right? This is people who are your friends, your close friends, your family.

219
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:41,780
Then there's instrumental support. So instrumental support refers to help aid or assistance with tangible needs.

220
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:48,049
So have you ever gotten instrumental support from anyone or given instrumental support?

221
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:54,640
And what does that look like? Yeah.

222
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:09,149
Yeah. Well, yeah, if you have a flat tire and you're stranded on the side of the road and you call your neighbor or you call your friend or whatever,

223
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:18,090
and they come pick you up. That's instrumental support. Or if you're sick and somebody takes you to the doctor or brings you chickens.

224
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:26,440
Um, but you can see how there can be elements of both of these and that too, right?

225
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:33,270
Like bringing somebody chicken soup could also providing some level of emotional support to them because you're showing that you care about them.

226
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:42,060
But the distinction is really that this is kind of purely emotional and this has some kind of tangible built in to it.

227
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:54,370
So how would how do you think these types of support would be important for health and what kinds of health outcomes might they be important or.

228
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:12,440
Yes. To say. That.

229
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,110
I mean, I have never done that.

230
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:28,240
Yeah. I think it depends on how close you are to your neighborhood.

231
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:36,010
Right. I mean, and so think about it, especially if you're far away from home.

232
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:40,600
I'm thinking about being a college student or being a grad student.

233
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:54,190
And maybe you're new living here. You don't have close supports, but maybe you are able to like to find someone who can provide instrumental support.

234
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:59,650
So like in our department, we have emergency hardship funds for student.

235
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:08,620
So that would be a form of instrumental support. Like you're having trouble, you had a car breakdown, you had to pay to have your car towed.

236
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:14,790
You don't have the money to pay for it. The department can provide funds for that to help you get through.

237
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:23,680
We're not your friend, right? I mean, we love you so, but we're not the same way as your friend, friends or your family.

238
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,540
Right. But we can still provide instrumental support.

239
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:32,919
So I think you will get instrumental support from from someone that would be different, but you would get emotional support from.

240
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:42,110
But yeah, if you had the option, then you would probably ask someone who is close to you to answer your question.

241
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:46,200
Yeah, I think it's helpful because then there a reason.

242
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:56,969
Yeah. So it could it can be good for your mental or psychological well-being.

243
00:30:56,970 --> 00:31:07,930
That's important for health. Yeah.

244
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:13,930
So we can it's it's really clear, I think, how things like emotional support would be very important for mental health.

245
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:22,330
Yeah. Caitlin, I was thinking that instrumental help could directly impact the first couple of years, I guess in the center.

246
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:30,070
Yeah. So it could impact instrumental support might have a greater impact on physical health too,

247
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:36,760
because you might actually be getting something that you need if you need food or you need medicine or you need a ride to the doctor,

248
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:46,730
for example, that could directly impact your physical health. Any other thoughts on how these things might influence our health?

249
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:07,390
Yeah. I think the main ways are by kind of shaping our psychological well-being and then these other things that might be important,

250
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:10,800
um, like we talked about with instrumental support,

251
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:13,450
like if you're, if you're struggling financially,

252
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:19,810
obviously it can be really important for maintaining your health that you have someone who can help you financially.

253
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:27,230
So appraisal support is help in decision making.

254
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:32,450
So this is someone who's giving you feedback and helping you make a decision.

255
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:41,540
So can you think of any example of that? Sarah, you're nodding and laughing and it's helping you make a decision.

256
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:45,170
It's like. It's like your religion.

257
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:55,300
Just. So that more people.

258
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:03,570
Yes. Yes. You're always there.

259
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:09,360
That was my favorite. Yeah.

260
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:15,740
You know, that's a great example. And that could also be mixed in with emotional support, too, right, if it's your friend.

261
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,399
But you could get appraisal support from somebody who's not your friend.

262
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:25,969
Right? Like you might ask the student services coordinator for advice on what class you should take.

263
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:33,140
Great. So there's these so people can offer appraisal support and in ways that aren't mixed up with emotional support.

264
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:37,970
Yeah. Okay.

265
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:45,870
So that's that's appraisal support, informational support, provision of advice or information in service of particular.

266
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:52,320
So can you think of an example where you might have gotten information or support?

267
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:57,510
They weren't trying to help you make a decision. They're just giving you information.

268
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:05,290
Yeah. I mean, something like that, you know?

269
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:09,830
Yeah. Yeah.

270
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:13,270
I'm thinking about, like, in the health care setting.

271
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:21,940
I can't imagine this being a thing, right? So, like, helping you with eyeglasses or giving you information about,

272
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:26,499
let's say you've just recently been diagnosed with high blood pressure and

273
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:32,080
the doctor or the nurse might provide you information about hypertension and,

274
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,590
um, and maybe things that you can do to reduce blood pressure.

275
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:44,200
So you like informational support. And so these can all be important for help in sort of different ways.

276
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:49,270
So depending on your research question and the health outcomes, you might be interested in one or more of these.

277
00:34:56,090 --> 00:35:01,130
So which is more important? Perceived support or exposure?

278
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:05,990
Hold on. We already did that. Perceived support or experienced support?

279
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:15,990
First of all, how do those differ? What do we mean by perceived support versus experience to support?

280
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:31,150
Come on, you're laughing. Oh, you don't know. Yeah.

281
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:38,740
So is the difference with questions like how do you perceive that an hour versus like how many times this week that somebody.

282
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:44,149
Yeah. So there could be differences in the way we're asking the questions.

283
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:48,290
But even on the more objective measures, how often did someone help you?

284
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:54,500
You could have actually been helped five times. And you say zero because you didn't perceive it.

285
00:35:55,190 --> 00:36:05,929
Right. So this idea of perceived versus experience, support, this is really sort of meant to be more about objectively.

286
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:13,219
Like if someone if I could watch you for a week and I could sort of observe when you

287
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:20,420
receive support and quantify it versus what you perceived and what you're reporting.

288
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:25,680
And I'll just tell you, we don't measure it this way.

289
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:33,680
We measure it through perceptions. And so it can be like Abbott was saying it, it can be perceptions of the adequacy of support.

290
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:40,160
There's those kinds of questions and then there can be more sort of quantitative measures of perceived support.

291
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:45,310
How many times did someone help you with a tangible need?

292
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:48,170
How many times did someone provide you emotional support?

293
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:55,880
So we can ask those different kinds of questions, but they're always coming from the the the respondents.

294
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:08,680
And so the question is, I mean, we can think about this in the context of a measurement error.

295
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:15,100
Like, are people wrong? Do people misreport the amount of support they have?

296
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:18,880
But then we can also think of it more philosophically,

297
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:26,110
like in terms of how is it more important what people perceive or what they actually experience.

298
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:35,390
Yeah. I know what I'm thinking. I bet you feel, like, perceived as more important.

299
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:40,900
Yeah, definitely. Yeah, I like this.

300
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:51,770
That's been. Plan to maintain the perception is probably really important for mental health outcomes.

301
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:04,079
The experience could be more important for some physical health outcomes.

302
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:09,860
You may not. Perceive or report something as support.

303
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:18,830
But if somebody really did provide some kind of support that directly impacted maybe your ability to receive health care or something like that,

304
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:22,990
it could impact your health whether you realize it or not.

305
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:29,510
Right. I mean, just this kind of gets back to when we talked about stress early in the semester.

306
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:38,090
Like what's more important, like objective exposure to a stressor or the perception of that stressor as stressful?

307
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:42,650
Like how how do those have different impacts on people's health?

308
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,550
And so I think you would just have to think about this in your study.

309
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:52,340
For your outcome, what's more important,

310
00:38:54,320 --> 00:39:05,990
I'm going to a dissertation prospectus defense this afternoon where the student is studying loneliness and how and one of their chapters,

311
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:09,560
which I think is really interesting that is going to be challenging to do,

312
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:23,120
is thinking about gender and age differences in willingness to report loneliness and how that might influence the results that you see in the

313
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:37,160
relationship between self-reported loneliness and health and trying to correct for any basically information bias and in measuring loneliness.

314
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:46,190
But there's no gold standard measure of loneliness that you can use to sort of map that to you.

315
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:54,500
So people have done this kind of work looking at symptoms of depression and willingness to report certain symptoms of depression.

316
00:39:54,500 --> 00:40:01,489
And so the so the CCD scale, I think it still does include a question about crying,

317
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:05,569
but a lot of people take that question out because it was found to like men would

318
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:10,250
underreport that symptom and so it would make it look like they had less depression.

319
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:15,350
But it was because of the way the question was asked. So that's the kind of idea that she's trying to get at.

320
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:21,710
But it's really tricky to measure something that can't be objectively measured.

321
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:29,070
We have to rely on reports. Okay.

322
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:37,900
So social influence. So thinking about shared norms within social networks,

323
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:46,640
we were talking about that over here earlier with how riding bikes became a norm and then hiking sort of became the norm.

324
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:52,040
What are some other examples of shared norms in social networks?

325
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:55,490
You can think about your own social networks or other people's networks.

326
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:14,700
Yeah. I'm sorry, but I guess I used to work in HIV prevention, so let me talk to one another.

327
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:22,470
Hmm. Mm hmm. Our conversation.

328
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:26,879
Yeah. Yeah. Norms around condom use.

329
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:33,150
You could see how that could be really important for health outcomes and might be, as we were talking about before,

330
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:38,430
thinking about interventions that might be a really important intervention target

331
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:46,470
other norms that might be in social networks that are health relevant or not.

332
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:49,530
Yeah. Yeah.

333
00:41:52,450 --> 00:42:02,500
Yeah, absolutely. So there's strong words within different religious groups about health behaviors like smoking or drinking or things like that.

334
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:07,950
Sexual behavior. Yeah.

335
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:12,850
I was going to say. I'm sure.

336
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:19,349
Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah. All kinds of health behaviors.

337
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:23,640
There can be norms within different social groups about that, for sure.

338
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:32,720
I mean, you can also think about things like like norms around studying.

339
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:42,829
Right. You think about in grad school, there might be a strong shared norms around studying and and things like that.

340
00:42:42,830 --> 00:42:48,280
So. So there's all kinds of norms that happen within social networks that can influence how.

341
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:53,209
So in terms of how they influence health, right.

342
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:56,450
Some behavioral norms might be more health promoting.

343
00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:06,690
And some might kind of be the opposite, right? But if in your social network.

344
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:13,170
I'm thinking about that. What was that Katy Perry song is from a long time ago.

345
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:18,610
Where? What is that? Which one?

346
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:23,080
Last Friday night? Yes. Thank you.

347
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:32,650
Do you guys know the song? You remember the song? Does anyone think it was just right on time?

348
00:43:34,930 --> 00:43:39,430
Okay. Who remembers the song and wants to tell us what it's about? The music video.

349
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:44,950
And that's why I'm like, Wait. Yeah, I'll make something else.

350
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:50,440
Okay. Who wants to tell us about this song? No one wants to admit that they listen to Katy Perry.

351
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:55,260
Yes, Jack. Okay. You okay?

352
00:43:55,630 --> 00:43:58,630
I love this song. I love it. I've really bad taste in music.

353
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:04,299
So no judgment. Katy Perry. Because I'm having it on.

354
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:12,950
Because I don't want to get it wrong. Okay. It's basically like last Friday night we danced, so to speak,

355
00:44:12,970 --> 00:44:20,650
because then we forgot next credit card got kicked out of the bar, drinking in the park, skinny dipping, etc., etc.

356
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:26,950
Not necessarily. And the end is why we're going to do it again.

357
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:28,360
We're going to do it again.

358
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:40,000
So the whole song is about like partying, binge drinking, having negative consequences for binge drinking and then saying, we're going to do it again.

359
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:43,750
Right. Okay. This would not be a healthy norm.

360
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:51,190
This would not be not be health promoting. Right. But just a just a fun example.

361
00:44:51,310 --> 00:44:57,940
I think I think the song is meant to be a commentary on that, not promoting it.

362
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:05,890
But yes, so these types of being some behavioral norms are health promoting and some are health damaging,

363
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:13,390
particularly norms that can be around things like smoking or heavy drinking or condom use.

364
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:19,240
Those can be really very important for health. So, yes, no.

365
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:24,340
Oh, everything's perfect to hit the wind.

366
00:45:25,610 --> 00:45:31,450
Yes. So therefore, before you put this to begin with.

367
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:37,600
Yeah. And sometimes it's like, oh, yeah.

368
00:45:37,870 --> 00:45:44,590
Like from years ago, sometimes people went to like this and then.

369
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:49,209
Yeah, there could be injury. Yeah. Yeah. No, that's a really great point.

370
00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:53,320
So. So things like shared norms around physical discipline.

371
00:45:53,710 --> 00:46:02,500
So I came from the norms and the some of us were spare the rod, spoil the child, where like if you're not using,

372
00:46:02,830 --> 00:46:08,740
you know, physical discipline with your children, you're like doing it wrong that you're not being a good parent.

373
00:46:08,770 --> 00:46:13,780
Right. But like you say, that can have impacts on the psychological well-being.

374
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:22,030
It can also affects them physically. So, yeah, these are these are very strong norms that we're.

375
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:40,390
We can also think about I'm thinking about some of the projects that some of you are doing and thinking about norms around help

376
00:46:40,410 --> 00:46:48,970
seeking for mental health or for physical health that that those can be strong shared norms that might influence health outcomes.

377
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:56,220
And so a lot of different norms within groups that can can have an influence on health.

378
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:04,680
So this is kind of I thought we could talk just a little bit about the Christakis and Fowler paper.

379
00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:09,340
So this is the one on the spread of BMI in social networks.

380
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:17,230
And so a lot of you there were a lot of comments about this, and they were they were sort of in two groups.

381
00:47:17,590 --> 00:47:21,880
So and some people had both comments within their same comment, which was like,

382
00:47:21,910 --> 00:47:25,870
oh, my God, this is like super fascinating what they did and how they do it.

383
00:47:25,870 --> 00:47:32,530
And then, oh, my God, the like the stigmatizing language that's used in this paper.

384
00:47:32,770 --> 00:47:43,509
And I do think that's true. This is an old kind of it's not old, old, but it's I would say it's kind of like a classic paper now in social networks.

385
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:55,330
What year is it from? 2007. But this was not the way that obesity was talked about in this paper at the time, was not considered problematic.

386
00:47:55,600 --> 00:48:05,500
That is how much society has changed, you know, over this kind of 15 year period and talking about and thinking about obesity.

387
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:19,420
So this is kind of coming at a time when people are extremely alarmed about increases in the prevalence of BMI over 30 or over 25.

388
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:26,889
So thinking about overweight and obesity and this really starts to happen in like the 1980s in the United States,

389
00:48:26,890 --> 00:48:30,850
and then it just accelerates rapidly over time.

390
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:35,380
And so people are really trying to understand what is happening, like, where did this come from?

391
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:40,780
Why is it suddenly happening and what do we do about it?

392
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:46,899
Because people are really concerned about the implications that this would have for life expectancy,

393
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:55,270
for things like diabetes risk and other health conditions of cardiovascular disease that are associated with adiposity.

394
00:48:55,510 --> 00:49:01,120
And so there's a lot of interest in this topic at the time and in trying to understand it,

395
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:13,419
because it's pretty clear that something is going on other than just imbalance between energy intake and expenditure, right?

396
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:16,000
Because why is this happening at the population level?

397
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:25,330
And so this is kind of this work is coming out of an attempt to have a different approach to understanding obesity.

398
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:28,780
Um, but so I'll stop there with giving that background.

399
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:32,830
But I'm interested to hear what you thought about it in terms of, you know,

400
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:37,929
those of you who thought this is a really interesting approach, like what was it that was interesting?

401
00:49:37,930 --> 00:49:43,780
And those of you who were sort of more skeptical about this approach, what generated the skepticism?

402
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:50,360
Yeah. Personally, I'm frustrated.

403
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:55,980
Mm hmm. I just.

404
00:50:06,350 --> 00:50:09,720
Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to catch a reason.

405
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:14,540
Yeah. It's like a really problematic way of thinking about that.

406
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:20,110
Yeah, I think, you know, I. Training 2015.

407
00:50:22,330 --> 00:50:32,880
Yeah. Huge problem. I do not.

408
00:50:36,510 --> 00:50:41,660
At the end of June. I said, Yeah, yeah.

409
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:51,490
We decided to try to figure out how. Yeah.

410
00:50:55,930 --> 00:50:58,930
You know. Yeah.

411
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:07,010
So some of this was about the way that results are presented and the language less than necessarily the methods or the question itself.

412
00:51:07,070 --> 00:51:10,550
But how is this being presented and interpreted and.

413
00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:21,740
Any thoughts on this article yet, Patricia? Yeah, I think I've been talking about this for.

414
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:37,509
Yeah. Yeah.

415
00:51:37,510 --> 00:51:42,070
The good and bad language. And you see this all the time in public health.

416
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:50,280
All the time. We talk about good neighborhoods and bad neighborhoods and good behaviors and bad behavior.

417
00:51:50,330 --> 00:51:59,500
There's a lot of, um, sort of judgment on, on these things.

418
00:51:59,710 --> 00:52:04,590
Uh, even in. AB And even when you were talking about condom use, right?

419
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:11,350
Like there's this implicit kind of using condoms is good and not using condoms is bad.

420
00:52:11,710 --> 00:52:18,040
And of course, there's a reason. I mean, you know, why do we say that? Why do public health people say using condoms is good?

421
00:52:21,350 --> 00:52:24,350
You can say lots of things. Yeah, like both.

422
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:28,620
Because it's good for your health. And also because it causes people to become.

423
00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:37,460
Spreading illness is often interpreted by society as.

424
00:52:39,150 --> 00:52:49,460
And so I think it's about the health. Which can become problematic when you start to say that communities are in the sectors and also that is.

425
00:52:52,940 --> 00:53:04,970
Yeah. Yeah. Because they get kind of mixed up together though, like the people, like good for health and good ethical and morally right.

426
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:19,850
I mean, and even we've talked even even going further like all about this idea of always defining certain health outcomes as good or bad.

427
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:25,040
Um, and there's reasons why we do some of that right.

428
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:30,860
I think most of us would probably agree we'd rather not have HIV than have HIV.

429
00:53:31,730 --> 00:53:42,440
Right. Um, but, and so that's where that kind of that comes from, is like, okay, using condoms prevents this disease that we think is bad.

430
00:53:42,710 --> 00:53:46,430
And so using condoms is good. And people who use condoms are good.

431
00:53:49,530 --> 00:53:53,640
And then so you can see how that same language got applied to obesity.

432
00:53:53,850 --> 00:53:57,899
If the thinking is obesity is bad, obesity is a disease.

433
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:01,620
Although at this time obesity hadn't been classified as a disease yet, but it has.

434
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:05,760
Now there's an ICD ten code for obesity is considered a disease.

435
00:54:06,270 --> 00:54:10,770
If we want to prevent disease, that's good. How do we do that?

436
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:19,440
If we think about it through behavioral mechanisms like eating a physical activity, but eating a certain kind of diet is good and engaging.

437
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:31,080
Certain types of physical activity is good, so it's hard to not have these kind of moral value judgments in public health.

438
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:36,209
And so I do think we have to be careful about how we talk about them,

439
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:41,850
but also recognizing that the way people think about these things will shift over time.

440
00:54:44,890 --> 00:54:53,920
We have seen a really big shift in the way people think about the stigmatization of obesity since this paper was written.

441
00:54:54,130 --> 00:55:01,430
Yeah, I know. That.

442
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:12,270
You could say like attack of anything good and bad.

443
00:55:12,670 --> 00:55:19,610
Is it because it's. Like you said, I hope the resolve.

444
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:44,100
You know something? You know something. When you're maybe. Now that.

445
00:55:48,010 --> 00:55:53,080
Whatever terms you use because of the way your language works.

446
00:55:54,340 --> 00:56:01,330
Farai Lay In terms that were previously not considered pejorative word.

447
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:08,970
So if you think about the labels that certain groups like to use to describe themselves.

448
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:12,800
Right. Like think about the use of the term queer. Right.

449
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:16,120
That that was like an insult at some point.

450
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:19,930
And now it's been embraced as a preferred term.

451
00:56:20,890 --> 00:56:27,670
So there's there's all these ways in which language has the ability to kind of morph.

452
00:56:28,090 --> 00:56:35,260
And so I think whether you're calling it health promoting or health risk.

453
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:41,620
Risk of behavior. Health promoting behavior, or whether you're calling it healthy or unhealthy,

454
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:50,770
I think no matter what's what catches up to it over time is the connection to good and and bad, right and wrong?

455
00:56:51,130 --> 00:57:03,740
I think it's hard to avoid that. But I think it's something we can think about when we're doing research,

456
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:14,629
like thinking about our outcome and why we care about this outcome and how we how the way we talk

457
00:57:14,630 --> 00:57:20,270
about it and the way we talk about the factors that we're looking at is influencing this outcome.

458
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:24,800
I mean, this hasn't really happened in public health, to my knowledge.

459
00:57:25,010 --> 00:57:31,100
Like a big movement toward focusing on wellness instead of wellness.

460
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:37,700
But I do think psychology had this sort of big movement toward positive psychology.

461
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:43,730
And so instead of thinking always about psychopathology, thinking about flourishing and well-being,

462
00:57:43,850 --> 00:57:51,080
and so maybe maybe in public health, that's another way that we could that's a direction that we could move.

463
00:57:51,560 --> 00:58:02,980
What do you think about that? Yeah.

464
00:58:02,990 --> 00:58:06,180
Ali. Yeah.

465
00:58:08,470 --> 00:58:17,180
Yeah. You know, I personally.

466
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:30,250
I mean. You know.

467
00:58:36,490 --> 00:58:45,270
You know, I. Yeah.

468
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:58,320
Yeah. And I think that's one of the point you're bringing up is the importance of understanding causality there and how you think about that.

469
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:09,600
Um, the other thing I'm thinking about is the sort of the intentional use of stigma and stigmatization and in public health campaigns,

470
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:17,370
thinking particularly about smoking and how that was embraced as a public health strategy

471
00:59:17,370 --> 00:59:24,269
to stigmatize smoking smokers or some of the most stigmatized people in our country today,

472
00:59:24,270 --> 00:59:29,520
I would say. And is smoking randomly distributed in the population?

473
00:59:31,670 --> 00:59:42,080
Right. And so I think there was a realization, particularly around HIV, that stigmatization was counterproductive,

474
00:59:42,530 --> 00:59:47,300
but that was not going to be an effective strategy to reduce HIV transmission.

475
00:59:48,170 --> 00:59:55,729
But I do think to some extent, it may have been the case that that approach is more similar to smoking,

476
00:59:55,730 --> 00:59:59,150
were thought to be used intentionally around obesity.

477
00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:04,970
That stigmatization of obesity can be an effective public health strategy.

478
01:00:05,750 --> 01:00:15,230
I don't think that's true. And so I think we have seen some movement away from that, from stigmatization.

479
01:00:15,770 --> 01:00:29,400
But it is still stigmatized. Do you want to talk about the causal questions in this analysis?

480
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:40,149
Sarah Did you just clap your hands? Oh, no, I couldn't do that analysis.

481
01:00:40,150 --> 01:01:04,060
I don't know what the heck they did exactly. Yeah.

482
01:01:07,450 --> 01:01:11,510
That's why I clap. Because forgot. Yeah.

483
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:15,470
Who else wants to talk about that? Abby, you had concerns about that.

484
01:01:15,710 --> 01:01:20,480
I can second that, but I don't have anything. Yeah, no, you just.

485
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:24,940
I was, I. I could be convinced by their because they were so full.

486
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:31,860
It? Probably. They probably did something that I don't understand. Right.

487
01:01:33,350 --> 01:01:39,339
I it was. I think there's a couple of things that are going on.

488
01:01:39,340 --> 01:01:43,580
And so they're like control. So they're really looking at change over time.

489
01:01:44,030 --> 01:01:49,040
So they do have longitudinal data. They are controlling for like baseline levels of staff.

490
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:55,400
And so they are looking at change and finding change hard.

491
01:01:55,610 --> 01:02:01,730
Like if you've ever done longitudinal analysis and you adjust for baseline, baseline explains almost everything.

492
01:02:02,090 --> 01:02:11,630
And so if you are seeing that there's kind of still, um, if you do see evidence of change adjusting for baseline that's kind of,

493
01:02:13,220 --> 01:02:17,090
you know, somewhat compelling evidence for there being a causal association.

494
01:02:17,090 --> 01:02:21,060
Not perfect, certainly it's still observational. Um,

495
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:27,709
I think also because they have these which are very clever of these different ways

496
01:02:27,710 --> 01:02:34,310
of testing their hypotheses by hypothesizing different relationships based on the,

497
01:02:34,310 --> 01:02:48,469
um, the type of relationship between the ego and the alter, that the pattern of findings seems to be suggestive of a causal relationship.

498
01:02:48,470 --> 01:02:52,940
And why would that be? You you remember some of the things that they found.

499
01:02:56,690 --> 01:02:59,690
Like when was there the strongest effect?

500
01:03:00,530 --> 01:03:04,880
Yeah. That's why they were. Yeah.

501
01:03:05,060 --> 01:03:09,440
When the ego and the alter like each said, that person is my friend.

502
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:14,030
So they were mutual friends. And I think of the same gender too.

503
01:03:14,030 --> 01:03:19,760
Right? Like that was stronger. So if they were the same gender and they were mutual friends, that was the strongest.

504
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:25,140
They. What did they find was neighbors. You remember?

505
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:31,100
The neighbors influence each other. No, they didn't.

506
01:03:31,430 --> 01:03:38,900
Right. Um, and then spouses, we're kind of inter media, I think.

507
01:03:39,380 --> 01:03:43,170
And then there were siblings that they looked out to, so they.

508
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:50,570
They looked at all these different types of relationships and found that it was when the people were,

509
01:03:50,570 --> 01:03:58,970
like, kind of both strongly connected to one another, that there was this influence of one on the other.

510
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:04,310
And so they argue that this supports a mechanism of.

511
01:04:08,290 --> 01:04:11,890
Shared norms is what they argue.

512
01:04:12,550 --> 01:04:20,500
So like they conclude that the psychosocial mechanisms for the spread of obesity on social network may rely

513
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:29,170
less on behavioral imitation than on a change in the ego's general perception of social norms about obesity.

514
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:37,930
That's what they claim. And they claim that based on looking at these different types of like diets, do you buy that?

515
01:04:40,250 --> 01:04:45,950
You know, do you not buying it? Okay. Is anybody convinced by that?

516
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:56,400
Maybe. I mean, I think it's I think it's stronger when you have these kind of things where you're testing it.

517
01:04:56,480 --> 01:05:06,140
I think it can it's stronger than just looking at it across the board and saying, we found this, that we think that this is causal.

518
01:05:07,430 --> 01:05:16,550
But to me, it's like this doesn't do anything, in my opinion, to sort of explain.

519
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:23,140
What caused the increase in obesity at the population level.

520
01:05:23,290 --> 01:05:28,600
Right. It doesn't do anything to explain why we observe these linked temporal trends,

521
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:36,309
which have to suggest something like a larger environmental, probably like explanation for this.

522
01:05:36,310 --> 01:05:42,940
That's not about individual behavior or norms, not that this is a component of it.

523
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:53,080
Maybe it is, but like what was happening in the food environment or something at this time that was leading, that was initiating these changes.

524
01:05:53,470 --> 01:05:56,980
And I think that's really not addressed in here at all.

525
01:05:56,980 --> 01:06:07,510
And so the focus to me is, is too much on on behavior and on individual stuff, even though it's a social network analysis.

526
01:06:07,510 --> 01:06:13,150
So it's like it's moving kind of away from the individual, but it's really leaving out like macro level factors.

527
01:06:13,540 --> 01:06:24,309
Yeah. No. Well, yeah, that's like my I think there's like a little bit of themselves for a reason.

528
01:06:24,310 --> 01:06:27,830
You can be sure it's previous studies.

529
01:06:29,810 --> 01:06:33,350
Yeah. Yes. Yeah. No, that I.

530
01:06:33,770 --> 01:06:38,150
Absolutely. Okay. Well, my friend is doing something. Me, so I'm doing that.

531
01:06:38,570 --> 01:06:41,240
I don't think that's how it works.

532
01:06:41,420 --> 01:06:49,870
So that's kind of what makes me like skeptical of some of the underlying assumptions that make this all come together to make sense.

533
01:06:50,570 --> 01:06:54,379
I don't know that I'm on the fence. Yeah, I completely agree.

534
01:06:54,380 --> 01:06:54,740
It is.

535
01:06:54,740 --> 01:07:06,620
It's totally based on the assumption that it's really just about like energy intake and expenditure and that there's nothing else going on with this.

536
01:07:06,620 --> 01:07:10,730
And that is purely behavioral. And I think that's highly questionable.

537
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:19,130
I mean, so they did look at things. They said that they were looking at neighbors to see if there was a larger environmental influence.

538
01:07:19,490 --> 01:07:24,650
Um, but again, this is over a short period of time.

539
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:30,110
So. So things like changes in the food environment might not show up in that.

540
01:07:30,110 --> 01:07:39,019
And then the other piece of that, um, is that this is all in one town in Massachusetts.

541
01:07:39,020 --> 01:07:44,750
This is framing, right? So it's one place.

542
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:48,379
And so there could be peculiarities about that place.

543
01:07:48,380 --> 01:07:52,459
And it's a very kind of it's I think it's entirely white.

544
01:07:52,460 --> 01:07:59,480
I think Framingham was entirely white. The sample. So the generalizability this is fairly limited.

545
01:08:00,470 --> 01:08:07,459
But it did want you to read it because it is a kind of classic in social networks and how and it

546
01:08:07,460 --> 01:08:13,520
does kind of they did use a very different approach than what we typically use in epidemiology,

547
01:08:13,820 --> 01:08:21,200
um, to study health outcomes. All right.

548
01:08:21,290 --> 01:08:28,310
So social engagement. So networks can promote social participation and engagement.

549
01:08:28,340 --> 01:08:32,690
What would be some examples of that? Social participation and engagement.

550
01:08:36,380 --> 01:08:39,380
I know we may have forgotten over the past two and a half years,

551
01:08:39,380 --> 01:08:45,350
but what are some things you used to do that were social participation and engagement?

552
01:08:48,850 --> 01:08:51,970
Mhm. Yeah. I didn't go to parties.

553
01:08:55,710 --> 01:09:02,580
Yeah, sure. Okay. I have the hour after work parties.

554
01:09:03,130 --> 01:09:06,760
Going to church, going to a sewing circle or whatever.

555
01:09:06,770 --> 01:09:15,030
All of these kinds of things. Right? Getting together with friends, going to parties, group, refereeing recreation, church and tender.

556
01:09:16,990 --> 01:09:20,350
Do you think these things affect health or are they just fun?

557
01:09:22,030 --> 01:09:29,950
I see them sort of, yes. I think we all understood that when we were stuck in our houses alone.

558
01:09:30,460 --> 01:09:39,560
Right. Social engagement is something that many of us, even introverts, some a little bit.

559
01:09:39,570 --> 01:09:42,820
But it's important for human health and well-being.

560
01:09:43,900 --> 01:09:47,980
It defines and reinforces meaningful social roles.

561
01:09:48,810 --> 01:09:59,090
And this gives us a sense of value belonging and an attachment which just seems to be kind of a core human need.

562
01:10:00,220 --> 01:10:06,030
We need this. We're we're social beings.

563
01:10:11,780 --> 01:10:18,080
And so the largely the opportunities that you have for social engagement depend on your social networks.

564
01:10:18,740 --> 01:10:24,620
And so that's part of how your social networks are influencing your health as a through opportunities for social engagement.

565
01:10:31,210 --> 01:10:36,590
And providing opportunities for companionship. Oh, I wanted to.

566
01:10:36,790 --> 01:10:42,400
CULLEN You mentioned you talked about social isolation versus emotional isolation.

567
01:10:42,430 --> 01:10:46,630
Can you explain the difference between social isolation and emotional isolation?

568
01:10:57,610 --> 01:11:01,210
So, like you have zero social ties. Yeah. Yeah. How?

569
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:13,940
Mm hmm. Yeah. Yeah.

570
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:26,100
Yeah, definitely. Yeah.

571
01:11:29,230 --> 01:11:36,129
Yeah. So you could have social ties and your network, you could report for friends or whatever,

572
01:11:36,130 --> 01:11:42,070
but you could feel you could still have loneliness and that that could impact your health.

573
01:11:42,220 --> 01:11:51,940
Yeah. Um, so the idea here is that having social networks could give you opportunities for social participation.

574
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:59,580
Engagement, but not necessarily. Right. And so it's that piece that's important to to benefit from.

575
01:12:00,670 --> 01:12:06,460
So then the social networks also, um, involve person to person contact,

576
01:12:06,580 --> 01:12:12,190
sometimes not always free, but so it's person to person contact, good or bad for health.

577
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:28,820
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I was. And.

578
01:12:35,130 --> 01:12:40,610
There. And a lot.

579
01:12:41,830 --> 01:12:47,690
I only ask. Yeah.

580
01:12:48,070 --> 01:12:57,730
So it can be health promoting because sometimes we may be more motivated to engage in health promoting behaviors in a social context.

581
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:07,360
Yeah. Yeah. When I when I lived in Alabama, my mom and I would go walking, like, in the evening, and then I moved and she stopped doing it.

582
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:14,469
And I think that's probably pretty common. If you there were other people who talked about gym buddies in the in the comments.

583
01:13:14,470 --> 01:13:26,050
Right. Like, so sometimes our health behavior really is tied to those social interactions and the person to person kind of it's not quite the same.

584
01:13:26,470 --> 01:13:29,540
So call your mom on Zoom and go for a walk or anything like that.

585
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:35,260
So we're just making kind of motions thing so it doesn't work very well.

586
01:13:36,850 --> 01:13:44,950
Yeah. So so this person to person contact can be good if it encourages promoting behaviors and person to person contact.

587
01:13:45,250 --> 01:13:51,530
Be bad for health. Yeah. I also said because of the pandemic.

588
01:13:51,790 --> 01:13:58,599
Yeah. That infectious disease. Yeah, absolutely right.

589
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:04,479
That's how COVID and other infectious diseases are transmitted is through person to person contact.

590
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:09,910
And that's why we all have to stay in our houses for a million years or however long it lasts.

591
01:14:09,910 --> 01:14:13,870
It actually wasn't that long, but it felt like a really long time.

592
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:22,660
But yeah, it was person to person. Contact can be good for health if it's promoting sort of social engagement and health promoting behaviors.

593
01:14:22,930 --> 01:14:26,889
But it can also be a way that infectious diseases in particular are transmitted.

594
01:14:26,890 --> 01:14:40,760
So kind of good and bad. Social networks can also influence our access to material resources, which we know are really important for health.

595
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:46,640
Right. So social networks are really important for job opportunities.

596
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:53,629
You know, you're thinking about some of you who are second year students are probably starting to think about applying for jobs.

597
01:14:53,630 --> 01:15:00,350
You've got a semester left are you know, think about that alumni network for Michigan.

598
01:15:00,350 --> 01:15:04,280
Right. You want to tap into that? That's part of how we sell the program, right?

599
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:09,320
We have this alumni network of people who are in all these places that can kind of help you get a job.

600
01:15:09,860 --> 01:15:15,080
So social networks are super important for job opportunities.

601
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:25,880
They can be important for health care. So, you know, a lot of times if you move to a new town.

602
01:15:26,720 --> 01:15:32,190
You might ask somebody at work. But Doctor, do you use or what dentists do you use?

603
01:15:32,210 --> 01:15:39,290
That's how I found my doctor and my dentist and whatever. When I moved here, I asked people who I trusted, who lived in Ann Arbor.

604
01:15:39,590 --> 01:15:48,980
Who should I go to? Right. Housing another one. That this is something that you can gain access to through the social networks.

605
01:15:50,030 --> 01:15:56,780
And these are all really important for health and things that we often don't think about as being shaped

606
01:15:57,290 --> 01:16:04,040
by social networks and those larger macro forces that are shaping the nature of your social networks.

607
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:12,440
So you can see how thinking about job opportunities, this can lead to racial inequalities in the job market.

608
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:15,650
Right. And I have the sort of opportunity structures here,

609
01:16:15,650 --> 01:16:23,719
because if we think about these larger macro structural conditions, like we we're talking about racism and sexism.

610
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:32,960
And if racism is pattern patterning, residential segregation and that's developing networks and then that's influencing job opportunities,

611
01:16:33,260 --> 01:16:37,340
it's like going all the way from the macro level down to the micro level.

612
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:47,230
Okay. So there's also we've largely been focused with the exception of the key here,

613
01:16:47,310 --> 01:16:54,030
think we've largely been focused on the positive and promoting aspects of social networks.

614
01:16:54,030 --> 01:17:00,060
But there's also we have to remember that there are negative interactions and social relationships as well.

615
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:12,300
And so there's things like demands, criticism, direct conflict of use that can happen in social networks and in interpersonal relationships.

616
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:20,159
And these are not as studied. These are well-studied in thinking about how these aspects of social networks and relationships influence health.

617
01:17:20,160 --> 01:17:35,160
But they're clearly very important. So then the last piece here is thinking about pathways and those more like proximate determinants of health.

618
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:39,240
So health behaviors, psychological well-being and physiology.

619
01:17:45,510 --> 01:17:50,330
So we've talked a lot already about health, promoting damaging behavior.

620
01:17:54,680 --> 01:18:06,559
So this would be, you know, things like smoking, drinking, exercise, diet, condom use, seatbelt use, all the all the common behaviors we know about.

621
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:11,620
Right. We've also talked about cognitive and emotional states.

622
01:18:11,630 --> 01:18:22,060
So thinking about how our social networks influence our self-esteem, how they influence our sense of social competence, self-efficacy, depression.

623
01:18:26,650 --> 01:18:32,350
And then also how they influence our stress response and so very much on the biological level.

624
01:18:33,610 --> 01:18:35,950
So we know that, for example,

625
01:18:35,950 --> 01:18:45,570
social isolation can lead to accelerated biological aging because it's chronically it's a chronically stressful state to be socially isolated.

626
01:18:48,370 --> 01:18:59,140
I think that the next 20 years we'll have lots of research on this and how social isolation during the pandemic impacted health, of course.

627
01:18:59,410 --> 01:19:04,690
It'll take a long time to see. But I think there will be a lot of work in this area.

628
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:15,880
We also know, for example, that early handling and separation from the mother and baby rats leads to permanent changes in the HP axis.

629
01:19:17,230 --> 01:19:26,740
So there's ways in which our sort of social interactions and social relationships can influence our biological stress responses.

630
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:32,339
So in terms of the evidence,

631
01:19:32,340 --> 01:19:40,890
there are a whole bunch of longitudinal studies going back many decades showing increased mortality risk for people who are socially isolated.

632
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:50,760
And meta analysis suggests that one and a half times increased risk of death for those who are socially isolated versus those who are not.

633
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:58,709
There's some work I'm thinking of this 1988 study that was this really big paper

634
01:19:58,710 --> 01:20:03,720
that came out in science that was about social relationships and mortality.

635
01:20:03,990 --> 01:20:09,990
And they found that social isolation had as large of an effect on risk for mortality as smoking.

636
01:20:10,590 --> 01:20:17,460
So most of the time, social factors have a little teeny tiny impact on health outcomes compared to behaviors.

637
01:20:17,730 --> 01:20:27,210
But social isolation really has a strong effect on mortality, in particular for cardiovascular disease and stroke.

638
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:34,650
There's not a lot of evidence that that social relationships are related to incidence of these things,

639
01:20:34,890 --> 01:20:42,690
but it does seem to be strongly related to sort of the course of disease in the outcome, prognosis and survival.

640
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:49,080
So people who have a heart attack or have a stroke, if they have strong social networks,

641
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:52,530
than they typically do better than those who have fewer social supports.

642
01:20:52,800 --> 01:21:01,170
It makes sense. Thinking about the instrumental support aspects, particularly especially for something like stroke.

643
01:21:01,980 --> 01:21:08,870
And also thinking about the emotional. So for cognitive function, this one's a little trickier.

644
01:21:10,780 --> 01:21:15,919
And this is what the prospective defense I'm going through this afternoon, where the exposure is loneliness.

645
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:19,940
Their outcome is it's a cognition outcome for older adults.

646
01:21:21,830 --> 01:21:29,450
Social engagement and network activities are related to cognitive function, but it could be reverse causation.

647
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:38,840
And why might that be? Why might social engagement be lower in people who are starting to have cognitive difficulties?

648
01:21:42,590 --> 01:21:46,460
Yeah, I. Yeah.

649
01:21:50,640 --> 01:22:00,140
Yeah. Yeah, you might withdraw from social interactions because it's embarrassing to start having memory lapses or things like that.

650
01:22:00,140 --> 01:22:09,800
Right. And so this is an area that where of research where it's it's kind of hard to tease apart the causal relationship there,

651
01:22:10,460 --> 01:22:21,750
although there's there's plenty of reason to believe that having social interactions could could help in terms of cognitive function.

652
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:26,180
So, so, but teasing those apart empirically is difficult.

653
01:22:28,160 --> 01:22:33,380
With infectious diseases. We know that disease can spread through networks via contact.

654
01:22:33,740 --> 01:22:41,810
That's kind of obvious. But people who have more social ties are less susceptible to things like the common cold.

655
01:22:43,250 --> 01:22:52,910
There's evidence that they fight infection better. HIV positive individuals with more support showed higher CD4 counts.

656
01:22:54,920 --> 01:23:00,920
So, yes, social networks are a way for infectious diseases to spread.

657
01:23:01,310 --> 01:23:10,040
But having strong social networks can improve outcomes for people who are exposed to infectious disease and have infectious disease.

658
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:25,719
And of course, you know, largely the evidence is based on real world social interactions rather than virtual networks,

659
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:34,270
which are becoming much more common. And so thinking about what the evidence will look like, I don't know, 20, 30 years from now,

660
01:23:34,270 --> 01:23:44,170
it may be different as we start to do more thinking about both virtual networks and the combination of virtual and sort of real life networks.

661
01:23:49,990 --> 01:23:53,140
Okay. So here are just just a few things for us to think about.

662
01:24:00,210 --> 01:24:04,830
Do you feel like our society is becoming more or less socially integrated?

663
01:24:09,130 --> 01:24:17,830
And why. Yes.

664
01:24:17,830 --> 01:24:21,350
There. Yeah.

665
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:25,760
How are we defining socially integrated? I wasn't sure if you have like this.

666
01:24:40,150 --> 01:24:44,420
No. Same.

667
01:24:50,810 --> 01:24:54,900
Yeah. Otherwise.

668
01:25:01,750 --> 01:25:08,850
Yeah. Like, cause you're, you're thinking about a distinction between a kind of the larger macro level, like as a society,

669
01:25:08,890 --> 01:25:18,970
are we more or less socially integrated in terms of social cohesion versus with in our kind of more nutso level social networks,

670
01:25:20,170 --> 01:25:24,489
are we more closely connected and integrated with our groups?

671
01:25:24,490 --> 01:25:29,680
And so I think what you're saying is that we can have a situation where at the macro level,

672
01:25:29,890 --> 01:25:34,690
there's less integration, less social cohesion and more polarization.

673
01:25:35,080 --> 01:25:45,610
But at the more mezzo level, you could have stronger ties and actually be more strongly integrated within your smaller network.

674
01:25:48,110 --> 01:25:58,690
That could be. The only time you want to say something with what you want to say.

675
01:26:04,150 --> 01:26:10,210
Yes. It's a great song.

676
01:26:10,540 --> 01:26:15,180
Yeah. So you probably get sucked into that for a long time.

677
01:26:15,780 --> 01:26:24,410
Yeah. Which friends?

678
01:26:27,110 --> 01:26:32,590
I wanted to do it again. I think the was.

679
01:26:37,790 --> 01:26:43,270
Integrated was. We're just so excited about it.

680
01:26:43,320 --> 01:26:53,520
I think they. Yeah.

681
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:56,770
And probably like a social media connection.

682
01:26:57,060 --> 01:27:02,340
Social media and virtual social networks play a large role.

683
01:27:06,440 --> 01:27:10,230
Yeah. I'm.

684
01:27:13,430 --> 01:27:16,530
Yeah, yeah, yeah, maybe.

685
01:27:20,590 --> 01:27:29,840
But if you break it up, I'd say because you are being be like that is just so fast.

686
01:27:29,870 --> 01:27:34,550
Yeah. Yeah. Everyone is always working so much to make money.

687
01:27:36,020 --> 01:27:42,630
But before I was just friends, you know, I was.

688
01:27:44,750 --> 01:27:48,790
So we like it. It's very. It's.

689
01:27:52,140 --> 01:27:59,100
So. So. So. That's the reason I went.

690
01:27:59,670 --> 01:28:02,870
So. For all or like this.

691
01:28:03,050 --> 01:28:09,930
It's my fault. Okay. And then it goes on and on.

692
01:28:09,950 --> 01:28:14,700
And then eventually, you know, it's in front of friends.

693
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:20,700
But. Not.

694
01:28:23,190 --> 01:28:28,790
So they we're thinking about the quality of interactions that people have their networks.

695
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:40,620
And even if those networks are growing because networks extend now oftentimes beyond traditional relationships like elevators and that sort of thing,

696
01:28:41,790 --> 01:28:51,000
the quality of the interactions declined, which could have implications for for health for an individual and for the population.

697
01:28:51,030 --> 01:28:56,670
Caitlin. Yeah, I guess from my perspective it's not like, uh, like more or less.

698
01:28:57,570 --> 01:28:59,250
I just think that social integration is.

699
01:28:59,740 --> 01:29:06,070
It's happening in different parts that I have the best friends, like people that have connected more in person.

700
01:29:06,130 --> 01:29:09,370
Yeah, that's happening more. Yeah. Yeah.

701
01:29:11,070 --> 01:29:18,260
So. But the nature of the interactions is changing and changed by necessity during the pandemic.

702
01:29:18,270 --> 01:29:22,150
But some of that may be some of those changes may be kind of permanent.

703
01:29:23,190 --> 01:29:38,480
Yeah. I call on. Yeah.

704
01:29:44,840 --> 01:29:54,240
More. That we value those social connections more.

705
01:29:54,680 --> 01:30:02,160
Yeah. Yeah. And maybe that gets at the idea of like I think Sarah was talking about.

706
01:30:02,270 --> 01:30:05,750
It was a chosen family. Chosen network. What do you say?

707
01:30:06,710 --> 01:30:11,060
Family. Family. So, yeah, when when our networks involved,

708
01:30:11,060 --> 01:30:17,750
people that we've chosen to engage with that that can have a different quality than when our networks are

709
01:30:17,750 --> 01:30:27,410
largely just based on kind of default networks of a family and people we work with or people we live near.

710
01:30:33,980 --> 01:30:37,140
Yeah. Patricia.

711
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:45,520
Oh, no, no matter. You know, I couldn't have a. I'm sorry, but I was thinking that I'm going.

712
01:30:48,050 --> 01:30:59,240
No such thing, but I think you probably know what I'm looking for.

713
01:31:01,460 --> 01:31:08,080
You know, I think the social media, the. That's.

714
01:31:08,300 --> 01:31:13,190
But it's not easy to find, I suppose.

715
01:31:13,580 --> 01:31:27,290
So as soon as my friend Taylor would be too old to tell you things, to turn the ad against you.

716
01:31:28,090 --> 01:31:37,190
And honestly, I can see how big my friend is to make light of that, you know?

717
01:31:37,190 --> 01:31:40,220
So they keep it clean. You just start to teach people.

718
01:31:40,340 --> 01:31:49,340
Yeah. That's the one thing that I didn't produce so much was when I was trying to do.

719
01:31:52,020 --> 01:31:57,260
People. Yeah. And I think also a lot of.

720
01:31:59,370 --> 01:32:02,590
In a discussion around politics in that sense.

721
01:32:02,760 --> 01:32:16,020
But those kinds of social media algorithms have helped kind of reinforce certain political identities among people in opposition to others.

722
01:32:16,020 --> 01:32:21,540
And that is potentially led to increased polarization politically.

723
01:32:21,540 --> 01:32:30,930
And we're seeing now increasingly that political affiliations are falling along the lines of their social identities,

724
01:32:31,620 --> 01:32:40,139
whereas historically they didn't as much, particularly education is driving people's political identities and that those

725
01:32:40,140 --> 01:32:45,320
political identities are becoming really central to their personal identities.

726
01:32:46,260 --> 01:32:51,899
And so this is this is something that is different than we had historically and seems

727
01:32:51,900 --> 01:32:59,490
to be having influences in ways that could be really important for not just politics,

728
01:32:59,490 --> 01:33:04,930
but other. Oh.

729
01:33:04,930 --> 01:33:10,990
So the so we kind of talked about this a little bit, but but I do think it's important for us to consider that,

730
01:33:11,110 --> 01:33:16,000
that this question could have implications for population health.

731
01:33:18,280 --> 01:33:25,510
And so what does it mean for society to become more or less socially integrated?

732
01:33:25,930 --> 01:33:28,930
What does it mean for trust in institutions?

733
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:36,020
What does it mean for voting participation? But also, what does it mean for health and population health?

734
01:33:36,070 --> 01:33:48,160
And so I think these are these are important questions for people in public health to think about and in terms of interventions.

735
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:51,879
Right. Maybe this seems like how would you intervene on this?

736
01:33:51,880 --> 01:33:55,180
But but could you could you intervene in ways?

737
01:33:58,100 --> 01:34:01,690
To promote certain aspects of social networks that would you want.

738
01:34:10,870 --> 01:34:14,960
Yeah. I just. Yeah. Just.

739
01:34:18,830 --> 01:34:22,700
Yeah. And that's the purpose of that paper is that you want to.

740
01:34:27,660 --> 01:34:33,370
But focusing on. Yes.

741
01:34:33,540 --> 01:34:42,300
Important. That's.

742
01:34:44,040 --> 01:34:50,980
Yeah, they showed. Previous research showed that, especially for.

743
01:34:57,480 --> 01:35:02,370
How they control the. Yeah.

744
01:35:02,370 --> 01:35:08,460
So, so you could use this to do interventions at the level of peer networks.

745
01:35:09,030 --> 01:35:18,089
You can do that. We also talked about somebody mentioned in their comments when we were when there was a question about paper.

746
01:35:18,090 --> 01:35:26,280
We're going to talk about just a minute after the break. Is there anything you can intervene on in social media and somebody who is

747
01:35:26,280 --> 01:35:31,350
bringing up the idea of I think it was Instagram that got rid of the like button,

748
01:35:32,490 --> 01:35:40,410
right. Because there was sort of evidence that this was problematic for social comparison and stuff, I think, particularly for adolescent health.

749
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:48,750
And so I do think there are things that can be done that can affect health outcomes

750
01:35:50,100 --> 01:35:54,890
besides just telling people stay off social media or something like that.

751
01:35:54,900 --> 01:36:01,740
I mean, we've also seen this is a big issue with like with hate speech on social media platforms

752
01:36:01,740 --> 01:36:07,810
and the implications that that has for things like contributing to violence and,

753
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:08,840
and stuff like that.

754
01:36:08,850 --> 01:36:20,550
So there are, there are these ways in which we do have control over these types of influences and that can have implications for how.

755
01:36:22,020 --> 01:36:32,970
Okay. So let's take a break, come back at 1115, and then you'll get in your groups one last time and we'll talk about the Facebook paper.

756
01:36:50,820 --> 01:37:02,570
You look. Yeah.

757
01:37:04,580 --> 01:37:15,460
That looks like a school. Yeah, I guess I didn't.

758
01:37:22,840 --> 01:37:31,390
I can remember not. Yes, I know that.

759
01:37:31,470 --> 01:37:36,330
The situation. Yes or no?

760
01:37:36,840 --> 01:37:43,810
No. The dissertation defense will be when she finishes the dissertation, the prospective defensive ends.

761
01:37:44,120 --> 01:37:48,090
Oh, yeah, but it's. It's Lindsay Kobayashi student.

762
01:37:48,210 --> 01:37:52,920
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Because my. My proposal is.

763
01:37:53,450 --> 01:37:58,070
All about owners. Yeah. Yeah. You could ask her if she would share her.

764
01:37:58,190 --> 01:38:05,030
I mean, she doesn't have findings yet. Well, she has findings from the first chapter that she shared with her last name.

765
01:38:05,030 --> 01:38:08,220
You maybe y you heard. Oh, I think I know you know her. Yeah.

766
01:38:09,170 --> 01:38:12,470
So you could ask her if she'd be willing to share it with you.

767
01:38:13,070 --> 01:38:16,780
Great. Yeah. You know, I thought about you, obviously, for something a lot.

768
01:38:16,790 --> 01:38:20,000
Like. Like. Yeah. Just so. Thank you.

769
01:38:20,100 --> 01:38:25,870
You're welcome here.

770
01:38:31,460 --> 01:38:44,450
And we help because, of course, like all the others we have in the country.

771
01:38:47,480 --> 01:38:52,460
We have. Here.

772
01:38:53,480 --> 01:39:10,740
Right and right. So I thought that.

773
01:39:22,470 --> 01:39:25,580
Here's what happened.

774
01:39:29,340 --> 01:39:33,700
Do you know Christmas songs got hit for songs? Oh, yeah.

775
01:39:33,730 --> 01:39:37,050
Okay. Well, like a long time ago, right? Or again.

776
01:39:37,150 --> 01:39:42,010
Oh, again. Yes. Yes. Oh, well, you know.

777
01:39:42,280 --> 01:39:48,290
Yeah. You'll have it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

778
01:39:49,810 --> 01:39:54,380
I guess he wasn't, he, he didn't support the student union or something like.

779
01:39:56,970 --> 01:40:01,320
I don't remember exactly what he said, but he's just got to pass it. Then he should know.

780
01:40:01,460 --> 01:40:11,040
Okay. I don't know. Well, I mean, he's he's kind of like that's sort of his being a little bit so.

781
01:40:12,630 --> 01:40:22,290
But I don't think he's thinking about that, though. And the stuff like, you know, he really he promotes free expression and exchange of ideas.

782
01:40:22,300 --> 01:40:23,220
Right. Like, that's his thing.

783
01:40:23,670 --> 01:40:30,120
And I don't think that obesity paper, I don't think the stigmatizing language and the obesity paper was meant to be provocative.

784
01:40:30,720 --> 01:40:39,330
I think it was really just. Yeah. Um, and so, yeah, I kind of.

785
01:40:39,330 --> 01:40:45,390
I wondered if people would know him and think that he had done that on purpose.

786
01:40:46,480 --> 01:40:55,830
Um, yeah. I've never, I've never met him or like, seen him at a conference or anything, but I'm sure he's quite interesting.

787
01:40:56,090 --> 01:40:56,909
Yeah, I never have.

788
01:40:56,910 --> 01:41:14,990
I haven't, I haven't heard that term he recently had like and I got to know that was my first and then I was like, Oh, I know this guy, you know?

789
01:41:15,870 --> 01:41:23,250
And so, yeah, some of the bold claims in this paper may be like a temperamental thing.

790
01:41:23,280 --> 01:41:26,970
Right. And he's also an M.D. Yeah.

791
01:41:27,390 --> 01:41:30,950
Which I think is really interesting for my conversation.

792
01:41:31,390 --> 01:41:35,010
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

793
01:41:35,100 --> 01:41:45,660
It's not good. I, I think you do another paper looking at smoking in networks.

794
01:41:45,900 --> 01:42:06,660
I don't remember what show I read. You know, I think, I guess these ideas are evolutionary based in society and stuff like that.

795
01:42:07,650 --> 01:42:14,060
So that makes sense. Yeah, I think it's that the book that he wrote after the first time he was canceled.

796
01:42:14,070 --> 01:42:17,910
Yeah. Yeah. Cause that was over Halloween costumes.

797
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:21,000
Yeah, that was a long time ago now.

798
01:42:21,120 --> 01:42:27,180
Yeah, this is almost like academic. And then I heard my partner. All this material is a secret.

799
01:42:28,720 --> 01:42:31,870
I think it's rather unusual. I don't think this is like a typical thing.

800
01:42:33,490 --> 01:42:47,460
But the papers. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

801
01:42:52,480 --> 01:42:56,559
Okay, your. Your group tents are down here if you want to find.

802
01:42:56,560 --> 01:43:32,920
Oh, you're already in your. Never mind, Normie. Ignoring the fact that India was.

803
01:43:37,300 --> 01:43:40,620
We? You.

804
01:43:50,550 --> 01:44:01,300
And I think. And it's a testament to.

805
01:44:14,310 --> 01:44:26,650
I know that. What is your group?

806
01:44:33,930 --> 01:44:38,450
That's the way I feel a little bit.

807
01:44:38,620 --> 01:44:51,490
And that's because you are Bella and all Yana and your group.

808
01:44:53,800 --> 01:44:57,940
Sir Francis is Francis and your girl, Audra?

809
01:44:58,390 --> 01:45:03,490
Yeah. Okay. She's out today. The back?

810
01:45:04,090 --> 01:45:15,600
Yeah, probably. Yeah. I don't think I'd be happy with.

811
01:45:23,410 --> 01:45:27,610
I've is saying.

812
01:47:11,200 --> 01:47:47,420
Oh. I know.

813
01:51:59,900 --> 01:52:31,260
I can. Right now.

814
01:52:42,500 --> 01:53:10,910
At the end of the film. I really want to be.

815
01:54:02,040 --> 01:54:07,910
Yeah. But.

816
01:54:23,350 --> 01:55:22,750
Here. That's right.

817
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:37,390
The first time. Yeah.

818
01:56:00,690 --> 01:56:08,480
And then I thought, you know, I think it should have done.

819
01:56:30,290 --> 01:56:36,030
Yes. It's.

820
01:57:36,130 --> 01:57:44,750
Yeah. So they would.

821
01:58:23,360 --> 01:58:42,710
I think. Maybe. In income.

822
01:58:44,390 --> 01:58:51,030
Yeah. I know.

823
01:59:10,490 --> 01:59:24,340
Yeah. Yeah.

824
01:59:27,040 --> 01:59:33,440
I. Yeah.

825
01:59:35,220 --> 01:59:47,350
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's.

826
01:59:49,950 --> 02:00:22,140
I'm going to. And.

827
02:01:25,670 --> 02:01:36,500
Personal. Are you going to run over here for?

828
02:01:38,160 --> 02:01:46,350
Okay. Okay. The Exhibition President.

829
02:01:47,810 --> 02:02:19,590
The first. Especially for first.

830
02:02:24,600 --> 02:02:37,010
It does. How much of.

831
02:02:44,370 --> 02:02:54,660
It's pretty obvious that a lot of students will be in at the time, of course.

832
02:02:56,890 --> 02:03:11,570
There's no doubt about that.

833
02:03:14,810 --> 02:03:25,200
All right. If you be.

834
02:03:34,960 --> 02:03:48,900
I don't want to go into medical science.

835
02:03:49,920 --> 02:04:09,880
I don't have a question about. I know that you're going to have to make it.

836
02:04:11,970 --> 02:04:15,130
I think here is that experience for.

837
02:04:18,820 --> 02:04:27,000
For example. Does anybody need more time?

838
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:31,140
Any groups still working? Did you say yes any more?

839
02:04:31,700 --> 02:04:35,040
No. Okay. Sorry. Okay. All right, let's.

840
02:04:35,040 --> 02:04:39,839
Let's go ahead and get started. I think people are ready. All right.

841
02:04:39,840 --> 02:04:47,040
So let's start with the first one. According to your interest stock is how does previous research on real world

842
02:04:47,040 --> 02:04:51,060
face to face social networks differ from research on online relationships,

843
02:04:52,020 --> 02:04:56,700
both with respect to quantity of research and the nature of the findings?

844
02:04:57,510 --> 02:05:04,900
Anybody want to take that one? Or you want me to call somebody? Okay.

845
02:05:29,290 --> 02:05:41,770
Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.

846
02:05:41,780 --> 02:05:49,220
So in terms of quantity, there's way more research on the sort of real life social networks versus the online networks.

847
02:05:49,940 --> 02:05:55,909
And then in terms of the consistency of findings, they're really consistent for real world social relationships.

848
02:05:55,910 --> 02:06:00,020
They almost always have a positive impact on health, whether it's mental or physical health,

849
02:06:00,380 --> 02:06:05,180
whereas for the online networks, the evidence is kind of mixed.

850
02:06:05,180 --> 02:06:09,740
Some show protective effect, some show risk, and some are not.

851
02:06:09,800 --> 02:06:13,800
So it's still kind of unclear. All right.

852
02:06:14,240 --> 02:06:20,780
Describe the data and sample used for this study. How does the analytic sample differ from the full sample?

853
02:06:22,030 --> 02:06:28,540
You may want that one. Group six.

854
02:06:29,720 --> 02:06:33,670
Hey. Yeah, you look like you looked like either you really did want it or you really didn't.

855
02:06:38,690 --> 02:06:42,500
Okay. Social network.

856
02:06:50,400 --> 02:06:58,830
5200. Yeah.

857
02:06:58,920 --> 02:07:04,140
And how did they differ? How did the analytics sample differ from the full sample that you just described?

858
02:07:04,830 --> 02:07:09,910
Do you have that? Oh, you were trying to figure it out.

859
02:07:09,940 --> 02:07:16,420
Okay, I'll tell you. So data came from three waves of the Web based portion of the Gallup panel's survey.

860
02:07:16,570 --> 02:07:20,550
And so some people in this dataset have repeated measures that answered the survey more than once.

861
02:07:20,560 --> 02:07:27,820
Not everybody, but some people do. And the analytic sample includes people who are agreed to share data from their Facebook accounts.

862
02:07:28,120 --> 02:07:35,379
So what's kind of interesting about this study is that it's not just they're not just using self-reports of social media use and characteristics.

863
02:07:35,380 --> 02:07:40,270
They're they actually have access to their Facebook accounts. And so they can see how many friends they have and stuff.

864
02:07:41,200 --> 02:07:46,300
So the analytic sample differed from the full sample in that they were younger,

865
02:07:46,630 --> 02:07:50,470
more educated and more likely to be female, more likely to be unmarried.

866
02:07:50,770 --> 02:07:54,310
They had lower scores on mental health and life satisfaction measures,

867
02:07:54,610 --> 02:08:00,730
more self-reported friends and less time spent interacting in-person with real world friends.

868
02:08:01,120 --> 02:08:07,479
So they were. So you started with a nationally representative sample, but by the time you get this analytic sample,

869
02:08:07,480 --> 02:08:12,350
it's quite different from the full sample, which, you know, could introduce bias.

870
02:08:12,460 --> 02:08:21,210
Right. So just important to keep that in mind. What were the exposures, outcomes and covariance used in this study?

871
02:08:22,840 --> 02:08:30,880
Who wants to talk about the exposure? Group three to this.

872
02:08:47,550 --> 02:09:02,230
Uh huh. Have been.

873
02:09:05,300 --> 02:09:34,140
The First lady. Yeah.

874
02:09:34,620 --> 02:09:41,970
So they had it for exposures. They had measures of real world social networks and the Facebook measures.

875
02:09:42,330 --> 02:09:48,290
And so for the real world stuff, they had this information for up to eight friends that the person reported.

876
02:09:48,300 --> 02:09:56,730
So like they had the number of friends, the average closeness across friends, frequency of in-person contact over the past year.

877
02:09:56,730 --> 02:10:00,750
And then for the Facebook measures, I don't even know what some of these things mean,

878
02:10:00,750 --> 02:10:06,630
but lifetime life count for others content, I guess how much they liked other people's stuff.

879
02:10:08,170 --> 02:10:15,120
Uh, 30 day link click count number of status updates in the past 30 days and friend count, I understand that, but.

880
02:10:15,480 --> 02:10:21,059
All right. And then the outcomes self-rated health, upgraded mental health, life satisfaction, self-reported BMI.

881
02:10:21,060 --> 02:10:24,140
Controlling for income, education, age. Sex, marital status.

882
02:10:26,910 --> 02:10:33,510
Okay. What is the overall pattern of results and how did the multivariate cross sectional results

883
02:10:33,510 --> 02:10:39,240
differ from the multivariate prospective results and what might explain this difference?

884
02:10:41,290 --> 02:10:52,450
Group four. Do you guys want to take this one? Members.

885
02:11:02,520 --> 02:11:09,660
Yeah. Yeah. So the Facebook measures were associated with worse outcomes overall.

886
02:11:09,870 --> 02:11:13,440
The real life measures were associated with better outcomes overall.

887
02:11:14,190 --> 02:11:19,290
When you look at it prospectively. So now you're like you're looking at longitudinal stuff.

888
02:11:20,490 --> 02:11:27,570
The positive associations for real world relationships were less robust than the negative associations for the Facebook measures.

889
02:11:28,230 --> 02:11:34,860
So the effect sizes were larger. Our results were more likely to be significant, even after adjusting for a number of real world friends.

890
02:11:35,820 --> 02:11:40,530
There was no association of the Facebook measures with BMI and prospective analysis.

891
02:11:41,670 --> 02:11:48,840
And the longitudinal results are looking at social network variables in relation to change in well-being, which we talked about before.

892
02:11:49,020 --> 02:11:57,960
And it's it's always much harder to show the change because the biggest predictor of type two is time one level on that variable.

893
02:11:58,470 --> 02:12:04,290
So the prospective stuff is always going to show you weaker relationships than the cross-sectional stuff.

894
02:12:05,310 --> 02:12:09,420
All right. Why might Facebook use we to review this?

895
02:12:09,480 --> 02:12:12,660
Well, B group in the back.

896
02:12:12,660 --> 02:12:26,440
You guys might think this one. Yeah.

897
02:12:26,440 --> 02:12:36,729
So it could be like there's a social comparison happening that can lower self-esteem and also potentially the

898
02:12:36,730 --> 02:12:42,880
replacement of real life interactions like substituting the online interactions for real life interactions.

899
02:12:43,810 --> 02:12:52,430
I do want to talk about a question that a lot of you raised about just thinking about online interactions and the health effects.

900
02:12:52,450 --> 02:12:59,400
Some of the some of the questions were about how might different platforms impact health?

901
02:12:59,950 --> 02:13:04,120
Would Facebook interactions be different than, say, Twitter?

902
02:13:05,650 --> 02:13:09,700
Any thoughts on that? Anybody who brought that up?

903
02:13:09,710 --> 02:13:12,990
Yeah, no, I was thinking so.

904
02:13:13,120 --> 02:13:15,280
But LinkedIn is depressing.

905
02:13:15,550 --> 02:13:38,770
That's why I mean, I always feel bad from the interactions that are my friends experience and I've been with these different friends.

906
02:13:43,630 --> 02:13:48,640
I don't know that I'd like to have any surprises, he said.

907
02:13:54,820 --> 02:13:55,900
And the well.

908
02:14:01,960 --> 02:14:08,920
So there may be different characteristics of the different social media platforms that can influence health through different mechanisms.

909
02:14:08,930 --> 02:14:16,120
I'm almost thinking like when you said tick tock, that it's informational, that I mean,

910
02:14:16,120 --> 02:14:21,730
of course, depending on what the information is, it could be health promoting or health damaging.

911
02:14:21,820 --> 02:14:28,840
Right. But but that does seem fundamentally different from something that's more focused on appearance.

912
02:14:29,980 --> 02:14:33,190
Yeah. Any other thoughts on that?

913
02:14:33,190 --> 02:14:38,410
Yeah. On this, which is that a lot of people use online communities to get like identity related communities.

914
02:14:39,880 --> 02:14:47,070
Like, there's somebody in my department. Trends Tumblr people coming into their.

915
02:14:47,630 --> 02:14:54,220
There. There's lots of things that look like years ago. So definitely hands on.

916
02:14:54,330 --> 02:14:57,780
I just want you to think back when you're here.

917
02:14:58,770 --> 02:15:06,060
Yeah. Like your own identity interacts with with the platform and could have different impacts on people's health.

918
02:15:06,360 --> 02:15:11,480
I mean, I do think. I. Somebody brought this up, I think.

919
02:15:11,500 --> 02:15:14,500
Yeah. Bello brought this up to link for certain communities.

920
02:15:14,500 --> 02:15:17,979
This can be a place where you can find other people who are like you.

921
02:15:17,980 --> 02:15:22,000
And you may not be able to in the community where you live or something like that.

922
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:28,100
And so it can be a way to connect to others. Yeah. You. Yeah.

923
02:15:29,380 --> 02:15:34,910
I mean, like while. Health promoting.

924
02:15:41,020 --> 02:15:45,630
Yeah. Then it could be like racial strife in America.

925
02:15:45,670 --> 02:15:50,550
Could be very detrimental to. Yeah.

926
02:15:51,390 --> 02:15:57,810
Yeah. Several of you mentioned this idea of social media, particularly Twitter and the others that are kind of news space,

927
02:15:58,320 --> 02:16:08,490
that are being constantly bombarded with certain kinds of news stories, can actually be traumatic and challenging for mental health.

928
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:12,790
Are that where you're. It's in your hand? Yeah.

929
02:16:12,810 --> 02:16:19,080
Now I. Yeah, I guess.

930
02:16:27,160 --> 02:16:37,320
Did. Yeah.

931
02:16:38,220 --> 02:16:43,050
Yeah. I mean, it's really interesting work on vicarious grief and vicarious trauma.

932
02:16:43,890 --> 02:16:51,360
And we know that watching repeatedly, watching news stories about natural disasters or things like police shootings

933
02:16:51,360 --> 02:16:55,650
or whatever can have negative impacts on people's mental health in particular.

934
02:16:56,670 --> 02:16:59,190
So yeah, that, that can influence.

935
02:16:59,200 --> 02:17:09,779
But I think also, um, you know, when Facebook started, like, I mean Facebook and all that are kind of different, right?

936
02:17:09,780 --> 02:17:19,739
But they're kind of basically the same model where, whereas Twitter, tick tock, some of these others are like totally different types of media.

937
02:17:19,740 --> 02:17:26,910
And so I don't know that we'll ever have the same kind of consensus about the health effects of social media and social.

938
02:17:27,480 --> 02:17:31,830
Online social networks that we have about in-person social networks.

939
02:17:31,830 --> 02:17:42,300
Because I think there there's just a lot more heterogeneity in those online communities than there is in sort of real world, real life networks.

940
02:17:42,390 --> 02:17:47,910
So that will be interesting to see. Um. Other things that you're thinking that might.

941
02:17:48,630 --> 02:17:54,330
So we've got platform, we've got different identity characteristics that can modify the health impacts,

942
02:17:54,330 --> 02:18:00,300
other things that might shape how interactions on social media influence health.

943
02:18:03,180 --> 02:18:14,890
Yeah, I know. I.

944
02:18:17,170 --> 02:18:22,060
For time. I think.

945
02:18:24,060 --> 02:18:41,040
I. The when she. I. I've been to five studios and one time one of the first ones, and it was like it was pure apes and they just weren't funny.

946
02:18:42,840 --> 02:18:50,030
I'm wondering even for the person with you, get in the time.

947
02:18:52,030 --> 02:19:04,700
President. Just.

948
02:19:08,390 --> 02:19:31,750
Right. It is interesting how sometimes it's a lot easier when you're anonymous to post really hateful things,

949
02:19:31,750 --> 02:19:42,520
when to say something to somebody in person, and that these platforms really can be a way that that hate gets out there.

950
02:19:45,380 --> 02:19:52,000
Some of you talked about me. Oh, yeah? Because sometimes.

951
02:19:57,170 --> 02:20:04,020
Yeah. And I think you. That.

952
02:20:06,900 --> 02:20:11,080
Sure. So. I mean, I just.

953
02:20:15,410 --> 02:20:16,879
Yeah, that's a great point,

954
02:20:16,880 --> 02:20:24,290
that people can post things on social media and it kind of never goes away and I can follow you and impact your job prospects long term,

955
02:20:24,290 --> 02:20:30,469
which can then impact your health. Yeah. So that that is a thing that people have to have to think about.

956
02:20:30,470 --> 02:20:34,730
What are you posting on there and what does that look like ten years from now?

957
02:20:36,410 --> 02:20:44,760
Yeah, no. Yeah.

958
02:20:46,890 --> 02:20:50,030
Yeah. Different ethnic groups and different.

959
02:20:58,770 --> 02:21:05,270
Sometimes you miss. Sometimes you.

960
02:21:07,480 --> 02:21:10,630
Experience. I feel like it's people on both sides. So.

961
02:21:11,650 --> 02:21:15,290
Basically the time. But I.

962
02:21:17,690 --> 02:21:27,500
He's been. Yeah, that's a great point.

963
02:21:27,960 --> 02:21:34,850
I haven't really talked about that before, but how social media influences like kids and what, you know,

964
02:21:34,910 --> 02:21:41,540
young kids and adolescents and what they're doing and in terms of how that shifts their physical activity and social relationships.

965
02:21:41,990 --> 02:21:48,380
My son, the other day, I went downstairs in the basement and I looked at him and I was like, What is happening right now?

966
02:21:48,890 --> 02:21:52,280
He had his PlayStation going.

967
02:21:52,670 --> 02:21:56,990
He had his old X-Box doing something.

968
02:21:57,470 --> 02:22:01,549
And he was watching YouTube. And I was like, How are you doing?

969
02:22:01,550 --> 02:22:07,970
Three things at once. And he needed to complete some challenges for FIFA to move to the next level.

970
02:22:08,360 --> 02:22:16,970
And so he tied a piece of string around the joystick on his PlayStation so that it wouldn't just automatically play without him touching it.

971
02:22:17,300 --> 02:22:23,990
So he was losing, but he didn't care that he was losing. He just had to play what is happening.

972
02:22:27,210 --> 02:22:31,220
So I don't know if I can blame this. I blame it on YouTube. This is what I blame it on.

973
02:22:31,220 --> 02:22:38,870
But like but yeah, I think kids are interacting with all of these things in different ways and maybe older people.

974
02:22:38,870 --> 02:22:44,870
Yeah. I love that he would tell you that he is amazing.

975
02:22:45,710 --> 02:22:48,830
Totally. Like I.

976
02:22:53,400 --> 02:23:02,390
Yeah. Have. Or something like that know.

977
02:23:06,070 --> 02:23:13,960
I. I knew that.

978
02:23:17,670 --> 02:23:32,850
I don't think it's something I feel like I. I knew I'd get.

979
02:23:36,890 --> 02:23:39,970
Yeah. So I was. Yeah.

980
02:23:44,480 --> 02:23:52,049
Yeah. It becomes a natural way to have your attention divided and and that I mean,

981
02:23:52,050 --> 02:23:56,000
it absolutely I think has implications for our productivity, our mental health.

982
02:23:57,110 --> 02:24:06,169
And these things are designed to do that. I mean, we know that the developers of it have said they're just coming back to it like that.

983
02:24:06,170 --> 02:24:09,590
So. Interesting and challenging.

984
02:24:09,590 --> 02:24:15,499
And you start if you start trying to make one of your devices operate independently from you that you know,

985
02:24:15,500 --> 02:24:20,510
you've gone too far, I believe it's time to step back.

986
02:24:21,300 --> 02:24:34,000
Ali, did you ever it. Oh, yeah. Feel very personal.

987
02:24:36,480 --> 02:24:43,200
Yeah. And I think part of. Yeah.

988
02:24:43,360 --> 02:24:47,640
Yeah, that's a good point. I was thinking you mentioned how apps are designed to keep coming back to life.

989
02:24:47,660 --> 02:24:54,020
I recently saw something about how, like Tinder is designed to keep you coming back into the 17 year business.

990
02:24:55,160 --> 02:25:00,220
Well, it's it's interesting because they both have a stake in being a successful app and getting connections.

991
02:25:00,350 --> 02:25:03,860
Yeah. They also definitely don't want to lose Tinder users. Yeah.

992
02:25:04,220 --> 02:25:08,540
And so there's some article about how, like, it's designed to keep scrolling.

993
02:25:09,110 --> 02:25:16,350
It's a little bit hopeless, I guess. Yeah. That's right.

994
02:25:16,750 --> 02:25:20,030
But isn't that what Tick Tock is? That's the design of tick tock. Right.

995
02:25:20,050 --> 02:25:23,150
That is the first thing. Yeah.

996
02:25:27,170 --> 02:25:42,950
Yeah, I. Yeah, I've, I haven't done it, you know, but that's a, I've never done any other social media because I like I didn't understand it.

997
02:25:42,950 --> 02:25:47,330
I was like, why would I want to do that? And then it became and then it was like too late.

998
02:25:47,780 --> 02:25:52,880
And then people started hating it. And so I felt like I had been right all along.

999
02:25:55,420 --> 02:25:59,290
I feel like there was a question, who asked this question on me?

1000
02:25:59,360 --> 02:26:06,260
Or was it, um, somebody asked Nikki, could we do a study where anyone had zero social media?

1001
02:26:07,490 --> 02:26:16,190
And I wanted to say, Yes, you can zero social media, although now we have these department one Twitter and Instagram accounts,

1002
02:26:16,190 --> 02:26:23,270
and I feel like I should look at it, but I like I literally don't understand how they even open it.

1003
02:26:25,170 --> 02:26:33,530
And so I hope you guys are enjoying it. If you look at Twitter and Instagram like sidebar as it were, like, yeah.

1004
02:26:43,770 --> 02:26:51,170
Yeah. It's really important now.

1005
02:26:52,760 --> 02:26:59,440
I was like, oh, I'm willing to listen to.

1006
02:27:03,980 --> 02:27:10,290
Anyway. Yeah. Maybe I'll go away and other things, but yeah, sure.

1007
02:27:10,610 --> 02:27:13,790
No problem. Although I feel truly out of touch.

1008
02:27:14,300 --> 02:27:19,910
No, but my husband is obsessed with social media, so I like I get the stuff from him.

1009
02:27:19,910 --> 02:27:24,950
So I feel like I'm. I'm like adjacent to it. Yeah, I would say now.

1010
02:27:25,820 --> 02:27:33,360
Yeah. You get stuff like Google, for instance.

1011
02:27:33,660 --> 02:27:37,220
I don't know if you can Google. And that time.

1012
02:27:39,320 --> 02:27:43,070
You see all these other. Oh, right.

1013
02:27:43,580 --> 02:27:47,690
Yeah, I have a lot of that. Yeah. It's easy for.

1014
02:27:48,710 --> 02:27:54,920
But you know, like you have all these and you know, it seems like even the famous ten times.

1015
02:27:57,340 --> 02:28:08,500
Yeah. And then, you know, like someone without any social media, like, can go on Reddit for them having a lot of opinions.

1016
02:28:08,960 --> 02:28:14,260
And that's because she goes on Reddit and I'm like, What? You going on road?

1017
02:28:14,390 --> 02:28:22,600
Yeah, well, yeah, but I'm I guess my whole point is, social media is not the only place you can get where you can be exposed.

1018
02:28:22,700 --> 02:28:26,170
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1019
02:28:26,200 --> 02:28:35,829
No, that's absolutely true. Yeah. And those things are also targeted to you because if it's Google, all right, if you have a log in.

1020
02:28:35,830 --> 02:28:41,799
And so it's looking at your searches, which drives me crazy sometimes cause I try to search for something.

1021
02:28:41,800 --> 02:28:52,480
And if I accidentally clicked on something and then I didn't like it, it's showing me the thing I didn't like, you know, face to face.

1022
02:28:54,190 --> 02:28:57,280
It's very irritating. I like, but I didn't like that.

1023
02:28:57,280 --> 02:29:00,440
So the algorithm needs to work better than I do, but sure.

1024
02:29:00,460 --> 02:29:15,460
Yeah. Yeah.

1025
02:29:15,470 --> 02:29:22,350
So it's like. You know, it's not just. Yeah.

1026
02:29:22,350 --> 02:29:28,370
And it has been you're right. It's become kind of a central component of culture and.

1027
02:29:28,710 --> 02:29:30,120
Yeah, I don't understand me.

1028
02:29:30,120 --> 02:29:38,040
And now I'm like, I should have done like, I shouldn't have been resistant because now means are a thing and I don't get it and I feel left out.

1029
02:29:38,040 --> 02:29:41,340
But whatever, you know, what's done is done.

1030
02:29:41,520 --> 02:29:46,049
But yeah, it has become like really an essential part of culture.

1031
02:29:46,050 --> 02:29:49,920
And I remember when my son wanted to get. What's the one where it disappears?

1032
02:29:49,920 --> 02:29:55,229
Is that Snapchat? And we were like, you know, you know, this is terrible.

1033
02:29:55,230 --> 02:29:58,850
And then I just remember. But it's like it's the way they talk to each other.

1034
02:29:59,100 --> 02:30:02,280
They don't text. They Snapchat first. Now, never.

1035
02:30:04,730 --> 02:30:08,660
Yeah. Anyway, let's see.

1036
02:30:08,660 --> 02:30:13,810
I went to see if there was any other things. So we talked about age difference. Well, we talked a little about huge differences.

1037
02:30:13,820 --> 02:30:21,080
So, like, how might social media use differentially impact older adults versus kids?

1038
02:30:21,080 --> 02:30:24,260
And there can be really different implications of that,

1039
02:30:25,010 --> 02:30:29,950
particularly if the use of social media helps older adults maintain social connections and

1040
02:30:29,960 --> 02:30:34,940
they have limited ability to have in-person connections so it can be health promoting.

1041
02:30:35,270 --> 02:30:37,879
Um, let's see, certain communities.

1042
02:30:37,880 --> 02:30:44,570
Oh, several people also talked about the intention, like your intention of using social media and how that might influence the effects of it.

1043
02:30:44,840 --> 02:30:48,499
So I think the thing I want you to take away from this is that I think it would

1044
02:30:48,500 --> 02:30:54,530
be really difficult to make a blanket statement about how social networks

1045
02:30:54,530 --> 02:31:04,340
and social media impacts how because there's so many things to think about that could modify the impact of exposure to that on health outcomes.

1046
02:31:04,700 --> 02:31:10,609
Um, but probably an area that many people are going to continue to be interested in in the future because it

1047
02:31:10,610 --> 02:31:18,230
is so widespread and because it is starting to demonstrate some links with mental health in particular.

1048
02:31:20,680 --> 02:31:26,140
All right, so that's it. Remember, next week we start presentations.

1049
02:31:26,260 --> 02:31:34,300
If you haven't signed up for a time, please make sure you do and will be next week and have a good weekend.
