00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:17,090
As we've discussed, public health is a complex field with so many different elements that make up its structure and function.

2
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:27,270
The core values we talked about of disease prevention, health promotion, social justice, evidence based practice and public accountability.

3
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:32,640
They all provide so many opportunities for success in public health,

4
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:41,910
the public health infrastructure and the orientation around those three core functions assessment, policy, development and assurance.

5
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:47,729
They all provide us with a way to think about how public health can deliver on those

6
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:52,920
really important ten essential services that help us achieve public health mission.

7
00:00:53,810 --> 00:01:03,110
At the same time, though, public health faces challenges, and these challenges can make it very difficult to enact or implement policy.

8
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:13,930
Distrust in government that stems from moral or religious opposition, the shift from government driven programs to private sector responsibility,

9
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:20,319
and the public health community's ability or sometimes inability to communicate about

10
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,930
public health all make it challenging to move public health initiatives forward.

11
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,800
But as you learned in the brief documentary history of public health,

12
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:35,950
there's been an incredible evolution in the way society approaches public health.

13
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,100
And as you enter the field as a public health professional,

14
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:44,950
I want you to think about the steps you can take to make your mark on public health and then

15
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:50,980
work toward some of the many opportunities we have for public health successes in the future.
