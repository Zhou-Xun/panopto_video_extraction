1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,390
To get rid of them. Otherwise, they're going on the sixth floor of the kitchen.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:07,690
Or you just leave it out. Okay.

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:10,960
How was everybody's Labor Day? Good.

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:16,330
Good. Sorry. Uploaded the PowerPoint kind of late.

5
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:20,580
But it's a funeral. Oh, okay.

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,770
I was telling about the same about the dog sitting, but this morning.

7
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:34,800
This week. It's our loft investor. It was dark when I left, and I kind of, like, loved, tapped my neighbors.

8
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:41,459
The bumper front bumper with my back bumper when I left this morning because it's trash day.

9
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,910
So my cans were on the other side and I didn't like.

10
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:54,210
So anyway, I like ran over at 645 in the morning because that's when I was leaving and I rang on the doorbell, but no one answered.

11
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:57,600
And so I was like, Shoot, but I have a third class.

12
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,270
So I was like, I need to leave, but I don't have like a pen, but I don't want them to think I hit and run.

13
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:08,260
So then I like park. I drive to work. I curbed it again.

14
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:13,210
Okay, that's like, distracted. And then I took my other neighbor. I was like, what is this neighbor's cell phone?

15
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:19,139
I try to call him the numbers breaking up. I go on his Facebook.

16
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,690
We're not Facebook friends. I just know his name.

17
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:29,190
I find his wife and she thankfully has a business where her Facebook profiles public and also she has her cell phone to work.

18
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:32,230
And then I texted her, I was like, oh, my God.

19
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:37,700
You like I? This is Roger from across the street, like. And there she has a SUV.

20
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,350
So it's just like when I looked at it this morning, it's like a plastic bumper, and I just looks.

21
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,800
Look like a white smudge. Yeah, she's buffing out.

22
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:49,819
I mean, they were really chill about it, but I didn't want them to think I was, like, trying to hit and run.

23
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:53,180
So how do you talk to them afterward?

24
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:59,100
But it's thrown off my my day a little. It's okay.

25
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:03,360
I just do that for money. I know.

26
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:12,900
And I you know, I've driven for I've had my license for 16 years and I've never had accidents until I moved to Michigan.

27
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:15,960
Something about. Yeah. Yeah.

28
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:23,850
I like lived in I drove in Chicago for a while and I think Michigan drivers are worse but not I'm the bad Michigan that's

29
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:29,549
my roommate's car like I think I don't know what happened but she parked like really close to out of our driveway.

30
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,740
I was backing out. I'm not good at backing out.

31
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:38,160
And I like really scratched the back of her car and like, my mirror came out, but she was like, whatever.

32
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:41,740
Yeah, they're really chill. Midwestern hospitality.

33
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,970
No, no, I. I think, like, if you park your car on the street, like you assume.

34
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:48,270
I don't know. I guess I assume something's going to happen through it at some point.

35
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:55,410
I mean, maybe that's why we all pay for no fault insurance. So everyone's, like, super chill about you hitting a car.

36
00:02:55,410 --> 00:03:00,530
I don't know, but ho boy. Okay.

37
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:04,770
So we will continue on today,

38
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:13,170
will we're talk a little bit more about the workplace environments then the community environment and then and then do like a brief,

39
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:18,480
very brief start to the survey methodology just as a heads up.

40
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:24,600
Your first quiz is going to be due after the end of this week on Sunday on that.

41
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,680
Is that mainly lectures, readings or just a little bit of all?

42
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,390
Mainly lectures.

43
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:41,910
And as I mentioned, I think for this class because I it's like more short answer type format, you have up to 90 minutes to take the quiz,

44
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:54,180
but one shot only and generally they're like worth anywhere between like 9 to 15 points and are generally like 4 to 6 questions.

45
00:03:54,210 --> 00:04:00,570
Cool. Yeah, so not too bad. But like, don't wait until Sunday at 10 p.m. probably.

46
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:09,040
Okay. So last week we were talking about the social determinants of health.

47
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:15,580
And then this infographic here is just a little bit different way of thinking about it.

48
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:25,120
From Darwin and Whitehead all the way back in 1991, where at the core of it is your age, sex and constitutional factors.

49
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,889
Some things you can change, but some things you necessarily can't necessarily change.

50
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:36,280
Like you can't change how old you are. Right. But then we move on to individual lifestyle factors.

51
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:44,620
Your social and community network. But according to them, at the crux or the center of it all is your living and working conditions.

52
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:50,500
So that can be influenced by the work environment or just the regular environment, unemployment.

53
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:57,610
And then that thereby affects your general socioeconomic, cultural and environmental conditions.

54
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:03,459
So we'll take a detailed look at this specific study.

55
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:07,120
This isn't in your reading, so this is why I'll go over in more detail.

56
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:15,879
So this is a study by Vandenburg and colleagues from 2018 from again Scandinavia

57
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,780
where they've been very much on the cutting front of psychosocial factors.

58
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:29,310
And they look specifically at, you know, we all know that as populations age you deteriorate physically.

59
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:36,690
You know, like once you past 25, like for me it was just like downhill.

60
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:42,930
I had this week, I think I told you all, like, a strange way back from all the COVID coughing.

61
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:50,530
Yeah. So I have like a I was at Costco on Friday and they had salon paths with 4% light came.

62
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:55,090
So that is kind of that's what's keeping you like a break right now.

63
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:58,120
But hopefully that will take care of itself soon.

64
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:07,850
But obviously, you know, once you deteriorate physically, that also leads to changes in your physical and mental capacities, capacities as a worker.

65
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:12,879
Like I would say, I've definitely not been as mobile as I could be in the last two weeks.

66
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,080
So that means I haven't been like leisure walking as much as I should have.

67
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:23,440
I was telling Sam I was dog sitting over the weekend, so of course I still had to like walk the dog and stuff,

68
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:29,890
but we couldn't go to like Cherry Hill Nature Preserve or anything longer that I would have liked to.

69
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:35,510
But, you know, people get depressed once they lose their mobility.

70
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:40,180
Like mental health decline is is quite severe.

71
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:48,850
So for this study in particular, we'll talk more about measures next week.

72
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:55,960
So this was a cross-sectional study and generally with cross-sectional studies or or surveys, you know,

73
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:04,149
people don't like to do these types of design models just because they tend to be you know, it's difficult.

74
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:11,530
You can't you can't infer causation. Right. But why what might be the reason why we do a cross-sectional study?

75
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:19,710
Instead of like a longitudinal study. It's not that time consuming.

76
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,380
Not that time consuming. Yeah.

77
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:34,600
Cross sectional serve and you kind of gain all information at the end right through like surveys and whatnot that like the past history.

78
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:38,580
It doesn't necessarily have to be at the end. Okay.

79
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:43,120
So for you, yes, one point in time.

80
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:51,850
So like, you know, if we think of this as like I did this, okay, let's see how many of these I have to.

81
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:55,870
I did throwing out the dead ones. Okay.

82
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:01,630
So let's just say, like, this is our. Our pie here.

83
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:14,020
So really what we're trying to do. With a with a cross section, just literally a cross section,

84
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:22,510
as we're only getting a snippet of something in one moment in time, we're not necessarily getting a holistic view of the pie.

85
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,260
But like Joyce said, it is less time consuming.

86
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:40,690
Generally, it is also. Generally it is also cheaper, a lot cheaper than a longitudinal study or a randomized controlled trial, for example.

87
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:46,990
And a lot of times, especially for the things that we're interested in, in the context of this class,

88
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:52,840
like psychosocial factors, these are mostly like self-reported measures.

89
00:08:53,170 --> 00:09:03,610
You can do some observational studies to do more like a mixed methods, where you add some qualitative data to the quantitative data that you collect.

90
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:10,870
But it's not necessarily something we can like hook up somebody to like a EEG or a blood pressure monitor,

91
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:15,640
for example, and be able to determine what those psychosocial factors are.

92
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:23,380
So what they're doing in this particular study to make it more robust is in addition to the psychosocial factors,

93
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:31,660
they're adding some physical measures in it and then some some some historical data, so to speak.

94
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,250
So they look at workability, which they're using the workability index.

95
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:44,559
And this is mostly talking about like physical physiological functionality, functional health status for psychosocial factors.

96
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:49,180
They're looking at teamwork, stress handling and self-development.

97
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,700
They ask about stressful life events.

98
00:09:51,700 --> 00:10:01,090
They ask about lifestyle factors like diet, smoking, exercise, and then they also perform the physical exam on all the participants as well.

99
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:10,180
So this first table here, so these to keep this in mind, these are what we considered white collar workers.

100
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:19,419
So these are people who have manually laborious jobs and they were able to get a pretty big sample size of over 1100 people,

101
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:23,980
which I think is really decent for voluntary medical examination.

102
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:32,019
So if we look at the the characteristics here, the AB, the median age is 35.

103
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:36,460
So it's not particularly old folks. It's like I would consider.

104
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,809
What do you consider people? 35. Just adults. Not young adults.

105
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:53,090
Certainly not just adults. Yeah. And then, you know what the frequency for it looks like males mostly made the sample in regard to workability,

106
00:10:54,170 --> 00:11:00,079
and most of them reported either having good or excellent workability in terms of

107
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:07,280
their mental health and physical health on these scales of 8 to 74 for mental health,

108
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:14,839
with 74 being the highest physical health of 4 to 73, with 73 being the highest people scored,

109
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:19,790
I would say, you know, pretty above average on self-reported mental and physical health.

110
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:28,250
And then in terms of these psychosocial factors on the scale, the 1 to 100 seems like they have pretty good teamwork across the board.

111
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:31,280
And again, these commercial workers don't all work in the same place,

112
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:40,100
but they're in the same kind of sector, you know, stress handling less good, but still above average.

113
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:49,130
And then self-development, this is in terms of like fulfillment and we're talking about upward mobility at their workplace.

114
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:58,880
We're at a 78. And then in terms of the number of stressful life events people have had from 0 to 100, most people would report 5.5.

115
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:03,740
So like, you know, what would you consider a stressful life event?

116
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:13,670
It's like a death in the family or death in the family. I was like losing a job.

117
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,090
Why not apply to those groups since they're workers? Losing all.

118
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:29,050
You could previously lose a job, right, and end up in this job, you know, a death of a family member giving birth to pregnancy.

119
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:34,420
Right. Having to do a big move is considered a stressful life event.

120
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,370
Changing careers, for example.

121
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:43,870
So most people with this median age have averaged about 5.5.

122
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:47,170
That makes sense. I would think that was a little low, but that makes sense.

123
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:51,590
We've been through quite a bit of stress in the next three years, so that makes sense.

124
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:55,659
This was pre-pandemic. I have four in last two years.

125
00:12:55,660 --> 00:13:05,680
But yeah, yeah, they pre-pandemic. And then in regards to lifestyle, so lack of moderate physical activity was a good chunk of them.

126
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:09,940
Lack of vigorous physical activity was also a good chunk of them.

127
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:16,450
Current smoker is about 13% and then problematic alcohol use was only 5%.

128
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:28,629
And then in terms of those who were overweight or obese, only 35% were considered overweight and then 5% were considered obese.

129
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:33,070
And then they did volume of oxygen and then biceps strength.

130
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:47,740
I personally have issues with the the use of BMI, but a lot of people in epidemiological studies still use them as a like a proxy for obesity.

131
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:54,730
Do you talk about this in your your other classes? About, like, off and on, just like.

132
00:13:54,910 --> 00:14:01,540
Oh, yeah. Like you're saying, BMI isn't a good standard, but it's okay as a proxy to what we have.

133
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:08,670
Yeah, it's really, you know, now that I would say the dynamics are changing and people are trying to move away.

134
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:12,729
So if you're designing your own, well, you will be designing your own survey.

135
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:17,889
But in the future, when you design your own research, if you're asking about, you know,

136
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:25,090
weight and height, think about the way you want to analyze that potentially in a different way than BMI,

137
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:30,900
just because a lot of people now in public in that public health space are trying to move away from that,

138
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:36,580
not just because of like, yeah, there's the body, inclusivity, movement and all that stuff,

139
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:46,479
but BMI was essentially created by mathematicians and a lot of study shows it has no actual correlation with people's physical health.

140
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:52,540
So I mean, like what my weight looks like on somebody else with a different height and weight is totally

141
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:56,679
different and then it doesn't take into account muscle mass and all this kind of stuff.

142
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:02,520
So complicated. So if we look here, so they did.

143
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:11,320
So this is the characteristics. Okay, so they did a backwards regression analysis essentially to look at the effects of these psychosocial factors.

144
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:20,649
So again, we were talking about they separated into the areas of mental health and then physical health looking at work,

145
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:27,880
stressful life events, lifestyle, physical condition and mental health and physical health among workers.

146
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:32,860
So I'll give you like a little bit to look at this data.

147
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:02,950
Just glancing at it. Is there anything that stands out to you?

148
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:11,250
What is the fate of variables that like an odds ratio or two?

149
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:16,390
Does anyone want to split? Do you want to take a stab at it?

150
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:26,480
Uh, I guess. It's the regret.

151
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,670
It's the weight of the regression. I figured it out after I thought.

152
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:38,440
Okay. Oh, no, about that. Yeah. Yeah. So C is the standard error and then the the beta is the weight of the regression.

153
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:43,480
So if you're looking at like a negative number, right,

154
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:50,440
if you're looking at what the dependent variable is and then all of these are the dependent

155
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,839
variable and all of these are like the independent variables that they're looking at,

156
00:16:53,840 --> 00:17:01,870
but they're comparing it to categories. The weight between the two would either be positive or negative, and then the higher the number,

157
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:07,360
the greater the weight kind of in the same way that you would look at a correlation.

158
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:15,760
But the regression is more powerful than the correlation just because they control for the individual characteristics.

159
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:20,620
Yeah. So anything here still standing out?

160
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:39,030
Does it just look like a bunch of numbers over?

161
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:42,620
Something I looked at was like, I don't know what I'm looking at. Okay, I'm looking at it again.

162
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:51,140
So, so when you when you go through your upcoming perusal, articles like these are the kinds of things where you can comment and be like,

163
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:54,260
I don't know what I'm looking at and that's totally fine.

164
00:17:54,950 --> 00:18:03,169
But part of it is to try to get us to like understand what this means in the context of you developing your own survey,

165
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:04,400
and we'll kind of build on that.

166
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:13,940
So if you notice here, if we're looking even between the univariate and then the multivariate models specifically focusing on mental health,

167
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:17,150
if you look at these psychosocial factors at work,

168
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:30,410
low versus high teamwork, intermediate versus intermediate, high versus teamwork versus low versus high stress, low versus high self development.

169
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:40,490
When you're on the lower end of things, its impact on mental health if you're at and the low end of type of psychosocial

170
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:45,830
factors has a significant li proportionate effect on the mental health,

171
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:50,990
I would say less so on the physical health just because like you see, the numbers are smaller here.

172
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:55,460
And then, you know, a lot of these numbers like the physical examination.

173
00:18:55,790 --> 00:19:00,710
Interesting, none of none of these variables are significant in it.

174
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:08,330
Right. And then, you know, physical activity and smoking status seems to have an impact on mental health,

175
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:13,520
but only physical activity on physical health, which makes sense.

176
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,090
But interestingly, smoking non and physical health.

177
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:24,320
And then if you look at. Age and and sex, for example.

178
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:34,610
The the sex seems to be significant in the univariate model as does age for mental health for both.

179
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:40,420
Does that make a little more sense? Okay.

180
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:46,790
Let's look at another one. So this is a different this is a next backwards regression.

181
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:53,770
So this is the effects of psychosocial factors at work, in stressful life events, physical condition and workability.

182
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:58,620
So this one here was on mental health and physical health.

183
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:05,890
This one here is on work ability. So looking through this again, is there anything that.

184
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:18,600
You notice? Blocking the screen.

185
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:26,550
Because somewhere where the psychosocial factors are having a bigger impact than like other groups.

186
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:32,190
Yes, yes. Yes. And then this one here, this one here is on work.

187
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:41,640
So this one is a backwards regression, looking at age groups on the psychosocial factors of work.

188
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:47,280
And you see, like with the age groups, there's still an effect, but less of an effect.

189
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:58,710
So in this study here, the biggest takeaway is that work ability of white collar workers was strongly associated with the psychosocial factors,

190
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:06,660
more so than stressful life events, more so than physical activity, and more so than the BMI.

191
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:18,360
And determinants of mental health are more similar in terms of like what they self-reported their work ability to be rather than physical health,

192
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:23,460
which obviously was more impacted by lifestyle factors.

193
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:31,950
So I mean, in the grand scheme of things like, you know, you might say, oh the or like that seems like common sense.

194
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:38,370
But I mean the benefit of this is conducting this study was such a large sample size

195
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:43,890
in this particular cohort in order to validate like what hypotheses you may have.

196
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:49,230
So just say, for example, you might you might be really interested.

197
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:55,590
You're like, oh, I really want to do like my survey on burden.

198
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:59,969
How on on female faculty members specifically.

199
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:10,290
So that's what you're going to focus on. So you're going to have a hypothesis, obviously, of what you think you're going to see.

200
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:14,069
So that based on that, you might decide what your skills are,

201
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:19,709
what kind of questions that you want to incorporate in there and that will, you know, affect that.

202
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:20,190
But, you know,

203
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:28,110
you could do that observationally or you can even do it through qualitative research where you do like focus groups or key informant interviews,

204
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:33,839
where you go around and you're like, okay, can I talk to you for half an hour, Dr. So-and-so?

205
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:42,930
And then you like code the data after like transcribing everything and you thematic and content analysis and that can like take forever.

206
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:47,400
So this is a little bit quicker way of where we can ascertain things.

207
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:57,300
And again, the study is they found the influence of an unhealthy lifestyle was more important for for older workers than younger ones.

208
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:01,530
So with the age group one, the older you get in terms of your age group,

209
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:06,840
the greater the influence of the unhealthy lifestyle on so-called psychosocial factors.

210
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:12,450
So their biggest takeaway for this was like working conditions are are have more

211
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:17,910
of an influence than lifestyle factors on overall physical and mental health.

212
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:23,640
I. Yes, I didn't say that. That makes sense.

213
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:31,980
I mean, I'll share like a. Yeah, sure.

214
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:40,870
So so I mostly where I have almost exclusively worked out like what I consider like white collar jobs most of my life.

215
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:52,239
So before this, I was at another university where I would say certain things, like certain psychosocial factors were really good, right?

216
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:57,010
So I had a lot of autonomy. You know, I had a supervisor.

217
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:03,910
Supervisor was really chill. Not too many people checked on me or micromanaged me.

218
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:08,349
Role clarity wasn't the greatest.

219
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:16,960
I was classified as an academic specialist, which is mostly supposed to be like public health practice and and training and things of that sort.

220
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:23,530
But I was still doing research and then I was adjunct teaching as well and doing like a couple of other things.

221
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:34,720
But there were places like psychological, like workplace bullying and things like that and you know, like academia is very hierarchical and etc., etc.

222
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:45,219
So despite, you know, some job resources being pretty high, I was not being paid that much.

223
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:55,030
Then in hindsight, like with a like post-grad masters degree, I started out at $45,000, but I was just trying to get my foot in the door, you know?

224
00:24:56,340 --> 00:25:04,750
Um, so during that time I would say my, my mental health wasn't the best.

225
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:08,349
My physical health was better than it is now.

226
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:13,899
But that was only because there's that school of Public Health literally had the gym inside of it.

227
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:18,130
So I would just walk from my office down the hallway to the gym.

228
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:25,570
The pandemic has had irreparable damage on my fitness, but I mean, you know,

229
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:31,720
that's one example of where I would say the working conditions outweighed the lifestyle factors.

230
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:37,060
Does anybody have, you know, examples personally they would like to share?

231
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:46,820
No. Okay. That's okay.

232
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:49,940
I would I would say working here now.

233
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:57,390
Yeah. The working conditions, like, definitely outweigh the lifestyle factors for sure.

234
00:25:57,410 --> 00:26:04,370
Like, like I always joke, you know, like we so easy to so easy to gain, so hard to lose.

235
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:15,380
But like, I've been, you know, doing my fitness pao calorie tracking I do hellofresh now the the meal subscription like delivery thing.

236
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:22,580
I got this Apple watch. I walk at least like 3 to 4 miles every day.

237
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:33,620
But because of the amount of stress like cortisol I have in my body, the sedentary lifestyle, I have a lot of these social,

238
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:45,120
psychosocial factors where I feel like team work isn't really optimal, supervisor support is not really optimal.

239
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:50,450
A lot of these negative psychosocial factors are definitely contributing,

240
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:54,649
like my working conditions are definitely contributing more to the state of my

241
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:58,790
physical and mental health than the choices that I'm making outside of work.

242
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:04,380
And I spend 10 to 12 hours here. Yeah.

243
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:10,190
Yeah. So that's just, you know, a personal example from me on this one.

244
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:20,329
Here is another study by Kowalczyk and colleagues from 2017 called the reciprocal effect of psychosocial aspects on nurses working conditions.

245
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:25,610
So this looks at almost 800 in-patient nurses from a facility in Poland.

246
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:30,920
So moving from white collar workers to a little bit more of a physically laborious job,

247
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:35,540
they were still considered nurses, white collar, but it's not sedentary.

248
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:41,000
So they were doing a correlation analysis, looking at job demand, social support,

249
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:49,790
wellbeing and the expectations of things changing at their workplace, essentially, which could be considered a psychosocial factor.

250
00:27:50,120 --> 00:28:02,300
So they found all in all that nurses self-reported wellbeing really depended on the social support provided by their superiors and colleagues.

251
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:08,029
What do you think about does that make sense to you? Yeah.

252
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:14,330
What do you think, Sam? Yeah, I mean, thinking of like the last event we had and I don't know if it's I'm picturing them in,

253
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:17,639
like, economics or accounting for some reason for that one.

254
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:21,770
And so nurses, I mean, that's a very mentally tasking job.

255
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:27,739
So having a supervisor or colleagues to kind of talk through what you've experienced,

256
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:32,600
I feel like that's a big impact on your self wellbeing and mental wellbeing and stuff.

257
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:38,929
Yeah, yeah. And unfortunately this is not one of the jobs where you can work pretty autonomously.

258
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:47,419
It's team based whether or not you really like it or not, even though a lot of nurses might be designated certain patients,

259
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:51,200
like you have to go through staffing together, you have to share resources.

260
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:57,650
Oftentimes your patients are in the same room as other colleagues patients.

261
00:28:57,950 --> 00:29:07,069
So it's a highly social environment, a sense of well, a sense of being able to have an effect on the work performed.

262
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:15,440
In other words, autonomy, minimal conflicts and also an absence of overload also correlated with wellbeing in a positive way.

263
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:20,540
And then poor social support, a lack of control, conflicts.

264
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:28,640
And then work overload or work overload essentially spurred these nurses expectations of change.

265
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:36,170
So they didn't necessarily follow up in the study to determine if change in the workplace actually occurred.

266
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:41,180
But, you know, with those who had the perceptions of poor social support,

267
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:45,829
lack of control and conflict overload, obviously that they were expecting change.

268
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:48,200
But, you know, TBD,

269
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:56,600
how many of you have been at a workplace or a situation where it was like pretty bad and you expected change but things didn't change?

270
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:01,910
Yeah. Did you quit? Um, I knew I was quitting.

271
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:06,560
Um, and then I was hoping to hear back from college. I stayed on because we all.

272
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:13,190
I did like my personal experiences, like this is why I'm leaving and you should fix it for incoming people.

273
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:17,210
And I've heard that nothing happened, so I was like, bad luck.

274
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:21,560
Sorry. Yeah, yeah.

275
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:34,009
Cultural change takes a long time, and some places have a mentality where it's easier to replace workers than change the actual workplace itself.

276
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:40,970
So a lot of things just stay the same unless there's a lot of movement around it or a huge like.

277
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:44,730
Very public backlash, for example.

278
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,910
Any questions or comments about that study?

279
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:58,830
Okay. So moving on to community, environment and the psychosocial factors.

280
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:10,440
So if you recall last week from Gie and Pain Sturgis, we looked at the stress exposure disease framework in relation to social determinants of health.

281
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:17,610
And specifically in this article they focused on race and residential location,

282
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:24,690
environmental hazards and pollutants and structural factors that feed into the stress exposure disease framework.

283
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:33,630
But honing in on community stressors, in particular the physical and psychosocial, are also taken into account into this framework.

284
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:43,770
So they talk about crowding, social disorganization, racial discrimination, fear and economic deprivation can lead to stress.

285
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:52,170
How multiple studies have shown perceptions of crime and disorder with one's community can lead to exactly the depression,

286
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:55,590
post-traumatic stress disorder and substance abuse.

287
00:31:56,100 --> 00:32:03,509
In a number of studies, they found that neighborhood crime is actually the most robust environmental predictor of

288
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:09,600
infant birth weight after controlling for individual and neighborhood characteristics.

289
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:21,750
Again, you will see some quiet today. So I'll give you I'll give you personal anecdotes and then maybe we can build on these.

290
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:29,400
So as I mentioned, I grew up in Sacramento, California, in a pretty like low, scarce neighborhood.

291
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:38,640
So like the high school that I went to was double fenced in and we had security guard because I went to you know, when you go to school in California,

292
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:47,460
it's like how you see in the movies where it's like when you go change classes, you go like outside with the sky.

293
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:55,620
Whereas I've never been to a public school here where it's all indoor, but I've seen it on like TV shows, but so we had a lot of security guards.

294
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:59,790
Most of them were there to just like break up fights between people and stuff like that.

295
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:06,630
But I lived about from the age of like, I don't know, as early as I can remember, it's like 14.

296
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:15,750
I lived in the same neighborhood and it was never like the kind of neighborhood where my mom allowed me to go outside to play like.

297
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:27,120
Like it was like the hood. So, like, you know, like renters next door have like, pit bulls and like, maybe while we're dealing drugs, I don't know.

298
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,209
But I was, like, never allowed to go outside and ride my bike.

299
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:33,720
If I was, I have to call my mom and my dad to supervise me.

300
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:38,459
And I was only allowed to do like one lap around the block.

301
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:41,880
I wasn't able to, like, leave unattended.

302
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:45,930
Like I hear some people from the Midwest talking about where they would just have like

303
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:52,170
sleepovers or like their parents would just like leave them unattended for hours.

304
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:56,760
So we get to put it like how far you can see that's where you can go.

305
00:33:56,910 --> 00:34:00,750
And your parents were never concerned about you getting kidnaped. I don't know.

306
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:04,500
Why not. Because we were in a low economic situation, too.

307
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,720
Is that just like what's going to happen? It's going to happen to you?

308
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:10,860
Was it was it like a racially diverse neighborhood?

309
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:15,600
Now it's typically more white with lower and middle.

310
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:22,350
But we lived next to like the rich neighborhoods. We always go to their place, so we were, quote unquote, safe.

311
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:30,480
Sure. But who knows? Sure. I mean, as with my mom having two girls, too, I think she was constantly worried about us being sex trafficked.

312
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:35,070
So, you know, I mean, do any of you have similar different experiences to that?

313
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:41,550
I'm from like the middle of nowhere. So, like, we couldn't walk anywhere, mostly just, like, stayed and played in the yard.

314
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:44,700
Okay. Um, I also have a lot of civilians.

315
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:52,200
I have two older siblings. So basically when they were old enough to, like, babysit like 11 or 12, they would just watch us.

316
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:57,480
But with that, we would have like our older cousins would come watch us over the summer.

317
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:02,800
Yeah. So completely different because we just simply could not go places.

318
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:06,240
Yeah. What was that like in China? Different.

319
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:09,780
I was born in a very small town, so I.

320
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:14,280
I spend most of my time actually in.

321
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:20,510
The real world. Uh huh. I always.

322
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:27,550
I was. I had a lot of freedom. You can ride a bike everywhere, something different.

323
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:34,980
I mean, I feel like it definitely had an impact on me, but I don't think at the time I was growing up,

324
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:38,730
I realized that it wasn't until all the stuff you learn later,

325
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:44,610
especially like in public health, where you're like social determinants of health, like psycho psychosocial factors at work.

326
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:49,649
Because now I have friends who I talk to come from like very different lifestyles.

327
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:58,050
So one of my best friends kind of moved all over the country because her dad is a big like pharma rep and he's now retired.

328
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:05,249
But her parents live in Huntington Beach, which is like a very wealthy part of Southern California, also very conservative.

329
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:09,659
So they had like during COVID, a lot of the protests, like no masks.

330
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:14,490
And it was that restaurant that was like, if you don't have a mask, you can eat here for free.

331
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:19,710
Do you remember hearing about that and believe it, that's Huntington Beach or Orange County.

332
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:26,160
But I would say my paranoia where so we both grew up in California, but like in different ways.

333
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:30,310
I totally like double check. My doors are locked.

334
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:35,430
We both are like females in our thirties who live by ourselves.

335
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:41,549
We own a house. I like my door when I go home and I check it before I go to sleep.

336
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:48,180
At night I turn on my home security system. When I go to sleep at night, I like double lock my doors.

337
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:51,300
I don't leave stuff in my car. She just, like, does it.

338
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,860
She lives in Oklahoma City,

339
00:36:52,860 --> 00:37:01,200
which I would say is maybe like she lives in a more crime ridden neighborhood than I do and she does not, like, lock her stuff.

340
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:12,299
I have this pepper spray on my keys I think we have never had to use, but I throw it away and when it expires and get a new one.

341
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:15,180
I've carried this since I was like in college.

342
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:24,060
I have a taser which is charged at my house, which I had to buy when I was in Indiana because you legally can't get one delivered to you in Michigan.

343
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:34,500
Isn't that odd? I've thought about taking self-defense classes, even though I've never been, like, attacked my entire life.

344
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,690
Trust issue. Thank goodness. I know.

345
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:43,950
But I feel like, you know, obviously she was like and then, you know, and then my mom was always worried about me being stolen when I was a child.

346
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:51,990
And so now that we, you know, we talk about these differences, I realize how much of my psychosocial factors,

347
00:37:51,990 --> 00:38:00,930
my like anxiety about where I live in the world has so much been informed about the way that I grew up.

348
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:08,659
Ideas of what was really interesting is like what we do as adults can always be traced

349
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:12,550
back to how we were raised as children and like the stuff that happened with children,

350
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,940
the way we interact with the world we do as adults. Yeah.

351
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:19,070
Yeah. Childhood trauma. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

352
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:25,790
But, you know, those kinds of things, like even psychosocial factors can be dynamic, but they also can stay solidified.

353
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:31,430
Or where are you all around for the groper of summer 2021.

354
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:38,209
Oh, there was there was a guy going around here in downtown Ann Arbor,

355
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:46,660
like just randomly groping women and then trying to, like, attack them and pull them away.

356
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:53,180
When one person in Nichols Arcade, like, meet him and the police finally caught him and stuff like that.

357
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:57,499
But you know, you never know those kinds of things happen.

358
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:01,890
But I still I'm always like, obviously, I'm not the prime target, right?

359
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:06,440
Like, I'm not like, you know, 18 years old and then and like super fit.

360
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:11,479
And my main defense of it, someone tries to, like, kidnap or attack me. I'm like, I'm a faculty member.

361
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:15,500
Do you want to be in the Michigan Daily tomorrow? Like, that's my defense goal.

362
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,629
And then I'll, I'll go to the pepper spray.

363
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:24,980
But, you know, community stresses, obviously, that's my own personal example of how that's impacted me physically, but also psycho socially.

364
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:35,930
And in regards to this environmental predictor of neighborhood crime and infant birthweight, have you all heard of the weathering effect?

365
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:42,799
Yeah. Do you want to? Isn't it from it's mainly done in like African-American communities, but it's women.

366
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:50,600
So it's just like they have much higher stress and stuff and that contributes to them just being that unhealthy in general.

367
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:56,270
Or is it has to do with like pregnancy and stuff too. It's mostly focused on infant birth weight and mortality rates.

368
00:39:57,170 --> 00:40:00,650
So you haven't talked about this in your other courses now.

369
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:08,629
So that's called the weathering of factor, the weathering hypothesis, and it's mostly focused around social determinants of health.

370
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:12,230
It's a really interesting series of studies if you want to read it.

371
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:17,209
But essentially this researcher followed longitudinally.

372
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:27,140
They looked at white women in the United States, black women in the United States, and then black women who are in Africa.

373
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:38,420
And they compared the birth weights and infant mortality rates and the birth weights and infant mortality rates of white women and women in Africa,

374
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:42,710
despite being lower resource than Africa, were about the same.

375
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:51,020
But black women in the United States disproportionately had higher infant mortality rates and lower gestational weeks.

376
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:56,960
Yes. Like is the low birth weight?

377
00:40:56,970 --> 00:41:05,640
Is that really also I don't know how to phrase as passionately in accounting for like shorter gestation period.

378
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:09,809
Yes. Yes. And they also took into account individual characteristics.

379
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:21,120
So they tried to do kind of like a propensity score matching, which is what we call like a quasi experimental study design, where you can't you don't,

380
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:28,199
you won't in a study, you won't always find like the same person with the same characteristics that are like the exact person,

381
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:35,970
but just a different race and ethnicity. So they tried to manage them as closely as possible, like 1 to 1 in terms of age groups,

382
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:42,060
smoking characteristics, like if two people smoke in the different cohorts, like they compare them together.

383
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:48,540
Obviously you wouldn't want to like compare a smoking and nonsmoking person because that changes their birth outcomes,

384
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:52,049
like alcohol consumption, diet, lifestyle.

385
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:59,520
So they can they do control for all those characteristics. And then a gestational weight also has to do with timing in utero.

386
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:10,709
And essentially what they found was that the white women and the African women had about the same outcomes,

387
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:20,790
but the black women disproportionately did. But then they would look at African women who then immigrated here to the United States,

388
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:28,920
and then they would have children and their their children who were born here.

389
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:37,140
All of a sudden, their daughters, like the the infant mortality rate and shot up in the birth rate and the health outcomes down.

390
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:43,259
And then they would look at their daughters, same thing, controlling for all these characteristics.

391
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:49,590
So essentially what the whether in fact they were looking at like the impact of social determinants of health,

392
00:42:49,980 --> 00:43:00,690
structural racism, microaggressions, the effect of essentially cumulative stress due to like their position out in society.

393
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:06,419
If you think about it, have that have you ever heard like death by a thousand cuts so like,

394
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:10,770
you know when you have just one cut like it's fine, you'll live.

395
00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:18,659
But, you know, with repeated assaults over and over and over again, your body is only so resilient.

396
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:27,570
And then it, you know, adapts to different ways of coping, both physiologically but also mentally.

397
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:31,800
And that can manifest itself in different ways.

398
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:36,540
Yeah. So that's that's kind of, you know, like the weathering effects.

399
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:44,849
So the neighborhood crime, if we think about this as the most robust environmental predictor of infant birth weight, obviously that results in stress.

400
00:43:44,850 --> 00:43:50,669
But thinking about neighborhood crime as we know, you know, depending on where you live,

401
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:58,590
certain pockets or neighborhoods or zip codes might be more heterogeneous or more homogenous,

402
00:43:58,590 --> 00:44:07,650
but they might have similar characteristics in terms of socioeconomic status, which can thereby influence the environment and then their outcomes.

403
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:18,480
Yeah. So I'm going to do another case study looking at the environmental impact and psychosocial factors.

404
00:44:18,870 --> 00:44:24,749
How many of you have watched any of the stuff from unnatural causes?

405
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:28,409
You have already had an undergrad. In undergrad. Which did you what?

406
00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:31,640
All of it. Don't remember which ones. Okay. Oh, come on. We're talking about.

407
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:36,060
Okay. Did you talk about the Native Americans and diabetes?

408
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:40,140
I don't think so. Okay, great. So this was real news for you.

409
00:44:40,570 --> 00:44:44,540
So this this one, I have two short clips.

410
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:54,270
I'm so sad. I just found out as of this semester cannot be took a natural causes of like University of Michigan is no longer subscribing to it

411
00:44:56,910 --> 00:45:04,560
which presents a problem my other class because I haven't also received a show but essentially this one is just placing into context.

412
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:10,410
American Indians are Native Americans have a lot of poor health outcomes.

413
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:19,709
So this one in particular, these two short clips focuses just to provide you a little bit of context on how that happened.

414
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:25,280
And then we'll look at an intervention. Sawsan.

415
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:33,910
You. Okay.

416
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:44,160
There's a there's a direct connection between a very diverse water in the river and the health status and how the status of Peterson.

417
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:51,420
Here comes the 1891 water simply stopped coming, coming out of the river stream water.

418
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:57,090
Water from the Healy was diverted by dam one and water projects given given white settlers and farmers,

419
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:00,450
ranchers, mighty mighty interests one water that they needed.

420
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:05,940
And when we're dependent on large groups to provide for ourselves,

421
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:14,210
not only in the 1908 Supreme Court decision movement under water rights for all Native Americans could protect the Pima.

422
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:27,190
The Cuckoo's Nest Dam in 1931, one of the largest in the world, its promise to provide warm water for everyone.

423
00:46:27,350 --> 00:46:38,210
This this time clearly delivering the Pima. Former former President Talbot, which is still celebrated its open with politicians and businessmen.

424
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:46,740
De de de China. Cruz, Christine. Linen, the PPE bags.

425
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:54,120
Lunches on makeshift tables. Who allegedly part in the peace pipe.

426
00:46:54,450 --> 00:46:58,770
But in and out of the water again.

427
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:07,229
We were without water for an extended half century where American workers in the United

428
00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:12,040
States of America are conditions on the reservation still standing in that situation.

429
00:47:12,090 --> 00:47:17,760
I know my neighbor across from probably been able to get get out and work and work in the fields and able to develop an

430
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:25,630
economic recovery because of the lack of water for almost 200 years was just an absolute shame for as far as this country,

431
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:28,950
as far as the states territories is concerned.

432
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:37,370
What is what is a metaphor for the rest of the country to try to think about in terms of dating the rivers?

433
00:47:38,030 --> 00:47:42,140
It would be like doing something to this entire country. Okay. So you survive now without money.

434
00:47:42,590 --> 00:47:45,900
And how would you do that? How would you change your entire income?

435
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:50,030
How would you change your whole culture? How would how would you change your entire lifestyle?

436
00:47:50,040 --> 00:48:01,070
And when will you be successful? When people do die and the people who did die, but they died from starvation, not knowing they had diabetes.

437
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:13,700
A Supreme Court in 1902 found out no one saw the sun among the Pima, but with 33 years old building the Coolidge Dam.

438
00:48:14,090 --> 00:48:15,830
There were more than 500.

439
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:28,729
If we had gone down the river rivers back in the 1920s and 1930s, we wouldn't be able to get the lifestyle that we enjoy in terms of swimming pools.

440
00:48:28,730 --> 00:48:33,350
And of course there are just artificial lakes and there's less limestone.

441
00:48:33,350 --> 00:48:42,380
We're really living outside the laws of nature and I think generally speaking don't realize is that is that all the prosperity,

442
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:48,140
the feeling since prosperity of this entire state was those built at that with the help of the local tribes?

443
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:53,870
He was he was living a very, very, very difficult life on the bottom economic scale.

444
00:48:54,670 --> 00:48:59,660
You had almost no recourse except to become become too dependent upon government benefits.

445
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:10,340
Shortly after the dams were built, the US U.S. military began distributing commodity food to Native Americans and deaf deaf people in hard times.

446
00:49:11,210 --> 00:49:19,100
This is a commodities building, or they are designed as a commodity food source where you can get their good shoes,

447
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:25,850
their beer beans and their great, great stuff are usually used in rows and rows and rows of those.

448
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:34,210
But this was food, wine, white flour, refined sugar, lard and foods that designed diabetics.

449
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:40,790
Nightmare business secretaries, neighbor. They asked just how many people were buying houses, and she said five.

450
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:45,140
And the guy the guy said, Well, you can't get five boxes of food.

451
00:49:45,590 --> 00:49:49,400
And there is a chat room and an accountant.

452
00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:56,180
And I thought it was maybe a nice, nice idea about having food, but it's just the wrong kind of food.

453
00:49:56,180 --> 00:50:01,880
And I said, sorry, but once a week they can come along normal food with our kangaroo gravy.

454
00:50:05,430 --> 00:50:15,090
Okay, one more clip. Well, there's a lot a lot of debate, debate and conversation.

455
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:23,230
I am currently looking at the role of genetics and environment and how the problem that we see with diabetes in American ingenuity.

456
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:27,470
So, for example, the diabetes was exceedingly rare.

457
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:37,400
I mean, Dan Rivers in Arizona, there was actually a fairly complete survey done around the 19, 19, early, early 1900s.

458
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:43,530
And they found one 1996 dives in the south southwestern tribes.

459
00:50:43,550 --> 00:50:46,770
So it was not a common health problem.

460
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:50,780
Historically, people people lived in a different environment and lifestyle.

461
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:55,420
Then this was Dan Rivers in the 1920s and 1930s.

462
00:50:55,560 --> 00:51:00,560
And then by the 1970s, some of the local tribes had the highest rate of diabetes world.

463
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:05,110
So we certainly did not see a tremendous dramatic shift between between 1919 70.

464
00:51:05,390 --> 00:51:09,110
What we saw was a tremendous change in environment and lifestyle.

465
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:14,810
So when they would be looking at the allocation of resources and because of this world policy perspective,

466
00:51:15,250 --> 00:51:24,500
we will work with some communities and spend many, many, many millions of dollars on medical research in those populations.

467
00:51:24,770 --> 00:51:28,210
And and at the same time, we will hence $40,000 recapture.

468
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:38,140
So so we haven't prioritized the allocation of resource rich life like the needs of the indigenous allergist resources,

469
00:51:38,150 --> 00:51:43,490
things like these policy makers and the medical research community.

470
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,040
And this what this really is a social justice.

471
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:52,120
But looking to look at it from a broader perspective, we're seeing an explosion of poverty, diabetes around around the world.

472
00:51:52,130 --> 00:51:59,480
It's not just American Indians. It's not just not just in this country, but in the whole world world development regulations.

473
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:07,460
What we what we've seen is tremendous change in diet, processed foods and corn sirup,

474
00:52:07,550 --> 00:52:12,770
which which makes the availability of sugar that much greater, either in processed foods.

475
00:52:13,210 --> 00:52:17,960
And as a result, we're seeing we're seeing a tremendous increase in diabetes throughout the world.

476
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:25,130
And that's certainly something that the world world has plenty of healthy food just because it's distributed equally.

477
00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:33,200
And the people that have access to healthy places are the people and the populations that are suffering most of these.

478
00:52:35,330 --> 00:52:47,840
Okay. There was a whole 26, 27 minute, 27 minute video on unnatural causes for that specific episode is called Blood Sugar.

479
00:52:47,850 --> 00:52:50,159
I think it's also on YouTube kind of poor quality.

480
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:59,129
But if you want to watch any thoughts or reactions to those clips, as you all know that before you watched it, you did see.

481
00:52:59,130 --> 00:53:02,250
Yeah, yeah, I've seen it my first before.

482
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:05,999
It's like an interest of mine. I'm always kind of questions.

483
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:10,860
It's like, you know, I always hear America is like the leading, like, obesity,

484
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:15,509
diabetes rates in the world, or one of them that one that I always thought of.

485
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:20,480
I mean, as we're watching this, this is like wonder if we can, like trace back and see when that started.

486
00:53:20,490 --> 00:53:25,379
If it was because of the food they're just reading to the communities that, well,

487
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:31,020
we literally destroyed or just kind of seen if there a cause and if this is one of those causes.

488
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:36,540
Yeah, yeah. How about you, Bridget? Any thoughts or reactions?

489
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:46,500
Um, I think I heard we talked about like, this, and so, like, I heard like, briefly, Bob, I didn't read the article.

490
00:53:46,530 --> 00:53:51,590
Is that Amy's class? Yeah. Yeah.

491
00:53:52,160 --> 00:54:00,739
I mean, like, it makes sense. I feel like I feel like a lot of like the health issues that have been emerging are because of

492
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:05,879
like the quality of our food supply and like what kind of foods are like readily available.

493
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:10,910
But I think that's really everyone. And I think it makes sense for like, um,

494
00:54:10,970 --> 00:54:14,780
like the American Indian populations to be more impacted just because of like how

495
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:20,540
they used to live is so different and like the way they've been forced to live.

496
00:54:20,570 --> 00:54:27,860
Now I'm in like environmental justice and indigenous peoples class and so I was

497
00:54:27,860 --> 00:54:31,910
like reading under different environmental issues that they faced in the past,

498
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:35,659
like last night. So. So because you're an AHP, right?

499
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:42,319
Yeah. So this is certainly like, as we pointed to, primarily like a policy issue because they wanted to build the dam.

500
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:46,129
But I'm sure in your other class, you talk they talk about how, you know,

501
00:54:46,130 --> 00:54:57,140
now people are trying like we had this huge boom from the sixties essentially to like the early 2000s of just like commercialization,

502
00:54:57,140 --> 00:55:01,520
like shelf stable products, plastics, plastics, plastics.

503
00:55:01,910 --> 00:55:05,830
And now people are like they'll learn the earth is like literally on fire.

504
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:10,490
Right. So I know there's more of a movement back towards like, you know,

505
00:55:10,910 --> 00:55:16,399
locally sourced things or like native grown foods or trying to give indigenous

506
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:21,650
people back their land so that they can do more like subsistence farming.

507
00:55:21,650 --> 00:55:30,590
But the world as it the land as it is today, is not the same as the land that it was in 1960s, 1960s.

508
00:55:30,590 --> 00:55:34,090
It's dry now. It's like incredibly barren.

509
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:40,580
So, I mean, do you talk more about that in your course? You're still like, okay, get in there.

510
00:55:40,610 --> 00:55:45,889
Okay, so maybe you'll have more insights to share as the semester goes on.

511
00:55:45,890 --> 00:55:54,440
But it's like, yeah, just, it's a, it's talking about this in my other class this morning because they didn't know the, my other classes,

512
00:55:54,440 --> 00:56:01,190
infectious disease and emergency response and they didn't know that pharmaceutical reps are usually trained in the sciences.

513
00:56:01,190 --> 00:56:06,679
They're just generally attractive, charismatic people who like are sales people.

514
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:16,819
Right. And I tried to explain to one of my students, she was like, I don't understand, like why physicians prescribe more medications.

515
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:20,330
Like why would they do that if a pharmaceutical kickbacks.

516
00:56:20,330 --> 00:56:26,800
Right. So, you know, the beauty, the terrible part of capitalism is, you know,

517
00:56:26,810 --> 00:56:32,420
we were talking about Marx last week is money is what makes this country go around.

518
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:39,409
So, you know, in terms of like food and stuff like milk does not need to spoil.

519
00:56:39,410 --> 00:56:46,280
Right. As as nearly as fast as it does. It's the dairy lobby and industry like in Europe.

520
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:52,669
It's ultra pasteurized. Um, my mom's family, after the war in Vietnam, they immigrated to Germany.

521
00:56:52,670 --> 00:56:54,980
So I've actually never been to Asia.

522
00:56:55,910 --> 00:57:02,210
Growing up my whole life I used to visit my mom's family in Germany and just like the quality of food is so different there,

523
00:57:02,570 --> 00:57:08,270
the eggs don't need to be refrigerated. I can't eat lactose here in America, in Germany.

524
00:57:08,270 --> 00:57:16,249
I can eat yogurt, I can eat gelato, I can eat cake, show just cheese.

525
00:57:16,250 --> 00:57:23,000
It's just so different. The quality of food just because of the preservatives and additives they have.

526
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:27,620
But it's like they said, an environmental justice issue,

527
00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:34,160
but also a social justice issue in terms of what has happened to the American Indians in this particular context.

528
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:40,640
Also, because of policy decisions made, they have high an end to like just genocide.

529
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:47,780
They have higher rates of substance use disorders, depression, suicide among their communities.

530
00:57:48,530 --> 00:57:56,299
So the reason I showed you those clips is to give you greater context into this particular study by Gittleson and colleagues,

531
00:57:56,300 --> 00:58:05,960
where they are looking at the higher prevalence of obesity among American Indians associated again with type two diabetes,

532
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:09,260
hypertension and cardiovascular disease.

533
00:58:09,590 --> 00:58:14,389
So they did this 14 month intervention with the Navajo Nation called Navajo

534
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:19,550
Healthy Foods Stores to try to increase the availability of healthier foods.

535
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:28,430
So this was they had ten store regions in Navajo Nation and they randomized them into experimental and control group.

536
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:33,830
So at baseline, they had 276 people post intervention.

537
00:58:33,830 --> 00:58:38,270
After the 14 months, they only had 145 left due to attrition.

538
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:46,790
But the intervention did show reduced BMI, improved health food intentions, healthier cooking methods and healthy food getting.

539
00:58:47,270 --> 00:58:56,640
So what are the psychosocial factors related? Added to this study, the psychosocial factors are specifically around self-efficacy, right?

540
00:58:56,660 --> 00:59:06,240
That's something we can't necessarily see, but that we want to measure healthy food intentions and then perceptions of healthy food.

541
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:10,070
So what they would do in this intervention was with particular foods.

542
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:16,430
They would give them a score underneath that where the, you know, near the price tag so they could see,

543
00:59:17,150 --> 00:59:21,740
you know, with the labeling and all that, does that drive healthier food choices?

544
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:26,599
It started in California, but I think it's most places nationwide.

545
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:30,650
You remember when they rolled out like they have to put the number of calories.

546
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:37,460
How for how many of you did that change, like your ordering practices that didn't change your ordering practices, Bridget.

547
00:59:37,550 --> 00:59:41,000
Now I got like, I'll be like, I'll have a lot of calories. Forget about it later.

548
00:59:41,930 --> 00:59:48,559
For me, it did a little bit because like you go to a place like, I don't know, like BJ's Brewhouse or like Chili's or something.

549
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:53,410
And I used to think, Oh, I'll just get the, like, you know, Chinese chicken salad.

550
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:59,299
Like a salad is healthier. But then you look at and you're like, whoa, it's like actually over 1000 calories.

551
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:04,200
Like, it's I should just get the cheeseburger. It's like 200 calories less.

552
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:07,310
I should add that I'm vegetarian. Oh, I go to restaurant.

553
01:00:07,310 --> 01:00:11,060
It's like I have one, two, three, oh, oh, oh. Okay. I can't choose that one.

554
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:18,590
Okay, that's fair. That's fair. I was a pescatarian for four years, so I understand why I have easy seafood, but, you know, trickier.

555
01:00:19,070 --> 01:00:29,240
So so with this in particular, you know, similarly, when I was I had a brief stint working at the Health Department in Omaha for Douglas County,

556
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:34,790
and there was also food deserts like I think I mentioned, like thus the city is highly segregated.

557
01:00:34,790 --> 01:00:43,910
So in North Omaha we had mostly the black community in South Omaha where you had mostly the Hispanic Latino community, there were large food deserts.

558
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:50,390
So essentially, like all there were places for them to go get groceries at was the corner store.

559
01:00:50,690 --> 01:00:58,910
And usually at the corner store that would have they have like Hot Cheetos, like Hostess products, Cigarets soft drinks.

560
01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:05,120
So the health department got this grant essentially to go in and work with the corner

561
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:12,949
store owners or like the local bodega owners to reconfigure this store and bring in,

562
01:01:12,950 --> 01:01:23,269
you know, very basic staples, apples, oranges, carrots, green onions, even just like regular onions and, you know,

563
01:01:23,270 --> 01:01:32,540
put like really attractive signage and make it affordable to increase, you know, the healthy eating.

564
01:01:32,540 --> 01:01:38,869
Just because for a lot of these places, too, there wasn't infrastructure, like there weren't sidewalks.

565
01:01:38,870 --> 01:01:43,850
Like I did my internship in North Omaha and I didn't have a car for two years.

566
01:01:45,230 --> 01:01:51,530
The bus system is not good like it is here and for my internship getting like the, you know,

567
01:01:51,530 --> 01:01:57,230
six miles or whatever would take an hour because there was no app, you couldn't track it.

568
01:01:57,980 --> 01:02:02,870
It was winter like it's literally just like a mound of snow in front of someone's

569
01:02:02,870 --> 01:02:08,809
house and like a little sign the nearest grocery store is a couple miles away.

570
01:02:08,810 --> 01:02:12,710
Even if you took the bus, you can't do like a big haul, right?

571
01:02:13,340 --> 01:02:19,549
So for the time that I was living there, I would walk to the Walmart grocery store.

572
01:02:19,550 --> 01:02:25,129
I forget what the Walmart version of the grocery store is called, but that's like, you know what I'm talking about.

573
01:02:25,130 --> 01:02:31,550
It's like a Walmart, but they only do groceries. So I would walk there, but then it was uphill coming back.

574
01:02:31,550 --> 01:02:40,160
So I would just call a Lyft back if I had to like carry a bunch of stuff because I could, you know, kind of afford that on my grad stipend.

575
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:43,880
But for a lot of people that don't even have those options.

576
01:02:44,570 --> 01:02:52,940
So specifically focusing on the psychosocial factors like things like self-efficacy and intentions are also for so for like you

577
01:02:52,940 --> 01:03:00,110
to who aren't necessarily in the age occupational health space just to get you thinking like what your survey might look like.

578
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:03,320
It doesn't have to be about the workplace if you don't want it to be.

579
01:03:04,460 --> 01:03:13,800
Okay. Any questions, comments or thoughts about those before we move on?

580
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:21,260
Okay. So just with that, then, I wanted to wrap up today.

581
01:03:21,260 --> 01:03:25,190
We'll start. Survey methodology crash course on Thursday.

582
01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:34,100
But talking about this analogy here. So with survey methods, we talked, okay, it's a faster way to get information.

583
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:40,459
It's cheaper sometimes. It may be the only solution that's really actually feasible.

584
01:03:40,460 --> 01:03:44,420
And and surveys aren't all bad, right? They have to be made in a good way.

585
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:52,879
But like any Heinz, for example, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey is a cross-sectional right.

586
01:03:52,880 --> 01:04:03,110
They don't necessarily get the same people, every cohort, great data source so long as you know what variables to use and statistical methods.

587
01:04:03,110 --> 01:04:11,299
So with surveys in particular, we're trying to seek a better understanding, let's just say understanding of a construct,

588
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:16,370
relationship or outcome particular in a population of interest,

589
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:25,250
your population can be as small as like the students in this class or the whole United States or the world.

590
01:04:25,310 --> 01:04:28,969
But it depends on your question of interest, right?

591
01:04:28,970 --> 01:04:32,990
Is it really applicable to sample that many people?

592
01:04:33,380 --> 01:04:38,090
So if we look at this picture here, what is this a picture of?

593
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:44,300
Don't look ahead in the slides. Hmm. Thinking like farmland.

594
01:04:44,660 --> 01:04:47,570
Farmland. Is it just because it's green? Exactly.

595
01:04:47,660 --> 01:04:58,790
So just say, for example, we'll take this box as what we call our population and who we actually sample is our sampling frame.

596
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:10,730
So if we were just just say this box is 3 billion people and we only surveyed 30, like this is maybe all we can get.

597
01:05:11,150 --> 01:05:14,810
Right. And but does this give us a good enough picture now?

598
01:05:15,590 --> 01:05:27,410
So what if we did this? So, you know, we sampled widely this time with different clusters.

599
01:05:28,010 --> 01:05:34,400
Do do we still can we still make any generalizations about this photo or can we figure out what it is?

600
01:05:34,970 --> 01:05:38,120
It's better not not breed better, but not great.

601
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:41,299
Okay, how about this?

602
01:05:41,300 --> 01:05:47,270
I just, you know, I just really focus homogeneously and I sampled the crap out of it.

603
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:54,250
What do we. What do we think it is? Any guesses?

604
01:05:56,190 --> 01:06:01,010
No. How about how about now?

605
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:09,250
You know, this is if we were to sample in clusters more heterogeneous.

606
01:06:10,730 --> 01:06:16,370
But we're still missing people from the frame. How about now?

607
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:23,060
Nate. That everything, huh? You did, everyone? No, no, I didn't.

608
01:06:23,450 --> 01:06:26,600
So what is it? A turtle. It's a sea turtle.

609
01:06:26,630 --> 01:06:35,000
Is it a good picture of a sea turtle? It's not. But at least we know we have a better clear picture of what it was then, like a couple of slides ago.

610
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:42,170
Right. So essentially this is analogy for what we're trying to accomplish in survey methodology where, yeah,

611
01:06:42,170 --> 01:06:49,430
this is not a randomized controlled trial, this is not quasi experimental, it is not longitudinal, it's not a cohort.

612
01:06:49,820 --> 01:06:56,020
Right. So none of those like better. And you're looking at your pyramid of AP studies is not the gold standard at all.

613
01:06:56,030 --> 01:07:02,899
In fact, they would put this at the bottom of the pyramid. A lot of times I think that's a mean about survey research, but it's really hard.

614
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:06,320
But really it is giving us a better picture of what we started with.

615
01:07:06,740 --> 01:07:14,870
But in order to accomplish what we're wanting to accomplish, if you have bad questions, you're going to get bad answers.

616
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:20,149
If you have a poor if you have, you know, a low response rate,

617
01:07:20,150 --> 01:07:29,050
that's obviously going to shade the biases of your sample as well, depending on who you sample, that could affect it as well.

618
01:07:29,060 --> 01:07:38,660
So just say, for example, have I talked to you all about what I did for my dissertation or some other class?

619
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:47,990
Okay, things blend together. So for my dissertation, I did a mixed methods study qualitative and quantitative,

620
01:07:48,290 --> 01:07:53,840
looking at university employees intention to evacuate during fire alarms.

621
01:07:55,550 --> 01:07:55,970
Why?

622
01:07:55,980 --> 01:08:05,840
Because people don't actually evacuate during fire alarms, but students are a lot better at it because they don't necessarily have the autonomy to.

623
01:08:06,110 --> 01:08:12,709
Generally, you're in a classroom or some kind of shared space where like an adult is telling you that you need to leave.

624
01:08:12,710 --> 01:08:17,360
But if you look at a lot of faculty at the old university I used to work at,

625
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:23,720
people would just turn off their light and close the doors and pretend they weren't there just to keep working.

626
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:30,260
That's terrible. It is terrible because because there could be like an actual fire.

627
01:08:30,950 --> 01:08:35,150
And here over the summer, you were here when the fire alarms went off, right?

628
01:08:35,270 --> 01:08:43,819
Yeah. Yeah. A lot of people over time with frequent fire alarms either because there's smoke producing incidents like someone's

629
01:08:43,820 --> 01:08:50,389
bringing popcorn in the microwave or there might be like an electrical wiring issue that sets off the smoke detectors.

630
01:08:50,390 --> 01:08:52,070
But you don't see like visible flames.

631
01:08:52,400 --> 01:09:01,130
People mentally attribute that to false alarms or drills, so they get really complacent and they stop doing it, like when we had to evacuate twice.

632
01:09:01,490 --> 01:09:07,309
One time I didn't bring my coat because I was like, I know what to do my dissertation.

633
01:09:07,310 --> 01:09:10,430
And then I just like ran out and it was so cold.

634
01:09:10,430 --> 01:09:16,790
And I think you all end up making, like, a huddle around me because we were in like a wind tunnel and we stood outside for 40, 45 minutes.

635
01:09:17,270 --> 01:09:25,849
Firefighters did not even come. Police slowly rolled up and then like they talked to the facility's people and

636
01:09:25,850 --> 01:09:28,909
they wandered inside for like 15 minutes and came back out and they were like,

637
01:09:28,910 --> 01:09:34,219
okay, you just come back in. And then that happened again a couple of weeks later, thankfully warmer.

638
01:09:34,220 --> 01:09:37,370
And I was smart enough to like grab my backpack that time.

639
01:09:38,510 --> 01:09:49,610
But same thing happens. And when there's no like follow up to those types of situations, people just don't understand why they're doing it.

640
01:09:50,030 --> 01:09:56,809
And then compliance gets lower. So I sampled university employees at Indiana University.

641
01:09:56,810 --> 01:10:00,590
I sent it out to my sampling frame was all employees.

642
01:10:00,590 --> 01:10:11,540
So I was working with the Public Safety Department, like the people here who send you the alerts about like tornado siren practice or like burglary.

643
01:10:11,690 --> 01:10:15,230
I'm like, you know, this hall or whatever.

644
01:10:16,220 --> 01:10:26,870
So they distributed across all units and I got about 540 people to reply, which was less than 10%, which is like pretty pathetic actually.

645
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:34,040
But, you know, given time and capacity, I could have been more robust in my sampling methods,

646
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:37,339
like looking at which buildings or which units hadn't responded,

647
01:10:37,340 --> 01:10:44,930
and then literally stalking people outside with an iPad to like fill it out to, you know, round out my sampling better.

648
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:56,420
But the way that Indiana University employees responded would certainly be different than the way University of Michigan employees respond.

649
01:10:56,930 --> 01:11:01,940
So when we look at a survey, we also have to think about generalizability.

650
01:11:02,420 --> 01:11:05,180
How many is the thing that you're asking?

651
01:11:05,540 --> 01:11:14,449
So potentially that study could transfer over because it is a large Midwestern public university with about 40, 50,000 students.

652
01:11:14,450 --> 01:11:17,480
So like kind of the same. Right. But.

653
01:11:17,770 --> 01:11:22,270
You know, that would not be the same as like, I don't know, it's a small college here.

654
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:31,900
Like, I don't know, like if it was like a, like a like a like a having brain for like Vassar College,

655
01:11:31,900 --> 01:11:35,889
which is like an all women's college that has maybe like 2000 students.

656
01:11:35,890 --> 01:11:40,240
Right? Like that survey, those survey responses would look totally different.

657
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:44,620
So when you're thinking about what survey you want to make,

658
01:11:44,620 --> 01:11:52,450
is it so niche that it only really specifically applies to the population you have of interest?

659
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:59,530
Or are you able to generalize your findings later to other populations?

660
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:04,239
So that's something that will want to think about as we craft our topic.

661
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:13,240
So just say like off the top of our my head, you know, I was the only person in my program that did occupational safety and health.

662
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:20,740
So a lot of my friends, because the the Kinsey Institute is there at IU, they did a lot of sexual and reproductive health.

663
01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:26,499
So surveys on like sexual violence among college students.

664
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:32,040
For example, the Center for Sexual Reproductive Health did a ton of surveys and research about that.

665
01:12:32,470 --> 01:12:37,510
So those studies are generalizable to potentially other college campuses.

666
01:12:37,510 --> 01:12:47,829
But when you look at something like use of telehealth services to get, you know, oral contraceptives among like this provider in particular,

667
01:12:47,830 --> 01:12:53,200
and you're doing a survey of that, it's it becomes it becomes more difficult to generalize.

668
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:59,860
Does that does that make sense? Okay. So that's all I had for today.

669
01:13:01,150 --> 01:13:05,380
Thursday will definitely do more of a crash course on survey methodology.
