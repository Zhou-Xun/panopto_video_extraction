1
00:00:00,345 --> 00:00:05,613
In this session, we're going to talk about hemochromatosis.

2
00:00:05,613 --> 00:00:09,816
Learning objectives are to describe the following attributes of hemochromatosis.

3
00:00:09,816 --> 00:00:14,456
The epidemiology symptoms and affected organ systems, genetics,

4
00:00:14,456 --> 00:00:18,377
biological pathways that are disrupted and treatments.

5
00:00:18,377 --> 00:00:22,847
Also describe the role of genetic screening in asymptomatic and

6
00:00:22,847 --> 00:00:25,994
symptomatic adults for hemochromatosis and

7
00:00:25,994 --> 00:00:31,687
articulate the challenges associated with each of these public health approaches.

8
00:00:31,969 --> 00:00:36,087
Hemochromatosis is a disease of iron overload.

9
00:00:36,087 --> 00:00:39,051
It actually affects the metabolism of iron and

10
00:00:39,051 --> 00:00:43,086
excessive amounts of iron accumulate in the body's tissues.

11
00:00:43,086 --> 00:00:47,883
You can actually see that down here in the picture where this person's

12
00:00:47,883 --> 00:00:51,945
hand has this sort of red, yellow, orangey kind of tinge,

13
00:00:51,945 --> 00:00:55,379
that's due to excess iron that's accumulated.

14
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:59,460
This is by comparison, someone who does not have hemochromatosis.

15
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:05,710
Hemochromatosis primarily is an autism or recessive genetic disorder and

16
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:09,392
we call that hereditary hemochromatosis.

17
00:01:09,392 --> 00:01:14,699
But you could also get this kind of iron overload secondary to other

18
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:20,119
disease processes like fallacy miA's or cider, or blastocysts.

19
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:24,868
We're gonna focus today on hereditary hemochromatosis primarily.

20
00:01:24,868 --> 00:01:27,174
Different factors can slow down or

21
00:01:27,174 --> 00:01:31,947
accelerate the presentation of the disorder, including blood loss or

22
00:01:31,947 --> 00:01:37,449
transfusions, dietary iron supplements and blood loss through menstruation.

23
00:01:37,449 --> 00:01:42,085
Any kind of blood loss will slow down the presentation of the disorder because it

24
00:01:42,085 --> 00:01:43,550
lets you get rid of iron.

25
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:48,027
But anything that's putting iron into the body like iron

26
00:01:48,027 --> 00:01:52,046
supplements will actually exacerbate the issue.

27
00:01:52,046 --> 00:01:57,344
Iron overload generally occurs in people about 40 to 60 years old,

28
00:01:57,344 --> 00:02:02,291
but some people who are very strongly predisposed genetically can

29
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:04,603
develop symptoms by age 20.

30
00:02:04,603 --> 00:02:08,757
Hemochromatosis affects many different organ systems.

31
00:02:08,757 --> 00:02:13,881
You've already seen the skin having that sort of discoloration.

32
00:02:13,881 --> 00:02:19,581
The skeletal muscles, heart and pancreas can also be affected.

33
00:02:19,581 --> 00:02:24,103
But the main organ that's affected as the liver and

34
00:02:24,103 --> 00:02:31,182
increased iron in the liver can lead to cirrhosis, liver cancer and liver failure.

35
00:02:31,588 --> 00:02:36,568
What makes hemochromatosis a little bit difficult is that the early

36
00:02:36,568 --> 00:02:38,674
symptoms are non specific.

37
00:02:38,674 --> 00:02:45,056
So in the beginning, when you start to develop symptoms of iron overload,

38
00:02:45,056 --> 00:02:52,066
you can feel fatigued, weak, there's weight loss, there's abdominal pain.

39
00:02:52,066 --> 00:02:55,657
Those are pretty non specific symptoms, and so

40
00:02:55,657 --> 00:03:00,070
sometimes hemochromatosis is not diagnosed right away.

41
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:03,450
The symptoms can get worse over time and

42
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:08,165
they can lead to other problems including arthritis,

43
00:03:08,165 --> 00:03:13,597
loss of having your period early menopause, loss of libido and

44
00:03:13,597 --> 00:03:19,046
then eventually you get really worsening symptoms over time.

45
00:03:19,046 --> 00:03:23,196
And so as the iron accumulates over time,

46
00:03:23,196 --> 00:03:27,591
these more advanced complications occur.

47
00:03:27,591 --> 00:03:31,573
Hemochromatosis is one of the most common genetic disorders in the United States.

48
00:03:31,573 --> 00:03:35,903
About one in 200 people are affected and about one in nine people

49
00:03:35,903 --> 00:03:40,405
are carriers of genetic mutations that can cause hemochromatosis.

50
00:03:40,405 --> 00:03:44,879
The incidence is higher in whites, especially those who have

51
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,783
a Celtic heritage or an Irish heritage because in Ireland up to about

52
00:03:49,783 --> 00:03:54,186
one in four individuals are carriers for hemochromatosis.

53
00:03:54,186 --> 00:03:59,247
And about one in 64 actually have two genetic mutations that cause

54
00:03:59,247 --> 00:04:05,196
hemochromatosis, although that might be a little bit now due to some screening

55
00:04:05,196 --> 00:04:11,413
practices that have been implemented where you can actually do carrier testing for

56
00:04:11,413 --> 00:04:17,231
hemochromatosis in Ireland and you can use that in planning your pregnancy.

57
00:04:17,231 --> 00:04:22,159
So people are less likely to be born with two copies of

58
00:04:22,159 --> 00:04:27,200
hemochromatosis causing mutations now in Ireland.

59
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,567
Treatment for hemochromatosis is really pretty simple.

60
00:04:31,567 --> 00:04:36,523
It's lobotomy, it's really removal of one or two pints of blood every week

61
00:04:36,523 --> 00:04:40,094
until the iron stores kind of go back to normal limits.

62
00:04:40,094 --> 00:04:45,421
The phlebotomy though needs to be continued every 2 to 4 months for

63
00:04:45,421 --> 00:04:49,070
life to prevent that re accumulation of iron.

64
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:54,340
And another thing that you can do is modify dietary iron intake especially

65
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:58,607
if you're eating high iron foods or taking iron supplements.

66
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:00,883
The gene responsible for

67
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:06,119
hereditary hemochromatosis is the HFE gene on chromosome 6p.

68
00:05:06,119 --> 00:05:10,544
And there are three mutations that have been identified.

69
00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:14,149
The one that has the highest penetrates is,

70
00:05:14,149 --> 00:05:18,632
well all of them are single amino acid substitution and

71
00:05:18,632 --> 00:05:23,991
the one with the highest penetration is a substitution of Sistine

72
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:28,778
to tyrosine at amino acid position to 82 in the HFT gene.

73
00:05:28,778 --> 00:05:34,421
And so that mutation is called C282Y because C is the code for

74
00:05:34,421 --> 00:05:38,054
cysteine and Y is the code for tyrosine.

75
00:05:38,054 --> 00:05:41,974
Another amino acid substitution is the H63D and S65C.

76
00:05:46,017 --> 00:05:51,741
The HFE protein is found mostly on liver and intestinal cells.

77
00:05:51,741 --> 00:05:56,154
And this is a picture of the HFE protein in the actual setting

78
00:05:56,154 --> 00:05:57,838
of the cell membrane.

79
00:05:57,838 --> 00:06:02,323
Here's the inside of the cell and here's the outside of the cell.

80
00:06:02,323 --> 00:06:05,525
And so this protein spans the membrane,

81
00:06:05,525 --> 00:06:09,586
and out here is where you see the common mutations.

82
00:06:09,586 --> 00:06:15,980
So here is the cys282 with conversion to tyrosine, right here and it's actually

83
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:21,756
at an important site where you normally would get systeine systeine bonds.

84
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:25,339
So these two sys are the bonding of two systems but

85
00:06:25,339 --> 00:06:29,811
that can't happen when you have a conversion to a tyrosine.

86
00:06:29,811 --> 00:06:35,338
So it kind of messes up the protein confirmation here and

87
00:06:35,338 --> 00:06:42,723
then the his 63 asp mutation is up here at the top of the protein that's the HD.

88
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:47,473
So what's happening at the cellular level?

89
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:51,995
So people think that the HFE protein is really

90
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:56,874
important at first of all letting iron into cells

91
00:06:56,874 --> 00:07:01,396
are actually keeping the iron out of cells and

92
00:07:01,396 --> 00:07:06,284
that it's important for iron sensing in cells.

93
00:07:06,284 --> 00:07:11,504
So in this top panel part A you have a hippo site which is the outer cell and

94
00:07:11,504 --> 00:07:16,289
this is the inside of the cell and this is the outside of the cell and

95
00:07:16,289 --> 00:07:18,395
here's the cell membrane.

96
00:07:18,395 --> 00:07:23,510
And when you have low levels of plasma iron this HFE protein is

97
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:28,540
actually bound to the transfer and receptor TFR1, okay.

98
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:33,393
And it means that iron is not coming into the cells and

99
00:07:33,393 --> 00:07:37,805
when there's an increase in plasma iron level C

100
00:07:37,805 --> 00:07:41,350
there's more iron here in the blood.

101
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:44,834
This Fe Is the symbol for iron,

102
00:07:44,834 --> 00:07:49,795
The Fe actually displaces the HFE protein.

103
00:07:49,795 --> 00:07:52,902
So the HFT protein detaches from TFR1 and

104
00:07:52,902 --> 00:07:56,736
the iron molecules are allowed to go into the cell.

105
00:07:56,736 --> 00:08:02,865
Okay, so iron uptake happens and when iron uptake happens over in this,

106
00:08:02,865 --> 00:08:09,998
another part of the cell membrane, this TFR2 protein starts assembling with other

107
00:08:09,998 --> 00:08:15,430
proteins nearby including HFE to form an iron sensing complex.

108
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:20,831
So the HFE is a really critical part of the iron sensing complex.

109
00:08:20,831 --> 00:08:27,108
And so that complex is trying to regulate how much iron is coming into the cell.

110
00:08:27,417 --> 00:08:31,175
Iron activates the Hepcidin gene.

111
00:08:31,175 --> 00:08:34,663
And when iron is coming into the cell,

112
00:08:34,663 --> 00:08:40,658
this Hepcidin gene is always on and it will increase iron intake.

113
00:08:40,658 --> 00:08:40,932
When the iron sensing complex normally indicates that there's too much

114
00:08:46,575 --> 00:08:53,037
iron coming into the cell, this will be shut down and hepcidin will be expressed.

115
00:08:53,275 --> 00:08:57,347
If however the HFE protein isn't functional,

116
00:08:57,347 --> 00:09:04,488
iron will always be coming into the cell and this iron sensing complex won't work.

117
00:09:04,488 --> 00:09:08,401
And so there's always going to be iron coming in and

118
00:09:08,401 --> 00:09:13,406
dis regulated iron sensing and that means that this hepcidin gene

119
00:09:13,406 --> 00:09:16,574
will always be on and more iron will keep coming into the cells.

120
00:09:18,243 --> 00:09:22,593
When we're thinking about symptomatic hemochromatosis,

121
00:09:22,593 --> 00:09:28,061
you've got some people that carry mutations that never develop symptoms.

122
00:09:28,061 --> 00:09:30,769
People that don't develop the symptomatic

123
00:09:30,769 --> 00:09:34,503
hemochromatosis could still have an increased iron level,

124
00:09:34,503 --> 00:09:39,200
but it hasn't reached the point where they're actually seeing symptoms.

125
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,002
Also keep in mind that not everybody with two mutations for

126
00:09:43,002 --> 00:09:46,271
HFE will develop symptomatic hemochromatosis.

127
00:09:46,271 --> 00:09:46,687
Here, environmental factors also play a critical role and

128
00:09:50,433 --> 00:09:55,424
that includes things we've talked about, like how much iron is coming

129
00:09:55,424 --> 00:10:00,601
into your diet, other things like gender and also alcohol consumption.

130
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:06,841
When we think about the HFE mutations, I've laid the three of them out here,

131
00:10:06,841 --> 00:10:13,571
90% of the hemochromatosis cases that we see have at least one copy of C282Y.

132
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:19,443
So that mutation is really responsible for most hemochromatosis.

133
00:10:19,443 --> 00:10:24,795
In the general population, the allele frequency of that mutation is about 10%.

134
00:10:24,882 --> 00:10:31,487
When you have homo zygotes that have two copies of C282Y, in men almost everybody,

135
00:10:31,487 --> 00:10:36,836
and also in women, actually, almost everybody gets iron overload.

136
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:42,886
And about half of men and about a 10th of women also show other symptoms.

137
00:10:42,886 --> 00:10:48,306
So because women menstruate and are getting rid of iron in their blood,

138
00:10:48,306 --> 00:10:51,030
they actually have less symptoms.

139
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:55,445
But you can still see that when you have two copies of C282Y,

140
00:10:55,445 --> 00:10:59,462
you have a pretty high risk of developing iron overload.

141
00:10:59,462 --> 00:11:05,026
If you have a C282Y and an H63D mutation that accounts for

142
00:11:05,026 --> 00:11:08,561
about 4% of hemochromatosis cases.

143
00:11:08,561 --> 00:11:13,888
If you're homozygous for H63D probably you won't have

144
00:11:13,888 --> 00:11:19,212
that much of a problem, but if you have one copy of H63D,

145
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:24,430
but also one copy of C282Y, about 1% of those people

146
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:29,892
develop iron overload usually with mostly mild symptoms.

147
00:11:29,892 --> 00:11:32,650
And for the S65C mutation,

148
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:37,956
almost there's very few symptoms that are detectable.

149
00:11:37,956 --> 00:11:43,140
And when you have heterocyclic, for C282Y and S65C,

150
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:48,935
it's a modest effect on iron metabolism and usually mild symptoms.

151
00:11:48,935 --> 00:11:49,005
The following model was proposed for the relationship between the HFE genotype and

152
00:11:54,936 --> 00:11:59,577
the probability of developing symptomatic hemochromatosis.

153
00:11:59,577 --> 00:12:04,774
So if you have the C282Y genotype and your homozygous for it,

154
00:12:04,774 --> 00:12:11,430
some people have no disease, but a lot of people do end up developing the disease.

155
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:15,116
And the relative risk of hemochromatosis in

156
00:12:15,116 --> 00:12:20,003
people who are homozygous for C282Y is 1000 to 1.

157
00:12:20,003 --> 00:12:26,439
When you compare these homo zygotes to people who have no HFE mutations.

158
00:12:26,439 --> 00:12:28,507
If you have a C282Y and

159
00:12:28,507 --> 00:12:34,627
an H63D the relative risk is 20 compared to people with no mutations.

160
00:12:34,627 --> 00:12:41,635
If you are homozygous for H63D, the relative risk is about 10 to 1.

161
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:46,369
If you have just one copy of C282Y and you don't have a mutation on

162
00:12:46,369 --> 00:12:51,268
your other chromosome for HFE you still have an increased risk of about

163
00:12:51,268 --> 00:12:55,861
eight times compared to somebody with no mutations whatsoever.

164
00:12:55,861 --> 00:13:00,712
And if you have H63D And no other mutation

165
00:13:00,712 --> 00:13:04,324
your risk is still about twice as high.

166
00:13:05,175 --> 00:13:09,950
So there was a study that looked at the global prevalence of hemochromatosis

167
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:14,951
mutations, and the goal was to determine the worldwide allele frequencies for

168
00:13:14,951 --> 00:13:16,230
C282Y and H3D.

169
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:20,906
And therefore identify the populations that are most affected by

170
00:13:20,906 --> 00:13:23,208
hereditary hemochromatosis.

171
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:28,618
And what they found when they looked at DNA samples from about 3000

172
00:13:28,618 --> 00:13:33,570
individuals they looked for the C282Y and H3D mutations and

173
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:38,257
what they found here is that for example here's a C282Y.

174
00:13:38,257 --> 00:13:43,449
A little frequency if you look it's about 6 to 10% in

175
00:13:43,449 --> 00:13:48,974
all of these different populations whereas the H3D little

176
00:13:48,974 --> 00:13:55,621
frequency is about 10 to 30% in all these different populations.

177
00:13:55,621 --> 00:13:59,311
And they're looking mostly across Europe.

178
00:13:59,311 --> 00:14:04,506
And what they found was that C282Y and H3D were found in nearly

179
00:14:04,506 --> 00:14:09,605
all European populations and the highest illegal frequency for

180
00:14:09,605 --> 00:14:13,771
C282Y was found in the UK, which was about 6%.

181
00:14:13,771 --> 00:14:19,307
And the H3D mutation was present at lower frequencies in Africans,

182
00:14:19,307 --> 00:14:22,075
Asians and native Americans, and

183
00:14:22,075 --> 00:14:27,338
it really wasn't found at all in some of some other populations.

184
00:14:27,338 --> 00:14:31,271
So what are the public health implications here?

185
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:36,061
So identifying the HFE gene and its mutations has provided

186
00:14:36,061 --> 00:14:41,157
the opportunity to prevent iron overload diseases, right?

187
00:14:41,157 --> 00:14:47,025
So there's research looking at who might be affected if we did genetic

188
00:14:47,025 --> 00:14:53,396
testing because genetic testing can be done on people who have no symptoms.

189
00:14:53,396 --> 00:14:58,027
So that'd be like a population level screening where all adults

190
00:14:58,027 --> 00:15:03,013
would get screened for HFE mutations and that would be one approach.

191
00:15:03,013 --> 00:15:03,280
Another approach would be symptomatic screening where they

192
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:14,901
only look at genetic testing for people who have symptoms of iron overload.

193
00:15:14,901 --> 00:15:19,979
And then another public health approach would be not to do genetic testing at all,

194
00:15:19,979 --> 00:15:24,127
just wait until people have symptoms of iron overload and then treat it.

195
00:15:24,483 --> 00:15:28,982
The benefits of genetic testing are possibly if we can do

196
00:15:28,982 --> 00:15:33,866
genetic testing on everyone in the population we can prevent

197
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:38,383
people from ever having any symptoms of iron overload.

198
00:15:38,383 --> 00:15:44,114
But that's not actually a strategy that's been adopted right now.

199
00:15:44,114 --> 00:15:51,359
The way that it's usually done right now is if you have someone who's symptomatic

200
00:15:51,359 --> 00:15:57,660
or you have a first degree relative with hereditary hemochromatosis or

201
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:03,867
even in asymptomatic people just sort of as a general health check up.

202
00:16:03,867 --> 00:16:09,189
What they'll do is they'll test your serum transparent saturation and

203
00:16:09,189 --> 00:16:14,261
really that's the ratio of serum iron to the iron binding capacity.

204
00:16:14,261 --> 00:16:17,211
So they'll test the iron in your blood and

205
00:16:17,211 --> 00:16:21,356
if it's normal then they won't take any further action.

206
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:26,666
But if it's abnormal, what they might do is test your HFE genotype.

207
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:31,954
And if you're C282Y then they can do more tests to look

208
00:16:31,954 --> 00:16:37,352
at your liver enzymes and your actual fair level,

209
00:16:37,352 --> 00:16:42,546
and if it's high they can do the therapeutic lobotomy.

210
00:16:42,546 --> 00:16:46,382
And if you're having other complications they can look for

211
00:16:46,382 --> 00:16:48,231
pathology related to that.

212
00:16:48,231 --> 00:16:53,905
And then if you're a compound hetero zygote then they're

213
00:16:53,905 --> 00:16:59,935
gonna just make sure that you don't have any other diseases.

214
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:00,764
And they may or

215
00:17:00,764 --> 00:17:04,717
may not do therapeutic lobotomy depending on if you have symptoms.

216
00:17:04,717 --> 00:17:07,960
And so we can discuss symptomatic and

217
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:12,360
asymptomatic testing and the testing approach.

218
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:18,338
And we can discuss whether testing the HFE genotype is a good idea for

219
00:17:18,338 --> 00:17:24,336
everyone in the population or just if you have an elevated iron level.
