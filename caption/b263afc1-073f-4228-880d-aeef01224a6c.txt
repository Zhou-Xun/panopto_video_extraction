1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,120
Then you're good. Now, what I will say here and this goes to what I was saying earlier, this is a lot of text.

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:13,440
Yes. Whereas I'll give you a concrete example here in this room right here.

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,720
Five year survival rate, that's over 13%.

4
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:25,120
That's picked up 44%. That's, again, the high levels in place.

5
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:34,600
Checking out really hard to scan increasing survival, five year survival rate, 1344.

6
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:45,700
And all the information is there. So some of these things are going to take more of this impact.

7
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:59,220
Think about breaking news. The point is, there's a lot of different things to separate that I think write it for or so.

8
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:19,340
So it's not just easy to read some of these things. I know I didn't like it in like my this and some of the things that about 19 somewhere.

9
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,379
I know it's like kind of yesterday all I had is write down like my like my audience.

10
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:41,950
So that's the kind of question this whole are you kidding?

11
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:57,820
Because if I got my first question as good, I think it might start talking about it.

12
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:02,530
You know that that's how I think about it.

13
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:06,760
I love it. It's it's like an hour.

14
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:21,180
Right. Well, I know, but maybe that's why you should be down there, and then I might have to share it, because it's not like.

15
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,680
It's not like it's not like in which case I can just put this on.

16
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:39,490
But again, that is because now it's just like, I'm like, looking at, like, free or.

17
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:51,549
But I think I usually when I should be like, do you think, oh, that's like, oh, I'm not sure how much these is having restriction.

18
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:58,730
And something about the restriction, if you have the same restrictions is probably a good idea to have on the table.

19
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:10,389
Like maybe not all that level. All that level. I like I talked about it here recently because you can't write something and

20
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:13,650
this is why this is an assignment like I'm not going to give you that answer.

21
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:23,010
That's what you got to wrestle with. So as you can tell, I'm already just sort of diving in and that's basically all we're doing.

22
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:34,470
I will be circulating and I put up on the board a set of ideas and a lot of discussion about how I will run through.

23
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:40,470
Now, keep running through them department. You'll have all of your options.

24
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:46,590
Hopefully you have narrowed this down to two options. If you are stuck with more than two options, let me talk to you now.

25
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:51,240
Let's try and make it simple. But a general thing is always, please think.

26
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:58,909
Listing all the options, including by not doing something that could be its own option.

27
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:03,440
And this is a key one.

28
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:10,430
Organize information of five dimensions. So dimensions are not one thing for risks.

29
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:19,610
If you've got headache and stroke, really the two different things that you should approach do not do the lumping thing for that unless you

30
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:25,340
are intentionally saying I'm going to lump all of these because they're essentially similar like major

31
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:34,100
surgical problems might be one thing because it's going to be really rare event but much much don't go the

32
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:40,970
pros can't route don't just dump a bunch of stuff into a single cell separate rows for individual things.

33
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,900
You got to have some quantitative risk information, but not always something that's going to always.

34
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:59,390
The severity. So we read papers that talked about, hey, maybe it's important to separate the mild things from the severe things.

35
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:05,040
It's about that. Experience.

36
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:09,570
What's going to be different in someone's life from one place to another?

37
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:20,600
Tradeoffs. So we've talked about sometimes it's useful to do the math for people to tell them what's different.

38
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:25,760
And let's see how we're going to show that lots of different things we see and do that.

39
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,450
I think about the reference class. Who is this for? What is this?

40
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:41,089
Not for me to be a statistic out of what population is that coming from, etc. All of these are judgment calls.

41
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:45,960
And the larger picture here is the big one, which is. More versus less.

42
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:52,380
Like the more you throw in, the bigger and more complicated, the less you throw in, the simpler it is.

43
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:57,540
All of this is a judgment call. I'm going to speculate a lot.

44
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:04,890
What I want you to do is to form small groups of like three or four people, share what you've done.

45
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:09,140
All of these services.

46
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:14,040
You're I'm going to call me over.

47
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:19,949
I'm going to be circulating. I am more than happy to give you advice, more than happy to answer questions.

48
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:23,040
And from time to time, I'm going to be sort of shouting out stuff to think about.

49
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:30,360
And then probably give people a workshop that I have no agenda, musings, etc.

50
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:38,250
The last thing which is not up here, but which is more broadly the very people in text.

51
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:50,730
As you've seen in the examples. We can do new job with a fairly simple but clear descriptor and just a little more information in itself.

52
00:06:51,510 --> 00:07:00,300
The number or three times a day or whatever kind of information is a tendency for people to throw lots of text into your table.

53
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:05,190
No idea that you need to fill it out, like take a page at the beginning.

54
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:11,460
Did you start that off the decision? Have a follow up page to explain stuff in greater detail.

55
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:17,730
Explain what that core table, just like, simplify it as much as possible.

56
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:24,960
Yeah, I know. That's a judgment call that was hard about this. So each.

57
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:32,339
So my idea is to keep thinking about group yourselves in groups two, three, four.

58
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:36,900
People start sharing stuff and I'm just going to be circulating all day.

59
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:41,010
Hey, I really want you right from the start.

60
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:53,770
Right. Just seen so far.

61
00:07:53,920 --> 00:08:00,220
And I'm like. That's my introduction.

62
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:08,920
I have nothing to hide. And I want to take a look at this.

63
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:18,780
And that is the question I have for the like.

64
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:25,600
There is nothing I think I should clarify.

65
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:43,270
And like a framework you can go medication or we can better make sure that this doesn't make it a little easier when people like you or something.

66
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,630
I don't know anything.

67
00:08:44,830 --> 00:09:02,380
I don't you know, I wish I was like yours at this point because it looks to me like a similar to what I would like, which I have my best.

68
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:09,879
Yeah. So there are, you know.

69
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:15,790
Oh and by the way, they are going to have a little tricky on doing that.

70
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:23,710
But basically you're not real negative.

71
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:31,480
You don't get better. That's often just like, you know, this is how it goes back surgery.

72
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:41,480
Like, I feel like everything else when you are you want to share or if you like.

73
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,810
Like that. Yeah.

74
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:53,700
So, like, this is much safer. Okay.

75
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:58,270
Yeah. With others, however, still struggling with this.

76
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:10,460
So your premiums are not as bad as chance that things get better or don't get better given a lack of education.

77
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:20,020
So it becomes a you have a lower chance, but you don't have the risks kind of trade off so that that becomes the way in which people are afraid.

78
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:25,540
So I kind of have it right now is like so on.

79
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:51,100
Yeah, I do like the situation. I mean, I don't know exactly how the industry as well, which is the right thing to do.

80
00:10:51,130 --> 00:11:12,840
And I like how you know that he or she had to take more responsibility for it because that's what I mean.

81
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:26,400
I like to think earlier when I like for example, the closet and I have no idea looks believable.

82
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:31,620
Text your defensive wrestling.

83
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:54,370
And when I felt like this and I was like yeah I think know just think that they find most

84
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:12,970
of the rest of the two options like one of the word vomit with for your job in their life.

85
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:41,190
And I think yeah it was because I mean so I knew I was like I have that I think in this case it might be like I literally was trying to imagine.

86
00:12:45,300 --> 00:13:04,580
I do want to say that I feel like if I say thank you for your listeners that

87
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:19,970
are of course it is like having never heard and it's happening looks like,

88
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:28,870
you know whatever that means you have nuclear power supply.

89
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:33,310
I didn't do get mine and I know what that's like.

90
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:43,690
I am like everything is like that.

91
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:55,340
And like I said, it's like you just can't even say this.

92
00:13:55,620 --> 00:14:03,670
I mean, yeah, yeah.

93
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:14,890
I don't know. I just didn't want this to happen.

94
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:35,460
So it's kind of like I think I didn't like the next one sometimes, but it just seems like it's,

95
00:14:36,020 --> 00:15:00,720
it's like I think we get departments like you're more like something like an or because it's just, you know what, I'm trying to get out very well.

96
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:09,500
I think it's the role of yourself less in general.

97
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,700
It's not about that.

98
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:50,010
So there's no other way like that, that which allows you to have something you don't want to like.

99
00:15:50,020 --> 00:16:15,390
I don't know what the [INAUDIBLE] was that we hear because they were killing people and that's I consider considerable out.

100
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,730
And they told me that yeah.

101
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:38,950
I mean I wouldn't have had the chance to have I had I, like I said,

102
00:16:38,950 --> 00:17:04,470
I really feel like that's really kind of to me it's probably what that doesn't sound like I want to say anything stupid already.

103
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:15,540
I think that allows people to explain about like they have or you know,

104
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:31,809
I would like to think about it and it's like really I think that it's really challenging, believe it or not.

105
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:41,680
And but it's like, I don't know.

106
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:51,290
Fairly confident. Really?

107
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:58,590
Yes. I mean, what's your take on this?

108
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:02,590
Yeah, I guess so.

109
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:06,870
You're right about that one.

110
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:15,680
Let's talk about this monster out here that it's like.

111
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:42,040
And then I'll tell you what I actually really felt like as long as I said, yeah, I guess what I'm doing, it was like, well, you know what?

112
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:50,570
I'm looking forward to hearing about it first.

113
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:03,220
A lot of everything.

114
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:11,380
Yeah, I think we all. First of all, I don't answer that.

115
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:26,310
Yeah. Yeah, I really like this.

116
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:35,120
I don't know. I guess what I'm.

117
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:41,150
You do? Yeah, I know.

118
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:53,700
I was like, I don't know how to, you know, but I think how to act.

119
00:19:54,680 --> 00:20:07,950
But maybe like my life, so maybe not with my friend or like whatever.

120
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:13,120
It could be a pretty good.

121
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:20,520
But I guess they like the idea that this is why I like I like I like that.

122
00:20:20,820 --> 00:21:08,100
Yeah. I can tell you how sorry I am that I'm going to show you what's your name and I just I just like you.

123
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:12,450
Just like the way you are right now.

124
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:34,650
There's nothing wrong with it. It was just like, you know, like I don't have any kind of sense of whether or not actually because like cousins.

125
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:51,930
So yeah, yeah, they are their own thing and I guess it looks like to me like I don't like that,

126
00:21:51,970 --> 00:22:42,480
but that's why I like you kind of like other that Madison you may have noticed pregnancy and consideration in back to you have you I been to.

127
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:54,880
Yeah. I would insist on an overall decision to go back and have surgery inside.

128
00:22:55,670 --> 00:23:05,080
Didn't I say this is going to happen like this?

129
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:25,430
You know, even like like your life it like a little bit like that.

130
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:30,350
That's what I think about that. My knees are not actually like that.

131
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:42,440
And I really feel like I'm sure that it was like, yeah, like what are you going to do with these?

132
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:49,160
Like you like, I mean, it's like a little bit. Yeah, but I think that's not always what I feel like.

133
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:54,050
You know, you need to be aware of that.

134
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:58,760
Yeah, I don't quite understand.

135
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:21,440
What I mean is if I was like, oh yeah, yeah, this is I feel like I mean, there's the same numbers like the whole thing goes to just like, why not?

136
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:32,070
Just like, I feel like I need to see.

137
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:39,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

138
00:24:39,740 --> 00:25:00,410
I mean, I think they are like, so often.

139
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:07,690
So I like being on my computer.

140
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:17,150
Like, what about sexual assault for myself?

141
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:25,840
I'd like, yeah, oh, yeah.

142
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,299
I mean, so it can be.

143
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:50,160
I remember I talk about what you might call that like I'm not complaining and it's kind of like a small talk with your mind is really just like,

144
00:25:50,210 --> 00:26:09,120
I just wish we could risk chemical interactions to find out what it's like for other people.

145
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:16,540
So you might have what do you roll and then put everything into its own space?

146
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:31,490
For me to think about it, you probably like other options, like somebody who can do the right thing because so many other ideas.

147
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:45,820
And that's kind of the main thing that if you're out, whatever it is,

148
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:54,260
I'm sure other things are reminded that in terms of the way people would have a single one day procedure table,

149
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:59,629
I really like this area with the tax code.

150
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:20,450
I think it's going to be like this with you in my side, which is the procedure in the receiving this as a result of what I felt like.

151
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:27,880
I don't know.

152
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,790
I was at first there was no no.

153
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:40,610
It's like if you are having that I was like, yeah, I didn't know what to do and how to get some ideas on maybe treatment.

154
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:45,980
Yeah. Maybe. Like to have them. I'm just wondering.

155
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:52,999
I'm trying to acknowledge, like I said, you have like an urgency.

156
00:27:53,000 --> 00:28:01,940
Look at those two methods. I was going in terms of, you know, like it like a confirmation.

157
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:09,310
And I was like I was pregnant with about 20 million.

158
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:19,190
And I'm thinking about how to change this. I'm not sure it's exactly so, but I think things like like benefits and then like side effects,

159
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:36,890
like I would like you submit your thoughts and this is why I do like this is going to be on the same page.

160
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:52,780
Oh, so this is like risk management is like, you know about do you know like about this option?

161
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:59,730
It's like if you want to get out of the market.

162
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:11,460
That's right now is you know, philosophy only an animal and I also have yeah.

163
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:15,980
I guess you're like somebody you have a lot of. Yeah, yeah.

164
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:20,659
You know, I don't do that. I like that.

165
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:33,440
You know, it's like, oh, I just just like, maybe see that it was like right after I left originally.

166
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:52,880
Like, it's like, oh, I was like, I'll just call it like, I know exactly like I felt like I sounded like a back story that's there,

167
00:29:53,420 --> 00:30:11,510
but I don't know, I just I was like, I plan on like the answers were inspired by the fundamental differences on the arrow down.

168
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:23,870
So much so that statement is all about like, I guess,

169
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:41,839
like the fact that so many people have like shared things like they only had reason to be I mean,

170
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:48,440
part of, part of what you're doing and I know nothing about changing your word on your resume.

171
00:30:49,080 --> 00:31:07,639
That's not really relevant. Yeah. Yeah, like, I don't you know, that's because I think now that I, you know, I mean, I was like before, you know,

172
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:29,030
like, I can't say I do this for a while and then after that, then I would have things like, how do you know?

173
00:31:29,030 --> 00:32:05,970
Like education probably already. So that's why I was like, we all I had to go up there and I really have to have like that was so.

174
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:23,790
So it's like I just feel like it's not like the impression that you may feel like it's like, oh, I have whatever was not expected.

175
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:31,969
It's not my field day forward in my life and that that doesn't kill it.

176
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:41,470
So that's what you feel for how it can go the other way.

177
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:53,209
Maybe you could add one. Every measure doesn't seem obvious to us, or three often so similar.

178
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:59,300
But like I said, it's going to be. I feel like I be like what this is like.

179
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:17,240
Oh, you said you'll simplify things like if you're at the end of your document and starting to.

180
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:33,440
The department says this had provided a range of light so we can use it because I don't think the problem right here.

181
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:47,690
But it's just I think it's just so the caveat being people who are facing the right and take longer to recover,

182
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:52,070
if you want to know what that might mean, especially when it gets.

183
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:57,310
I think it's I think it's important to me in a way.

184
00:33:57,590 --> 00:34:00,800
So you're basically say you're going to be on the lower level? I'm not sure.

185
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:04,400
I mean, I don't really think it is. And this is, again, a little over simple.

186
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:08,840
Notice that you're not out of control or any of this.

187
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:13,630
Oh, sorry, I forgot to change that. So I was like, I was doing that.

188
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:30,620
So what I knew I have a lot of work to do.

189
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:41,540
So I guess I was just I just take out for myself that I did everything.

190
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:46,850
I don't think they should do it. All right, well, you have a way.

191
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:52,429
So once people are defined as like having a major coronavirus was they can I can't go back again.

192
00:34:52,430 --> 00:35:02,470
It's really just surgery. So you may then want to know what you're really like.

193
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:17,870
Yeah, I like that. Makes you realize that young people are different.

194
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:26,480
That's completely you. There's only one vote for the ones that made it seem like one because.

195
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:32,250
So I don't I don't know the whole thing.

196
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:39,860
That is the same reason why no one else had to go.

197
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:47,240
And that's why I think that makes sense with the table.

198
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:54,720
And I know she was just trying to get out of here.

199
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:01,200
What does that encourage people to participate?

200
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:05,860
And I was actually I don't know.

201
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:14,210
I, I know that my whole life isn't like that.

202
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:21,630
You wanted to have no confirmation,

203
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:35,300
but I think it's hard for people to abstractly that they arrested more than 105 hundred that means be out of 100 and have no potential.

204
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:43,860
Yeah, I know that's an unusual line, but I think it like doing the math is better than that.

205
00:36:44,120 --> 00:37:09,230
I don't know how you did that last night like that one category first or not at all for one that is something that the pilot both boxes.

206
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:14,180
Oh. Oh, [INAUDIBLE].

207
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:21,910
Lucky for you then you can later on. But I struggle with this.

208
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:25,670
Yesterday I was like I was like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

209
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:53,880
You know, I think I feel like a lot of stories, but these are maybe like mentioned like, I guess like eating or, you know, what are those?

210
00:37:54,810 --> 00:38:06,160
So I don't like that's all I ask. Is there something like that?

211
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:15,910
Right. Yeah, I think it's just something I usually after.

212
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:22,740
I think that is true. That's true. I don't know.

213
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,280
I was really impressed with all of you.

214
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:30,180
I just I don't know. That's why I said let's just.

215
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:44,610
I don't I really like your right about like I would just say the same thing that they were because, well, not only an example of what I said.

216
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:47,880
Like, I don't know where they are though.

217
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:56,110
Yeah. Like in Kansas, but I just know, like that one reading about all of that.

218
00:38:56,370 --> 00:39:11,100
Yeah. Yeah. And so I don't I don't want that to happen.

219
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:17,310
Like, I should've done one where I could just had one already. So that was, like, any other way.

220
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:28,360
As Australians. In many cases, I don't know anything about like eight people.

221
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:35,140
Yeah, it wasn't mentioned. I don't think that can hurt.

222
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:42,400
I mean, I just believe that was absolutely necessary.

223
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:52,660
Yeah, I don't. I don't think. I don't even know where to begin to know why all of these risks.

224
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:57,570
Okay, so look into all the surgery options. It would be more of an approach.

225
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:03,570
Yeah, but would that be it seem like we're 25?

226
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:09,700
As much as I could. Yes, I would.

227
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:18,760
So we're trading off the essentially creating a default is to support new options like tantalum,

228
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:31,720
which is the consumer device or more hospitals or whatever.

229
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:38,920
Yeah. Yeah. Less people into, like, higher education.

230
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:46,790
Like, I don't know.

231
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:53,270
Another way to think about this are very true.

232
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:58,630
Like, I don't know what happened.

233
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:03,070
So I think it's fine to provide people authority over here.

234
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:06,910
So the mystery has more.

235
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:14,169
I guess I should take out a paragraph about I was less green.

236
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:17,319
Maybe it was subjective.

237
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:25,880
Like, maybe like it was like, okay, maybe I have, you know, periods important to me and like I would say all that one,

238
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:41,210
you're all going over to all these things and like it might be like a very negative or positive, positive or negative side effect.

239
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:48,820
Oh, well, I mean, that's an interesting thing.

240
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,930
So you're really looking at that?

241
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:58,490
Well, I think it's, um, and as long as you're not hearing about it so that it's not just like general period information.

242
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:02,100
That's really again, I don't worry less about the wording.

243
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:10,059
You're more about clarity of just how much information like I've seen ones with arrows here.

244
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:16,150
I've seen one where they put the language from another dimension.

245
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:24,940
Yeah, we're not expecting any information unless possibly.

246
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:35,470
Remember, it's like sort of like eliminating this column in general and like incorporating the different again,

247
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:42,910
I'm not going to sit here one way or another would be one way to go at this is the setting of one versus the other.

248
00:42:42,910 --> 00:43:05,910
So the point is fair and I would say younger more versus like all the time that you might be able to go further and step away from something else.

249
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:14,930
Well. You better find her.

250
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:19,040
Oh, I see. It's perfectly safe. Except for the Prime Minister.

251
00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:24,200
It could be worse. You tried this once or twice.

252
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:33,540
For three years. Plus 5.6.

253
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:38,750
Six years short term. This is what's what bothers me is the mix.

254
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:43,340
So you've got normal mobile or digital media, and then you've got a future here.

255
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:50,750
Why are you doing this with her? You know, I think my life is better here.

256
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:54,500
Come on, let's use the critical pieces.

257
00:43:57,470 --> 00:44:15,720
Oh, well, no. I was using surgical nurses, and it was in the background that everyone was so busy that I was like, you remember?

258
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:19,460
Yeah. Yeah.

259
00:44:22,070 --> 00:44:25,380
So much of a symbol.

260
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:29,809
I thought of what happens if I were to do that?

261
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:39,780
Would I know what it is that what women have to see?

262
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:52,170
Well, that's a good point. Death is unnecessary. This explains a lot of my thinking about my interventions to too good for that intimate ceremony.

263
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:58,250
I got through those designs and my girls like.

264
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:14,220
But then I was like, I just got some headaches. So my problem is and I like to think about my parents, not great things that are out there.

265
00:45:15,070 --> 00:45:19,090
Why is it that severe side effects or major side effects?

266
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:24,450
We're talking about like class or like.

267
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:30,190
Yeah. And what that is from this and really like out.

268
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:32,679
Yeah.

269
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:41,860
Well, severe is like remember the point here is that we're concerned about that argument dilution effects where I've got so many different things,

270
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:54,130
I'm not actually paying attention to the severe pain. Okay. You know, I was trying to learn something straight.

271
00:45:55,100 --> 00:46:08,330
And do you like this newspaper where you're then like,

272
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:18,459
it's really an argument for which I think because what you're really doing by separating the facts were just looking at those points so I can see it.

273
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:46,690
Although I think separating like an actor, oh, I think if I think about the word but you know, you're just like, oh, okay, yeah, I'm getting my notes.

274
00:46:46,690 --> 00:46:53,950
And I was like, Oh my God. It seems like, like we stuck together, you know?

275
00:46:54,550 --> 00:47:08,920
And even though I think we all do the numbers, okay, typically we'll probably start as a way to do this.

276
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:12,090
I think it was maybe two actually worked out.

277
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:28,209
Yeah, that's what I'm doing. And she was telling me this is the same conversation I just haven't seen more so than when you had your alternating.

278
00:47:28,210 --> 00:47:32,230
Which one on the table here. Yeah. Which is really confusing.

279
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:37,420
I do not know this. Do you see, like last couple of different things?

280
00:47:37,570 --> 00:47:50,530
Not a bad way. In a good way. Be lazy either because it's like you don't choose the surgery or that it might not work.

281
00:47:54,740 --> 00:48:04,000
Yeah. I just have to ask you, what's it like to show you where I was, which is a good thing?

282
00:48:04,230 --> 00:48:13,870
Yeah, cause I just think it's necessary.

283
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:26,880
The information. Yeah, I would say.

284
00:48:27,310 --> 00:48:37,690
I would say you have to share this place.

285
00:48:41,110 --> 00:48:51,520
Like, I actually see how much it is. You know, I'm not all the same.

286
00:48:51,790 --> 00:49:13,780
I didn't ask you this because, you know, compared to other things, otherwise, it's like, you know, it's like, yeah, star, I don't have a table.

287
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:19,690
Thank you so much as I think it's like it's kind of medical.

288
00:49:20,410 --> 00:49:35,070
So I just felt like I was going to really focus like, I know, gonna tell, you know?

289
00:49:35,830 --> 00:49:50,540
So maybe I'm like, Oh, this is just a few days later, I'm inside it back.

290
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:54,550
Like, you know what it's like?

291
00:49:54,610 --> 00:49:58,400
No, it's not like the difference between the sexes.

292
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:03,610
Yeah. Something like four different theories.

293
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:23,010
And then another description of religious values to say, I really look at myself and I think you've been to somebody.

294
00:50:23,410 --> 00:50:27,740
You should have that if you are interested in that. Yeah, I think I think you're right.

295
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:30,820
I know what I mean. I'm waiting to see that early.

296
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:35,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

297
00:50:36,710 --> 00:51:00,670
I think what I think what I, what I wanted to know what do you think that it was a good way to respond to it was like.

298
00:51:00,670 --> 00:51:08,150
Well, what I always tell people for like this, like they don't want answers.

299
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:24,520
I know they're allowed to like I was like, oh my God, I can't have it pretty short.

300
00:51:24,610 --> 00:51:27,790
I think I remember us talking about that.

301
00:51:27,790 --> 00:51:31,149
I do do what I would do.

302
00:51:31,150 --> 00:51:37,620
It's just like I was like, you know, what is the time to air like?

303
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:46,220
And then they're like, you're like, Oh, no, no, no, no.

304
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:55,570
They're like, okay, yeah. I got something like we had the one end of the spectrum, which is the president is not going away.

305
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:11,290
Yeah, I think that's why you have started getting your friends and I go somewhere else, like,

306
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:26,290
because it's like a couple months ago and I like like that like this to that take hold, think about that.

307
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:36,820
And it comes back and doctor says you have a twin like a to their operations.

308
00:52:40,870 --> 00:52:51,310
Yeah. That's one of the questions when you really have to push.

309
00:52:51,520 --> 00:53:09,759
But I mean I lost six points as much information as I feel like I okay you know you're such a little better you it I don't know.

310
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:18,790
Like, I just. I just feel like it's broken, really.

311
00:53:19,570 --> 00:53:22,780
I was worried about, like.

312
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:26,800
I felt like st. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

313
00:53:27,130 --> 00:53:31,560
I think so. Too much again.

314
00:53:31,990 --> 00:53:35,980
Too much. I like it.

315
00:53:36,330 --> 00:53:44,420
But it's also a bit of silence, so I don't know, I,

316
00:53:45,350 --> 00:54:00,000
I do that because clearly the message that I'm getting in all are doing because Washington synthesizes things.

317
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:04,030
But I think that that should be more than that.

318
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:11,270
You know, they're like, well, that's good.

319
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:22,830
I think that's part of the diversity in place.

320
00:54:23,890 --> 00:54:31,270
Like, Oh yeah, before the crisis for the things that we're not pretending like.

321
00:54:31,270 --> 00:54:38,370
At some point I just want somebody to get some money.

322
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:47,980
This. And finally, it was very interesting.

323
00:54:48,780 --> 00:55:01,480
I did not answer all of those questions on that question, and I was like, Keep on fighting.

324
00:55:02,310 --> 00:55:15,630
So if you look at me like, you're like, oh, my lifestyle medication or anything either that I probably wouldn't do that.

325
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:29,760
And I think people like things like the thunder, the word or that word for the good of the sport.

326
00:55:30,050 --> 00:55:49,080
I think what would happen is that the antibody levels and that's like what we're talking about,

327
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:57,750
50% more than finding somebody that you really think that it's true.

328
00:55:57,810 --> 00:56:08,360
It's like, you know, someone that is suffering. And I think that might not be the progression.

329
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:14,150
Also, different studies like believe that it's just it's just looking at the progression.

330
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:19,230
If you went out there with those. Yeah.

331
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:32,240
Oh yeah. I think this might seem like something like it's not a solution.

332
00:56:32,850 --> 00:56:36,280
That's true. That's like. I think that's a possibility.

333
00:56:36,490 --> 00:56:41,060
Yeah. You're not going to say, oh, no, it's not terminal.

334
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:51,790
They'll say, you know, you're you're using that as a good outcome.

335
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:58,560
You know, that's what I want to know.

336
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:29,520
But I think it's something like this. One time I was a baseball player and so I was just to think that you always hear all the other stuff like that.

337
00:57:29,610 --> 00:57:41,640
Also in between me and I wasn't going to give it to him in his left.

338
00:57:44,590 --> 00:57:52,040
Right. And you know, we already know these things, right?

339
00:57:52,430 --> 00:57:57,560
Yeah, that's great.

340
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:03,550
I know. Yes. Okay, good.

341
00:58:04,170 --> 00:58:08,510
It is. It has to be if you are going somewhere else.

342
00:58:08,550 --> 00:58:20,370
I'm just not interested in that idea as being something like.

343
00:58:25,410 --> 00:58:34,920
But basically, I was like, I really want to do something like that.

344
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:40,140
So that's what I was going to ask is like. So I think it could all directly right now.

345
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:57,180
So there is something, I guess it's like I'm kind of your second language, for example.

346
00:58:57,450 --> 00:59:00,479
These are all things that there's more jokes.

347
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:08,549
It's like, so great to have that because yes, these are all working together.

348
00:59:08,550 --> 00:59:21,090
All of these are quite well organized around one person is quite satisfied.

349
00:59:21,510 --> 00:59:26,780
I like similar ideas and I'm probably very I definitely am going to lifestyle changes

350
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:31,920
around me like more like that example I would just say like people experience.

351
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:46,020
Oh yeah. Patients avoid the side effects to their impact daily, but it's just something like people's lives.

352
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:57,240
But it was different because I feel like, why are these.

353
00:59:58,020 --> 01:00:01,710
Well, these separate out. I guess I supported them out because these are you.

354
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:08,669
People are necessary for that sort of suffering like necessity,

355
01:00:08,670 --> 01:00:16,160
which you could have instead of surgical storms that might have major things that might happen, or at least some people having something else.

356
01:00:16,170 --> 01:00:30,150
Whereas if anything else, what if I think that's like immediate following this idea that there's hope about the Philippines?

357
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:37,840
I have no doubt that it is, because I know that all of us will be with us.

358
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:51,540
And then like anything else, and increasingly tonight, it's more it's more like just a game of one night.

359
01:00:53,430 --> 01:01:05,300
I really think look at their quality of participation in this space.

360
01:01:05,330 --> 01:01:13,110
We're just waiting to hear more about the plain language patient experience that's about to come first.

361
01:01:13,230 --> 01:01:16,640
Organizing. I would organize with the family.

362
01:01:16,710 --> 01:01:20,780
I have a friend who did something like Texas.

363
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:25,860
What do you think about what's happening in Europe?

364
01:01:26,790 --> 01:01:37,199
Maybe on the table. But you have to just like now is immediately on like how many people do they feel out of the average,

365
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:41,340
the average price of gasoline and diesel production.

366
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:52,620
Once they get lot of what's in terms of quality and that is.

367
01:01:53,010 --> 01:02:04,350
Yeah, I guess so. So I think the first to make it seem like a place, that's one thing.

368
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:14,790
I mean, it's it's sort of like they have a lot of interesting stuff and I feel like we just were totally wrong.

369
01:02:15,460 --> 01:02:29,290
Okay, sorry. It's almost like do I think also I hear the competition for this type of competition here.

370
01:02:29,970 --> 01:02:34,490
How do you have another way of saying like you could have the role of negotiating competition?

371
01:02:34,590 --> 01:02:43,460
Like what I was thinking when I was a little kid, I was this morning stuff that I did somewhere else.

372
01:02:43,850 --> 01:02:53,010
I have especially for things like conversations like you should have you planning this one for years.

373
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:57,890
So that's why you're right.

374
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:03,720
It maybe it's an idea as an action.

375
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:22,890
So I think when I think a lot of and and what are these kinds of just like that's what I was trying to connect with the cosmos different

376
01:03:22,890 --> 01:04:13,760
places that I probably shouldn't be or they normally you you don't know which ones and that it's a trade off in less than 145 or 6500 tables.

377
01:04:13,770 --> 01:04:20,150
I don't want to do it or not, but I think it's okay to go before I would listen.

378
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:27,990
I think of the trip. I think it was in Springfield that I used the places that were going.

379
01:04:28,590 --> 01:04:37,440
I don't know how, like the way I think people are trying to make a separate statement.

380
01:04:39,260 --> 01:04:46,150
So but I think it's I think it's just that's really cool.

381
01:04:46,170 --> 01:05:01,800
And what happens if you don't do it between him and his grandmother or if you're not happening or something like that in your.

382
01:05:02,390 --> 01:05:04,050
I wouldn't put it in your table.

383
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:30,080
I want you to decide if I don't have the ability to change the terms of what they look like after all the house releases.

384
01:05:30,390 --> 01:05:34,440
These are what these were all directly. Yeah.

385
01:05:34,750 --> 01:05:40,400
Okay. There are some angles. Okay, I get it.

386
01:05:40,410 --> 01:05:47,730
Not to tee it up. And I didn't mention that we're talking about.

387
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:56,400
It's fine. It's about like my father was a really important point in my life.

388
01:05:56,430 --> 01:06:00,600
What is the relevance of.

389
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:06,470
Oh, I don't really get that.

390
01:06:07,050 --> 01:06:15,610
I was thinking about it. Yeah, it was just like there was a 5%.

391
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:25,950
If you say I don't want a tight end like this and that's what it's about.

392
01:06:26,430 --> 01:06:36,870
Honestly, on everything that we have, certainly there is no question about that.

393
01:06:38,310 --> 01:06:50,610
So I think the concern is, well, what is it like?

394
01:06:51,870 --> 01:06:57,600
I mean, do you have any given the never even give it to you?

395
01:06:57,870 --> 01:07:05,849
What if I was like, again, the Jacksons? What would you measure so rare that I wonder if I should just say there aren't major

396
01:07:05,850 --> 01:07:13,950
complications like it would be some involved in my whole life and production.

397
01:07:13,950 --> 01:07:23,660
Right. So think about that ability or even when you are actually going to find that second surgery.

398
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:29,940
That's really purely for the surgery operations where you're comparing two different teams.

399
01:07:30,060 --> 01:07:34,010
I'm looking at the surgery versus the surgery or something.

400
01:07:34,540 --> 01:07:38,120
Yeah, I know. It's like it's a tough call, a great idea to answer that.

401
01:07:38,130 --> 01:07:41,610
Some side effects might. I don't exist.

402
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:48,230
Yeah. So that's question. But the funny part is like this one go either way.

403
01:07:48,810 --> 01:07:51,810
Yeah, I got it.

404
01:07:52,470 --> 01:07:56,670
Idea that you guys work.

405
01:07:56,730 --> 01:08:02,550
It's still extremely well established from all the things in life, even at the table.

406
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:14,780
What if you took out your area? But now you have something that really wasn't your cancer?

407
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:22,320
That maybe that's a very short term organization.

408
01:08:22,350 --> 01:08:31,340
What it sounds like. I just think I've got a conveyor belt.

409
01:08:31,830 --> 01:08:34,410
Yeah. And then I'm going to explain a lot as well.

410
01:08:35,370 --> 01:08:54,480
And then I think the only difference is that one of the billion clinical trials, I don't think it's like that.

411
01:08:56,700 --> 01:09:07,860
I don't like the idea that you don't have that kind of money.

412
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:40,980
And that's what got pregnant at the time because was something like, Oh my God, you're my only half your family is not.

413
01:09:40,980 --> 01:10:00,990
That was that was not one of the things that I don't know why there just has to be something like oh I've heard from the guys that are horrible like.

414
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:13,320
You know, it's almost me.

415
01:10:15,870 --> 01:10:28,110
Like. It's like, you know, strategies to come across.

416
01:10:28,710 --> 01:10:33,550
Yeah. I think about your girl.

417
01:10:33,750 --> 01:10:42,280
I mean, I. Like I said, it's not real.

418
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:50,190
It's not as easy as I thought.

419
01:10:50,820 --> 01:11:03,720
It was like, yeah, I would say you're also not like, would you want to have like a bigger, like category?

420
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:15,510
I mean, do you think it's going to come to pass?

421
01:11:20,580 --> 01:11:28,290
But I don't. Yeah, it's like, yeah. So what is the scope of this in employment?

422
01:11:28,290 --> 01:11:32,220
I mean, you have to have like you have to get more than one.

423
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:37,740
I feel like I wish I feel like I'm not sure.

424
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:51,540
Yeah, I don't think I am. Definitely. Some of these days it's like it's like, oh my God.

425
01:11:52,350 --> 01:11:58,319
Yeah. But like, for like and there's like, you've had a baby.

426
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:03,810
So what about like, you know, like, there's no third without like it's not like.

427
01:12:05,610 --> 01:12:14,520
I don't think it's. I think it's just like going on.

428
01:12:15,210 --> 01:12:22,630
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

429
01:12:22,630 --> 01:12:25,830
So have you had a guy like. And food?

430
01:12:25,980 --> 01:12:29,550
Yeah, it has. It has all the kids. Just like.

431
01:12:29,660 --> 01:12:35,100
Like things are tied around because they have a thing.

432
01:12:36,030 --> 01:12:38,850
And that's just something. I just.

433
01:12:40,980 --> 01:13:04,290
I just need an idea that really old they're on their so all in all those years, like there's a genetic mutation that she was missing.

434
01:13:04,290 --> 01:13:25,649
And I'm sure, you know, I would definitely be anything I'm going to notice about side effects in theory.

435
01:13:25,650 --> 01:13:28,710
They get this like somebody had a lot of other things.

436
01:13:28,740 --> 01:13:42,210
And so I think something like this is like side effects in ways to not make it.

437
01:13:43,350 --> 01:13:47,420
But yeah. Like for me and. I think it's somebody number one.

438
01:13:47,470 --> 01:13:53,030
I know. Yeah. And they were all volunteering.

439
01:13:53,690 --> 01:13:56,730
I think you're adding something.

440
01:14:02,110 --> 01:14:07,590
Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

441
01:14:08,460 --> 01:14:24,260
Not like some of these things, but it felt like an intelligent one is going to be.

442
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:30,610
The hardest thing to distinguish are times when the warm waters are increasing like that.

443
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:45,280
That's one of the things that I didn't know that for sure or not in high school.

444
01:14:47,310 --> 01:14:53,750
But I haven't heard anything like that.

445
01:14:56,760 --> 01:15:09,450
That doesn't mean that you don't get to say okay or not even apply.

446
01:15:09,780 --> 01:15:15,200
I know. Okay. All right.

447
01:15:16,180 --> 01:15:30,820
We want to help anyone clearly understand that there are different models because it's just something that I like very much.

448
01:15:31,050 --> 01:15:43,650
I'm doing something that's obviously related for every 5 minutes.

449
01:15:43,660 --> 01:15:48,240
LAUGHTER Celebrating Object Class Just for one second.

450
01:15:48,510 --> 01:15:54,180
The last thing I want to say, just to remind everybody, I had lots of conversations about more versus less information.

451
01:15:55,380 --> 01:15:59,459
Minimizing wording is good. Remember, you can pop stuff out of the table.

452
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:05,040
Like, if you want to explain how bad headaches we're talking about, you can have a little section outside of the table.

453
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:08,910
But not everything has to be on the table. But.

454
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:15,270
The theme of really clarifying comparisons have come up over and over again.

455
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:22,290
Like you want to be as clear as possible for this benefit, for this red square on this dimension.

456
01:16:22,890 --> 01:16:25,230
How do these two options compare to each other?

457
01:16:27,210 --> 01:16:32,070
Sometimes I've been talking with people about wording, like if you're doing the math for people and saying more here or less here.

458
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:38,430
Do it in a consistent way so that you don't get confused about okay, more than which one is bigger here.

459
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:44,690
Like that needs to be super transparent. There's lots of different ways to do this.

460
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:50,690
That's fine. Depends on a lot of what your position is at the table can be long.

461
01:16:50,780 --> 01:16:57,110
The table can be shorter. That's a choice you're making. That's okay to always just sort of ask yourself, what's the patient need?

462
01:16:57,710 --> 01:17:01,640
Like, are they going what do they need this information in order to understand what the trade off is?

463
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:04,700
That's the key thing I'm going to keep circulating.

464
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:12,530
If you're basically done, you can head out if you need to and do a free shipping email if something comes up as you continue to work on it.

465
01:17:13,370 --> 01:17:17,160
All right. Yeah.

466
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:30,389
I mean, it was like starting off.

467
01:17:30,390 --> 01:17:46,670
So this is like, yeah, this is kind of, you know, what you're gonna do.

468
01:17:48,260 --> 01:18:08,640
So and so I guess it's so obvious in terms of any response period like this, you know, the first time that you are able to do something like that.

469
01:18:08,770 --> 01:18:20,730
Otherwise I think I mean you guys at that time.

470
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:30,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

471
01:18:32,020 --> 01:18:45,090
And also I think it's not because, as I said, although not immediately, the answer is the answer is they're not the same.

472
01:18:45,100 --> 01:18:51,010
But I knew something about this. But can you show me the definition for that again?

473
01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:56,500
You don't have to be easier to recent research like they have.

474
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:09,579
The only things that are different from the owner to get over with this place it or whatever is you put

475
01:19:09,580 --> 01:19:17,740
something in your phone or we can tell it's the same thing over and over to do that to make more time.

476
01:19:17,890 --> 01:19:41,290
Yes. So I think in this stuff, I would know what it was like to think that a lot of we've got a lot of questions like, why does this matter?

477
01:19:41,690 --> 01:19:55,240
Like, what do I spend over here? Well, for me, but, you know, I have a lot of regrets why we have the difference.

478
01:19:56,310 --> 01:20:03,050
What is this? I know what it's like to criticize.

479
01:20:03,390 --> 01:20:06,610
It would just be like so it's not available in your pocket.

480
01:20:07,210 --> 01:20:16,480
So you just have to like. Part of the core problem here is the evolution of what it was doing.

481
01:20:17,090 --> 01:20:39,400
That we don't have the weaknesses. Yeah, well, and also it just means, like said is I don't what you're thinking.

482
01:20:39,430 --> 01:21:05,470
He made it work. And I'm like, I guess I'm not sure you're not in the 70 seconds and 90 seconds and other stuff working out.

483
01:21:05,650 --> 01:21:28,090
So then I got to know how I would like to have it on Monday, but how right it's going to be,

484
01:21:28,870 --> 01:21:38,799
especially a touchdown my year, like I actually make it last week.

485
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:58,170
It's like I love it totally, mind you often times that yeah, but we're also going to be a better balance.

486
01:21:58,180 --> 01:22:14,890
I feel like if there was sort of a government that and then also like I would like to answer this question.

487
01:22:16,100 --> 01:22:24,570
Yes, I want you to of like the one of the topics.

488
01:22:24,580 --> 01:22:31,250
And I was like, well, I don't even know how to get into the top of a dimension.

489
01:22:33,970 --> 01:22:47,650
I love how he's like like I'd like to see what they like to see that they're doing.

490
01:22:51,190 --> 01:22:55,990
What's myself the best way to be?

491
01:22:56,430 --> 01:23:00,790
Okay, think about the mental disorders.

492
01:23:02,260 --> 01:23:14,070
And you would think that wouldn't be something he had, like, you know, 3 hours before we get to that.

493
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:21,940
So I guess it's not right for sure.

494
01:23:22,310 --> 01:23:26,590
Then why? What is really driving that in my life?

495
01:23:27,820 --> 01:23:31,150
Yeah. And then what are you going to do? Anything.

496
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:37,550
Yeah, I think I have to sort of like that.

497
01:23:37,970 --> 01:23:43,350
And then I just want to know what's really what's either or.

498
01:23:48,170 --> 01:23:52,190
Yeah, yeah, me too. Me too.

499
01:23:54,390 --> 01:23:58,580
And that's how it's supposed to look.

500
01:23:58,640 --> 01:24:02,450
It's going with the choices. Yeah, but you don't know why you're having an IUD.

501
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:06,930
Because you assume everybody. You already have the size of your hand that I.

502
01:24:07,340 --> 01:24:15,380
Yeah. Okay. That dimension, that dimensionality is the critical piece of this stuff.

503
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:20,040
And you pulled out. That's not part of the table necessarily. That's part of the description.

504
01:24:21,660 --> 01:24:25,170
What we need to highlight is the differences in the effectiveness,

505
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:30,750
the differences in side effects, the differences in experience like duration, things like that.

506
01:24:30,820 --> 01:24:35,430
Yeah, like these. This can also be separated a little more out of these things to get broken out.

507
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:44,429
Okay. So. Now the short term pain that might be something you would put in the table because you're basically saying, no,

508
01:24:44,430 --> 01:24:50,880
there's no difference in the short term experience of putting in one of these types of activity versus another find that's relevant.

509
01:24:51,180 --> 01:24:56,400
Right. You could imagine somebody thinking that one would be different in terms of their short term experiences.

510
01:24:56,770 --> 01:24:58,564
Happens to be not the case here, but.
