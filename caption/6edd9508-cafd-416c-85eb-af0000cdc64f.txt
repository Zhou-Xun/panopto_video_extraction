1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:13,950
Monday afternoon. I played yesterday, I spoke to Michael Jackson on things like this one, saying,

2
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:44,330
at the end of the day, I don't think you should be able to just give up on the current season.

3
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:50,820
Okay. This is crazy about you.

4
00:00:50,820 --> 00:01:12,870
And you said to me, I'm really happy you're going to do this.

5
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:21,750
So I know that you know it's your fault.

6
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,620
Yeah, right. Right.

7
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:36,450
Let's put this away so that you have paper IV paper presentations between September and October.

8
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:42,930
All those papers are now available. So this is the third day of your presentation.

9
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:52,860
So if you're doing the sugar tax on the 21st, they'll be the first one to see those two articles right after the student presentation on sugar tax.

10
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:59,130
So everything is up through October.

11
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,130
Example On the first day we have three presentations.

12
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:15,269
So the market, I can only mention of that markets that these three papers or websites here student presentation

13
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:20,520
on price transparency there are a bunch of short ones in here not travel guilty of

14
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:25,400
health care services on one article but that's sort of a longer more involved article Tokyo

15
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:32,700
three or four to do they're very short and all like one or two slightly larger articles.

16
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,830
So it's kind of evened out now, but they're all on through the end of October.

17
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:46,860
Those of you have presentations after that. If you really, really, really want to see the papers now, let me know otherwise and get a lot of weeks.

18
00:02:55,540 --> 00:03:00,640
All right. So we thought last week of us or why people give to charity.

19
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:09,219
And we asked whether that Canadians are voluntarily giving up some of your resources rather than using them for sort of a narrow,

20
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:13,570
selfish purpose, contradicted the idea of utility maximization.

21
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:20,710
And we argued that, well, maybe it doesn't, because it actually sort of reinforces the idea of decision making at the margin.

22
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:27,010
We concluded, really, none of us have given up or given our red money to charity, and that because of that,

23
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:34,390
it's more once we've paid our rent and bought our groceries, then we decided to go to a movie or are we going to donate to a cause that we care about?

24
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,650
So that was really a demonstration of decision making at the margin.

25
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:45,940
Another thing that might have struck you as we were going through this sort of simple microeconomic theory of your neighbor,

26
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:49,810
is the assumption that you're always like exactly on your budget constraint?

27
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:59,410
Now, how many of you this month expect to spend exactly the amount of money that you buy in this month's money,

28
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:04,240
and whether through work or through student loans or any other source you're looking at,

29
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:09,930
these actually all have budget constraints on the United States.

30
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:17,790
So how do we reconcile that with the model we have that says, well, the utility maximizing bundle is going to be on the budget constraints?

31
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:24,420
We draw constraint budget constraints. Like, here's my budget constraint for these goods.

32
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:30,540
So basically, it's going to take a certain amount of money that I'm going to use for groceries,

33
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,400
and then I'm going to allocate that between vegetables and fruit and cereal.

34
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:38,700
Yeah. Yeah. So it's sort of a sub maximization problem.

35
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:46,110
It's not your grand utility maximization over everything you buy, but it's like, okay, I've got a budget of $100 a week for groceries.

36
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:52,380
And then I go to the store and I say, How am I going to spend my $100, $100 and all the money you have?

37
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:56,850
That's entirely plausible. You know, first you sort of divide up your budget,

38
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:06,420
sort of what's the utility maximizing way of dividing your budget between groceries and rent and entertainment and clothing and travel, etc.?

39
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,520
And then you kind of think of sort of, well, I've got this much budgeted for travel.

40
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:16,290
What am I going to do? I could take a shorter trip to a more expensive place.

41
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,360
Or I could take a longer trip to a cheaper place.

42
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:24,650
That's actually a very plausible way of kind of thinking about how, you know, he might make decisions.

43
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:30,710
Does anybody necessarily want to sub budget like that? They haven't got, you know, $100 a week set aside for groceries.

44
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:41,620
Okay. So that's plausible. There's one other thing that's sort of missing from this simple model of utility maximization.

45
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:47,440
So far, with the difference curve tangent to the budget constraint, even dimension that's missing.

46
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:54,420
It's a clue. What's not in that model?

47
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:58,930
Is it the utility of having cash left over for the utility?

48
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:03,300
So what dimension is missing if there is utility of having cash left over?

49
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,320
It's a savings. Savings account.

50
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:12,670
So saving for what? What's missing in the model that doesn't account for savings?

51
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:21,200
About time. So that model we've drawn so far implicitly is sort of a one shot deal.

52
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:27,180
So if if the world is a one shot deal, there's no reason not to be on your budget constraint.

53
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,430
If there is no future, why would I be inside my budget constraint?

54
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:37,650
Because what am I saving for? Similarly, if there is no future, is anybody going to loan me any money?

55
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:44,610
Once a loan. A loan is. I'm giving you money today for the promise that you're going to pay me back with interest in the future.

56
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:52,560
Student loan program wouldn't exist if there was no time. So borrowing and saving sort of require added time dimension to the model.

57
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:59,250
So if there's no time to mention, it makes perfect logical sense why you're going to be exactly on your budget constraint.

58
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:03,179
Because there's no point leaving money on the table because that's leaving

59
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:06,780
utility on the table and there's no future that you're saving that money for.

60
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:12,870
Similarly, if there is no future, nobody is going to loan you money to allow you to consume beyond your budget constraint.

61
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:18,140
So we have to add a time dimension. So how would that change things?

62
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:32,030
Let's put it in the simplest possible way. There's two time periods.

63
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:35,780
There's a time period when you're working and there's a time period when you're retired.

64
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:42,020
Your lifetime utility is defined over your consumption on your work and your consumption, and you're retired.

65
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:45,800
Now that exactly that sort of sub maximization problem played out,

66
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,000
this could be a huge factor on all the goods and services you buy when you're working.

67
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,090
This is a huge factor of all the goods and services you buy when you're retired.

68
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:59,600
So what do you have to decide? And this the simplest possible model with time is two explicit time periods.

69
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:07,790
So it's all right now. Right now. So if I say, well, how much of my lifetime income do I want to consume now while I'm working?

70
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:11,030
How much of it do I want to consume when I'm retired?

71
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:17,030
And by definition, if I'm going to consume any when I'm retired, I can't spend it all when I'm working.

72
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:22,219
So we've got a world. All my income comes in when I'm working. So no Social Security programs.

73
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:26,300
Keep this as simple as possible. No government programs helping you out.

74
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,230
So you say, well, I'm making a certain amount of money now.

75
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:36,440
If I literally spend it all, I starve when I'm retired now.

76
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:43,850
So being on my budget constraint in the first periods, either in spending everything I make while I'm working.

77
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:52,940
Sounds like a terrible idea. So I've got a way, you know, how much do I value my future self?

78
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:56,240
Think of this as two different people. As my current self or my future self.

79
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:04,660
I don't value my future self at all. Well, then I'll just have a great time now and spend it all and start over.

80
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:08,170
I do value my future self. I see that terrible decision.

81
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:18,339
I ought to save some money. So essentially I can transfer some of my purchasing power over my lifetime into the future.

82
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:24,400
When I'm not earning an income, all my income comes now, but I have to consume both now and when I'm retired.

83
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:35,450
And so. Let's just do a utility maximization graph.

84
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:41,870
On how I'm going to split my budget. Again, this is kind of exactly like a sub maximization round.

85
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:46,680
This could be a whole vector of things I spend on this. Should be on all vector of things I spend on the.

86
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:53,750
Think of it as somehow splitting my money since it's a dollars $70 in my spending today when I'm working,

87
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:58,970
how many dollars I get to spend in the future when I retire?

88
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:06,400
It's so much. That's the income that I earn while I'm working.

89
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:11,980
So that's one end of the budget constraints. If I literally saved nothing, if I just consumed it all now.

90
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:19,540
Other words, if I couldn't care less about my future self, that's the most I could consume while I'm working.

91
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:27,129
What's the most I could consume when I'm retired? Zero. Well, if I did this.

92
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:30,880
But what if I did the exact opposite? What's the other end of the budget constraints?

93
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:39,520
What's the most I could assume when I retire? Well, what would I do with my money if I didn't spend it now?

94
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:43,750
Should I stick it in the mattress that they've been invested?

95
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:52,660
I hope there is some some rate of return. So let's assume the rate of return I earn is R.

96
00:10:54,640 --> 00:11:00,040
So the other end of my lifetime budget constraints, or the most I could possibly consume when I retired,

97
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:03,440
is my income times one, plus the rate of return that I earn.

98
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:12,580
So if I earn, say, a 50% rate of return, that means every dollar that I save today turns into a dollar 50 that I can spend when I'm retired.

99
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:19,520
And so slow that budget constraints. She's not going to be one.

100
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:24,790
If I literally couldn't invest it for any return, well, then it would be I dollars here and I dollars here.

101
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:28,850
It was simple. They trade off of $1 for $1 every dollar.

102
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:34,700
I don't consume today. I get to consume when I'm retired now since I can invest it, earn some return.

103
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:42,050
I hope every dollar I save today transforms magically into one for our dollars when I'm retired.

104
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:47,300
So that expected rate of return is going to determine the budget constraint.

105
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,710
There is a relative price of consuming today versus consuming in the future.

106
00:11:53,180 --> 00:12:00,740
The opportunity cost of spending an extra dollar today is I'm losing the opportunity to spend one plus hour dollars when I'm retired.

107
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:08,319
The greater R is kind of the richer I am in a lifetime perspective of the rate of return is higher.

108
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,530
Well in this intercept would be higher and there would be a whole bunch of lifetime

109
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:17,880
bundles of affordable that aren't affordable at the current rate of return.

110
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:28,079
And so my job really over this, the very simple as possible model was times or a two time period model is to

111
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:32,700
pick the right split between consumption today and consumption in the future.

112
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:38,160
And then kind of like your grocery budget once I decide how many dollars I'm spending today.

113
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:44,570
This seemed always Starr. Then I figure out what am I going to spend that on?

114
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:57,250
Travel, groceries, housing? There's my optimal consumption where I'm retired and we actually kind of look at the savings.

115
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:05,870
That's right. Their savings is this is how many dollars I made.

116
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:10,790
I spent a CW star of them. Therefore, the difference between those two is how much I've saved.

117
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:27,320
I transferred my savings into my savings times one plus R.

118
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:36,620
So by consumption I'm retired as this is how much I didn't spend when I was young and then I got one plus r times that to spend it when I'm old.

119
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:44,090
And so at any point in time I'm not on budget constraints.

120
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:47,870
I'm under spending my income when I'm working,

121
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:55,490
I'm overspending my income when I'm retired because I saved and invested some of the money that I didn't spend when I was working.

122
00:13:56,390 --> 00:14:02,870
So at a point in time first, I live under my budget constraint when I'm working and I live above my budget constraint.

123
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:11,910
I'm tired. If you think of my budget constrains, how much I'm earning at that period of time when I retire earn zero.

124
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:16,710
I don't want to consume zero, so I'm able to save and invest.

125
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:27,780
And so we can actually take our utility maximization model and sort of in very simple expansion down to time periods,

126
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:31,620
sort of understand sort of how savings and investment comes into the model.

127
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:35,670
It never did until now because we implicitly we never said it said this.

128
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:39,330
But implicit is there's no tomorrow. There's no tomorrow.

129
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:42,860
There's no reason to be under my budget constraint, because what am I saving for?

130
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:47,579
I might as well just have as much utility as I can and I can't be outside my budget constraint

131
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:51,120
because who's going to loan me money if there's no tomorrow for me to pay it back to them?

132
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:58,889
Now, as soon as there is a tomorrow, then at a point in time,

133
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:05,160
you're probably not spending exactly what you earned at that point in time, you're saving more your borrowing.

134
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,890
Let's make it just one tiny step more complicated.

135
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:23,790
Let's add three time periods. So this is serve your entire adult lifetime.

136
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:28,830
Presumably your parents paid for your expenses when you were a kid. So we're kind of ignore that.

137
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:36,210
But you're now a student. In the future you'll be working and in the distant future, you'll be retired.

138
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:41,430
So you can think of this as three time periods of your life where you could think of it as your three selves.

139
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:48,629
You think it's just three distinct people. There's your self today, the future self, what you're working in your future,

140
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:54,870
future self when you're retired, if all of your income arrives in this time period.

141
00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:04,079
So if you think of yourself as three selves petty this person is this person has to pay for themselves and they've got to pay for this

142
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:10,080
person because they've got to pay back their student loans and they've got to pay for this person because they have to save for retirement.

143
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:14,010
So this person has to support all three of yourselves.

144
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:24,420
So if you're borrowing some money for living expenses and tuition while you're a student, you're bringing some income forward from your future self.

145
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:31,580
Are you borrowing money if you're if you're in student loan or are you borrowing money from the bank or the government?

146
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:38,930
I would say no. The bank or the governor is just the conduit. You're borrowing money from your future self.

147
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:46,460
All the banker, the government program, student loan program is is the conduit that helps that transaction happen.

148
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:51,160
You're not borrowing money from the government. You're borrowing money from your future self.

149
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:59,790
That program's going to charge you some interest. Free time is valuable.

150
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:05,200
Money today is worth more than money in the future. Absolutely not to borrow it.

151
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:10,169
So even if you don't want to borrow, then you basically have to figure out how am I going to support myself now?

152
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:16,500
My tuition and my living expenses. You have to get out and get a job and work 40 hours while you're at school.

153
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:19,620
So that's certainly an option if you don't want to borrow.

154
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:24,720
But if you are borrowing, essentially, you're not borrowing from the government, you're borrowing from your future self.

155
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,800
The government program is just a conduit that allows you to do that.

156
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:36,280
Similarly, you don't want your retired self to starve.

157
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:43,270
You better save some money and investors support your retired self.

158
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:48,160
So pity this person or one person. They need to support three people.

159
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:54,000
You've got to support your current self and they've got to support your future.

160
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:59,300
Future self. Plus they've got to support themselves. And.

161
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:04,880
So you get my manager, but you do this in three dimensions. Have another axis coming out of the wall.

162
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:14,570
We could then have sort of an indifferent surface rather than a indifference curve, and we could come up with the optimal way to spend.

163
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:20,309
You know, if I'm going to make a certain amount of money when I'm working, how much should I borrow to support myself today?

164
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:23,760
How much should I save to support my future future retired self?

165
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:31,200
Now, what assumptions are still in this that we might worry about?

166
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:42,040
What don't you know that you'd like to know to make these decisions? Inflation in our annual inflationary model.

167
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:46,770
What will be the return of the stock market? How long will you live?

168
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:54,250
How much money will you make in your working career? So sitting here as a student is when you're once you're here, you'll have a better idea.

169
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:59,310
Sitting here as a student, you're kind of guessing who knows what their salary is going to be ten years, right?

170
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:04,800
No one knows what the stock market's going to be ten years from now.

171
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,970
Who knows how long they're going to live? And none of us know any of those things.

172
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:18,700
We have to make our best guesses. So we're going to talk about decision making under risk and uncertainty in a couple weeks.

173
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,430
And that begins to relax those assumptions.

174
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:28,660
So how do you make your best decision when all you can do is form some expectation of what's going to happen in the future?

175
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,320
But you don't have absolute knowledge of what's going to happen in the future.

176
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:38,049
So this graph here works perfectly well if I know exactly what I'm going to make

177
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:41,860
when I'm working and I know exactly what this rate of return is going to be.

178
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:51,670
For every dollar I save until retirement. At best, I can sort of come up with an informed guess as to what I might make when I'm working.

179
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,890
And guess what the rate of return might be if I invested for a certain number of years.

180
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:02,870
So it will relax those assumptions of perfect information in a couple of weeks and

181
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:06,260
begin to talk about how people might make decisions when they have to make guesses,

182
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:13,370
hopefully educated guesses, guesses based on least some information about the likely distribution of outcomes.

183
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:23,210
And so if you go to an investment site like a mutual fund site, they often have planners and they'll do simulations.

184
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:32,090
And there's still an assumption that something about historical returns and how they vary is going to persist into the future.

185
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:36,950
That might not be right. So that's kind of fundamental uncertainty.

186
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:45,559
You know, I don't know that the future 50 years is going to look like the past 50 years in terms of how many of years are there in the stock market,

187
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:48,920
how many years, how big the up yours are, how big the down years are.

188
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:56,180
But they can do simulations for you and say, well, if you save this much for your retirement,

189
00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:01,700
there is an x percent chance that you will have enough to live.

190
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,400
And whatever budget you told me you want to live on when you're retired,

191
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:11,300
and if you want to increase that 50% chance to a 90% chance, this is how much more you're going to have to save.

192
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:20,100
So there are ways we can try to make these decisions accounting for that uncertainty.

193
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:26,010
I don't know where the stock market is going to look like exactly, but there's data on how it's looked like in the past.

194
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:33,030
And based on that, we sort of come up with a kind of a simulation and say, well,

195
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:37,469
I don't know for sure that I'm going to be able to make my budget goal as a retiree.

196
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:40,500
But I've got a 95% chance. I got a 95% chance.

197
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:45,180
I feel pretty good about how much I'm saving, and I probably don't need to save more.

198
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:51,840
And I can go to that trip to Hawaii now. I've only got a 20% chance of meeting my desired retirement budget.

199
00:21:52,710 --> 00:22:00,930
I probably should not go to Hawaii this winter. I probably ought to put that money into my investment account for retirement.

200
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:09,660
So there are ways we can sort of help ourselves make these decisions when we don't know, but we're kind of set progressively relaxing assumptions.

201
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:16,900
So here we relaxed the assumption that there's no time. But we still have the assumption of kind of full knowledge.

202
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,070
I know what I'm making. I know what the rate of return is going to be.

203
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:25,110
This one is even bigger assumption because you're sitting here today. So you're saying, well,

204
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:35,940
I know what I'm going to make in the future when I'm actually working and I know the rate of return that I would get a minus on my investment.

205
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:43,670
So at this point, you're saying, well, I've got maybe some guess based on I think that I kind of want to follow this career path.

206
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:52,830
And I think this is kind of what people make of this career path. This is kind of what the rate of return might be.

207
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:58,320
When I saved some of that money my future self makes for my retired self.

208
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,480
But these are guesses.

209
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:10,440
I make questions about that, about how we sort of begin to think about a time dimension and how that doesn't really change the model.

210
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:15,840
Here we added the time dimension and we have a very familiar graph.

211
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:19,079
I could have written good X here and good Y here.

212
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:24,629
Had years of budget constraint, years utility maximizing model because of now we're interpreting it very differently.

213
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:29,130
We're saying as well as the consumption decision over time, I have to decide when I'm working,

214
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:35,730
how much of my income am I going to save it at best for my retired self and the relative price of

215
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:40,500
a dollar of consumption today is I'm sacrificing one plus R dollars of consumption in the future.

216
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:51,680
So a lot of this abstract model of consumer decision making,

217
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:00,200
the basic intuitions ideas carry over when we begin to relax the assumptions we may have to modify some of them,

218
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:08,090
but the basic intuitions usually carry over. We only do two and two good world because I can graph on this board and two in two dimensions.

219
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,239
All the intuitions about decision making are the same.

220
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:17,210
If we had a thousand goods or a million goods that the consumer is choosing from, none of us live in a two good world.

221
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:22,370
But this basic idea of diminishing marginal utility of the different things and way off.

222
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:29,569
If I've got a bundle that's really heavy in one area, I'd be willing to trade off a lot of that to move to a bundle that's a little more balanced.

223
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:34,760
Maybe all those ideas carry over and it's not like, well,

224
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:41,570
if we had a third go and the whole model falls apart in the model makes no sense anymore, it still kind of carries over.

225
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:52,110
I want to talk a little bit about today's short readings.

226
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:59,610
One is about inflation and how you measure inflation. So obviously a big, big topic today.

227
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:06,180
So there is a debate about whether the best way to measure inflation is.

228
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:10,560
So traditionally of measuring inflation is you've got sort of a bundle of goods.

229
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:15,390
A fixed bundle is the serve representative of what the average person buys.

230
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:22,049
A certain amount of their budget is on food. And among food, it's you know, there's different fruits, there's different vegetables,

231
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:26,490
there's different meats that go into that certain amount of budget on housing.

232
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:37,170
And we send people out from the federal government to go and measure what those things cost at different points of time signatures on a fixed bundle.

233
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:41,340
So this is sort of a representative bundle that a typical American consumes.

234
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:45,240
And we try to say, well, how much of that bundle costs you this month?

235
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:53,310
And then we send our surveyors out into the field and say, How much does that exact same bundle of goods cost you next month?

236
00:25:53,910 --> 00:26:00,090
How much does it cost the month after? And so on. So that ignores a couple of things.

237
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:07,090
One thing it ignores is that the new products show up for product quality changes.

238
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:12,249
So it's not just a fixed bundle. Some things are absolutely fixed.

239
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:17,650
You might say, well, a loaf of white bread, that's pretty much the same a year from now as it was a year ago.

240
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:30,400
That's really not going to change much change by an easy or something like even like natural digest or the impact on food and everything.

241
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:35,140
That certainly determines scarcity and prices.

242
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:39,940
Right. But in terms it probably doesn't change the product itself for as imagine this

243
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:44,540
year's model of cars is different than last year's model of car from year to year.

244
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:50,770
That might not seem like a big difference, but say compare a car from the 1970s to a car from today.

245
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:57,250
Look out after the 1970s did not have airbags. If you were lucky, it had an AMS FM radio.

246
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:03,040
It didn't have an MP three player, didn't have Apple CarPlay.

247
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,880
It didn't have any of those things. All the other safety, no automatic braking,

248
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:16,000
didn't have that reliability in the gas mileage were probably terrible compared to a similarly sized car today.

249
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:23,860
So you say we can't just say, well, a car today costs $35,000 in a car in the 1970s costs $7,000.

250
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:29,860
So the price of cars has gone up five times since 1970 because you're comparing an incredibly different car.

251
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:38,260
It's a whole different beast. So you have to try to adjust for changes in quality and say, you know how, you know, how much better is today's car?

252
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:43,510
It's not really five times expensive for the same car. It's five times as expensive for a much better car.

253
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:49,650
But another thing you have to worry about is this idea of a fixed bundle.

254
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:56,790
So what do consumers do if the price of one thing increases relative to other things?

255
00:27:57,390 --> 00:28:07,540
What is our model showing as they do? Something they substitute substituted they subject away from, things become more expensive.

256
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:14,320
So if we have a fixed bundle that kind of assumes that, say, if the price of chicken goes up,

257
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,669
I'm going to buy the exact same amount of chicken I did when it was cheaper.

258
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:25,570
And I'm not going to say, Wow, chicken's really expensive this month. I'll buy some more beef or I'll buy some more tofu or buy some more pork.

259
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:32,630
So this idea of chained CPI takes into account that sort of substitution behavior.

260
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:41,900
So people sort of offset the impact of inflation on a fixed bundle by moving away from the parts of that bundle that became relatively more expensive.

261
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:48,900
Now, there's not sort of a right answer to how much we should do it because, you know, your utility could be affected.

262
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:50,919
I really like chicken better than I like beef.

263
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:58,000
Then even though I'm substituting away from chicken towards beef, the response that praise, I may be less happy with the new model.

264
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:07,510
And that's not being an important policy issue because if you do the sort of chained CPI that accounts for the substitution,

265
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:14,649
typically that will reduce the inflation rate by about 0.3% as compared to doing a fixed bundle

266
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:18,639
approach where you're saying we're assuming that even though price the relative prices have changed,

267
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,090
people are buying the same bundle of goods this month that they bought last month.

268
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:28,989
0.3 percent doesn't sound like much, right? So inflation now is running eight and a half percent.

269
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:34,450
So it would be 8.2, let's say, if we did the chained CPI.

270
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:38,050
Does it matter from a policy perspective, though?

271
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:46,990
Which inflation index we use one of those based on a fixed bond or one that accounts for the substitutions consumers make.

272
00:29:50,410 --> 00:30:00,000
What's indexed to inflation. Social Security payments and tax brackets.

273
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:07,320
So if we changed the inflation measure to one, that is going to typically be 0.3% less.

274
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:15,570
That means every year the Social Security and cost of living adjustment goes down by 0.2 percent in that every year the tax brackets.

275
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:25,090
Our adjusted that, much less so that people pay more taxes because we assumed that, well, inflation was lower than it was under the old calculations.

276
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:27,340
So we don't need to adjust the bracket up as much.

277
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:36,220
So effectively becomes a benefit decrease for Social Security recipients and a tax increase for all of us.

278
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:46,930
Okay. 2.3%. That doesn't matter much, right? Compound interest, point 3% a year every year for 20 years.

279
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:53,080
That's going to have a meaningful impact on Social Security benefits. That's going to have a meaningful impact on tax brackets.

280
00:30:53,150 --> 00:31:02,270
That's how much income tax you pay. So it seems like sort of a technical question what's the best way of measuring inflation?

281
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:06,770
Does it account for these substitutions or are you just trying to measure a fixed bundle?

282
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:10,430
And how is the cost of that fixed bundle people not substituting?

283
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:16,100
It seems like sort of an arcane technical issue for the wonks,

284
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:22,340
but actually if we were to make a policy decision to use the chained CPI lower cost through substitution,

285
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:26,570
we're making a decision to raise taxes and decrease Social Security benefits.

286
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:30,760
So it has real impact, small impact in one year.

287
00:31:30,800 --> 00:32:09,270
Big impact in ten or 20 years. So the other memo that I really recommend you at least skim through from the Leonard Davis

288
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:14,040
Institute at the University of Pennsylvania talks about the concept of affordability.

289
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:23,249
So our model has had a very simple definition of affordability.

290
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:28,590
Is it honor below the budget constraint? If it is this affordable that's outside the budget constraint, it's not affordable.

291
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:36,150
Absolutely accurate from a technical sense. But is it the most useful definition of affordability?

292
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:42,670
Let's assume that. The people's.

293
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:53,420
Health insurance and food. What if the price of health insurance.

294
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:56,839
$10,000 in income? What are the price of health insurance?

295
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:02,300
Is $9,999 a year. Okay.

296
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:08,360
It's technically affordable, right? If I have $10,000 in income, it is an affordable bundle.

297
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:15,050
It's honorable. All my budget constraint to have health insurance plan for $9,999 and eat $1 food all year.

298
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:20,090
Is that meaningfully affordable, would you say, for this person health?

299
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:26,389
Would you be a kind of a hard boiled person? Just looking at this model is it's okay, it's honorable.

300
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:33,170
Your budget is straight, you can afford health insurance. Now, that's kind of a stupid definition of affordability.

301
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:37,040
It's technically right. It's practically irrelevant.

302
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:42,010
So we need sort of different ways of trying to understand it.

303
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:47,570
We're trying to answer a question like for how many people in the United States is health insurance affordable?

304
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:53,810
So we have this objective measure of affordability is on or below a budget constraint.

305
00:33:54,260 --> 00:34:01,040
And there the answer is yes. Health insurance is affordable for the vast majority of Americans, the overwhelming majority.

306
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:11,110
But it's not practically affordable. So we have to come up with a subjective measure of affordability as well.

307
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:15,940
So there are many different ones that have been proposed. This particular one.

308
00:34:19,410 --> 00:34:24,930
Spring hasn't come down. It's weird Scotia well enough.

309
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:37,169
It's a sort of post ACA. And on this axis, we have income in sort of 50 percentile spends of that relative to the federal poverty level.

310
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:41,970
Start from less than 100%, 101 200 and 5051 to 200.

311
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:46,290
And then finally, the last one is over 500% of the federal poverty line.

312
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:51,900
So the ACA has a number of provisions that are related to the federal poverty line.

313
00:34:51,930 --> 00:34:57,950
One of them is the Medicaid expansion. And again, expansions are good, up to 138% of the federal.

314
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:09,010
So you got Medicaid and then you got the subsidies for your premiums on the exchanges if you buy an individual policy on the exchange.

315
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:14,350
Those are phased out gradually until they disappear at 400% of the federal poverty line.

316
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:19,390
And then you also have what's called cost sharing reductions.

317
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:30,340
So if you're between 100% and 250% of the federal poverty line and you are in an exchange plan, your cost sharing is subsidized.

318
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:36,700
So you don't have to pay as much deductibles and co-pays as somebody with higher income.

319
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:44,280
So put all these things together. And then I had sort of a notion of what is, you know,

320
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:54,230
kind of a budget that would be needed for just kind of living within basics food, clothing, housing, housing.

321
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:58,010
Okay. So how much would it take for a typical person to have at least one?

322
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:02,239
What might the subject of running against all subject and not object of subjectively

323
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:06,770
be considered at least a minimally acceptable standard of living in this country?

324
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:13,790
You know, as add to that health insurance premiums and let's add to that potentially

325
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:17,510
average out-of-pocket expense when you actually go to the doctor or hospital.

326
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:22,470
And those add to that. Those few people have very high expenses on a given year.

327
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:25,310
So they use the 94 percentile of out-of-pocket spending.

328
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:34,339
That's the 1% of people at different income levels wouldn't have enough money left for this basic budget of food,

329
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:39,920
shelter, clothing, etc. If they faced that premium,

330
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:51,500
that premium plus that median out-of-pocket expense, that premium plus that 95% out-of-pocket expense is at the lowest income level is about 18%.

331
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:58,309
And again, that's because most of those people are going to qualify for Medicaid, which has little, if any, cost sharing.

332
00:36:58,310 --> 00:37:02,950
So, you know, you're at the 95th percentile. You're not really spending a lot out of pocket.

333
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:07,100
So those dots are really kind of this is 95th percentile.

334
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,260
This is with the median. This is just premiums.

335
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:18,500
So for these folks, those dots are almost right on top of each other because they pay very little out of pocket when they use health care.

336
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:28,820
Similar for on the other end, if we're above 500%, we see that the premium or the premium plus the median out-of-pocket expense,

337
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:33,290
almost 100% of people have about 500% of poverty level,

338
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:42,020
could still afford this other basic bundle of necessities, even after paying that if they face a 95th percentile out-of-pocket expenses.

339
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:50,690
Now, a couple of that, maybe 3%, wouldn't be able wouldn't have enough money left in their budgets for this sort of predefined bundle.

340
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:58,890
Now we're the ones who are really potentially hurt by out-of-pocket expenses.

341
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:04,540
Kind of the sweet spot or actually the inverse sweet spot this kind of year.

342
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:09,750
That's 201 to 250%, 251 to 300%.

343
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:15,030
So these are the people that if you're in that sort of 200 to 300% of the federal poverty line.

344
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:27,310
Almost 30% of those people, if they had a bad year and they faced 95% of the 95th percentile of use of medical care in that year,

345
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:34,060
almost 30% of them would not have enough money left after paying premiums and out-of-pocket

346
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:39,400
costs to still afford this predefined basic bundle of other goods and services.

347
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:44,470
And that kind of makes sense of that structure that I described,

348
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:50,440
that these folks are not qualified for the Medicaid expansion, so they are really facing out-of-pocket costs.

349
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:57,009
Which are you facing premiums? They get premium subsidies, but those are phased out gradually.

350
00:38:57,010 --> 00:39:00,160
So their subsidy is not as big as the subsidy that these people get.

351
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:07,090
And the cost sharing subsidy disappears by 250% and again, gradually phased out.

352
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:14,620
So these folks get a little bit of cost sharing, the subsidy that buys down their co-pays and deductibles a little bit.

353
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:20,410
These people get none. So the premium subsidy is starting to go away.

354
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:24,170
The cost sharing subsidy is going away. Yet.

355
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:32,150
These are still not very wealthy individuals. These are low income housing for fairly low income households,

356
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:37,219
not even under the definition of poverty that the Federal Government has laid out for 200 to 300%.

357
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:41,060
The federal poverty line is of a large amount of money.

358
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:46,310
I think for a single household, federal poverty line might be 15,000 or something.

359
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:52,630
So you're talking about 30 to 30 to $45,000.

360
00:39:55,510 --> 00:40:00,880
So these are the individuals, if they happen to have a really bad year in terms of their health care spending,

361
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:06,520
might have some real difficulties paying for everything else.

362
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:20,040
Does it make sense in terms of what that graph is kind of showing us in sort of the lower income groups are actually protected in a sense,

363
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:27,150
to a greater extent because of those higher subsidies for both cost sharing and premiums or Medicaid eligibility of low enough.

364
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:31,080
The highest income people are obviously protected.

365
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:39,810
But is that sort of middle group here of 200 or 300% that if they happen to have a bad year, it's more trouble?

366
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:51,640
So that's looking at it at the individual level. We can also look at it at more of a societal level.

367
00:40:57,750 --> 00:41:05,370
And this is making some radical way into the future projections, again, making an assumption that sort of past trends,

368
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:12,510
that health care spending and overall economic growth are somewhat representative of what's going to happen in the future.

369
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:20,800
So it's kind of like trying to guess what your retirement rate of return is going to be. And that's the question.

370
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:28,830
If health care spending goes up at sort of these historical rates and income goes up at these historical rates.

371
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:39,770
How much money will we have left over after paying for health care to spend on everything else?

372
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:44,600
Travel. Housing. Food. Clothing. Utilities. The works.

373
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:51,220
And here it's going to matter very much where you are in the income distribution.

374
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:55,209
So let's start it with a what's called the societal perspective.

375
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:57,670
That's that dashed line figure. That's just the average.

376
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:08,920
So we played implicitly as a society, we could decide to redistribute income if we think outcomes are too bad for some segments.

377
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:18,760
So would we, at least in principle, have enough income growth that we are as a society on average better off and at least in principle,

378
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:25,690
it could make the decision to protect certain members of society from rising health care costs.

379
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:34,030
And the answer is yes, that line is growing. So basically all these lines say sort of where how much spending is there?

380
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:37,840
Minus health care costs is spending on everything other than health care.

381
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:50,560
When we see in 1976 or 50,000 or what you're indexed to in 2056, it's doubled approximately.

382
00:42:51,460 --> 00:43:01,120
But now say we don't make those redistributions. And everybody is kind of stuck with where they are in the distribution of income.

383
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:05,410
Okay. Well, if I'm in the 95th percentile, it looks pretty good, right?

384
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:12,070
That's the green line. Obviously, I'm starting out a lot higher than the average and that gap continues to grow.

385
00:43:14,350 --> 00:43:20,320
So despite rising health care costs, if they continue to rise in the future at historical rates,

386
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:26,050
the rich are still going to be richer in terms of what they have left over to spend on everything other than health care.

387
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:30,610
The 80th percentile, which is still you're doing pretty well.

388
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:34,240
You're in better than four out of five households in terms of income.

389
00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:41,079
And there we see something interesting for a while. It keeps growing more slowly than the 95th percentile.

390
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:49,420
But still, if you're at the 80th percentile, rising health care costs are not going to steal all of your ability to buy more other stuff.

391
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:56,549
But then it kind of just basically plateaus. See you at the adios for sundial.

392
00:43:56,550 --> 00:44:03,120
Once again, this graph about sort of beyond this 2026 or so, you basically just stay flat.

393
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:10,230
So rising health care costs, you think of it as if you're in the 80th percentile again, if these projections come true, which don't count on it.

394
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:14,610
And so basically, health care is stealing all of your raises.

395
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:23,080
Purchasing power for everything other than health care is going to remain essentially constant.

396
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:28,120
Okay, so that doesn't sound too great, right? Even for the ages percentile.

397
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:34,300
But if you're the median household. So you're talking about low income households here.

398
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:38,050
We're talking about something a household and is living at the national media.

399
00:44:40,030 --> 00:44:50,100
We see that's declining. So rising health care costs, if these projections are based on past experience, come true,

400
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:55,380
even if you're sort of the middle household in terms of your household income in this country,

401
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:59,820
at some point, basically health care is going to say not only all of your raises,

402
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:05,670
it's going to take more than all of your raises and your not health care standard of living would actually decline.

403
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:11,900
So is this just like the the premiums because everybody uses health care differently, right?

404
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:14,940
So some people may use a lot of health care. Other people may not use it at all.

405
00:45:15,390 --> 00:45:18,940
So is that just an average of the population of people or.

406
00:45:19,830 --> 00:45:22,790
Yes, that's a dimension that's I feel like it's misguided. Yeah.

407
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:26,280
You have to look at the actual study and see how they account for out-of-pocket costs.

408
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:32,250
So I'm sure it's there's premium and some estimate of how much the out-of-pocket costs are for care received.

409
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:40,260
So basically the impact is very different depending on where a household lies and the income distribution.

410
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:45,260
And even this is the median and we're not talking about the 10th percentile versus this is the 91st year.

411
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:49,410
We don't have anything here for the fifth percentile. This is the median.

412
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:54,780
So you figure that is sort of the typical household.

413
00:45:56,180 --> 00:46:00,560
I don't want to take the projections too seriously, but certainly two big points.

414
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:07,920
Table was, I think, doing this. One is that, you know, it seems like we would have the wherewithal at the societal level.

415
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:15,470
To make redistributions to protect, say, this median household and certainly those that are below it.

416
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:21,710
But we'd have to be willing to do that, which obviously is a political question, not an economic question.

417
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:28,580
But it seems like you would have the wherewithal to at least have the ability to make that decision, should we politically choose to.

418
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:37,610
But if we don't make that decision, the distribution of the impact of rising health care costs is going to be very asymmetric.

419
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,540
So it kind of questions or comments about that.

420
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:57,480
The interesting issue brief to skim through some of these things on some of the issues of sort of how how do you define or define affordability?

421
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:04,950
And you have to do it sort of subjectively because the object of measure of its honor below the budget constraint really doesn't help you much.

422
00:47:06,330 --> 00:47:11,100
If that $10,000 family isn't a family with $10,000 of income.

423
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:18,480
Has faces of $9,999 health insurance premium as honorable as our budget constraint.

424
00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:24,090
Think they can afford that plan in practical sense? So let's try to sort of try.

425
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:29,070
So what are some of the ways we can make that definition more affordable and what are the implications

426
00:47:29,070 --> 00:47:37,200
that we see for policy or for the distribution of outcomes in society of taking one of those definitions?

427
00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:45,780
And I want you to take these exact numbers seriously because it's a total guess.

428
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:52,570
But I think we still saw two, two basic points that at a societal level, we probably can afford it.

429
00:47:54,580 --> 00:48:01,450
But then it becomes a political question of how we deal with the distribution of outcomes.

430
00:48:02,290 --> 00:48:06,490
If we deal with the distribution of outcomes because it takes the bulk of the political will to do that.

431
00:48:20,610 --> 00:48:26,340
And so we've got about a half an hour. So there's a couple of problems from the practice problems that I'd like to do.

432
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:31,649
The first one I think we'll kind of work on sort of together as a big group.

433
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:32,550
In the second one,

434
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:41,670
I'll have you kind of split up into groups of four or five or so and work on it for a little bit and the more we can link to solve it.

435
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:50,130
Okay, so we're going to do this question up here and then we'll do another question on the demand curve.

436
00:48:52,390 --> 00:49:00,340
So we have a consumer named David who gets $3 a month as an allowance, and he likes only peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.

437
00:49:01,570 --> 00:49:08,980
So he spends his entire allowance on peanut butter, which costs $0.05 an ounce and jelly which costs $0.10 an ounce.

438
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:13,660
So a neighbor gives some bread for free. So we don't have to worry about Fred keeping two dimensions.

439
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:18,760
So the peanut butter jelly sandwich only has two ingredients. He actually has to pay for the peanut butter and jelly.

440
00:49:19,870 --> 00:49:22,719
Now, he's a very, very picky eater.

441
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:30,370
He only likes those peanut butter and jelly sandwiches made one particular way, and that's with one ounce of jelly and two ounces of peanut butter.

442
00:49:31,150 --> 00:49:35,830
And he refuses to change those proportions. So given those laws, what is that?

443
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:42,800
What is the difference? Curves going to look like one.

444
00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:51,280
Like, you know, half of like this is what gives a person like me, like one ounce of jelly and two ounces of peanut butter.

445
00:49:52,810 --> 00:49:56,830
So if he never varies those proportions, what will be the shape of the difference curves?

446
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:08,300
It's not like standard preferences kind of like this, like perfect substitutes or linear indifference curves or perfect complements the L-shaped.

447
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:16,450
I see some nodding on the street. So the fact that he never varies his proportions.

448
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:24,810
That implies that, you know, butter and jelly are a perfect complement to the only uses of a fixed proportion.

449
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:46,550
A solution was when I had the chance. So where is the corner of the indifference curve?

450
00:50:46,570 --> 00:50:56,590
For one, peanut butter and jelly sandwich could be. And I think so for for one sandwich.

451
00:50:57,550 --> 00:51:03,810
Each sandwich uses one ounce of jelly, two ounces of peanut butter. Two and one.

452
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:07,420
Exactly. So we got two on the bottom one.

453
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:16,710
So. There is one of those indifference curves.

454
00:51:19,530 --> 00:51:25,290
It makes senses at that corner. These instances won't vary those proportions.

455
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:30,960
If he had only two ounces of peanut butter and you gave him extra jelly, that would be useless to him.

456
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:40,530
Wouldn't do anything with that extra jelly. Similarly, if he had one ounce of jelly and you gave him extra peanut butter, you want to.

457
00:51:41,930 --> 00:51:48,520
That wouldn't make him any better off. He only uses them in that fixed proportion until he gets more peanut butter and jelly.

458
00:51:48,530 --> 00:51:52,340
He can't make another sandwich. Restaurant will just sit there wasted.

459
00:51:53,300 --> 00:52:02,870
So he's going to be in a corner. Okay, let's take another corner, say for two sandwiches for exactly four and two.

460
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:16,780
Now, how can we figure out this utility maximizing number of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches?

461
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:21,700
What's his budget constraint? Do we have the prices there?

462
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:27,820
What? Which.

463
00:52:34,630 --> 00:52:39,790
And so what's the coefficient on peanut butter? Three.

464
00:52:40,750 --> 00:52:48,950
Peanut butter zero point do five. And for jelly, you found 0.10.

465
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:54,020
And then what's the income? $3. $3.

466
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:58,430
And so to maximize his utility, we know he's going to be on that budget constraints.

467
00:52:58,430 --> 00:53:03,680
So it's got to be a bundle that satisfies the budget constraints, but it cost $3.

468
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:10,430
What else do we know about it? It's got to be a record to it.

469
00:53:12,770 --> 00:53:18,290
Can we describe mathematically what that order has to satisfy?

470
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:29,440
Yeah. Equals one J. And so we've got, we say two to be equals one J.

471
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:38,990
And so if that's right, then we have to equations and two unknowns.

472
00:53:38,990 --> 00:53:44,120
And then we can actually solve for the most. Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches you can afford.

473
00:53:44,970 --> 00:53:59,460
Okay. So is this equation right? Take a look at this corner as a satisfying equation to look for a one day supply of j.

474
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:05,830
So J is one and peanut butter is you.

475
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:10,290
So we're saying four equals one. No, exactly.

476
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,840
It's not going to be fine.

477
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:19,910
Everybody, including myself, does this the first time I see this because you're thinking, well, he's twice as much peanut butter as jellies.

478
00:54:19,930 --> 00:54:23,160
The equation is two people say absolutely everybody does that.

479
00:54:23,250 --> 00:54:26,880
It's it's the opposite. Right. Because.

480
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:44,290
That tells me he uses twice as much peanut butter as jelly. If I use one tablespoon of jelly, I use therefore two tablespoons of peanut butter.

481
00:54:44,290 --> 00:54:47,920
I double the jelly. So that's actually the right equation for it.

482
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:52,860
But absolutely, everybody's so natural to think, well, it's two peanut butter, just one jelly.

483
00:54:52,870 --> 00:54:56,409
Put that in the equation, too. Peebles is the natural way to think about it.

484
00:54:56,410 --> 00:55:00,850
But actually you do have to flip it now and say, Well, for example, what if I had two jellies?

485
00:55:01,450 --> 00:55:08,140
If I had two jellies? I would have for peanut butter.

486
00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:12,550
And that's exactly in a corner. So essentially.

487
00:55:23,970 --> 00:55:27,990
That's just the equation of the line that connects to all the corners of the indifference curves.

488
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:35,970
It's all the combinations that have that sort of magic proportion to him that he consumes peanut butter and jelly I won't deviate from.

489
00:55:36,690 --> 00:55:49,260
Okay, so now we've got two equations and two unknowns. So we can just plug, for example, to J and for peanut butter.

490
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:07,350
And so I'm just substituting in to DJ for Bebe using this information.

491
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:15,600
So as I'm forcing that bundle to be at a corner, I am closing this relationship.

492
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:22,320
So that's going to be when two j equals three.

493
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:30,360
Jake was 15. And then how much peanut butter would I have?

494
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:42,990
It equals 30. So I could assume that I did all my math right where I could double check and double check.

495
00:56:42,990 --> 00:56:47,220
How could I double check the value of baby?

496
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:52,530
That was back in the budget constraints and see if this bundle costs $3.

497
00:56:53,190 --> 00:56:58,050
The math, Ron. Love is not going to cost $3. Okay, so peanut butter is $0.05.

498
00:56:58,380 --> 00:57:03,450
So that throw peanut butter is going to cost me a dollar. 50 jelly is $0.10.

499
00:57:03,990 --> 00:57:07,710
15 jellies is it costs me a dollar 50. So I spent my $3.

500
00:57:08,610 --> 00:57:13,110
So if I really, really, really trust my math, I could have just stop right here and I would have had the right answer.

501
00:57:13,470 --> 00:57:17,220
I never trust my math that well. It ends on an exam.

502
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:21,040
We shouldn't trust your math that. Well, there's often ways you can double check your answer.

503
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:28,260
If I plug these back into here and I get the budget constraint being satisfied, I can be very, very, very, very confident.

504
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:29,310
I've gotten the right answer.

505
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:36,600
So and if I would have gotten something other than $3 plug in the answer it I could be absolutely sure I got the wrong answer.

506
00:57:37,650 --> 00:57:42,330
So for the example, who got a similar type of fortune and then that's how we to do it.

507
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:49,350
I'm not saying, you know, to translate the information that's in the set up of the problem.

508
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:55,210
And will there be a graph tool like when you ask a friend in the graph.

509
00:57:56,230 --> 00:58:38,370
So we can now graph the. Solution of look, something like that corner is going to be a 38 tablespoons of peanut butter, 15 tablespoons of jelly.

510
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:44,940
So beyond the budget constraints, the budget constraints can be fairly tricky because jelly is twice as expensive as peanut butter.

511
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:57,390
So slope is going to be difficult to. The intercepts of the 36 teams are perfectly drawn to scale.

512
00:58:58,950 --> 00:59:02,430
That would be the wrath of the solution.

513
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:10,890
What about for more substitutable goods you want to implement?

514
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:13,980
Yeah. So it's not like a perfect complementary relationship.

515
00:59:15,370 --> 00:59:21,750
So then we're generally not going to be able to really give you an equation of a utility function,

516
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:26,190
come up with an exact answer without doing a lot more math on it,

517
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:31,109
which this is kind of is easy because once you figure out that, Oh, wait a second,

518
00:59:31,110 --> 00:59:36,900
he's going to be at a corner and then in Seattle has to satisfy this.

519
00:59:37,590 --> 00:59:46,290
And we know he's going to have to have twice as many tablespoons of peanut butter at sea as jellies and therefore PB equals two j.

520
00:59:46,890 --> 00:59:51,420
So it becomes very easy mathematically to do it because you can characterize, you know,

521
00:59:51,420 --> 01:00:00,210
the utility maximizing bundle has to be at a corner and then you can sort of characterize mathematically what it what that corner is, that equation.

522
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:09,479
So that that tends to be a lot easier to actually come up with a an exact numerical answer to a perfect substitute

523
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:15,240
is there also tend to be either of the exact numerical answer because it's whether you're going to only buy one,

524
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:19,710
you're going to only buy the other or you're going to be indifferent between any combination.

525
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:26,069
So there's going to be sort of an exact answer. The last case isn't exact is going to be anything.

526
01:00:26,070 --> 01:00:30,180
But, you know, any one is as good as any other. So it's not like there was a bad answer.

527
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:36,690
You know, Shell and Oil Gas are perfect substitutes to me and they both cost $4 a gallon.

528
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:42,180
I'm indifferent to any combination on the indifference curve that all utility.

529
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:48,600
I just want to get the most gas I can afford. Once I've got the most gas I can afford any mix of them as is equivalent.

530
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:58,290
Whereas if if Shell raised their price to 410, then I would only buy Mobil and said Mobil raised it to 410 and Shell stayed $4.

531
01:00:58,290 --> 01:01:05,940
I would only buy Shell. So in those extreme cases, it's a lot easier to come up with an absolutely precise answer.

532
01:01:06,550 --> 01:01:13,590
It's perfect substitutes. I I'll always go to one, always go with the other, or be indifferent between any combination.

533
01:01:14,130 --> 01:01:21,510
And with this, I'm only going to I'm never going to pay the utility maximizing bundle that's out here throughout here on the indifference curve,

534
01:01:21,510 --> 01:01:29,730
which would have to be a lower one to afford it. But that, for example, you know, that bundle exhausts my budget.

535
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:36,030
I would never pick that bundle because that bundle is really the only thing gives me.

536
01:01:36,030 --> 01:01:41,730
Utility is being at the corner. All of this extra jelly is just wasted to me.

537
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:50,070
So rather than having waste of jelly, what I do is I buy less jelly, invest the money, more peanut butter, so that I could move up here.

538
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:59,160
I think it was just the very extremes. You know, most goods are somewhere in between.

539
01:01:59,550 --> 01:02:03,750
Perfect substitute and perfect complement sort of things, I think of different.

540
01:02:04,350 --> 01:02:07,500
What's your favorite pizza in Ann Arbor? You've tried several.

541
01:02:09,270 --> 01:02:12,410
Did you guys just get out?

542
01:02:12,810 --> 01:02:18,870
If I told you the price of jets doubled and every other pizza that was kept the same price, what would you do?

543
01:02:22,290 --> 01:02:25,310
Yeah. Let's just see. Probably more likely try a different pizza.

544
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:31,350
So the different brands of pizza, they're not perfect substitutes because we have our individual preferences.

545
01:02:31,350 --> 01:02:40,340
So just means you like the Detroit style pizza crisp corners and let somebody else play like Domino's.

546
01:02:40,350 --> 01:02:47,610
Somebody else might like Cardigan, but they're probably for most consumers, fairly close substitutes.

547
01:02:47,610 --> 01:02:53,940
So if one of those pizza places decided, yeah, I know some people really like Jetson Town, so I'm going to double the price of jets.

548
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:59,190
I'm the owner of the Jets franchise and that's my thinking is that's a good business decision.

549
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:06,030
Probably not. If I doubled the price of jets and every other pizza place charge the same.

550
01:03:06,030 --> 01:03:11,760
I lose a lot of customers because there are a lot of close substitutes available for my product.

551
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:18,120
There are lots of other pizzas that are similar in the same location.

552
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:30,930
I imagine a lot of people is saying, what, $30 for a pizza and I can go to college and get the same thing for 12 or $15.

553
01:03:33,450 --> 01:03:38,690
Now, if there if Jess was the only pizza place in town, now there still be substitute.

554
01:03:39,010 --> 01:03:48,120
So pizza you can have something you get and Chinese food Indian food to try to sell yourself pasta and you could go to wherever.

555
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:52,380
But those are nearly as close to substitute as different types of pizza.

556
01:03:52,430 --> 01:03:56,730
If you really feel like pizza, you're going out for Thai.

557
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:03,929
You might like Thai, too, but tonight you really feel like pizza. That's not a great substitute, is it?

558
01:04:03,930 --> 01:04:08,790
There are two other pizza places in town. Your address is really shooting themselves in the foot if they know what the price.

559
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:51,960
I guess I go through the problem and then spend a five or 10 minutes working on it together in small groups, and then we'll reconvene into song.

560
01:04:53,490 --> 01:04:57,569
So we have a demand curve as the demand curve for pancakes.

561
01:04:57,570 --> 01:05:01,799
And it's a function of three things. It's a function of the price of pancakes.

562
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:06,120
That's just the price of sirup and income.

563
01:05:06,870 --> 01:05:14,660
So. We're given that the price of sirup is $10 on this $500.

564
01:05:15,650 --> 01:05:25,040
So the first thing is to draw the demand curve, assuming that price of sirup in that income as comedy pancakes when she buys at a price of $3.

565
01:05:26,540 --> 01:05:30,860
What happens if the price rises to $5?

566
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:39,630
And then so what would happen to the demand curve if the price of sirup increased or if her income increased after that?

567
01:05:39,650 --> 01:05:42,970
For those of you who have a hard time seeing that in the back, I'll write it off here.

568
01:05:43,460 --> 01:06:05,730
Much larger. Five P -0.5 B is.

569
01:06:08,380 --> 01:06:22,930
Most 0.01 I. Income 500.

570
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:28,180
So there's the data for the problem. So first graph the demand curve.

571
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:35,380
How much will she buy at a price of three B? What would change if the price of pancakes changed to five?

572
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:44,350
And that's what would happen to the demand curve if the price of sirup changed or income changed over them increased.

573
01:06:46,860 --> 01:06:58,709
So if you want to just kind of find a couple of neighbors around you and you can talk your way through it and you can being sort of about six

574
01:06:58,710 --> 01:07:55,490
or 7 minutes commercial indicate that this is a growing demand for whatever reason why this wanted to get back to work as a space piece.

575
01:07:56,280 --> 01:08:03,180
Oh yeah. Oh, right.

576
01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:12,480
Yeah. I think I was thinking about it.

577
01:08:13,140 --> 01:08:35,790
This is what I was like, you know, you want to start something, you replace you.

578
01:08:37,300 --> 01:08:57,750
Usually during this time I just lost my second experience that we can easily slimness in order to see the answer to that.

579
01:08:57,750 --> 01:09:03,920
Right. I want to go. Yeah, that's right.

580
01:09:07,770 --> 01:09:11,190
Yeah. Yeah, I guess so.

581
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:33,790
For me, I feel like I think I'm trying to use this subscription to see a set of priorities.

582
01:09:37,190 --> 01:10:06,060
And I was like, okay, so you're going to have to give us some of the processes that we have here.

583
01:10:06,540 --> 01:10:09,720
Yeah, I might be here like this.

584
01:10:12,850 --> 01:10:26,940
I was thinking the 500 and something which I think was intercepted, it's like you're just scoring against it.

585
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:51,010
And so it'll be something like this series, which is right.

586
01:10:51,090 --> 01:11:03,989
I think this is sometimes is the case that we're giving $3.

587
01:11:03,990 --> 01:11:08,960
How many pancakes? Oh, that's great.

588
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:21,700
So I started taking everything in at the end of this year.

589
01:11:24,090 --> 01:11:38,920
Yeah. I mean, I usually I listen to something around here, but I just really.

590
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:52,380
Yeah. It's nothing. I haven't. That be otherwise?

591
01:11:52,450 --> 01:12:19,940
I think that's one of the things we need to figure out how to live with five different types of pancakes,

592
01:12:19,980 --> 01:12:43,640
phrases like songs, studio and the solution to this problem.

593
01:12:49,580 --> 01:12:54,860
Yes. Yes. Yes, yes.

594
01:12:55,850 --> 01:13:10,940
Yes. That's just the way it should be on any given day in my life.

595
01:13:13,330 --> 01:13:18,200
Yes. I mean, there's a situation where you're champions, right?

596
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:25,040
Yes. What's it like to write at all?

597
01:13:26,330 --> 01:13:29,930
I think it's so.

598
01:13:32,660 --> 01:14:19,380
Yeah, right. Let's do it. You know what? If one of them is going to be in remote areas where I think the agency is discrimination and I think,

599
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:36,140
you know, these are not the people that just cancel out of the publishing house.

600
01:14:41,340 --> 01:15:19,990
Just one is supposed to be like, yes, I'm learning what makes me feel that way about my line of work.

601
01:15:20,030 --> 01:15:31,700
One of the actions when I'm saying, okay, yeah, they're still ready to take these numbers into the equation.

602
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:35,060
I mean, straight line. Okay.

603
01:15:38,370 --> 01:15:42,679
So it's just it's a bottom.

604
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:54,950
These values, what's left over at this particular place if your listeners are new to the first page was my

605
01:15:55,550 --> 01:16:09,080
services crash yet they're still kind of creating these just to make these things disappear.

606
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:13,130
So this is going to be negative five. This is going to be positive five.

607
01:16:13,610 --> 01:16:23,080
So what we're left with is that this price of sirup and this income level demand as a function of price of pancakes is 30 once a week.

608
01:16:23,510 --> 01:16:32,660
I see. And I told the economists that with some version of reality, it's a lot of variables and I really want to solve it, for Pete's sake.

609
01:16:37,490 --> 01:16:43,670
So add five feet both sides, subtract Q from both sides, and just divide that by five.

610
01:16:53,990 --> 01:17:01,960
So the price intercept is six.

611
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:12,120
The slope is negative one. First negative point to this quantity intercept going to be 31.

612
01:17:14,130 --> 01:17:18,090
Oh, yeah. So there's our demand curve and I get a revenue drive.

613
01:17:18,090 --> 01:17:21,479
Demand curves from utility maximizing choices.

614
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:26,670
We varied the price of are good, but we held constant to everything else.

615
01:17:27,150 --> 01:17:32,940
So here what we're doing is we're holding constant the price of sirup and income and those particular levels.

616
01:17:33,330 --> 01:17:39,000
So this is the demand for quantity as a function of price of its own price.

617
01:17:39,540 --> 01:17:48,890
But given P equals ten and given income equals 500, so how much would this person buy at a price of three months?

618
01:17:52,070 --> 01:17:58,230
$0.50.

619
01:17:59,190 --> 01:18:04,510
And then what if price rose to five, which is the price of sirup or price?

620
01:18:05,490 --> 01:18:10,740
She says this is the price of sirup, so we should change that.

621
01:18:10,950 --> 01:18:15,300
Right? So I see as p as the price of pancakes, the price is zero.

622
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:36,310
Now what if the price of goes as far as what happens to our demand curve so we think nothing happens to it to just moves up along the demand curves.

623
01:18:36,540 --> 01:18:46,259
Exactly. So we said last time that if we're changing the value of the variable on the axis, all we're doing is are moving along the given curve.

624
01:18:46,260 --> 01:18:51,840
Nothing happens to the curve. But her choice change as she moves to a different point on that curve.

625
01:19:00,750 --> 01:19:04,100
Now what happens if the price of sirup would increase?

626
01:19:04,310 --> 01:19:16,190
What happens to the demand curve? What happens?

627
01:19:16,490 --> 01:19:24,530
What's the coefficient on sirup? More importantly, the sign of the coefficient 1.5 doesn't occur.

628
01:19:24,530 --> 01:19:29,599
Would shift the entire curve. Which of course I didn't tell you the new price.

629
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:32,389
So it can't tell you exactly how much if I giving you a price.

630
01:19:32,390 --> 01:19:37,060
If I said we're going to have to $15, then you could come up with the exact equation of the U.

631
01:19:37,070 --> 01:19:40,250
Demand curve. You're not given the new price.

632
01:19:40,250 --> 01:19:51,020
You're saying it's higher. So if it's higher and the coefficient is negative or the substituted circumstance fan base in sirup compliments of sirup.

633
01:19:51,170 --> 01:19:58,091
So if I tend to heat my pancakes with sirup and the price of sirup goes up, we have a now the.
