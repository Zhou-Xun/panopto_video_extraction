1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:08,520
This conversation has returned to the surface.

2
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:28,040
It is controversial from pilots in Nigeria to make a coffee shop for the business side of the issues of

3
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:41,770
the previous midterm process and to all got the kind of sense of what the midterm is going to be like.

4
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:47,940
So, Molly, also similar to the homework questions, time constraints,

5
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:58,980
to make sure that you check out those previous previous year's midterm questions, then work on those questions and come to the office hours.

6
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:13,650
If you have any question without any additional delay, the solutions also pulsate at the movements of playing cards due to work on those questions.

7
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:23,340
Now some of you can find yourself with one hour and 15 minutes.

8
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:33,420
I'm going to have for the midterms. In the meantime, I'm going to be the Thursday before the fall.

9
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:40,920
I'm not going to be all over the country.

10
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:52,590
So one of the things so a few more weeks to help with any question about the midterms.

11
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:02,309
By the way, midterm and a final are all going to be closed or closed?

12
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:06,480
No. But you can bring your account later if you want.

13
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:21,060
Yeah. No close vote closed. But yes, this the starter calculator.

14
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:30,030
You're right.

15
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:35,880
So another side note.

16
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:39,510
So you guys have been very good at answering questions, which is great.

17
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:46,950
So keep it up. But I'm like, side. We didn't have a chance to see a lot of our shows or on Tumblr.

18
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:53,700
So just a side note, if you want to volunteer to do anything, you know, email me.

19
00:02:53,820 --> 00:03:01,110
Okay. So we always have those little phones during the break between the two sessions.

20
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:08,840
If you want to show, you know, some talent that you want to show your classmates or you want to show us where you are from,

21
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:19,600
what else is out there as of Friday email and make it happen and also keep answering the questions voluntarily.

22
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,290
That's great, but it's not an argument.

23
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:35,090
All right. So let's get started. Last time we talked about patience and today we're going to move on and talk about veterans and different moments.

24
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,010
And we're going to talk about this moment of.

25
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,129
The last time.

26
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:52,400
When we talk about the Asian countries in particular, we gave it the definition as a continuous running variable expectation of the roundabout way.

27
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:56,300
That's the integration of the roundabout itself.

28
00:03:56,570 --> 00:04:01,880
Times the period to do the integration over high air sample space.

29
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:08,930
Then you got a number. That number summarized the average or the median of that right now is probably patient.

30
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:16,190
So now we fine generalize that definition to the end order moment which is defined as.

31
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:28,050
And so on. Our moment of a random variable is defined as expectation of access to the power.

32
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:37,260
As you can say, the right way and is equal to one. That's exactly the occasion or the mean of the random variable.

33
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:53,550
We use this new prime to indicate it's the moment and we can also define a relevant moment where it is, which is called the central moment.

34
00:04:55,100 --> 00:05:04,800
That is expectation of x minus MU to the power of where this new is made, speculation of the roundabout of self.

35
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:13,710
And so, yes. So does that mean like the extracted to the power or X to the next?

36
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:19,200
It's the expectation of the this the power car.

37
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:28,920
So it's called a central moment, as the name suggests, because it's a sentence.

38
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:33,460
The random variable is subtracted by this by its own expectation,

39
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:43,060
and then take the power to that and then take the power to the other end and then take away its foundation.

40
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,250
So that's called the central moment.

41
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:56,920
So for the first, where this move is defined as the expectation of itself, or in other words, the first moment of the roundabout,

42
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:03,370
and in particular for the second, the central second, the central moment is called the balance.

43
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:13,660
In other words, the balance is this new two, which is defined by this axial expectation of x minus patient of X squared.

44
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:23,310
So when we write in this form, typically we mean the expectation of what's out of the square term.

45
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:35,200
Okay. If you want to write the square of the expectation, you typically press parentheses outside the statement,

46
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,880
and that's just something notation to keep in mind.

47
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,590
That's called the virus, and you probably already heard the term virus.

48
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:52,300
That's essentially what it is. And it will send a signal what that means.

49
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:56,680
And the virus of the rest of our world. Check out the central moment.

50
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:02,020
It's denoted by this vapor of x, r, v, of ice.

51
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:06,610
There are different types of notations, but all that means it's the virus.

52
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:10,750
And the positive square root of the virus is called the standard deviation.

53
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:17,110
Take the square root of this variance of x. That's called the standard deviation.

54
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,960
Nasty, nasty, nasty. Oh, you know what that means.

55
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:28,690
That's the standard deviation, the variance on the standard deviation measure, the degree of spread.

56
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:35,650
That's essentially what it is that you think about expectation in matter, the mean of the random variable.

57
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:40,330
And now we're measuring how far that random variable can take values from them.

58
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:49,860
I think that squared is always going to be found that if it measure the distance between the actual value of the random variable and the mean.

59
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:59,470
Right. And if you take the expectation of that distance. I just gave you the spread of this rhinovirus for both virus and the standard deviation.

60
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,780
They measure that degree of spread.

61
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:13,970
So we capture very different things from the expectation and finally the balance, that standard deviation, the different measurement units.

62
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:25,490
I think imagine if your original random variable is measuring in, for example, in the lens of something your foot, right?

63
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:33,450
Then the start of the virus. If you look at the definition of the virus, that's the square of the original rhinovirus.

64
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:37,480
So it's going to be the square, but that's going to be the unit forbearance.

65
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:41,840
Furthermore, if you take the square root of the virus together,

66
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:47,420
standard deviation that goes back to the original unit, the same unit with the roundabout.

67
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:52,400
So I'm going to be the foot. So it's been measured in different units.

68
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:59,060
In other words, the rent available and the standard deviation they use the same measurement unit,

69
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,820
the variance, they just the square of that something.

70
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:10,280
So this is the definition of the end moment and central moment and apparently just a

71
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:18,380
special case of that second central moment or rather any question about the definition.

72
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:26,510
Okay. So once we know that definition, we can do some calculation to get a sense of what really captures.

73
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:32,420
The first example is the exponential distribution, which is a continuous distribution.

74
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:46,969
Introduce a later, as we said before, a distribution for a random variable can be fully characterized by its PDF or CDP in a random variable.

75
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:50,720
So I'm either captured by city app or PDF.

76
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:55,630
In this case, we provide the PDF of the run of our whole take.

77
00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:05,420
The form one over lambda e to the power of negative x over here acts only to known that it values from zero to infinity,

78
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:13,270
and lambda is some parameter, so we can consider it as a as a constant and it's a positive constant by any given the value.

79
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:18,200
This is a fixed function, and this function defined the distribution of variables.

80
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:21,760
All right. So this is a PDF for the problem.

81
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,000
And the question is, what is the mean? What is the variance of this roundabout?

82
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:33,020
Last time we have already calculated the mean for this exponential random variable, right?

83
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:45,080
What we did is calculate this integration from 0 to 1 over lambda e to an active lambda the x.

84
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,140
And I recall the technique that we use to solve this integration is the integration by part.

85
00:10:51,500 --> 00:11:02,030
So after some derivation with the expectation to be lambda, so that is the mean of this run of our.

86
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:16,780
Now the question is what is the variance? Of the spread of our other words, what is the expectation of this x minus x squared?

87
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:25,580
So inside this expectation, what is the random? What is fixed?

88
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:31,909
There are two terms acts and events. Which one is random?

89
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:37,160
Which one is fixed? Yes, the x is random.

90
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:41,780
And then the of x is fixed. Very good access to random access space.

91
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:48,290
So when we calculate the expectation, that is the expectation with respect to the to the item.

92
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:54,170
That is random. Right. You are taking the expectation with respect to this random act.

93
00:11:54,710 --> 00:12:01,670
This is just a constant, as always, a that the expectation of X is essentially just a constant.

94
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:03,170
You can replace that by this.

95
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:15,500
So what they are really calculating is this expectation of X minus Lambda Square, and this X minus on the square is essentially a function of X.

96
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:23,570
And we have learned about calculating the expectation for a function of X given the formula.

97
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:32,990
All right. So I'll give you 2 minutes and you can take that, take a shot, see whether we can integrate this and solve it.

98
00:13:06,130 --> 00:14:08,990
You. He's.

99
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:46,150
All right. So let's look at this together. I hope you all got the final answer, which is in this case, from the square.

100
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:52,120
And to get that answer, we just need to follow the definition.

101
00:14:52,780 --> 00:15:00,520
You want to calculate this expectation of X minus one. The square, which is a function of X, is just the plug in this definition.

102
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:04,300
Right? Expectation is just the integration of this function.

103
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:09,950
Times the pdf with the random variable and the order to integrate these.

104
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:16,450
This this guy is break down this square down and separated into three terms.

105
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:28,930
And each time you do this integration by part and for this of the first term, you probably need to abide by the integration by part twice this number.

106
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:36,400
And the second one is essentially the same as how we calculate the expectation of X.

107
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:44,350
And the third one is a directly integral, integral and put everything together.

108
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:54,459
You will get the final services. Not this question, but that is to say for exponential distribution with parameter lambda around allowable has

109
00:15:54,460 --> 00:16:01,720
a mean lambda and varies equal to lambda squared that is directly from the definition.

110
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:10,420
Now let's take a look at the actual distribution of this random variable and see what that really means before we draw the figure.

111
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:19,210
By just looking at this two numbers, what can say about the exponential random variable with different lambda values?

112
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:23,890
Let's say lambda gets larger.

113
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:29,140
How does that ship the mean of the roundabout?

114
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:39,049
We have a larger lambda problem.

115
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:48,350
You have a larger mean, which means the random Arabs are going to take the average value of this amount of Arabs and a move to the right of access.

116
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:57,560
And also, it's going to have to have a larger variance recall virus measure that degree of spread.

117
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:01,790
It just means the variable going to be more variable.

118
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:08,630
It's going to spread more in this answer wrench, which is zero to infinity.

119
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:14,780
Although the range doesn't change, but the spread of the random variable change.

120
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:21,160
So I don't understand that we can sketch the pdf function.

121
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:31,400
This is a PDF. All right. So for any given lambda, you can always draw the figure from the figure of this pdf function.

122
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:51,130
For example, lambda or one. We know that if Acts 3.0, this pdf mount has the y axis at one right and then have exponential decay with larger acts.

123
00:17:51,910 --> 00:18:07,270
That's what the PDF function looks like if lambda or what it touts this y axis exactly at one right and lambda equal to one half.

124
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:18,070
And what has the y axis. I want to highlight that actually quite a zero.

125
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:22,330
You will see our top zero is going to be one over half, which is two.

126
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:27,370
So that's what the idea pdf of this run of our.

127
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:41,880
But again you have this exponential decay over time over with increasing x, but it has a steeper slope to suppose.

128
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:47,590
On the other hand, if a lambda is equal to two and it will be flatter.

129
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,770
What has the y axis around at one half?

130
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:55,450
I looked like this.

131
00:18:56,550 --> 00:19:08,530
Now, as you can see, if you increase the lambda value from one hop to 1 to 2, what it really does to this PR function is to make it flatter.

132
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:14,110
At the zero. Right. And has heavier tails.

133
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:19,270
When I go to infinity. So what that means.

134
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:28,330
Recall that for PD out the area out of the curve basically gave you the probability of the run about it taking value in that range.

135
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:36,969
So what that means is the run environment are going to have a larger degree of spread with increased, always increasing overlap.

136
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:47,840
Then it can have larger probability of taking values that is large compared to a small outcome.

137
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:55,420
And the mean, of course, is going to shift to the right as well. That makes sense.

138
00:19:56,430 --> 00:20:00,640
But there's just this visualization just to give us a.

139
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:14,280
Give us some sense about why this alarm that would change the men and the balance of this event available was

140
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:21,870
increasing alarm that you're going to have a larger degree of spread and higher average for this random barrel.

141
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:30,049
And. Any question. But the antiretrovirals.

142
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:39,450
If you can draw a PDF function, this is always a good practice and say how changing the parameters in this distribution separates,

143
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:46,640
hence the shift of the PDF function. And then you can get a sense of how that affects the mean on the barrier itself.

144
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:58,560
The roundabout. And we know the virus is on the square.

145
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:11,930
What about the standard deviation? What's a standard deviation of X? Every square root of the barracks.

146
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:21,760
Right. And that is just so that's of exponential distribution.

147
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:27,460
So a theorem about the the mean and the various operation,

148
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:35,830
the linear transformations we recall that we learned last time that expectation is a is a

149
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:42,190
linear operator in the sense that if you have a random variable X and a constant A and B,

150
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:49,540
then for any linear accommodation or for any of the inner transformation of this random variable, if you take the expectation,

151
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:58,810
you can always express it as the right hand side, which is a linear transformation of the expectation of any operator.

152
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:07,240
And you can switch the order between this expectation operation and the linear translocation and tolerance is not.

153
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:18,520
And now we have this relation and this always holds the variance of eight times X plus B is always equal to a square time.

154
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,600
The variance of x b just goes away.

155
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:26,890
And well, let's take a look why that's the case.

156
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:36,400
Again, we can prove this using the definition balance of A, X plus B by definition.

157
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:46,020
What is that? This X plus B is also round about the transformation of antiviral cell around environment.

158
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:53,110
So what is that and how can I express this balance in terms of using this expectation?

159
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,860
It should be something square. And what should I put in the parentheses?

160
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:10,310
I was. Yes.

161
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:15,320
Is it just A plus B and a balance?

162
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:20,980
Again. Presentation.

163
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:27,190
Very good. Minus the expectation of this guy, right? That's the definition.

164
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:31,630
You just treat this as plus as a as a as a unit.

165
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:39,220
And we're talking about the variance of this particular unit. This particular retroviral X plus B as a unit.

166
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:45,490
So it's going to be the expectation of the unit itself, minus its application of itself squared.

167
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:54,610
That's the definition of variance. And now we have written out the we have written out the, the definition of the variance we can further.

168
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:04,750
Look into this parenthesis, recall that for an expectation it's a linear operation.

169
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:16,990
So we can break down the second part and we can break down this expectation X plus B into x plus B minus X, actually.

170
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:26,240
Right this way. Know it's minus B squared.

171
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:35,720
This is just a using the linear and the linear linear property of the expectation.

172
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:43,970
And then we notice that the B just cancels out. That's why B does not show up on the right hand side of the first equation.

173
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:50,870
And what's left is the expectation of a X minus x.

174
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:58,220
Square. And there's a is a constant.

175
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:03,920
So you can take it outside of this this expectation.

176
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:10,170
Now you've got a square e x minus its square.

177
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:16,910
And what it. Mr. That's just the variance of X.

178
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:26,360
All right. Now give us a square variance of X that completes the proof.

179
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:30,830
So what it tells us is that for a linear transformation of a random variable,

180
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:40,310
the variance going to be a coefficient in front of the random barrel squared times the variance of the random variable itself.

181
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:47,420
It doesn't matter whether we do a shift of the roundabout, it doesn't affect the variance,

182
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:54,080
which actually makes sense because Barron's measures the spread that the graph spread of a roundabout.

183
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:57,919
If you adjust the shift, the roundabout rule doesn't change.

184
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:01,880
The spread of the virus shouldn't change.

185
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:08,660
But if you multiply the roundabout of a by a thousand, I only change that spread right.

186
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:14,720
If we multiply by a large number, the strike going to be much, much bigger.

187
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:22,220
And actually, there is a close form of relation between how much bigger it's going to be.

188
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:29,330
It's just going to be a square. If you multiply the random variable by a, you increase the spread by eight a square.

189
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:45,370
Question. So that's a very important relation for barriers and expectation.

190
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:53,080
And another very useful formula for calculating the Barron's is this one.

191
00:26:53,200 --> 00:27:01,750
A variance of the random arrow hacks is equal to the application of x squared minus the expectation of x squared.

192
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:08,670
In other words, the second moment of the random arrow minus the first moment square.

193
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:23,820
And to say this is also very straightforward, this one line up proves all in the definition of Barron's occasional price minus yo squared.

194
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:37,030
Right and we can break down this where you got x squared minus two times at times the that plus expectation of x squared.

195
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:43,329
And now recall this expectation is a linear operator.

196
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:59,950
So we just break it down to the expectation of x squared minus the expectation of 2xx plus differentiation of expectation of x squared.

197
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:04,660
So what is the second term?

198
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:28,120
Anyone with a second term, and I further simplify the second term to unexpected two times expectation of x squared for the square outside or inside?

199
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:35,950
Outside. Very good. And the reason for that, again, is this expectation of action is a constant.

200
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:40,959
It has no randomness is just a constant, because it is a constant.

201
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:46,750
You can always take it outside. The expectation of the expectation is a linear operator.

202
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:54,610
That's why you have this two, and that's always outside of this expectation.

203
00:28:54,640 --> 00:29:05,110
What's left is just the expectation of X. Then you have to times speculation about Square and the last one again acts as a constant.

204
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:08,230
So taking another expectation doesn't do anything else.

205
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:14,680
Ignore that outside expectation because the inside it's just a constant.

206
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:19,300
So what you have is still expectation square.

207
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:25,360
And then the second, the second and third term can be combined, which end up with.

208
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:35,920
E square minus X squared, but that's another way to calculate the bounce.

209
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:41,170
If I had to go from the nomination to argue this formula to calculate the variance,

210
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:53,140
there's always the one that means this is the second order moment, not a central moment.

211
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:58,360
And so this is a central utility with the second order.

212
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:08,290
Central X is equal to the second moment of X due to the prime minus this new square, the first order squared.

213
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:13,540
So that's the relation between this second order central moment.

214
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:18,940
Yellow was baron with second, second order moment and the first order.

215
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:30,630
And from this relation we can also have a very important role,

216
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:40,270
which is the expectation of our square is always greater or equal to speculation of x

217
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:54,700
squared vs oh of course assuming the expectation of x squared on expectations that exist,

218
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,570
at least in relation I always hope. And why is that?

219
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:07,870
Yes. Variance is always bigger than or equal to zero.

220
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:11,469
Very good variance is always greater than zero. Right.

221
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:20,200
That's by definition because variance is the expectation of this non negative random variable x minus x square.

222
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:24,430
So that's always positive. One side is always non-active.

223
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:34,540
So we know the right hand side must be always non-active. And that roughly translates to the second moment of the random variable is always greater.

224
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:46,240
I point to the first moment squared, so that's a very handy inequality that has many utilities in a lot of places.

225
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:52,870
Okay, so there's always code for any random variable as long as the first and second the moment exists.

226
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:58,030
You always have this relation square, always great deal of x squared.

227
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:07,410
So the first way to prove it is to notice the balance is greater or any kind of a zero.

228
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:11,550
And here this relation, they see all of it on the left hand side.

229
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:15,990
Another way to prove it is to use the so called inequality.

230
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:31,150
Which basically tells us for any COMEX function, if he is a COMEX function, then he is always the last.

231
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:39,500
I mean, that's not the way. Expectation of GM is always great.

232
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,800
Are equal to T of expectation of x.

233
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:52,460
So this is again gen the inequality or any hallmarks function g.

234
00:32:53,750 --> 00:33:00,620
This expectation of x, which is a transformation of the random variable, is always equal to g.

235
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:04,490
Expectation of x.

236
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:17,330
Empowerment function just means if you connect any two dots from this function, a line will always lie above the function as a comment.

237
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:22,549
And it's straightforward a way to say why.

238
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:30,050
This, in a sense inequality hose is if you think about these are two possible values for the random variable.

239
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:37,070
The expectation of this g x is somewhere along this line, right?

240
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:45,170
While this g applied to the expectation of x, assume that it's your x is somewhere along the original curve.

241
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:54,620
So cause by accident, you know this straight line always lie about a curve on this convex function.

242
00:33:55,010 --> 00:34:03,650
So that's why this applied. But more rigorously you have to resort to the anthropomorphic truth of the answer.

243
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:08,600
And that's just another way to not true.

244
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:18,380
It's not the scope of this course. Bottom line is this is a very important inequality.

245
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:22,790
The expectation of our square is always going to be equal to the expectation of X squared.

246
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:30,690
Since 1990, any question? All right.

247
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:41,610
So let's take a look at another example where we want to calculate the variance of a binomial rhinovirus,

248
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:53,500
because last time we have calculated the expectation of the binomial random variable using a trick or treat nine

249
00:34:53,550 --> 00:35:06,480
complete that converges the original x times of x to be another of so that we can get rid of this summation.

250
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:14,250
Now let's try to calculate the balance of this binomial right available for ax

251
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:19,710
following this binomial distribution with a parameter and a p has its values.

252
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:30,780
X takes the values in zero one all the way to end and the probability the PM of anybody acts as and chose x times p to the x y minus and minus x.

253
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:40,470
That's the definition of a binomial random variable, and we know the expectation of x is just and times piece from last time.

254
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:43,860
And you don't recall how to calculate this.

255
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:49,230
Make sure you go back to the lecture notes and review the tree that we use.

256
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,950
It's actually a very common tree that we're going to use over and over again.

257
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:59,130
Okay, now the question is what is the variance of X?

258
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:04,110
The other words, what is the patient of X minus x squared?

259
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:13,890
Or as we have just shown, it has another formulation which is x squared minus x squared.

260
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:29,060
So it's easier to go with this formula because we already know what the ease of access, you can directly plug it in.

261
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:36,440
All we need to determine is what x squared and ask What do we need to calculate?

262
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:43,910
Once we know the popular 40 x square, we can plug it in and calculate the variance punishment available.

263
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:51,350
So I'll give you a couple minutes and you can take a shot of this, you know, that square.

264
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:04,760
And it's just a hand directly calculating this. You know, x squared may not be very easy.

265
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:12,650
Instead, think about what is the occasional E at times x minus one.

266
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:19,720
Try to calculate what this expectation of x times x minus one.

267
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:27,670
Once we have that and we can manipulate these quantity with the expectation of X to got a e of x e of x squared.

268
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:38,790
Try to use that trait that we have we have introduced over the last time to get rid of this information.

269
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:37,750
How many of you have worked it out? Show me your hands. Another meeting.

270
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:55,120
On how to make it a pimp or some other kind of miracle so that I can get a reasonable estimation.

271
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:32,370
All right. So let's take all of that together. So really the most tricky part in this problem is the summation.

272
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:37,500
I goes from zero to end and we've got to write off this summation.

273
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:41,340
And the way to do it, very similar to what do we have done,

274
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:47,250
allows time to calculate the mean of this one, a variable as to what I call complete a pump.

275
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:57,240
And you try to manipulate the term inside this summation so that it becomes a PMA or some other random variable.

276
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:05,400
We know the PMS always sum up to one. If you sum up over these as a part of the roundabout,

277
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:16,680
if you somehow manage to change this inside term to the PM of some of the other variables, then you can get rid of this summation altogether.

278
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:24,300
So that's the idea. First, let's take a look at the ranch or the support for the current round of our blocks from zero to then.

279
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:28,500
If I say equal to zero, what is the value of all this term?

280
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:33,330
Gives that summation. Oh, it's going to be zero.

281
00:42:33,530 --> 00:42:37,640
Right. Because you have an ax term here. So I say zero.

282
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:46,620
This is always zero. They don't have to worry about it. What about actually quite a1008 because you have an X minus one term.

283
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:51,780
So all we need to do is to start from and say quarter one, actually actually for the two.

284
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:58,500
And that also motivates us to think about our transformation of the random variable.

285
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:05,210
We denote this Y to be minus two.

286
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:11,790
Okay, then the summation going to be Y from zero.

287
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:18,180
In other words, as from actually closer to two and minus two.

288
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:26,450
Let's do a change of variable instead of using ask with the note line to be x minus two.

289
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:35,090
Then the summation of the range of information is from y equals zero to y minus two.

290
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:45,140
Correspondingly, what this ax become is y plus two times y plus one times factorial.

291
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:53,960
We break down this entry entries that's three times and material Y to factorial and minus one

292
00:43:54,140 --> 00:44:13,280
minus two factorial at times p to the Y to one minus P and minus y plus and minus five minus two.

293
00:44:15,410 --> 00:44:24,110
So that's what you have once you've changed the rhinovirus and the parameter and then use the same trick as we apply last time,

294
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:30,380
we can combine this with this factorial to get a new factoring.

295
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:34,549
Not going to be an factorial over y.

296
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:39,110
Factorial and minus y. Minus two factorial.

297
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:49,760
I'm key to the White House, too. One minus B, minus Y, minus two.

298
00:44:51,950 --> 00:45:00,559
Now, if you look at the range and this functional form inside the summation and reminds us of a

299
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:07,750
PMT or a new binomial distribution which only takes a variable from zero to a minus to right,

300
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:11,630
and correspondingly the probability can be P and Y minus B,

301
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:23,800
they just need to complete a piano and move any additional redundant parameters outside this summation that will give us why.

302
00:45:24,110 --> 00:45:33,080
Zero and minus two times minus one times a minus two factorial divided by.

303
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:39,770
So these end times and minus one is the redundant product that we don't really need in this new camp.

304
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:56,210
The numerator is y factorial and minus to minus y all times p to the y right times one minus p to the minus to minus one.

305
00:45:56,270 --> 00:46:05,360
That's what we need. There's a we only need a piece of the Y some additional from now we don't need as well is P squared.

306
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:17,810
So once you take these terms outside, this summation must remain as exactly the PMA or new binomial random variable.

307
00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:24,889
Right. And that is the PMA or what a binomial random variable was.

308
00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:36,270
Parameter, but. And minus two feet.

309
00:46:37,070 --> 00:46:44,150
Okay. So that's exactly the pump or binomial random arable with parameter and minus two empty.

310
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:53,870
And we know that summation is always equal to one. So what's not is just and ons and minus one Times Square.

311
00:46:58,580 --> 00:47:05,590
And that's amplified with the expectation of x minus one x.

312
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:09,950
Can I give you another minute and use this result?

313
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:18,590
Finally, derive what the balance is. Now we know the expectation of x times x minus one is this quantity.

314
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:30,960
You have this resolved to derive what the parents. Parents.

315
00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:58,870
She? Right.

316
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:04,960
I think we all got it. So to get the barrels, we just need to use this formula.

317
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:12,040
It's not a square minus expansion of X squared from this E of x times x minus one.

318
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:15,790
It's just a one step away from this expectation of x squared.

319
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:26,920
It's not our moment. All we need to do is to add the expectation of us to this quantity, and we can get the expectation of x squared right.

320
00:49:27,190 --> 00:49:36,820
Because each of the times I sign a minus one is equal to E of x squared minus x because of the linearity of this expectation operations.

321
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:43,060
All we need to do is to have this expression of X, then you can have expectation of x squared.

322
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:48,430
And once we have that term, we just put those two terms together to calculate the variance.

323
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:56,530
So once you simplify your calculation, the final result is going to be ten times P, times one minus B.

324
00:49:57,190 --> 00:50:03,010
That's the barriers for this binomial roundabout of you all got this.

325
00:50:05,830 --> 00:50:10,000
So. Yeah. So this is the mean I'm embarrassed for this random variable.

326
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,770
Again, we use exactly the same trick to calculate both quantities.

327
00:50:15,010 --> 00:50:19,570
We try to complete this part of a continuous running variables.

328
00:50:19,810 --> 00:50:25,960
We use this trick as well. We try to complete some video so that integration goes away.

329
00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:31,900
This is a very common trait that you will see a lot of usage in practice.

330
00:50:33,990 --> 00:50:55,990
All right. So let's take a break and come back and talk about what you think of, you know, these problems.

331
00:50:57,370 --> 00:51:30,730
You know, that's what this is because it's always about this question about as you said.

332
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:36,810
Yes, exactly. So that's the second. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

333
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:56,320
So, like, this is exactly what we need to find out how to respond with you, with your partner, counsel.

334
00:51:56,320 --> 00:52:25,530
So what are you going to have to try to find out since there to be honest,

335
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:43,510
I to you are also working on something the same idea that we're talking about essentially in the classroom,

336
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:51,130
I think using calculations to sort of the same goals.

337
00:52:53,350 --> 00:53:23,500
So why would you do you know, what I was trying to figure out?

338
00:53:23,730 --> 00:53:38,020
What do you want me to tell you?

339
00:53:45,560 --> 00:54:04,030
That sounds like, you know, what does that mean?

340
00:54:04,630 --> 00:54:13,810
But I don't want that to be true.

341
00:54:13,810 --> 00:54:31,700
It's not any more just because I do not think you should do it.

342
00:54:35,930 --> 00:54:41,260
You know, I was going to.

343
00:54:42,050 --> 00:55:23,500
Do you think about something like that in terms of course I want you to succeed as well, but.

344
00:55:26,590 --> 00:55:41,860
Feels a lot of value from the inside of Dashboard.

345
00:55:43,300 --> 00:56:01,700
I can't wait to talk about what we're talking about.

346
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:30,670
So it's really hard to see how things are going to become more and more.

347
00:56:31,210 --> 00:56:36,320
Have you got a copy of who she is?

348
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:47,710
Sometimes I see you as a Christian looking for the you.

349
00:56:48,010 --> 00:57:56,080
Here we go from there. I'm so excited about the fact that she wants to go back there to listen to what it's

350
00:57:56,770 --> 00:58:59,350
like to be to talk about all of the things that you have to learn more about yourself.

351
00:59:02,610 --> 00:59:05,649
I don't like being silly outside.

352
00:59:05,650 --> 00:59:08,790
I don't know if you guys have made plans this.

353
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:14,920
You know, it's the first time that I've been in Ann Arbor or Michigan.

354
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:19,390
And so this is the first time I've seen its floor. Ann Arbor, Michigan.

355
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:28,890
Just want to give you some idea or some evidence that I can participate in during the you're in the fourth grade class for the region.

356
00:59:30,270 --> 00:59:36,880
Of course, the very first thing that came to my mind is the beautiful foliage in the fall.

357
00:59:37,210 --> 00:59:44,140
So I was super beautiful during the fall, Halloween and maybe the next month or.

358
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:53,790
And if you don't mind the driving, there are only a very nice spot for the spawn so that you can go to see this fall.

359
00:59:54,880 --> 01:00:05,680
If you drive up north about four and a half miles of forest, you can go to the Mackinaw Island, which is a super beautiful island.

360
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:14,860
So you can take some time off, but it's not something that it's just check out.

361
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:26,050
And also it drives 6 hours to take photographs that's not never been there, but this super persistent notion and also if you go even farther north.

362
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:30,750
I'm going to the mountains. It's super beautiful.

363
01:00:31,770 --> 01:00:35,040
And of course, if you want to stay in Ann Arbor. Ann Arbor there also.

364
01:00:35,370 --> 01:00:38,590
You can see the leaves. Start with tennis colors. All right.

365
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:44,520
And in a couple weeks, maybe a month. Oh, will be very colorful everywhere.

366
01:00:44,610 --> 01:00:49,290
So no matter where you go, you can enjoy the numerous parks. Ann Arbor as well.

367
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:54,090
Not exactly something to to look for.

368
01:00:54,510 --> 01:01:03,900
And here is the map or the foliage. The peak of the 48 comes around them.

369
01:01:04,150 --> 01:01:09,210
All right. So we're going to show you some to keep in mind.

370
01:01:09,630 --> 01:01:19,290
And also, there are a lot of nuclear activities that I can check out in the, you know, local area.

371
01:01:20,290 --> 01:01:25,580
I don't all, as you point out, do it is probably my favorite pastime.

372
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:37,590
That's about 20 minutes drive up north. So you can take those cars not and they also have a fire pit where you can roll them out right on the spot.

373
01:01:38,670 --> 01:01:51,390
Very nice. That sounds nice. I'm going to start in a way you up, because, of course, there are a lot of other activities like warm, high places.

374
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:57,060
If you actually go to one of those places, feel free to share with the class about with the class.

375
01:01:58,050 --> 01:02:01,260
So feel free to share with me your pictures.

376
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:11,130
I kind of show it to the class. You one of the most terrifying, awful places like 30 minutes away from here.

377
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:18,359
And it will open for exciting excitement right there at that point.

378
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:19,250
This is the first time.

379
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:30,810
So what I'm trying to say is that just that towns that are overgrown, they'll help, but it's going to be Ann Arbor in the fall.

380
01:02:33,150 --> 01:02:39,540
All right. So now let's come back to what do we have not so long behind?

381
01:02:40,050 --> 01:02:45,960
Jonathan actually asked very good questions during the break. Why we actually start from this.

382
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:52,020
All right. That's actually the key point of this calculation, right?

383
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:58,020
If you missed that point, probably you don't have a hard time finding the final solution,

384
01:02:58,380 --> 01:03:03,570
but you can still probably you can still calculate that number. But it's just going to be much more complicated.

385
01:03:04,170 --> 01:03:09,239
And the reason why we start here is really twofold. First, we need to be clear.

386
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:16,380
Why don't we need to calculate the bands? And recall this is the formula for the variance.

387
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:21,390
We already know what the expectation of axis. All we need to know is the expectation of x squared.

388
01:03:22,750 --> 01:03:27,330
Right? And that is just the expectation of a quadratic term for x.

389
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:36,690
If you think about the quadratic function, actually any quadratic function of X, if you can calculate the expectation of that,

390
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:43,110
you would be able to calculate the expectation of that square because of the linearity of the expectation.

391
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:53,850
So that's the first motivation. We don't need to just, you know, stick to this, you know, x squared actually adding quadratic function of X.

392
01:03:54,210 --> 01:03:59,360
As long as we can have an easy calculation of that, we should be able to get this X squared.

393
01:03:59,380 --> 01:04:02,580
That's all right. Is that clear?

394
01:04:03,660 --> 01:04:11,670
So now the question becomes, how do we find the expectation of some quadratic form of X?

395
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:18,000
Then the next question is how do we come up with these particular quadratic function?

396
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:25,230
And that goes back to the tree that we use the last time you are to go to read on this summation.

397
01:04:26,250 --> 01:04:31,770
The main trick is to complete the piano, try to convert it to some piano.

398
01:04:32,070 --> 01:04:35,850
So then that summation going to be equal to one. We don't need to worry about the summation.

399
01:04:36,510 --> 01:04:39,810
And if you think about the actual operation,

400
01:04:40,740 --> 01:04:49,770
the way that we manipulate this term to become a piano is to break down this and choose that term and get rid of some of the terms,

401
01:04:49,770 --> 01:04:56,250
get rid of this this function by combining it with the factorial in this entry.

402
01:04:56,300 --> 01:05:01,320
That's a term that actually motivates us to think about these times.

403
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:16,890
It's minus one formula instead of x squared correctly because x times x minus one is very easy to to combine with this factorial operation.

404
01:05:18,610 --> 01:05:26,250
Okay, that's how the factory is defined. So that's the motivation of why we come up with this X minus.

405
01:05:26,430 --> 01:05:30,510
X times x minus one, the terms of those two ideas together.

406
01:05:30,930 --> 01:05:35,220
That's how we end up with this that calculation. Right.

407
01:05:35,850 --> 01:05:41,280
Does that make sense? But again, this is a very tricky calculation.

408
01:05:41,490 --> 01:05:46,470
And in practice, you may encounter other tricky, tricky calculations.

409
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:58,229
It's not always, always obvious what is the best way to go in order to calculate the variance or in order to calculate this expectation of x squared,

410
01:05:58,230 --> 01:06:03,180
you may have to try different ways until you find the right direction.

411
01:06:03,870 --> 01:06:04,620
But overall,

412
01:06:04,620 --> 01:06:15,150
this is a very common trick to use this complete the PM approach to get rid of this complicated calculation either a summation or it's an integration,

413
01:06:16,350 --> 01:06:22,350
always taking advantage of the the fact that the PM something one area integrates one.

414
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:31,110
This is p of x times x minus one equals x squared.

415
01:06:31,110 --> 01:06:36,810
Or if you have two, it's not equal. You have to do additional calculation in order to get your x squared.

416
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:41,760
So this is the exact calculation that we do here and it's not equal.

417
01:06:42,060 --> 01:06:51,990
What I'm saying is that for any quadratic function, all we need to do to get to this E8 to the square is just the additional linear operation.

418
01:06:52,540 --> 01:06:57,419
We did not a quadratic function and the linear and the expectation of X and

419
01:06:57,420 --> 01:07:01,620
that linear operation is much easier compared to this expectation calculation.

420
01:07:02,550 --> 01:07:06,190
Thank you. Right. And the other question.

421
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:14,110
Okay. So these are not properties for of our first different moments.

422
01:07:14,140 --> 01:07:17,230
First, the expectation of a house. Then it's always a constant.

423
01:07:17,590 --> 01:07:22,149
Also for the Baron's, the balance is zero.

424
01:07:22,150 --> 01:07:30,880
Then Max is to generate one. What I mean by generator is that it has it is equal to a constant with probability.

425
01:07:30,970 --> 01:07:38,470
What it is equal to a contest with probability one.

426
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:46,570
That is what it means as is degenerate. So let's take a look why that's true.

427
01:07:47,590 --> 01:07:54,250
Conceptually, it's true because we call Baron's measure the degree of spreading.

428
01:07:55,330 --> 01:08:00,010
If the degree of spread is zero. It just means that random variable doesn't spread.

429
01:08:01,170 --> 01:08:06,640
So you concentrate on a single number. That's why it acts as degenerate.

430
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:14,380
And on the other. On the other hand, if this degenerate, then the spread is zero, which makes sense.

431
01:08:14,470 --> 01:08:18,580
Right? But that's just the intuition.

432
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:25,560
The formula is. We can prove it both way first.

433
01:08:27,660 --> 01:08:29,760
If the Baron is zero,

434
01:08:31,290 --> 01:08:44,040
then we know by definition based taxation of this random variable minus the meaning of the random arrow is there on this examination.

435
01:08:44,430 --> 01:08:49,560
And now, if you think about the term inside this expectation, it's always great or equal to zero.

436
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:55,020
And it's zero only if it is zero. With probability one.

437
01:08:57,050 --> 01:09:07,750
If it if it has a non-zero probability being a positive being some other numbers, this expectation cannot be zero.

438
01:09:08,350 --> 01:09:18,400
So what that means is that this x minus x squared is zero, whereas probability one.

439
01:09:19,390 --> 01:09:25,600
And that just tells us and must be equal to a year of X with probability of one.

440
01:09:26,230 --> 01:09:34,290
And this is just a constant. So that is from left to right and from right to left.

441
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:47,550
If X is equal to A with probability one, then the variance of X by definition is the year of x minus x squared.

442
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:52,350
This year of a minus a squared, which is zero.

443
01:09:52,860 --> 01:09:57,530
Okay. Plugging in and applying the definition, you can show the viruses zero.

444
01:09:58,470 --> 01:10:04,770
So that just tells us if some random variable has zero, it just means no random variable generate.

445
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:14,490
And the third property, the variance of the random variable is always the last that my patient of this quadratic

446
01:10:14,490 --> 01:10:22,140
function of x x minus c square or A.C. not equal to the first moment or the mean.

447
01:10:25,620 --> 01:10:33,750
And that is because you can break down the second part on the right hand side to be at minus X,

448
01:10:33,990 --> 01:10:47,860
plus X, minus the square, and bring it on to x, minus the x squared plus e x.

449
01:10:50,490 --> 01:10:54,620
Yes, but see. Was.

450
01:10:56,020 --> 01:10:59,180
Yes, it's quick.

451
01:11:00,810 --> 01:11:03,880
And what I did is just a break down this square.

452
01:11:05,230 --> 01:11:09,920
One is the first time. This is the virus.

453
01:11:12,350 --> 01:11:22,840
What about the second term? The second part.

454
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:42,500
But. Now the best time to come in.

455
01:11:43,430 --> 01:11:47,640
Zero zero. Okay. Okay.

456
01:11:48,860 --> 01:11:54,270
So the reason why is zero is because this term is what, a constant, right?

457
01:11:54,860 --> 01:11:58,579
Because then we don't have to worry about constant when to calculate expectation.

458
01:11:58,580 --> 01:12:07,960
It's always been taken outside expectation because of the expectation is that within our operation they become same taxation of x minus E of us.

459
01:12:08,270 --> 01:12:11,780
Again, you know, banks as a concept, it just becomes E of X minus.

460
01:12:12,530 --> 01:12:20,089
So that's zero. And the last one is just max minus C squared because again,

461
01:12:20,090 --> 01:12:27,950
it's a constant so that I just end up with know X minus C squared and we know this squared term,

462
01:12:27,950 --> 01:12:36,590
it's always this constant is always greater or equal to zero. And this takes equality if and only if, say equal to.

463
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:40,220
Yeah, that's right.

464
01:12:42,290 --> 01:12:48,370
So we see is not equal to a year of X, then this term the last time is always greater than that.

465
01:12:48,380 --> 01:13:00,650
Give us this inequality. Which tells us if you measure that the average distance, Euclidean distance between this random variable and any number,

466
01:13:01,490 --> 01:13:08,899
any constant, that is not the mean of this amount of arrival. Then the average distance squared distance between the random variable and

467
01:13:08,900 --> 01:13:13,460
that particular constant is always going to be greater than the variability,

468
01:13:13,820 --> 01:13:24,080
than the variance of this roundabout. So the variance in that sense always measured the smallest spread of this environment.

469
01:13:25,670 --> 01:13:29,870
Okay. Questions.

470
01:13:31,900 --> 01:13:48,040
Okay. Some special moments for me as a first honor moment, which is denoted by MU, and we know it as linear linear property.

471
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:51,930
So year X plus B is equal to eight times as copy.

472
01:13:52,580 --> 01:13:55,870
And of course, then it's always equal to the concept itself.

473
01:13:56,920 --> 01:14:03,550
Second order central moment, which is also called the balance, is defined as yo x minus nu squared.

474
01:14:03,970 --> 01:14:09,100
We know it has these properties, right? Baron's x plus b is a squared.

475
01:14:09,340 --> 01:14:13,090
The parents of x a concept is always zero.

476
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:19,570
Those two moments are the most commonly used ones in practice.

477
01:14:19,810 --> 01:14:25,270
If you want to quantify the distribution around a variable, in most cases it would be sufficient.

478
01:14:25,390 --> 01:14:35,650
You just don't talk about them in the balance. But sometimes you may want to go even higher if you think about the third, almost third order moments.

479
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:40,240
Third order central moments, you can think about skewness.

480
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:46,000
But skewness is defined as the third order central moment.

481
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:50,890
So this is a position of at minus X.

482
01:14:52,830 --> 01:15:02,600
Of about three divided by this of barons to the power of three over two and 62 is just the Barron's.

483
01:15:06,820 --> 01:15:12,160
If you calculate the ratio between the third on our moment and the third on our central moment,

484
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:16,390
and the second on a central moment to the power of one at half.

485
01:15:17,050 --> 01:15:21,850
Then you get the so-called skewness of a random variable.

486
01:15:23,140 --> 01:15:30,460
And the reason why it's called skewness is that because if you look at the denominator, it's always going to be positive.

487
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:36,850
Right? But then the numerator does not have to be positive and positive.

488
01:15:38,710 --> 01:15:43,870
So this is a patient to the third power. To the third power of a function.

489
01:15:44,170 --> 01:15:49,750
Can be positive, can be an actor. It doesn't have to be always have the positive side.

490
01:15:50,020 --> 01:16:00,150
So what it means is that in Alpha three. If you think about this out of three, try.

491
01:16:03,170 --> 01:16:09,470
So our three is equal to zero. Essentially what that means is a numerator equal to zero.

492
01:16:11,270 --> 01:16:18,320
So that just tells us this distribution is going to be symmetric around zero.

493
01:16:19,460 --> 01:16:23,360
So assume this is a PDA of a random variable.

494
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:33,890
It's just going to be symmetric. If it's not symmetric, then you cannot have the third power of this expectation of this third power equal to zero.

495
01:16:35,060 --> 01:16:43,220
Actually, it's not centered around the zero. Then turn around your backs and the center around each of us.

496
01:16:45,230 --> 01:16:55,430
So in our three, the skewness is zero. It means that distribution is symmetric around the mean and its Alpha three is positive.

497
01:16:57,050 --> 01:17:00,950
It means can let this be the occasion.

498
01:17:01,580 --> 01:17:10,770
So that means. The distribution going to look like this so hard skew to the right.

499
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:23,270
So it has a heavier tail on the right hand side and a lighter tail on the left hand side.

500
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:30,410
It looks like a lean towards the lot. So it has a longer tail toward the right.

501
01:17:31,220 --> 01:17:40,070
And that is because if you have a lot more tail toward the right, then that's going to have outliers that is on the right.

502
01:17:40,340 --> 01:17:45,350
So the expectation of this X minus expectation of X to the power of three is going to be positive.

503
01:17:47,270 --> 01:17:58,040
So skewness greater than zero means of diffusion is skewed to the right, and if skewness is less than zero, then it's going to be skewed to the left.

504
01:17:59,270 --> 01:18:04,910
It looks like this. Still you.

505
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:10,360
So that is what the skewness is capturing.

506
01:18:11,290 --> 01:18:16,600
Basically, whether a distribution is symmetric are skewed to the latter or skewed to the right.

507
01:18:17,860 --> 01:18:23,019
So that's the third moment, not directly using the third moment or the third central moment,

508
01:18:23,020 --> 01:18:29,440
but rather a completion of the third central moment over just a.

509
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:41,180
Our term. The second note, our central moment. And if you want to go even further to the fourth moment, that tells us that is upon us.

510
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:51,060
The fault order central moment divided by the barren square.

511
01:18:53,910 --> 01:19:00,900
So that is defined as Catholicism. In order about this offer for Catholicism, that is even more subtle.

512
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:02,970
It's even more implicit.

513
01:19:03,630 --> 01:19:22,650
So what it tells us capturing is the so-called goodness of or flatness of our distribution in comparison to a normal distribution of the four.

514
01:19:23,430 --> 01:19:27,460
First of all, we can notice that Alpha four is always equal to zero, right?

515
01:19:27,780 --> 01:19:31,170
The numerator and denominator always has to be positive.

516
01:19:31,710 --> 01:19:41,160
If our four is larger than it means the distribution of PDI, it just becomes.

517
01:19:44,940 --> 01:19:48,590
Taller and skinnier.

518
01:19:52,470 --> 01:20:04,890
And if our floor is smaller, close to zero now it's just become shorter and flatter so that what the process is about and for normal distribution,

519
01:20:05,370 --> 01:20:10,800
which we are introduced later, any kind of novel distribution,

520
01:20:10,980 --> 01:20:23,730
whether it has me in whatever media matters from the novel distribution is a catalysis is always going to be equal to a constant that three normal.

521
01:20:25,190 --> 01:20:30,830
Distribution of or it's always a four to.

522
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:48,740
Great. And so that's why normal distribution is sort of treated as a reference when you talk about tall versus short, skinny versus flat.

523
01:20:49,190 --> 01:20:58,130
We're talking about the comparison with the normal distribution and not just the standard normal distribution, but at a normal distribution.

524
01:20:58,460 --> 01:21:11,770
Okay. So you have a battleship that has crosses three, no matter whether it's a core and skinny shape or a short and flatter battleship.

525
01:21:11,930 --> 01:21:15,709
As long as it's about ship, it has those as three as eyes.

526
01:21:15,710 --> 01:21:26,660
This analogy of vision. It has those as three. But if you are a distribution, look like best example of that class and distribution.

527
01:21:28,010 --> 01:21:31,400
Right? It's color, but skinnier.

528
01:21:31,670 --> 01:21:45,670
So it will have a larger Catholicism. On the other hand, if you have a flatter and shorter distribution, that is going to be closest last three.

529
01:21:46,490 --> 01:21:53,420
And so this is just something to know about.

530
01:21:53,870 --> 01:21:58,730
And in practice, again, as I mentioned, McNamara's are the most important ones.

531
01:22:05,900 --> 01:22:10,150
I sense. Right.

532
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:21,879
Okay. So now that's one of the most important properties for Rent Marigold is the Chevy shows inequality again.

533
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:27,220
This one is super important and probably going to see a lot of application of this.

534
01:22:28,540 --> 01:22:34,830
You know, if you decided to continue learning about mathematical statistics and immigrants,

535
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:41,950
that these inequality is the most important inequalities in statistics.

536
01:22:42,610 --> 01:22:44,920
So it sounds like this is super elegant.

537
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:55,300
We know the median advanced or the median application of a random variable which is denoted by Neo and Sigma then or any positive constant.

538
01:22:56,170 --> 01:22:59,470
And we always have these inequality.

539
01:23:00,490 --> 01:23:11,350
The probability of this run of variable minus the median, the absolute value of that difference is less than a sigma.

540
01:23:11,830 --> 01:23:16,510
This probability is always greater or equal to one minus one over case.

541
01:23:18,390 --> 01:23:31,060
All right. So this applies to any class that if K is equal to one now, just means probability of x minus mu.

542
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:40,540
The absolute value less than sigma, less than the standard deviation is always greater equal to one minus one over one,

543
01:23:40,630 --> 01:23:57,040
which is zero, which is trivial, right? But if K is greater than one, then the right hand side is going to be less than one and a greater than zero.

544
01:23:59,110 --> 01:24:03,370
Right. It tells you how to then the right hand side is going to be greater than zero.

545
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:10,240
So that becomes non-trivial. And I would say for any case, any positive a number, there's always.

546
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:21,710
Now let's take a look at how improvements for simplicity.

547
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:37,710
Let's just assume X is a continuous minor variable. But there's also this theorem also hold for a discrete or mixed type of random variable.

548
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:43,200
But for simplicity, let's just assume as it is contained and see why that's the case.

549
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:56,610
So, you know, Sigma Square, which is a variance of X, is defined as expectation of X minus Mu Square.

550
01:24:59,820 --> 01:25:17,160
That's the definition and a continuous reminder variable that makes process that gives infinity infinity x minus mu square and the pdf of ask yes.

551
01:25:18,270 --> 01:25:25,200
And again its definition so far we just apply the definition.

552
01:25:25,830 --> 01:25:37,870
And from there the trick is to break down this integration into different parts so that we can consider whether the difference,

553
01:25:37,870 --> 01:25:43,580
the absolute difference is greater or equal to okay sigma or okay, so.

554
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:58,440
So the way to break it down is to consider three intervals infinity to mu minus a sigma.

555
01:26:25,410 --> 01:26:34,930
It's just great. This integration from nickname invented it to infinity into three segments negative infinity to mu minus

556
01:26:35,010 --> 01:26:41,460
a sigma meaning minus case think about 2 million plus case sigma and new plus case sigma to infinity.

557
01:26:42,090 --> 01:26:56,280
I just don't have space. So you plug in the same quantity here and then you can take us, you know, try to, to,

558
01:26:56,280 --> 01:27:05,670
to use the inequality to say whether you can get from here to this finite inequality.

559
01:27:05,970 --> 01:27:14,580
And I'll give you a couple minutes and you can try to apply some of the inequalities so that you end up with these charity shops.

560
01:27:17,670 --> 01:27:26,340
Think very carefully why we want to break down this integration into the three parts, why it is the meal minus T, Sigma and AMU plus.

561
01:27:26,350 --> 01:27:29,490
It makes sense in this case.

562
01:28:14,780 --> 01:30:12,249
Since. All right.

563
01:30:12,250 --> 01:30:22,390
So let's look at this together and say, how can we go from here to this finite inequality and think about the inequality on the left hand side,

564
01:30:22,440 --> 01:30:36,159
what that means, what that probability is really representing the probability of X minus mu last on case sigma in terms of the using this integration.

565
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:42,490
What that means is the integration or once you step.

566
01:30:45,500 --> 01:30:51,430
What that is is a probability of X plus.

567
01:30:51,440 --> 01:31:01,190
The MU plus is greater than mu minus three sigma.

568
01:31:02,060 --> 01:31:05,600
Right. So that's what was on the left hand side.

569
01:31:06,170 --> 01:31:17,540
And in terms of integration, that's the integration from MU minus Sigma TMU plus Sigma AX.

570
01:31:18,860 --> 01:31:26,570
Yes, that's just an area under this PDR function from Myanmar's case, Sigma TAMU plus case.

571
01:31:28,250 --> 01:31:35,000
All right. So that's both on the left hand side. That's why we want to break down this integration into this three parts.

572
01:31:37,730 --> 01:31:50,450
As long as we can evaluate this term integration of PD out on this interval for if we can evaluate the integration on the to complement,

573
01:31:52,360 --> 01:31:58,010
you kind of have a good characterization of the left hand side. We can go either way, right?

574
01:31:58,130 --> 01:32:03,740
Either evaluating on the left hand side directly or evaluating the complement of

575
01:32:03,740 --> 01:32:09,590
the left hand side by breaking down this integration into the three intervals.

576
01:32:09,950 --> 01:32:20,150
What do we mean? I mean, notice is that on this first interval, the ax is always lost or equal to mu minus eight sigma.

577
01:32:21,780 --> 01:32:28,810
Right. And if you calculate X minus New Square, what is that going to be?

578
01:32:30,910 --> 01:32:42,340
That's always going to be what let's plus in quantity for x minus means square axes the last night new minus eight sigma.

579
01:32:46,940 --> 01:32:51,170
Okay. Right.

580
01:32:53,160 --> 01:33:02,820
X minus Mile Square is always going to be greater or equal to k squared times the square forces on the negative side.

581
01:33:03,930 --> 01:33:12,480
So I'm aware of this part since we know it's always greater after Amu plus sigma, we can have the same inequality.

582
01:33:12,900 --> 01:33:17,340
X minus New Square is always going to be greater to K Square.

583
01:33:17,670 --> 01:33:23,840
Sigma Square. All right. And what about the Madam Chair?

584
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:35,460
Well, ask me. Anywhere between a meal minus sigma and a meal plus sigma.

585
01:33:36,050 --> 01:33:44,270
So the Madoff part, we don't really know what exactly that corresponds to in terms of inequality,

586
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:53,510
but at least one thing that we can know is that that's always greater or equal to zero because it's an integration of a non-active function.

587
01:33:54,080 --> 01:33:58,730
Right. Now, put everything together. One we can count as a inequality.

588
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:07,540
These three parts, if you add them together, it's always going to be greater or equal to a square Sigma Square.

589
01:34:07,580 --> 01:34:14,360
That is the term a lower bound, this x minus new square for the first time and for the master arms.

590
01:34:14,630 --> 01:34:26,480
The integration of 19 infinity new minus K Sigma Union U plus a sigma to infinity.

591
01:34:27,470 --> 01:34:30,920
And that is a function.

592
01:34:32,470 --> 01:34:32,950
All right.

593
01:34:35,020 --> 01:34:47,530
There are unclear how we got from the previous formula to this new law about all we did is to notice that advance is less than numerous cases.

594
01:34:47,530 --> 01:34:51,639
Sigma X minus New Square is always greater because of case square.

595
01:34:51,640 --> 01:34:56,050
Sigma Square. Same for the third term and the maiden term is always going to be zero.

596
01:34:56,680 --> 01:35:05,260
So putting all three together, we have these inequalities and now what is the integration?

597
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:16,100
What does the integration mean? What if this integration of PDA on these.

598
01:35:22,720 --> 01:35:27,550
That's a probability. Right. Whenever you integrate a PDF, you always got a probability.

599
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:37,980
So what is that probability? Let's look at this integration.

600
01:35:38,010 --> 01:35:41,940
What does that represent in terms of the probability?

601
01:35:51,780 --> 01:35:59,690
I use the left hand side and I go one minus the left hand side, one minus the left hand side.

602
01:35:59,700 --> 01:36:08,310
Very good. And if I run out of the probability, that's going to be the probability of falling into this two intervals.

603
01:36:09,640 --> 01:36:14,060
Right. That's exactly the definition of CDP.

604
01:36:14,070 --> 01:36:17,850
If we do the integration. We got the area under the curve.

605
01:36:18,100 --> 01:36:24,390
Right. The area under the curve just gave us the probability of the random variable falling into those intervals.

606
01:36:25,590 --> 01:36:35,700
If you right about about falling to these intervals is equivalent to say x minus mu is the absolute value is greater than a thing about.

607
01:36:42,630 --> 01:36:53,100
Thus the interval corresponding to this to the unit if it's to animals x minus meal, absolute value greater than K Sigma.

608
01:36:54,480 --> 01:37:01,500
If you look at this term that we got is very close to what we are after it just to the opposite side.

609
01:37:02,070 --> 01:37:09,590
Okay. And that is tells us if you take one minus, you've got that right now putting everything together.

610
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:16,530
What do we have achieved so far? Sigma Square is always greater, equal to a square.

611
01:37:16,710 --> 01:37:25,740
Sigma Square probability of X minus new Y, greater or equal to a stable.

612
01:37:26,640 --> 01:37:31,350
Again, here, the quantity doesn't change anything because it's a continuous random variable.

613
01:37:32,580 --> 01:37:45,180
And what that tells us is the probability of minus mu absolute value greater or rewards of a case sigma that's are equal to one over square.

614
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:53,340
So the probability of x following an interval is lost or equal to one over square.

615
01:37:53,790 --> 01:37:58,650
Of course, if you put in one minus on both side of the equation, you've got.

616
01:38:07,060 --> 01:38:10,570
This is now the left hand side.

617
01:38:10,870 --> 01:38:14,890
It's exactly what you need on the left hand side.

618
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:23,000
Now complete approval for this Chevy City quality.

619
01:38:23,420 --> 01:38:32,810
So really the key is to break down this integration into three parts and then apply the inequalities accordingly.

620
01:38:35,660 --> 01:38:39,740
You. Any question.

621
01:38:45,430 --> 01:38:52,510
And the motivation of why we want to break it down into three parts comes from inside.

622
01:38:52,990 --> 01:38:54,730
If you write out the left hand side,

623
01:38:55,000 --> 01:39:04,960
not just tells us What do we care about the integration of the PDF in this middle interval where you miss two complement complementary intervals.

624
01:39:05,890 --> 01:39:12,640
So that motivates us to break down this Barron's calculation to the three of us and then apply inequality.

625
01:39:13,240 --> 01:39:18,180
Once we do that, we end up with this. This.

626
01:39:21,930 --> 01:39:33,840
So again, very important the inequalities and in many cases if you are dealing with inequalities form probability, especially involving me and barons.

627
01:39:34,230 --> 01:39:37,980
Think about using this chubby chopsticks. It's fun to help you with the company.

628
01:39:45,370 --> 01:39:53,180
That's all right. And that's all about the moments.

629
01:39:53,720 --> 01:39:57,650
And next, let's talk about moment generating function.

630
01:39:58,520 --> 01:40:06,710
Okay. So then I'm stuck on why it's called the moment generating function because it's so very related to moments.

631
01:40:07,810 --> 01:40:12,010
The lack and spread of arable with the city of this capital.

632
01:40:12,010 --> 01:40:19,899
Our acts of acts none the moment generating function or omg of of acts is denoted by

633
01:40:19,900 --> 01:40:29,710
this capital home of acts with respect to a t new variable that is defined in this way,

634
01:40:29,950 --> 01:40:35,739
and so is to the expectation of e to the power of science for this year.

635
01:40:35,740 --> 01:40:42,969
That is a natural number and to the power of t times acts and is the run of arable t

636
01:40:42,970 --> 01:40:53,290
is a parameter is a parameter for the function to forget everything about the name.

637
01:40:53,590 --> 01:40:57,700
This is essentially just the presentation of some function for the roundabout.

638
01:41:00,640 --> 01:41:09,310
If the function particularly to take this form e to the power of T s, then we kind of moment generate function and practice.

639
01:41:09,310 --> 01:41:13,870
We only care about this function for our T in some name, our point of a zero.

640
01:41:16,190 --> 01:41:20,390
Empathy is exactly zero. One. What does this become?

641
01:41:24,480 --> 01:41:28,890
What is IMAX zero or any random variable?

642
01:41:35,190 --> 01:41:38,670
That's an easy question. Don't overthink this one.

643
01:41:40,050 --> 01:41:45,360
So I got one right because e to the power of zero is one.

644
01:41:45,870 --> 01:41:49,590
That's a constant. This is always one. Okay.

645
01:41:51,210 --> 01:41:56,970
The one we care about for a moment generally in function is just the T in some neighborhood of zero.

646
01:41:57,630 --> 01:42:03,210
We don't need the T to be very large or very small. It only has to be close to zero.

647
01:42:04,830 --> 01:42:08,130
We only care about those waiting, and we'll see in a second why that's the case.

648
01:42:09,160 --> 01:42:16,530
The other words we only care about a small interval is such that he is greater than active age and last age.

649
01:42:17,020 --> 01:42:23,130
And if in that interval, this E expectation of E to the power packs exist,

650
01:42:23,400 --> 01:42:26,910
then we call the moment generating functioning of this for the right of our whole.

651
01:42:27,750 --> 01:42:32,190
Otherwise we say that the job does not exist at.

652
01:42:36,870 --> 01:42:41,440
So it acts as container. You can write out the formula explicitly.

653
01:42:41,460 --> 01:42:46,440
That's going to be the integration from infinity to infinity of this function.

654
01:42:46,590 --> 01:42:55,950
Times the pdf of X and a practice described that is just a summation of this integration to the summation because as I said,

655
01:42:55,950 --> 01:42:59,759
the definition is just the expectation of some function of the random variable.

656
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:04,560
So we just use the definition of expectation to write out the focus,

657
01:43:05,700 --> 01:43:13,260
which in my case is that we actually can further simplify this integration so that it has that explicit form.

658
01:43:16,530 --> 01:43:21,180
I hear the theorem connecting the moment, generating function and the moments,

659
01:43:21,480 --> 01:43:27,930
and also telling us why it has a name moment generating function that acts as moment

660
01:43:27,930 --> 01:43:37,620
generating function and acts of t then we know and moment like this mu and prime.

661
01:43:38,490 --> 01:43:39,540
Not a central moment,

662
01:43:39,540 --> 01:43:50,210
but the moment of our moment e to the power of x10 is equal to the and the derivative of this moment generating function evaluated t.

663
01:43:54,000 --> 01:44:03,090
And the moon and moment and the gravity of this moment generating function at zero is defining this way.

664
01:44:03,510 --> 01:44:08,580
It's a derivative of the power and evaluate a t for a zero.

665
01:44:08,640 --> 01:44:17,100
The first take. That's all the derivative of this function is risk factor t and they're evaluated at 2.0 and.

666
01:44:20,940 --> 01:44:25,530
So that's why this is very close. And I relate it to the moments.

667
01:44:26,700 --> 01:44:34,830
Once you have this energy up, all you need to do to get to the moment is to take the derivative and then evaluate the function at zero.

668
01:44:35,940 --> 01:44:44,040
And then it gave you the moments. X So it greatly simplify the calculation of, of moments in many cases.

669
01:44:46,890 --> 01:44:54,270
So let's say why that's the case, why we have such a relationship between the moments and the derivative, our moment generating function.

670
01:44:57,410 --> 01:45:01,600
To recall a first take a look at first on our moment.

671
01:45:20,990 --> 01:45:23,150
And for simplicity, users fascinated me.

672
01:45:24,440 --> 01:45:32,560
Just assume the run of our boys continues, and then by definition, the moment generating function is just a key to the power of acts.

673
01:45:33,780 --> 01:45:36,950
Acts? Acts. Yes.

674
01:45:37,860 --> 01:45:46,790
All right. So that's our MGM. If I take the first R derivative with respect to T under some regularity conditions,

675
01:45:46,790 --> 01:45:52,810
it can switch order with this integration which has arisen with respect to this.

676
01:45:53,810 --> 01:45:59,720
So the derivative is in respect of T, but integration is raised with respect to acts.

677
01:46:00,110 --> 01:46:09,640
So we can switch out of the two of that and was is the over t t e to the tax facts.

678
01:46:10,910 --> 01:46:20,770
It's. So what is the derivative of e to the key acts with respect to t?

679
01:46:23,590 --> 01:46:31,280
There's times the tax write off tax hikes.

680
01:46:31,990 --> 01:46:38,140
Yes. Now you can see why we want to evaluate evaluate this term.

681
01:46:38,620 --> 01:46:44,740
T zero because one's T on a zero. This term, this nasty guy just goes away.

682
01:46:45,730 --> 01:46:49,570
All that's about is just at times attacks of X.

683
01:46:50,350 --> 01:46:54,160
And we know exactly what that is. That's our expectation.

684
01:46:54,850 --> 01:46:57,880
And that's why if you evaluate this first order moment.

685
01:46:59,860 --> 01:47:05,620
Of MGM at 12 or zero. Not exactly gave us, guys.

686
01:47:07,860 --> 01:47:10,950
Similarly, if you take higher order.

687
01:47:24,430 --> 01:47:34,990
If you take the thought out of this moment generating function, you can essentially do the same thing by switching the order of this integration.

688
01:47:40,690 --> 01:47:52,330
And the derivative which gave us a C and E, t, e, t and x.

689
01:47:54,730 --> 01:47:58,080
Now all we need to do is to evaluate this, okay?

690
01:47:58,600 --> 01:48:14,020
And evaluate this term that's going to be you can take the derivative and then the pi and to the end power.

691
01:48:14,110 --> 01:48:18,520
It will say this is going to be as to the power of that.

692
01:48:19,030 --> 01:48:27,250
Okay. And e to the text times about sex yet again evaluated on t zero.

693
01:48:27,580 --> 01:48:33,460
This just goes away to one and upwards is just the ease of access to the power of it.

694
01:48:36,430 --> 01:48:44,210
So that's why. The ends are derivative.

695
01:48:44,640 --> 01:48:50,430
Well, MGM evaluated 91 zero. Just gave us the end moment for the right amount.

696
01:48:52,110 --> 01:48:57,420
You can imagine in practice, if you can easily get the MGM out of a run a variable,

697
01:48:57,840 --> 01:49:03,540
then you can use this use this relation to calculate any order of moment.

698
01:49:04,980 --> 01:49:09,240
It's always easier to calculate the remedy, not to calculate the integration.

699
01:49:09,420 --> 01:49:19,170
Right? You can always calculate the derivative of this moment, generally in function, evaluating ante or zero at the moment and moment or moment.

700
01:49:22,590 --> 01:49:26,580
Any question. All right.

701
01:49:26,590 --> 01:49:34,870
So let's take a look at this example and say, why don't we value that idea to calculate different order of moments for this random variable and.

702
01:49:39,160 --> 01:49:48,690
But on the interest of time, let's just look at this together. And so ACT is a common distribution which has a PDF following this formula.

703
01:49:49,620 --> 01:49:54,300
Okay, so access here x is also exponential.

704
01:49:56,130 --> 01:49:59,245
Then you need to calculate the moment that.
