1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,380
After watching this video,

2
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,040
you will be able to use
PROC NPAR1WAY to calculate

3
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,695
a Wilcoxon rank-sum test for

4
00:00:16,695 --> 00:00:20,310
non-normally distributed
continuous variables.

5
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,030
Let's go back to our algorithm.

6
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:24,285
In the last video,

7
00:00:24,285 --> 00:00:26,820
we took about not much data and

8
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,105
continuous variables that
are normally distributed.

9
00:00:30,105 --> 00:00:31,950
Now, we will look at

10
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,125
the other branch of the
continuous variables,

11
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:35,820
the ones that are not

12
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,830
normally distributed
as highlighted here.

13
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:42,620
We're going to use
the same example

14
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,255
that we used for the last videos,

15
00:00:44,255 --> 00:00:46,970
our study sector session
of a study, and remember,

16
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:50,425
our outcome is abdominal
obesity. Yes, no.

17
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:53,210
But now we are going to use
a continuous variable that

18
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:55,790
is not normally distributed,
such as income.

19
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:58,610
Our hypothesis is that income is

20
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:03,190
going to be inversely associated
with abdominal obesity.

21
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:05,405
It makes a lot of sense that

22
00:01:05,405 --> 00:01:06,995
income will be highly skewed,

23
00:01:06,995 --> 00:01:09,335
but we need to
double check always.

24
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:11,420
Remember that the first
thing you have to

25
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,985
do is to check the distribution.

26
00:01:13,985 --> 00:01:16,235
If it happens to be
normally distributed,

27
00:01:16,235 --> 00:01:19,730
we will conduct an t-tests
as we did in our last video.

28
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:21,635
If it's not normally distributed,

29
00:01:21,635 --> 00:01:22,975
we can do two things.

30
00:01:22,975 --> 00:01:25,620
First, we can transform
the variable.

31
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,710
For example, log
transformations of

32
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:30,665
a skewed distributions are
often normally distributed.

33
00:01:30,665 --> 00:01:32,420
For the purposes of this class,

34
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,040
we're not going to
transform the variable,

35
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,785
but we're going to conduct
a non-parametric test.

36
00:01:36,785 --> 00:01:40,255
Let's first see the distribution
of the income variable.

37
00:01:40,255 --> 00:01:43,215
As we were expecting
this is highly skewed.

38
00:01:43,215 --> 00:01:46,490
Again, you don't need to look
at the normality test since

39
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:48,080
it's pretty obvious that this

40
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,870
is not normally distributed.

41
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:53,960
Since income is not
normally distributed,

42
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,520
we are going to run a new test,

43
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,925
the Wilcoxon rank-sum test,

44
00:01:58,925 --> 00:02:02,745
also known as
Mann-Whitney U test.

45
00:02:02,745 --> 00:02:06,495
This is the non-parametric
version of the t-test.

46
00:02:06,495 --> 00:02:10,650
You may be wondering what
is a non parametric test?

47
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:13,000
Well, a non-parametric
test does not

48
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,255
assume any underline
distribution,

49
00:02:16,255 --> 00:02:19,360
like for example, a normal
distribution in this case.

50
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,610
It can be applied when
those conditions for

51
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:24,235
the parametric test are not met.

52
00:02:24,235 --> 00:02:26,230
Here we have a normally

53
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:28,540
distributed variable
and we note that one of

54
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,460
the conditions to run a t-test is

55
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,925
that the variable has to
be normally distributed.

56
00:02:32,925 --> 00:02:34,290
Says it's not.

57
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:37,500
We can run this other test
that does not require that.

58
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,940
The PROC to do that is
brought in by one way.

59
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,834
It has a similar syntax

60
00:02:42,834 --> 00:02:44,590
to PROC the tests
in the sense that

61
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:45,730
the outcome is [inaudible]

62
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:47,670
the class statement and

63
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,630
exposure in the
various statement.

64
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:53,390
Don't forget to include the
option Wilcoxon here since

65
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:57,895
PROC NPAR1WAY can be used for
other non-parametric tests.

66
00:02:57,895 --> 00:03:01,280
The first thing you can notice
is that this procedure is

67
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,295
not giving you means or
standard deviations anymore,

68
00:03:04,295 --> 00:03:06,415
but some of the scores.

69
00:03:06,415 --> 00:03:08,120
You can actually ignore that

70
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,935
because this is not
telling you much.

71
00:03:09,935 --> 00:03:11,990
I'm not going to go
into the details

72
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:13,730
of how a test is actually done.

73
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:14,990
We're going to focus on

74
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:17,290
selecting the correct
p-value in this case.

75
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:20,175
SAS will give you four
different p-values,

76
00:03:20,175 --> 00:03:22,295
two using the normal
approximation

77
00:03:22,295 --> 00:03:24,575
and two using a t approximation.

78
00:03:24,575 --> 00:03:28,165
Two of them are one-sided and
two of them are two-sided.

79
00:03:28,165 --> 00:03:29,680
As a general rule,

80
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,895
we always tend to use
two-sided p-values.

81
00:03:33,895 --> 00:03:36,985
Regarding normal or
t approximation,

82
00:03:36,985 --> 00:03:40,240
although there are some reasons
to use one or the other,

83
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,055
we will use the normal
approximation for now.

84
00:03:43,055 --> 00:03:48,655
If you do that, you can see
that your p-value is 0.8388,

85
00:03:48,655 --> 00:03:50,515
which is basically telling

86
00:03:50,515 --> 00:03:52,630
you that you fail
to reject the null.

87
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:55,810
It looks like the potential
differences between income by

88
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:58,090
abdominal obesity are not really

89
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,874
statistically significant.

90
00:03:59,874 --> 00:04:02,170
Note that this output does not

91
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:04,690
provide you with any
descriptive statistics.

92
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:07,360
The next slide, you will
see that you will still

93
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,955
need to do a PROC means
on your income variable.

94
00:04:10,955 --> 00:04:13,595
Here, as I mentioned
in the previous slide,

95
00:04:13,595 --> 00:04:15,470
I'm running up PROC
means because I only

96
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,690
got a p-value from
the previous score.

97
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,060
But I did not get any mean
or standard deviation

98
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,845
to report in my table 1.

99
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:24,280
You will have to do
that separately.

100
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,665
Know that for highly
skewed variables,

101
00:04:26,665 --> 00:04:28,290
some people prefer to report

102
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:30,575
medians and interquartile ranges.

103
00:04:30,575 --> 00:04:32,350
In this class, we
will still report

104
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:34,740
means and standard deviations.

105
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,095
In summary, in this video,

106
00:04:37,095 --> 00:04:40,685
we learned how to use PROC
NPAR1WAY to calculate

107
00:04:40,685 --> 00:04:42,560
a Wilcoxon rank-sum test for

108
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,274
non-normally distributed
continuous variables.

109
00:04:45,274 --> 00:04:49,280
In the next video, we will
move in too much there.
