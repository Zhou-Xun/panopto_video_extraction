Hello everyone, my name is Asia Island.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:13,880
I am a current graduate student at the School of Public Health here at the University of Michigan in the Health Behaviors Health Education Department.

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:18,640
I'm also an ex-participant of the FPHLP program from the summer of 2017,

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:26,950
in addition to working with FPHLP now, as the evaluation assistant. So for today, we're going to dive into the graduate school presentation.

5
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:30,940
Starting off with, what is a graduate school?

6
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:38,220
So graduate school is an advanced program of study, focused on a particular academic discipline or profession.

7
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:44,070
In contrast to undergrad, where students are required to take courses in multiple academic disciplines,

8
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:49,440
grad students can focus all of their time on setting a specific subject.

9
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:56,130
So some key takeaways from here is that graduate programs are hyper focused on a particular academic discipline,

10
00:00:56,130 --> 00:01:01,840
and it's also suited for those who want to expand their skills and knowledge on a specific subject.

11
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,450
But what is the purpose of grad school?

12
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:11,080
So the purpose of grad school is to increase one's knowledge and skills in a particular sector or subject. For some careers

13
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:16,480
and in some cases, it helps with career advancement or establishing career pathways and interests.

14
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:25,960
For instance, if one is applying to the government sector, some steps may require a graduate degree or a certain level of experience.

15
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:36,160
It also gives students the opportunity to practice their skills in various ways, including through research labs and applied practice internships.

16
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:43,810
So why did I go to grad school? I went to grad school because I wanted to expand my knowledge and to develop practical

17
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:48,730
skills that I could use to improve the health of people that looked like me. Through graduate school,

18
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:56,020
I have gained more skills than I could have imagined. Opportunities have been abundant and the learning lessons were invaluable.

19
00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:06,240
I couldn't imagine having this much access to professional and personal growth in such a short amount of time anywhere else.
