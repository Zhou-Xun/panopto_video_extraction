1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:16,549
So I want to remind you that the proposal, the first half of the proposal draft is due next week.

2
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:20,690
So it's just half of it and it's just a draft. It's not the whole thing and not the final.

3
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:32,720
So next Friday, you need to have a draft of the background for your your project, the significance and the aims.

4
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:39,469
And then I'm going to assign peer reviewers for those,

5
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:47,090
and we're going to use the second half of class next week to I'm going to let you do the peer review in class.

6
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:55,520
So make sure that you submit your assignment before class or at the very beginning of class.

7
00:00:55,550 --> 00:01:01,790
That way I can assign a peer reviewer to you and you can get the peer review piece done in class.

8
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:07,400
Do you have any questions about the about the proposal?

9
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:13,190
Just be. Yeah. Patricia, does the do the aims include her policies?

10
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:20,659
They can. So if it depends on how how well-researched your area is.

11
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:30,020
So if you're doing something that's very preliminary, like there's not a lot of evidence to support a hypothesis yet, then you can just have aims.

12
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:38,100
Your study can be more exploratory. But if there is a literature that you're kind of building on, then I think it's nice to have hypotheses.

13
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:43,520
So it will just sort of vary from project to project, but all of them should have aims.

14
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:51,790
Yes. What's. That's a good question.

15
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:55,400
I mean, look, the whole thing isn't very long.

16
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,460
The whole thing is ten pages.

17
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:31,530
You know, I say orange peach. So you have to have your background and significant section.

18
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:35,690
This is where you're going to do a kind of your literature review.

19
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:50,190
And introduction, then you're going to have your specific aims and hypotheses, and then you've got research, design and methods and timeline.

20
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:56,160
I would say I don't have page numbers in here,

21
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:03,479
but I would think that your background and significance and specific aims and hypotheses might be slightly longer than your research,

22
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:13,810
design and methods depending on your project. So like some of you are proposing primary data collection, so you're proposing primary data collection.

23
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:17,940
You're probably going to need to spend more time explaining how you're going to collect the data,

24
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,730
how you're going to retrieve the sample, like all that kind of stuff.

25
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,430
Whereas if you're using an existing data source, you just need to say what it is and briefly describe it.

26
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:32,190
So it would also probably depend on the methods that you're using, too.

27
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:42,630
So some of you might be proposing to use some kind of sophisticated statistical method, and you might need more room to explain that.

28
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:48,809
Whereas if you're doing something more straightforward, then you probably don't need a lot of room for that.

29
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:59,100
So I think the how long each section will be will depend on your project a little bit, but I would expect that most of the projects,

30
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:04,200
the background, the significance and specific names and hypotheses would be longer than the research design.

31
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:15,770
So that how. There are questions about the.

32
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:23,810
Did anybody try to get office hours today and you weren't able to find out?

33
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:31,250
Cause I only have two appointments today, and I wasn't sure if it was because the Cowin lead wasn't working.

34
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,240
Okay, so it must be fine. Okay. Um.

35
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:57,190
You feel okay about it? Oh, and just to let you know so I won't get feedback on this draft.

36
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:06,460
Like, you're just going to get feedback from a peer. But the feedback that the peer gives you, you're not being graded on that.

37
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:15,040
It's just feedback for you. And like, if you want feedback from me, make an appointment for office hours and and we can go through it,

38
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:22,230
especially after you get your peer reviewed feedback. If you're like, Oh, this is didn't go well then let's meet and talk about.

39
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:42,150
Parents. All right.

40
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,319
So this is the last week that we're going to be talking about social status and health.

41
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:53,910
And then next week we start the final section of the class, which is on social context and health.

42
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:58,390
So I don't know about you, but I feel like the semester is going really fast.

43
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:06,069
Okay, so a few other people feel like this. Um, so this is, this is our last week on social status and health.

44
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:14,050
So we're talking about sexual orientation and gender identity. And I want to start with a little bit of public opinion data.

45
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:22,380
And this is and I'll read this to you because I know they're tiny,

46
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:32,850
but what I want to point out is that public opinion about controversial social issues tends to change pretty slowly over time.

47
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:46,140
And so what I have up here is the percent of U.S. adults who say abortion should be legal or illegal, and it's the time lag is from 1995 to 2015.

48
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:52,920
And yes, the top line is it should be legal in all or most cases.

49
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,430
And the bottom is it should be illegal in all or most cases.

50
00:06:56,730 --> 00:07:01,350
And you can see that over time. It's like it's pretty steady.

51
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:06,480
It hasn't changed that much and it's around.

52
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:16,200
So in 1996, 57% of U.S. adults said that abortion should be legal in all or most cases.

53
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:20,250
And by 2019, it was pretty much the same at 61%.

54
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:34,830
So very flat. And then I want us to compare that to the really massive shift in public opinion on LGBT rights over the past two decades.

55
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:46,500
So here in the left, the question is, do you think gay or lesbian relations between consenting adults should or should not be legal?

56
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:58,110
So the line is should be legal going up on gay overtime and then the dark green line, it should be illegal.

57
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:05,550
And you can see it going down. Then you've got do you think marriage is between same sex couples should or should

58
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:10,410
not be recognized by the law as valid with the same rates as traditional marriages?

59
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,830
The white green is should be valid and the dark green issue should not be valid.

60
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:20,550
And you can see these actually cross over time.

61
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:31,260
So support for gay marriage more than double over this time period from 27% in 1996 to 63% in 2019.

62
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:36,419
And the percent of U.S. adults who believe that consensual same sex behavior

63
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:47,940
should be illegal has fallen from 47% in 1996 to 26% over the same time period.

64
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:57,479
So really, really dramatic shifts, although is it surprising to anyone to see that in 2019,

65
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:02,190
26% of people thought that same sex behavior should be illegal?

66
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:06,870
I mean, I think that's I find that a little bit surprising.

67
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:10,770
That still seems quite high to me, actually.

68
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:17,459
But I put these here to sort of point out that there has been these really dramatic

69
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:23,640
changes in public opinion over just the last few decades that has given rise to increased

70
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,990
interest in studying the health of sexual and gender minorities who continue to face

71
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:32,910
stigma and discrimination despite these sort of rapidly changing societal attitudes.

72
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:43,559
And we'll talk more about that. But I just want to point out that in 1996, I was in college, which doesn't feel that long ago to me.

73
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:51,210
Maybe it seems like a long time ago to you. But in 1996, half of adults in the US thought that same sex behavior should be illegal.

74
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:59,160
Like, it's just. It's like, shocking to me how much that has changed in a relatively short period of time.

75
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,720
So I want to start, like we do basically every week with defining the concepts that we're trying to study.

76
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:19,220
Thinking about how to measure this in the context of quantitative health research.

77
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,490
And I want to after we do this, I want to get to the point that sort of Abbott's question.

78
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:32,900
I want to I want to come to that after we talk about all of the sort of typical public health approach to studying this thing, right?

79
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:41,450
So this definition of sexual orientation comes from the Institute of Medicine Committee on Lesbian,

80
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:45,950
Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Health Issues and research gaps and Opportunities.

81
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:56,600
That's the entire name. So this was an Institute of Medicine Commission that came together in 2011 to do this sort of big report.

82
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:06,340
And they defined sexual orientation as an enduring pattern of or disposition to

83
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:12,790
sexual or romantic desires for and relationships with people who have one same sex.

84
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:25,390
The other sex for both sexes is not very clear, but is like the most challenging to read and first definition ever, in my opinion.

85
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:33,790
But I don't know that I can come up with a better one. The IOM definition focuses on biological sex, so you see that in there.

86
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:38,980
But sexual orientation could also be defined on the basis of gender identity.

87
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:51,320
And so we typically think of sexual orientation as having three components attraction, behavior and identity.

88
00:11:56,230 --> 00:12:02,380
And so the first one, attraction or desire, is about romantic or sexual feelings.

89
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,000
Behavior is about sexual or romantic activities.

90
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:26,520
And then sexual attraction and behavior are often thought of as being on a continuum,

91
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:32,280
from being exclusively oriented toward others of the opposite sex or gender identity,

92
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:36,480
to exclusively oriented toward others of the same sex or gender identity.

93
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:38,330
I know you are.

94
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:46,230
You know, I feel like I'm a ninth grade health teacher, but I just want to make sure we're all on the same page with kind of these definitions.

95
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:57,930
All right. And so then in contrast to attraction and behavior, how do you how would you think of identity?

96
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:25,840
If you had to define sexual orientation identity, what would you say?

97
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:50,050
Maybe it's easier to think of some examples of identities.

98
00:13:50,070 --> 00:14:06,310
What are some examples of identities? Great game.

99
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:09,670
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Straight, gay, bisexual.

100
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:14,500
Right. These are about identities, about how people classify themselves sexually.

101
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:23,050
And so the three main categories that people have used in research are heterosexual or straight, gay or lesbian and bisexual.

102
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:34,950
And so for most adults, sexual attraction, behavior and identity are sort of consistent.

103
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:38,910
But that's not the case for everyone.

104
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:46,980
And so that kind of I think what's important to think about here in terms of once we get to thinking about measurement and conceptualization,

105
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:52,710
is that the different components of sexual orientation aren't necessarily interchangeable.

106
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,400
So we can't assume that someone who reports same sex attraction also identifies as gay.

107
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:07,920
Yeah. Yeah.

108
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:13,910
I mean how any kind of differentiate.

109
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:23,150
Romantic attraction. Sexual attraction like.

110
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:35,290
Yeah. Attraction is its. Okay.

111
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:43,270
I don't know. Like, I challenge this definition. You think it's like a supper?

112
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:47,170
It would be a separate component. Something different from that, hopefully.

113
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:53,210
Yeah. Yeah. This. Yeah.

114
00:15:54,650 --> 00:16:00,800
No, I think that's a great point. And I think it is true that any time we start to try to define these things,

115
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:10,190
there can be disagreement over the definition of that and that it is really important that when we're studying something,

116
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:18,500
we very clearly define what we mean, because that's important both for how we want to measure something,

117
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:24,920
but then also for like sort of the validity of our claims and the interpretation of our.

118
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:27,889
And so it's not, you know,

119
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:35,030
with some of these things like you're saying it's not but this this definition is wrong or right or the definition that's wrong or right,

120
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:39,170
but that we have to hear about what we're studying or something.

121
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:47,290
Any other thoughts on this? The definition of these definitions.

122
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:55,660
Yeah, but I don't love. Yeah.

123
00:16:56,630 --> 00:17:08,630
Yeah. Any other thoughts or comments on these definitions?

124
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:22,990
So then the term sexual minority refers to people whose sexual orientation differs from the majority.

125
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:30,219
So that can include people who self-identify as lesbian, gay or bisexual.

126
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:36,490
But it also may include someone who self-identify as a straight, but it's mostly attracted to people of the same sex.

127
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,060
So it can include a lot of different people.

128
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:57,620
All right, so now let's define gender identity. So gender identity refers to a person's perception of their own gender.

129
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:04,990
We talked about this a little bit last time. You could identify as a man or a woman?

130
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:14,330
Both neither. And then when a person's gender identity matches the sex that they were assigned at birth, they're referred to as cisgender.

131
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:19,340
When their gender identity differs from their natal sex referred to as transgender.

132
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:28,350
And then there's some kind of related concepts here so we can think about gender expression.

133
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:41,310
And so this is talking about the manifestation of characteristics of someone's personality,

134
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:47,730
their appearance, their behavior that is culturally constructed as masculine or feminine.

135
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:54,580
And we talked about this last time when we talked about sex and gender.

136
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,860
So we talked about some different expressions of femininity.

137
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:04,240
So that could be things like wearing high heels.

138
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:10,600
That's part of an appearance. It could be things like being warm and nurturing.

139
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,530
Verses expressions of masculinity.

140
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:24,980
So if you think about dress, maybe that means wearing a suit and tie or behaviorally being aggressive because they're just two examples.

141
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:34,670
Then there's this idea of gender role conformity.

142
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:46,110
And that's the extent to which a person's gender expression adheres to the cultural norms for someone of their biological sex.

143
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:53,190
So like is your gender expression matching what society expects for you?

144
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:07,880
Gender dysphoria refers to a feeling of discomfort with one's assigned sex at birth.

145
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:18,480
And then the term gender minority refers to people whose gender identity or gender expression differs from the majority.

146
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:26,110
And I put here at the bottom. Gender minority does not equal sexual minority.

147
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:33,760
Transgender people can have any sexual orientation. Being a gender minority doesn't automatically make someone a sexual minority.

148
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:52,790
Any thoughts about these definitions here around gender identity and related concepts?

149
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:11,370
Okay. So let's talk about measurement. All right, so we want to measure sexual orientation.

150
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:24,060
How would we do that? Yeah.

151
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:32,050
Right. Okay. So you could do a survey and you could ask, like, what would you ask people what they perceive?

152
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:38,950
Okay. What do you perceive your sexual orientation to be and what would be your response categories?

153
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:49,960
Let's be. Okay so like the identity, like you would measure identity self reported.

154
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:54,510
Can you think of any other ways you might measure sexual orientation?

155
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:06,190
Yeah. You could ask. Yeah.

156
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:17,630
So you could ask questions about attraction. You have to ask about behavior.

157
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:29,690
Right. So you could also ask these questions about behavior. So I'm just going to show you some recommended questions from this website, LGBT Datacom.

158
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:34,100
So this is Randall. So Drexel develops this website.

159
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:38,840
And so these come these are real questions that come from different surveys.

160
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:43,819
So the identity question comes from the National Center for Health Statistics.

161
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:50,750
So they do like enhance National Health Interview Survey and.

162
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,450
I think purpose also comes under NCAA jobs.

163
00:22:54,510 --> 00:23:01,049
But so the question that they've included in a number of surveys is this question know that you that you sort

164
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:05,940
of thought of first do you consider yourself to be and then the categories are heterosexual or straight,

165
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:10,170
gay or lesbian or bisexual. Those are the options. We'll talk about that in a minute.

166
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:17,790
In terms of behavior, this question comes from purpose.

167
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:23,489
The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey. During the past 12 months, have you had sex with only males?

168
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:36,740
Only females or both males and females? And then there's the attraction question that comes from the National Survey of Family Growth,

169
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:41,150
and it says people are different in their sexual attraction to other people.

170
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:49,849
Which best describes your feelings or are you only attracted to females, mostly attracted to females, equally attracted to females and males.

171
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:52,820
Mostly attracted to males. Only attracted to males. Not sure.

172
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:08,880
So there are some studies that do have questions about all three of the components, while others just ask about one or two.

173
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:17,990
That's fairly common. The decision about which components to measure depends in part on your research question.

174
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:31,400
You know. So can you think about a kind of study where you would really want to measure behavior?

175
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:38,540
Like what kind of study would would that be the most important thing?

176
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:43,510
Yeah. Risk of something like HIV aids. Explain sex.

177
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:47,379
Yeah. So if you're interested in something like a risk of HIV, right,

178
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:52,990
you're going to be much more interested in behavior than you are in identity or it's more attraction.

179
00:24:53,080 --> 00:25:00,580
Right. But you know, what's a kind of study where you might be interested in identity rather than behavior?

180
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:06,630
Like you don't actually really care about behavior. You care about identity. When might that be more important?

181
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:18,010
Yeah. Maybe discrimination, stress.

182
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:22,400
Yeah. So maybe if you're interested in stress or you're interested in discrimination,

183
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:26,229
you're interested in like and mental health or things that are related to stigma.

184
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:29,530
You might be much more interested in studying identity, right?

185
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,870
Also, I think the age of the respondents really matters.

186
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:45,690
So let's imagine you're studying adolescence. What would you want to measure for adolescents?

187
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:56,970
Do you think? Yeah, I remember attraction.

188
00:25:57,030 --> 00:26:04,309
Okay, just. Is that what you're gonna say? Yeah. Like, you probably don't really want to study behavior for adolescents.

189
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:11,299
A lot of adolescents aren't sexually active. Identity can be really in flux in adolescence.

190
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:14,570
And so that might not be the best way to capture what you're interested in.

191
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:19,640
So it really does depend on kind of the age of of respondents.

192
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:24,320
So. Oh, I just said that. All right.

193
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:31,790
So what do you think? And I know you think this you know, you think these questions are limited because I could see your faces when I was reading it.

194
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:38,630
So what are some limitations of these kind of questions and and measures?

195
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:50,500
Yeah. Jackie. Okay. Okay.

196
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:55,870
So that's part of it. Yeah, but some of them are too.

197
00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:00,720
To. Deep. Tell me what you mean.

198
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:07,780
Well, I just mean in terms of, you know, uh.

199
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:21,760
So like with the behavior question in particular, this is like sensitive to ask people in a survey and so that could be,

200
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:26,470
um, are you thinking that that could be problematic in terms of.

201
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:33,320
Well, tell me why you think it might be problematic in a survey to ask something really sensitive.

202
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:38,300
I think it does move for my.

203
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:49,180
People might not tell you the truth. People might feel judged by the question.

204
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:53,290
Colin, did you want to say something? No, I just. Just a bias.

205
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:56,760
Oh, okay. Yeah. So you could have information bias.

206
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:01,800
It's like if people don't you don't want to report this, particularly if you think about.

207
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:06,500
Right. It's a telephone survey. So you're actually talking to a person.

208
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:12,559
A lot of times these types of questions, people will use computer assisted interviewing so that you give somebody a laptop.

209
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:16,760
And so they're not like talking to a person to try to get around that.

210
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:21,830
I mean, this is true for all kinds of things that are things that that we measure in health studies.

211
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,720
But yeah, so that could be that could be an issue.

212
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:32,340
Subjunctive. You like?

213
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:35,800
Exactly. Yeah.

214
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:40,280
So this might be people may I think your larger point people might understand

215
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:45,260
these questions kind of differently now but you want to say something about. Yeah, because yeah.

216
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:53,180
Like how people define females or males. Yeah. Like depending on what that question.

217
00:28:54,230 --> 00:29:00,040
If you have partners who are transgender, for example, that is a different behavior than it.

218
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:09,350
Are your sources gender? Yeah. Yeah. And so just under like understanding what these questions mean and can be sort of challenging,

219
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:14,750
particularly as ideas about gender and and gender identity change.

220
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:21,650
So like you can also think about generational differences. Like some of these questions might make perfect sense to people who are like 50,

221
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:26,030
but to people who are 20 and maybe like, I don't know, I don't know where you're talking about.

222
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,870
Like, this just doesn't make sense. But that my experience.

223
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:38,770
Know, any other kind of limitations on these types of questions?

224
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:45,129
Yeah, sure. Yeah. Yeah.

225
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:48,700
So asexual is kind of like not represented in here.

226
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:55,300
I mean, they do have they do have not sure here as an option.

227
00:29:55,300 --> 00:30:01,390
But yeah, it kind of assumes that you're not asexual and not the options aren't an option or even there.

228
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:17,480
I think also to some extent, these questions assume that these things are fixed over time, which they're not.

229
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:27,469
We know that. And so these answers don't necessarily necessarily reflect sexual orientation at different points in the life course,

230
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:31,340
which could really be important for the health outcome that you're studying.

231
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:43,120
So they're definitely limited. Let's talk about measuring gender identity.

232
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:52,660
So the World Professional Association for Transgender Health recommends a two step method for measuring gender identity,

233
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:57,230
with the first question being, How do you describe your gender identity?

234
00:30:57,250 --> 00:31:02,830
And these are all of the options that they have with an option to fill in the blank,

235
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:10,090
to get around the kind of possibility that the option that that someone would select isn't included in the list.

236
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:17,440
And then the second question they recommend is what sex were you assigned at birth on your original birth certificate?

237
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,930
The respondents can select male or female.

238
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:34,280
So if you think back to the Meyer paper that you read for today, this isn't actually how burford's I suppose it's slightly different in purpose.

239
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:38,540
It's not the recommended way, but we'll talk about that when we get to that.

240
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:45,979
Talking about that paper. That's so I think we talked about this last week.

241
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:51,760
But, you know, questions about gender identity are becoming more common in epidemiologic studies.

242
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:55,810
But most surveys don't include questions about gender identity.

243
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:59,060
It's just one question like, are you male or female?

244
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:22,969
And that's kind of it. So I want to stop here at this part and I want to I want to go to Abbott's question from the discussion board.

245
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:30,710
And so I bet your question was what would public health scholarship that destabilized identities and selves look like?

246
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:37,280
So can you talk about that in the context of what we've just discussed in terms of measurements and definitions?

247
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:44,650
I can try to. Okay. Yeah, well.

248
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:51,410
My what I said in my comment is the most that I've thought about it.

249
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:55,400
Right. It was very preliminary thoughts, but totally fine.

250
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:01,150
I mean, yeah, I guess in the context of this discussion,

251
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:06,630
some of it is kind of captured by the fact that attraction, behavior and identity don't always cohere.

252
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:16,630
Mm hmm. And, like, my interest is in how identities are always formed.

253
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:32,500
However. And so it's like I'm assuming that there is like assuming that like, oh, I am a gay man and that has I'm signing up to something.

254
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:37,630
Well, first of all, being myself, that has changed dramatically.

255
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:41,600
Right. And for many people, that is the case, even people who are not sure.

256
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:50,590
And so that the existence of this phenomenon, which are like kind of like common interior spaces, kind of.

257
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:55,870
Destabilize the entirety of a coherent and consistent.

258
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:07,540
So I make it work. I think it helps that anybody have questions about that or reactions to that.

259
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:22,670
Yeah. Boehner. My parents.

260
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:44,280
How? Describe.

261
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:51,309
Yeah. Even if it were fixed, it would still be difficult to capture, to quantify,

262
00:34:51,310 --> 00:35:00,130
to measure in this way that we like to measure things in public health or really any quantitative kind of discipline.

263
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:07,810
But then it's also this is something that can shift over time within a person and probably does

264
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:15,220
for lots of people or most people even shifts over time as part of the developmental process.

265
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:21,490
But it is also interacting with like with the broader culture because you're

266
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:25,840
saying not only have your ideas about your own sexuality changed over time,

267
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:32,640
but the vocabulary around it has changed. And that's something that's that's outside of the person, right?

268
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:35,920
That's something that's happening in the in the broader culture.

269
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:48,160
And so sometimes, you know, we may not even be able to identify ourselves in a particular way until there is a name for that or a label for that.

270
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:55,240
And so that's something that's happening outside of the person. Is that kind of where you were going a little bit?

271
00:35:55,750 --> 00:36:02,110
Yes. Yeah. Any other comments or thoughts about that?

272
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:16,890
I mean, all of the things that we've talked about over, you know, over the course of this term so far, they're all hard to measure, right?

273
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:21,570
Like socioeconomic status is hard to measure. Races hard to measure.

274
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:29,760
Sex. Gender. Hard to measure. And so this is another one.

275
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:35,040
But it's like I think it's it's more complicated in these ways that we're talking about here.

276
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:45,129
I also wanted Abbott to get to this other part of your question and I want to hear what

277
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:50,950
you what you mean and what you think about is queerness oppositional to public health?

278
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:59,440
Yeah, I can. So this is pretty much a great theory, right? Like, this is like, very like so there's this book called No Future.

279
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:06,660
And the book is about how. Yeah.

280
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:10,690
I'm sorry. You know, this is relevant. Now, it's completely, really good, I guess.

281
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:14,960
Completely irrelevant saying it might not be relevant, but if it's not, I wouldn't have written it off.

282
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:26,280
This book, which I'm reading right now, talks about how some queerness, not any LGBT person, but like, uh,

283
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:37,999
like the political idea of what it means to be queer is at odds with the idea of, like, reproductive futurism.

284
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,690
The idea that,

285
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:50,660
which I'll explain is the idea that like the entire idea of like what politics exist for is like creating a better and brighter future for our kids.

286
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:56,420
Mm hmm. And the problem with that, it's rooted in reproduction and reproduction.

287
00:37:56,450 --> 00:38:04,459
And for people that are engaging in reproduction, usually sometime again, at any given LGBT person can put the idea of what it means to be queer.

288
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:09,530
It's like you're not having kids, you're prioritizing pleasure, you're having sex.

289
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:15,770
And there is actually like that book is written by a gay man. And it's like, I mean, there's a truth to that.

290
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:27,229
It's like and therefore his his conclusion is that being where is actually at odds is sort of like what is expected of the dominant social order.

291
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:33,330
And that's actually something we should embrace. That is that is sort of our position.

292
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:40,670
And it's Bush's sort of. Bush's ethics and society that.

293
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:45,020
So my question is, if is public health not sort of predicated on the same.

294
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:49,940
Said. Futurism? I don't know.

295
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:54,300
So that's where it that's where I'm going. I'm going to dig into it a lot more as I.

296
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:02,750
What do you guys think? What is the we?

297
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:09,500
I think this is a really important question. I think there's a lot of assumptions inherent in public health, not just this one,

298
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:17,030
but many others that have sometimes gotten us in trouble with things like eugenics and in history.

299
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:25,280
Right. So like, what are some of the underlying assumptions and values of public health?

300
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,070
Maybe. Let's talk about that.

301
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:34,240
So you forget about this stuff for a minute and let's just talk about what are the underlying assumptions and values of public health.

302
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:44,680
You know, this isn't a perfect answer to that question, but it is related to something that's been happening around my brain a lot lately,

303
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:54,070
which is like similar to at this point of public health, exists in a very political sphere and space, especially the like, constructive.

304
00:39:56,370 --> 00:39:57,750
Uh huh. Uh huh.

305
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:07,580
And because of that, like the way that public health constructs health problems can often exist to reinforce existing power structures.

306
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,130
So, like, I'm thinking about this a lot.

307
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:15,370
That's like my project for this class is more like teen pregnancy, which I would argue is not a health problem.

308
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:20,150
But that would be a lot of people in public health would disagree with me.

309
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:23,040
Yeah. So, I mean, so I don't wanna interrupt you too much,

310
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:28,209
but I just want to remind everybody that when I showed you in the lecture that the sort of racial

311
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:33,550
disparities stuff that I was showing you that were slides that were put together by Kaiser Permanente,

312
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:39,400
going through all the different outcomes where there's racial disparities, a teen birth rate is one of the things that's included in there.

313
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:44,110
And I think that it's also part of like healthy people, 20 or whatever it is now I'm 30.

314
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:48,600
That's one of the indicators for looking at disparities.

315
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:55,269
So yeah, go ahead and get a question. Yeah. Public health, the system defines health problems.

316
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:59,340
So like, I don't know, I'm kind of familiar with you as we're talking about like progressive future sometimes.

317
00:40:59,410 --> 00:41:01,300
Like, is that like,

318
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:09,790
is that why help is so wonderful problem is but what it's like how I'm like how is that socially constructed within public health to

319
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:17,170
reinforce existing power structures and like doesn't have to be or can we take like a critical public health plan and deconstruct that?

320
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:24,399
Or then do we get like, I don't know.

321
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:29,140
I don't know. I, I, here's what I heard.

322
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:38,260
Maybe there was more to it. But what I was hearing you say is that part of what public health does is it defines

323
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:47,680
things as problems in a way that is somewhat politically influenced and of course,

324
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:57,700
like culturally. But I our influenced and that isn't questioned.

325
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:05,950
But there. What's on that?

326
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:12,420
What was the original question? What are the the values and underlying assumptions of public health?

327
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:18,630
I mean, you know, it was the U.S. Public Health Service that ran the Tuskegee experiment.

328
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:28,020
Right. It wasn't like some, you know, weirdo researcher somewhere who ran the like the federal government.

329
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:35,070
Risk reduction. Okay. Risk reduction, which is an interesting.

330
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:39,879
The conflict related to my question is Curtis an opposition Republican in some way?

331
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:50,590
I like gay sex practices far. Riskier as defined by their higher HIV transmission because of biological factors.

332
00:42:50,880 --> 00:43:08,020
Yeah. So risk reduction being a value of public health and how that value differs differentially impacts various groups and can create stigma.

333
00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:12,400
I think so. Think about, you know, monkey pox, right?

334
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,940
Like we just kind of have gone through monkey pox.

335
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:26,680
And which group was at highest risk of monkeypox. Men who have sex with men.

336
00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:32,350
Right. And I remember the first article that I read about it in The New York Times,

337
00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:41,070
and it was talking about men who have sex with men are at higher risk of monkeypox, but literally no explanation for why I was think.

338
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:45,420
Why can you? Because I didn't know anything about it.

339
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:57,270
Right. I was like, Why? And then there was all this stuff where, like, public health people didn't want to stigmatize men who have sex with men.

340
00:43:57,270 --> 00:44:03,599
So they kind of weren't talking about it. But then, like, I don't know how much you know about that.

341
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:07,680
I don't know that much about it. I just know what was like kind of reported in the news.

342
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:16,770
But it was this thing where public health officials weren't sure how to talk about this because of the history of stigmatizing

343
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:24,720
men who have sex with men when it comes to HIV and AIDS and all the implications of that stigma for treating AIDS.

344
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:31,920
And so they were like there was some hesitation to talk about it because of stigma.

345
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:36,540
And so I wonder what your thoughts are on that.

346
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:41,890
Like, how should public health officials have talked about and addressed monkey pox?

347
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:48,960
Do you think? You may have to make these decisions one day.

348
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:58,830
You may work in a health department and you have to figure out who are we going to target with messaging about this particular.

349
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:15,930
President. Like I didn't put it in third party.

350
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:21,530
I think there needs to be collaboration.

351
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,910
The Health Department at.

352
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:40,560
And also to figure out the best way to go from has been spoken about our participants of this organization so they would know the best way to.

353
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:50,710
Yeah. So I may not have representation, as, you know, adequate representation of the public health workforce.

354
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:58,870
I call him. Huh?

355
00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:03,930
And explain why. Is that why?

356
00:46:04,290 --> 00:46:08,430
Uh huh. Why? They're more like.

357
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:12,540
Really? Uh huh. Just.

358
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:21,110
I feel like that's better, because if you just, like, try not to try to avoid it, um.

359
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:25,460
Try to avoid those things. I feel like that's more.

360
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:30,590
I don't know how to say that. It's like. Under the ground.

361
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:34,129
But yeah, it can create its own problems if you don't explain,

362
00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:41,600
because when people can imagine what like mechanism is and they might like completely not understand.

363
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:48,440
Yeah. Yeah. Olivia is going to jump out of the fields in public health.

364
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:54,850
We like to think that we have the. The scientific facts and we just put those out there.

365
00:46:55,190 --> 00:46:59,730
I go and pick them up in the nicest way possible, even though that's not usually what's going to happen.

366
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:05,250
Having grassroots people involved in that can kind of help shift the lens or at least make us think.

367
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:08,009
Use an example. It's so not related to this,

368
00:47:08,010 --> 00:47:15,450
but I work in this cohort study that follows children for a very long time and we noticed that kids eat or drink a lot of soda.

369
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:19,080
Yeah, which contributes a lot to obesity, all that kind of stuff.

370
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:24,059
And the public health messaging around that was don't drink soda, drink water.

371
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:29,459
It's better for you. True. I can't argue that, but people are doing it.

372
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:34,500
And we did this really cool, small, kind of ethnographic, epidemiological,

373
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:39,959
mixed message approach where I followed ten families and realized the issue is more

374
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:43,200
that within those families there's intermittent water within those households.

375
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:47,130
You don't know when it's going to come. And so when that came out, it for a really long time.

376
00:47:47,370 --> 00:47:52,650
Then it gets kind of dirty. So you really use the water more for bathing, washing dishes, but you don't drink it because it's not safe.

377
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:58,799
So then it was realizing once you brought these people in, they're not drinking water because they don't believe it to be safe.

378
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:01,980
And in most parts it's not. So soda was way safer to drink.

379
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:08,910
Not related to this, but pulling people in from the people who actually experiencing it can help you kind of shift the public health lens of, oh,

380
00:48:08,910 --> 00:48:14,910
there's something else going on here that I didn't even think about was going to be happening here that you can use to then shift your approach.

381
00:48:15,570 --> 00:48:22,590
I think it is related to this too, because a lot of the messaging around soda is also stigmatizing.

382
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:27,360
So like there were these campaigns in the U.S., I don't know if you remember these.

383
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:32,639
They were on the side of busses. There would be like a little adorable girl, like holding a cop.

384
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:37,020
And it said, May I have more diabetes, please? Do you remember these ads?

385
00:48:38,130 --> 00:48:41,610
I think I was a post-doc when this when this came out.

386
00:48:42,030 --> 00:48:45,860
Yeah. And so there's some of that.

387
00:48:45,870 --> 00:48:56,729
There's also a lot of talk around, like food stamps and should sugar sweetened beverages be excluded from that?

388
00:48:56,730 --> 00:49:04,530
So I think that there is like stigma and stuff that gets mixed up even with like soda.

389
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:07,410
Caitlin And then Abbott You look like you're thinking about something.

390
00:49:07,490 --> 00:49:13,140
Caitlin I guess it wasn't like super relevant to that, but I think they take your whole perspective.

391
00:49:13,290 --> 00:49:17,430
You think it's really important to present the facts and, and like have that knowledge.

392
00:49:18,630 --> 00:49:24,300
Like, it's possible to see that like your family. Why? There's like no reason like presented in the article.

393
00:49:24,510 --> 00:49:30,190
But I also think it's important my impression of people because how like, you know,

394
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:36,350
the public being able to see it all and I certainly feel like it kind of gives you an idea

395
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:44,129
that and I don't know I guess not really trainable perspectives of like pop on fact based

396
00:49:44,130 --> 00:49:52,350
and like yeah that you need information about like how something is transmitted who at

397
00:49:52,350 --> 00:49:57,540
risk but then also you need to bring in this component of how do you communicate that?

398
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:05,040
I mean, I was left reading this art. I left I finished reading this article thinking, is monkeypox sexually transmitted?

399
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:08,670
Literally, I was like, maybe it is.

400
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:18,390
I don't know. And so that's terrible that you can be left like literally having no understanding of the of the transmission of something,

401
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:22,230
but just knowing this group is at higher risk.

402
00:50:22,650 --> 00:50:27,130
But what are you thinking on that? Yeah. So I'm another public health system.

403
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:31,800
I think another public health value. Is that being sick? Mm hmm.

404
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:36,630
There's definitely some truth to that, I would say.

405
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:46,460
But. But but with that, I'm working through a puzzle in my head because being LGBT there used to be a sickness.

406
00:50:46,470 --> 00:50:50,340
Yes, it used to be seen as a sickness, an actual mental disorder.

407
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:53,580
Yeah. And so being trans is still a mental disorder.

408
00:50:53,790 --> 00:50:57,329
Yeah. Yeah. Is recognized as such. So what.

409
00:50:57,330 --> 00:51:04,560
I think what my conclusion is that in a very symbolic sense that queerness is oppositional to public health

410
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:10,120
because of the history and the social meaning of growing up or being LGBT still has stigmas wrapped up.

411
00:51:10,770 --> 00:51:13,880
Yeah, that's just I think that was motivating my comment on that.

412
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:20,469
That's a great point Erica was interested in.

413
00:51:20,470 --> 00:51:27,790
How about the fact that small. Uh huh.

414
00:51:28,150 --> 00:51:39,910
I'm always like, okay, I not really going to read, you know, the philosophy, everything like, um, especially like the new way that people are.

415
00:51:39,910 --> 00:51:46,720
Like, I don't think it's like I look at it, you know, my middle, you know, like middle class people.

416
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:53,440
I mean, that's like. It's very, you know, like, I think a lot of American.

417
00:51:55,330 --> 00:52:00,430
But it's just interesting that, you know, like I feel a lot of assumptions always come to balance.

418
00:52:04,890 --> 00:52:10,840
Okay. Yeah. Like pathologizing groups.

419
00:52:10,850 --> 00:52:15,259
I mean, I definitely think that's, um, that is true.

420
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:24,890
And that is part of public health focuses on, like you said, Abbott's sickness and illness and the spirit.

421
00:52:25,470 --> 00:52:31,700
And, and that is like we don't focus on wellness.

422
00:52:32,990 --> 00:52:38,899
Um, we don't focus as much on, although there is more focus now on resilience.

423
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:48,640
But even that is contentious. And I think some of you brought that up in your comments about the Hudson Bueller papers who think you know,

424
00:52:48,650 --> 00:52:58,010
is it you who is talking about um had some viewers comment about the Asian American and Latino

425
00:52:58,010 --> 00:53:08,270
participants showed mental distress at lower rates than expected and therefore it must be because of.

426
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:27,890
Uh huh. And so. I was thinking.

427
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:35,930
Yeah. I think I'm a different person. Yeah.

428
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:51,690
Then also. Yeah.

429
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:57,759
So just kind of like, okay, we've got to like racial minority groups.

430
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:02,799
We're going to like say this applies to all groups. We're not going to look at variation within.

431
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:07,150
And then also I think we're going to assume that there must be the presence of some

432
00:54:07,150 --> 00:54:14,600
protective factor that's driving this without actually looking at that or measuring,

433
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:20,490
um. Yeah.

434
00:54:22,610 --> 00:54:29,020
Yeah. If anybody familiar with like that and B over that kind of resilience literature.

435
00:54:30,030 --> 00:54:37,389
Talking about that in other classes. Did you say good and bad?

436
00:54:37,390 --> 00:54:39,040
And yes, it doesn't matter. As an undergrad,

437
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:47,900
you talked about that because it sort of implies that if you're suffering from illness or aggregate level of your population of suffering disparities,

438
00:54:47,950 --> 00:54:51,890
you're just not. You are lacking that.

439
00:54:52,070 --> 00:54:56,560
Yeah. There's something about the group that is weak or something, I mean.

440
00:54:56,900 --> 00:55:07,160
Yeah, but I think there's also kind of, um, a little bit of debate and discussion over this idea of,

441
00:55:09,110 --> 00:55:15,580
of resilience as being like, why should I have to be resilience?

442
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:23,480
You know, we shouldn't be focused and maybe it's the same kind of idea we shouldn't be focused on.

443
00:55:24,810 --> 00:55:30,930
Things that are characteristics or of individuals are things that are modifiable at the individual level.

444
00:55:30,930 --> 00:55:37,200
To promote health outcomes, we need to change the structures and the systems that give rise to these inequalities in health.

445
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:44,730
You know, because I think a lot of the resilience literature, literature is focused on, okay,

446
00:55:44,730 --> 00:55:54,090
we can't change systems of oppression, so how can we target things that are modifiable in order to improve health outcomes?

447
00:55:54,090 --> 00:56:04,730
And I think that comes from maybe like a well-meaning place, but can be perceived as problematic by people who are being told to be more.

448
00:56:07,010 --> 00:56:12,000
Right? Yeah. Cynthia. Yeah.

449
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:26,030
Yeah. Yeah.

450
00:56:26,070 --> 00:56:32,700
So there's a kind of a big literature on things like religiosity and spirituality as being

451
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:38,330
like a coping resource that particularly protects the health of black people and the earth.

452
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:48,210
But there's kind of a lot of research on that. Um, there's also some work that's focused on, of course, social support,

453
00:56:48,810 --> 00:57:02,129
a lot of that there's work on eating patterns and how like comfort eating is used as a coping resource comfort.

454
00:57:02,130 --> 00:57:07,800
Some of the other ones ah that are, they're usually a sort of like optimism.

455
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:13,529
There's another one. So there's kind of like personality factors that people look at them like the

456
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:18,090
interpersonal things and then things that people would consider more cultural.

457
00:57:23,170 --> 00:57:29,590
And I usually like the way you look at that is you're looking at like and you can do it two ways.

458
00:57:29,590 --> 00:57:38,440
You can look at an interaction. So let's say you use wake race as your exposure and then let's say cardiovascular disease is your outcome.

459
00:57:38,710 --> 00:57:42,940
Then you would look at interactions with things like social support.

460
00:57:43,930 --> 00:57:51,130
So you would find overall being black compared to being white is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease.

461
00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:59,020
But then you look at an interaction with social support and you find that the risk is lower for black people.

462
00:57:59,020 --> 00:58:02,349
You have higher levels of social support versus lower levels of social support.

463
00:58:02,350 --> 00:58:06,000
So it's like a buffer if you think back to like the person.

464
00:58:06,010 --> 00:58:12,010
When we talked about Berlin and the stress process model, that's kind of an example of that type of research.

465
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:20,530
Or then you can also do within group analysis. And so let's say, you know that the black population is at higher risk for some outcome.

466
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:26,799
You look just within the black population and you look at these different potential like resilience factors

467
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:32,140
and you just look at the main effect of that on now like two different ways that people are doing it.

468
00:58:34,730 --> 00:58:42,360
I was thinking about something else related to this idea of public health, valuing health.

469
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:52,700
And I was thinking about our conversation last week where we talked about the calculation of healthy life expectancy when we were talking about that.

470
00:58:53,150 --> 00:58:58,370
And I think one of the comments that came up was like that part of what you're

471
00:58:58,370 --> 00:59:04,099
doing is you're saying that if you have sickness or if you have disability,

472
00:59:04,100 --> 00:59:16,010
however that's defined, that that means you have your life with less because you're literally like sort of subtracting life from it due to disease.

473
00:59:16,130 --> 00:59:26,630
And what's defined as disability. I think there's also a lot of people in different communities like I can think about the autism community,

474
00:59:27,930 --> 00:59:32,930
the deaf community who challenge the idea that these are disabilities.

475
00:59:33,950 --> 00:59:39,200
Kind of like. To your point, Noelle, about teen pregnancy, is that a problem?

476
00:59:42,090 --> 00:59:51,660
Right. So there we do have a lot of these assumptions in public health that I think we take for granted and seem obvious,

477
00:59:51,930 --> 00:59:56,820
but really probably actually aren't and can be contested.

478
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:03,850
Are there any others you can think of assumptions that we make or values we have yet?

479
01:00:04,430 --> 01:00:07,620
You mentioned public values. Health also values in the public.

480
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:12,700
I haven't yet come to my conclusion about what that means, but it is related to politics.

481
01:00:12,710 --> 01:00:16,630
It's related to it's related nations. How about this?

482
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:23,450
Very I remember in 2024 in protecting the nation's health.

483
01:00:25,670 --> 01:00:29,570
There's a lot wrapped up in that in that notion of the public.

484
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:35,810
I haven't yet concluded what it is. Yeah. What do you guys think?

485
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:51,200
What do we. We do? It's all in all the beginning of the year.

486
01:00:58,310 --> 01:01:01,600
Different exposure. The.

487
01:01:03,990 --> 01:01:13,690
Yeah. I feel like that. And I don't know who said it, but just in regards to my.

488
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:22,850
Yeah. Like these are about one time about like where all minorities are everywhere and they're everywhere.

489
01:01:24,010 --> 01:01:37,550
So I feel like that. So I definitely agree that the public shouldn't be broken down with more and more of the specific neighborhood.

490
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:44,040
So that's more than what public health approaches.

491
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:56,980
What's the challenge with that? Oh, yeah, go ahead. I just think about psychology, right?

492
01:01:58,070 --> 01:02:02,900
Mm hmm. Mm hmm.

493
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:07,550
Yeah. I told you to do that in your grant proposal, right?

494
01:02:08,660 --> 01:02:19,220
Yeah, because there are so many people. And the other thing is that it's be big financial burden.

495
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:25,280
Uh huh. And I think that's the how the topic is all about.

496
01:02:30,590 --> 01:02:40,000
Number. Yeah. And I also think about how you quantify that disability.

497
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:52,870
Hmm. So we had a we had this about this, like how, how we define how it is, how many years?

498
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:58,570
Mm hmm. Like produce value?

499
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:05,110
Yeah. Yeah. I think that's really good. When. When I first time I heard that, I was like, wow, that's three.

500
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:15,030
All right. After objectifying, objectify like black people.

501
01:03:15,210 --> 01:03:28,200
Mm hmm. Yeah. Yeah. So this idea that we define disability based on the inability to produce something that's economic.

502
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:35,910
Economic production. So if you can't do something that generates money, then you're considered disabled.

503
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:41,090
I think also this idea of like how we define public health significance.

504
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:44,880
So that's always in every grant proposal, every paper, right?

505
01:03:44,910 --> 01:03:49,440
You have to start by like why this is a problem that we should be studying.

506
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:54,390
And it's either because it affects a lot of people or because it's really expensive.

507
01:03:55,800 --> 01:04:09,360
Yeah, because those are great points. So it's like public health in some ways is kind of accepting values that are related to.

508
01:04:12,610 --> 01:04:16,900
I don't know if it's capitalism, but I guess like it.

509
01:04:17,170 --> 01:04:23,889
It kind of is. But you could be in a non capitalist system and still value economic productivity.

510
01:04:23,890 --> 01:04:28,440
So it's like it's valuing economic productivity in this way.

511
01:04:28,450 --> 01:04:34,450
Yeah. Yeah. Tangentially. Yeah. You did you mention out of that public health is tied to politics.

512
01:04:34,450 --> 01:04:36,480
I think it's tied to academia a lot as well.

513
01:04:36,490 --> 01:04:44,410
Yeah, a lot of us are in academia and at the end of the day, I know that we are all very well caring people and we want people to get better.

514
01:04:44,410 --> 01:04:46,860
But you are trying to move up the ladder sometimes.

515
01:04:46,870 --> 01:04:54,489
Yeah, an academic setting and a lot of that is publishing papers and getting your work out there and getting the biggest bang for your buck.

516
01:04:54,490 --> 01:04:58,960
So like you're saying, it's public health would be better targeted at smaller communities.

517
01:04:58,970 --> 01:05:02,380
Recognizing that, I completely agree. It takes more time and more money.

518
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:05,799
And if you want to publish in JAMA, you're probably not going to do that.

519
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:11,740
You want the thing that's going to you can say this is going to work for everybody, if you can, and if not,

520
01:05:11,740 --> 01:05:17,010
maybe a smaller chunk of people, but definitely not within a small community, even though I think that we all recognize that some.

521
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:19,290
More beneficial to people on the ground.

522
01:05:20,030 --> 01:05:27,319
But you're kind of playing this game of, I want a promotion and I also want to do good things, but where do I find that balance between that?

523
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:32,280
So I think we're really tied to academics like in that way. I totally agree.

524
01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:36,950
I think you also answered the question that I was going to ask you and go and raise your hand,

525
01:05:36,950 --> 01:05:43,280
which is how how does that approach that McKayla was describing and that you were just describing, Olivia?

526
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:53,420
How does it fit or not? But not with public health, but with epidemiology specifically for those of you who are epidemiologists.

527
01:05:56,480 --> 01:06:01,640
Can you imagine an epidemiology that's local?

528
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:35,760
And what would that look like? I see you guys thinking.

529
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:42,590
I see the wheels. Or you're making your grocery list.

530
01:06:44,940 --> 01:06:54,080
I don't think. I mean, if you just had to sort of you're describing to a friend,

531
01:06:54,320 --> 01:07:02,180
here's your ten year high school reunion and you're telling your friends from high school what you do.

532
01:07:02,330 --> 01:07:06,830
Those of you who are epidemiology students, what if they're like, what is that?

533
01:07:08,180 --> 01:07:21,580
What do you tell them the epidemiology of? Ali.

534
01:07:21,910 --> 01:07:31,600
Oh, I'm sorry, but somebody back there wants to tell you you're okay, right?

535
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:38,580
Stop right there. Say it again. The study of disease trends in a few days.

536
01:07:38,860 --> 01:07:43,110
And I was hoping somebody would say that that. Right.

537
01:07:43,210 --> 01:07:50,520
Like epidemiology really is about like big crimes.

538
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:53,530
That is kind of what epidemiologists about.

539
01:07:54,730 --> 01:08:02,500
And so I think there's a tension there, Michaela, with what you're talking about, with the with the field of epidemiology,

540
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:12,489
because it's like the whole field is really about how do we get like everybody and we're doing this at this really big kind of scale,

541
01:08:12,490 --> 01:08:21,250
like zoomed out scale. But like, is there a way in which, like,

542
01:08:21,250 --> 01:08:35,420
that epidemiologic approach can be more helpful or can be implemented more locally or understood more locally?

543
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:38,680
I don't know. I'm like, I don't have an answer. Yeah. Yeah.

544
01:08:38,710 --> 01:08:49,960
I mean, that's okay a number of ways if you don't have trends at a macro level.

545
01:08:52,880 --> 01:09:00,510
You know, being from Mississippi, obviously, there were a lot of health disparities and obesity and progress there and things like that.

546
01:09:02,430 --> 01:09:09,640
I think really the purpose is so I can tell people. Allies that they want and ameliorate pain.

547
01:09:10,780 --> 01:09:19,350
And so to do that, you're going to need to bring in help.

548
01:09:20,230 --> 01:09:24,480
To continue. Not to force it.

549
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:33,180
We're going to give people a choice and then educate them so that they are able to feel.

550
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:38,690
As well. And so. Personally.

551
01:09:38,710 --> 01:09:42,170
That's my. I don't think it has.

552
01:09:42,190 --> 01:09:45,850
You know, I think there's been two sides of the coin.

553
01:09:46,130 --> 01:09:51,250
Understanding what's going on. But then you can bring those trends down to the community level.

554
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:56,600
You know, to explain to people in the audience about averages.

555
01:09:56,840 --> 01:10:01,330
Yeah. You as a person are not an average. It's good to understand averages.

556
01:10:01,340 --> 01:10:11,999
Yeah. So that you can then make your own. Epidemiology is like.

557
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:18,510
It's one kind of knowledge, right? Like it's one it's one way of understanding things.

558
01:10:18,510 --> 01:10:26,300
It's one type of information. It's not like it's not the truth or the right answer.

559
01:10:26,310 --> 01:10:37,490
And we know that with epidemiology, the thing that you give up with an epidemiologic approach is all of the details and all of the exceptions

560
01:10:38,940 --> 01:10:45,360
miss that because you really are just trying to get the overall general kind of patterns of things.

561
01:10:45,810 --> 01:10:57,120
And so it's telling you it's telling you something that is useful but maybe less relevant in a very specific context.

562
01:10:57,390 --> 01:11:05,790
Right. And so if you're if you're going to go and you're going to and you're going to work in a local area as a public health person,

563
01:11:05,790 --> 01:11:08,279
you can use that epidemiologic evidence,

564
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:14,670
but you have to think about it in the local context and the extent to which applies or doesn't apply in Libya.

565
01:11:15,090 --> 01:11:21,260
I think you. And it's like translation, which is kind of a buzz word that I dislike.

566
01:11:21,260 --> 01:11:28,280
But if you think of translation in a lot of different like micro steps, I think it's incremental in a lot of ways,

567
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:34,910
but it can be translational to the individual or community level, doesn't have to be at that macro level.

568
01:11:35,630 --> 01:11:40,190
The NIH Institute for Environmental Health has a translational model that if you'd like a headache,

569
01:11:40,190 --> 01:11:44,030
you can look at it because it's kind of silly explanatory,

570
01:11:44,030 --> 01:11:49,159
but it has a really nice way of just showing like little steps that you can take through epidemiology,

571
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:55,129
environmental sciences to bring up information that's done like in vitro all the way out to a community level.

572
01:11:55,130 --> 01:12:01,730
So it's kind of cool to think about how those small little steps work, but how you can take those epidemiological findings.

573
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:06,429
Or an individual level, which is exactly what you were talking about,

574
01:12:06,430 --> 01:12:10,510
of working within a community with findings that maybe you had and making it more context.

575
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:22,240
Where? Okay.

576
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:29,140
And yeah. Right.

577
01:12:30,580 --> 01:12:38,390
Do you think? Quality of service with one.

578
01:12:40,970 --> 01:12:46,450
Yeah I think that's nice about qualitative research is that it.

579
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:54,620
And go some of the things that it's and quantitative research and yeah so I

580
01:12:54,620 --> 01:13:00,290
think that's really important for like for understanding a research question.

581
01:13:00,290 --> 01:13:06,290
So yeah, like what we do with epidemiology is just like one little poster or something.

582
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:18,500
And I was thinking, Olivia, as you were talking because you said in vitro studies and I was thinking even just about randomized controlled trials.

583
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:28,670
Right? And we know that randomized controlled trials are really great for establishing causality, but oftentimes they really lack generalizability.

584
01:13:28,850 --> 01:13:35,120
And so every kind of that the even with in epidemiology has its limitations and then

585
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:40,400
epidemiology as a discipline in the broader field of public health have one of patients too.

586
01:13:41,090 --> 01:13:44,390
So I think that's just important to remember and to think about.

587
01:13:45,380 --> 01:13:51,540
It's not that epidemiology is like that, but it's limited.

588
01:13:51,540 --> 01:13:55,700
It's just like all of the other ways of like understanding how things are also.

589
01:14:04,470 --> 01:14:09,840
I didn't know we were going to go there today in class, but thank you for raising those those questions,

590
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:17,670
because I think it is helpful to have this kind of discussion about what are the underlying assumptions of public health.

591
01:14:18,750 --> 01:14:22,709
I mean, I oftentimes try to, in this class,

592
01:14:22,710 --> 01:14:31,590
get people to think about how the values of public health don't necessarily align with the public's values and priorities.

593
01:14:31,590 --> 01:14:36,899
And to understand how that shapes the ability to implement public health recommendations and things.

594
01:14:36,900 --> 01:14:40,290
But this is kind of another way of even thinking about it.

595
01:14:46,150 --> 01:14:49,360
What was next? Oh, minority stress model. Okay.

596
01:14:49,780 --> 01:14:54,250
So. Hey. Uh oh.

597
01:14:54,730 --> 01:15:01,300
Back up. All right. I have a question. Why would we expect sexual and gender minorities to have worse health outcomes?

598
01:15:02,770 --> 01:15:09,430
What would be the sort of mechanism? Thinking back to what the minority stress model.

599
01:15:15,190 --> 01:15:18,610
Already told you is stress. All right.

600
01:15:18,790 --> 01:15:27,940
So stigma, the minority stress model argues that sexual and gender minorities experience chronic stress as a result of stigmatization.

601
01:15:37,820 --> 01:15:45,890
So this idea of stigma comes from this work by Erving Goffman, who defined stigma as an attribute that is deeply discrediting.

602
01:15:53,240 --> 01:15:58,460
So groups that are stigmatized have lower social status, less power.

603
01:16:03,740 --> 01:16:07,730
So this leads stigmatized people to feel devalued.

604
01:16:15,410 --> 01:16:21,610
And so some examples of stigma for sexual and gender minorities.

605
01:16:21,740 --> 01:16:26,810
We talked about this and we talked about at least one of these earlier.

606
01:16:28,490 --> 01:16:36,650
So there was the criminalization of consensual same sex behavior throughout the U.S. until the first sodomy laws were eliminated in 1961.

607
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:46,700
Homosexuality was classified as a mental disorder in the American Psychiatric

608
01:16:46,700 --> 01:16:52,800
Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders until 19.

609
01:16:52,820 --> 01:17:01,040
What do you think? 73.

610
01:17:04,740 --> 01:17:08,050
Which explains why people in the nineties still have those opinions.

611
01:17:08,070 --> 01:17:09,330
But you saw there. Right.

612
01:17:10,620 --> 01:17:18,690
And then a more recent example of the stigmatization of gender minorities was the April 2019 ban on transgender people serving in the military.

613
01:17:19,990 --> 01:17:29,850
Yeah. Patricia. Oh, I just saw it as being something that were the crowd.

614
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:39,960
Oh, and here that. It goes along with that.

615
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:51,810
Have you guys heard about the drama? So is that meant to be?

616
01:17:54,360 --> 01:17:58,290
Is that progressive? Is that inclusive?

617
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:01,530
I don't know. I don't know what the intent of that is.

618
01:18:01,830 --> 01:18:13,540
Interesting. So just some examples of of stigmatization.

619
01:18:13,990 --> 01:18:23,650
So then the Captain Mueller then has the psychological mediation framework that builds on the minority stress model.

620
01:18:27,290 --> 01:18:31,010
Calls it a psychological mediation framework. He's a psychologist.

621
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:39,010
It's this framework. So the idea here is that stigma increases exposure to stressors.

622
01:18:41,930 --> 01:18:48,980
Which then leads to emotion dysregulation, which then leads to social and interpersonal problems,

623
01:18:49,190 --> 01:18:53,960
which then leads to cognitive processes that increase the risk of mental health problems.

624
01:18:55,670 --> 01:18:59,870
That's kind of his model. It's really focused on mental health.

625
01:18:59,870 --> 01:19:03,950
But of course, we know that stress is also a risk factor for physical health problems.

626
01:19:08,570 --> 01:19:16,550
So stress is an important mechanism. There is also health care is another important mechanism.

627
01:19:25,110 --> 01:19:32,460
So in addition to increasing stress, stigma can negatively impact health by leading people to avoid or delay seeking health care.

628
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:43,310
Stigma can lead to adverse reactions from others in health care settings, including the refusal to treat.

629
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:50,840
And then by leading communities to provide lower quality facilities to stigmatized populations.

630
01:19:58,700 --> 01:20:01,770
There can also be health impacts of medical treatments.

631
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:19,330
Like hormone therapies or surgeries. So there's various kind of mechanisms underlying these disparities that we see.

632
01:20:23,450 --> 01:20:28,560
So I want to show you some information about about the population.

633
01:20:28,580 --> 01:20:31,100
So if we're talking about the sexual minority population,

634
01:20:31,340 --> 01:20:37,850
this is very exciting because the last time I gave this lecture, I couldn't show you this because it didn't exist.

635
01:20:38,240 --> 01:20:48,440
So the U.S. Census started collecting information on sexual orientation and gender identity in July 2021 in the Household Pulse survey.

636
01:20:50,150 --> 01:20:55,840
And so you can see here the question is which of the following best represents how you think of yourself as result?

637
01:20:55,850 --> 01:21:04,819
Results Age 18 and over 4.4% said bisexual 3.3% Gay or lesbian 88.3 straight 1.9%.

638
01:21:04,820 --> 01:21:07,190
Something else and 2.1%, I don't know.

639
01:21:09,380 --> 01:21:19,900
So this is really kind of huge because this is saying that the LGBT population is around 8% of the U.S. population.

640
01:21:19,910 --> 01:21:25,040
This is double the estimates that we had before the estimates.

641
01:21:25,460 --> 01:21:31,340
So like some of the estimates before, they just came from surveys like Gallup used to do a really big study.

642
01:21:31,340 --> 01:21:38,090
And that was where like some of the estimates came from. And the estimate in 2017 was like 4.5% of the population.

643
01:21:38,540 --> 01:21:49,159
So this is this is like big. So the question is, is it because of the way we were sampling or is this something that has like changed over time?

644
01:21:49,160 --> 01:22:02,920
It could be both. Then I'm showing you this even though this is also this is from the 2011 IOM report said that the data

645
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:07,320
that we're reporting here is from the four events that they're showing in these different surveys,

646
01:22:07,330 --> 01:22:12,250
national survey on Sexual Health and behavior and general social survey from 2000.

647
01:22:12,250 --> 01:22:18,460
A national survey from 2000 to National Health and Social Life Survey from 1992.

648
01:22:19,570 --> 01:22:25,180
So this table was showing data on sexual orientation from five national surveys.

649
01:22:25,180 --> 01:22:28,780
And what I like about this table is that it shows you identity.

650
01:22:29,020 --> 01:22:32,680
It shows you behavior. And it shows you attraction.

651
01:22:32,890 --> 01:22:35,950
And so you can see the differences across those.

652
01:22:36,670 --> 01:22:42,160
So the estimates actually vary a lot depending on the component of sexual orientation that you look at.

653
01:22:42,430 --> 01:22:48,190
So in the National Survey of Family Growth, which is the first one here that has all of the measures,

654
01:22:48,880 --> 01:23:01,570
4.1% of women identified as lesbian, but 11.5% reported same sex partners and 13.4% reported same sex desire or attraction.

655
01:23:02,140 --> 01:23:06,880
So you can see it's like it's really different across those across those indicators.

656
01:23:07,090 --> 01:23:14,350
It also varies according to the year of survey and the age range of the sample.

657
01:23:19,700 --> 01:23:25,040
All right. Here's the data from the census on the transgender population.

658
01:23:25,050 --> 01:23:29,820
So the question they asked, two questions. What exactly were you assigned at birth and your original birth certificate?

659
01:23:29,820 --> 01:23:34,020
And then you can currently describe yourself as male, female or transgender.

660
01:23:34,590 --> 01:23:41,220
And 46% of adults in the census identify as transgender.

661
01:23:43,550 --> 01:23:47,880
So that is the question. So bad. Transgender.

662
01:23:48,720 --> 01:23:56,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And this is not the way the like the questions are recommended to be asked.

663
01:23:59,190 --> 01:24:04,410
It could be, although I'm going to show you that it matches purpose data which asks a different way.

664
01:24:06,060 --> 01:24:11,970
So this is from the purpose and and the Youth Risk Behavioral Survey also.

665
01:24:12,990 --> 01:24:19,830
So for surface added an optional optional module to assess gender identity in 2014.

666
01:24:20,190 --> 01:24:25,440
They asked two questions. They first asked Do you consider yourself to be transgender?

667
01:24:26,310 --> 01:24:30,030
So maybe it is kind of the same problem. Maybe.

668
01:24:30,510 --> 01:24:39,900
And then people who answered yes are asked, Do you consider yourself to be male to female, female to male or gender non-conforming?

669
01:24:41,380 --> 01:24:47,730
You think that's better yet? It passes my test. Okay. It would capture.

670
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:52,870
Yes. Yeah. Okay. I don't know why the census did it differently than purpose.

671
01:24:52,890 --> 01:24:57,920
I mean, they're different organizations, obviously, but they're both better, all know other gender.

672
01:24:58,050 --> 01:25:05,470
That's a good example of the ways that, like, things are actually like social,

673
01:25:05,630 --> 01:25:08,890
socially understood of like, yeah, we all agree that this is what this is.

674
01:25:08,910 --> 01:25:12,810
Of course we're going to end this question this way. In practice, it's like that doesn't make any sense.

675
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:16,800
Yeah. It doesn't work for people who are trying to answer this. Okay.

676
01:25:17,300 --> 01:25:21,440
Yeah. Are you putting your hand up or stretching?

677
01:25:21,450 --> 01:25:25,979
Okay. So let's see.

678
01:25:25,980 --> 01:25:35,070
2014. I already said that. So since 2014, 43 states have included the optional modules of the paper that you read.

679
01:25:35,070 --> 01:25:39,450
That was from the 2014 data that were, what, 14 states or something like that.

680
01:25:39,660 --> 01:25:44,190
So it's definitely expanded. So there's more states that have included it now.

681
01:25:45,060 --> 01:25:58,470
And so this data here that's from the Williams Institute is from the 2017 and 2019 Youth Risk Behavioral Survey and the 2017 to 2024 office.

682
01:26:00,570 --> 01:26:05,220
The Youth Risk Behavioral Survey added the question about gender identity in 2017,

683
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:09,870
and so far only 15 states have included this in their statewide questionnaire.

684
01:26:09,870 --> 01:26:12,300
So it's less than the purpose.

685
01:26:12,900 --> 01:26:24,150
But then you can see here that the population is 13 to 17, 1.4% identify as transgender, which is higher than any of the other age groups.

686
01:26:25,200 --> 01:26:32,640
And 18 to 24 is 1.3%, 25 to 64.5%, 65.3%.

687
01:26:33,750 --> 01:26:40,860
And so the average the sort of average across all of those is point 6%, which is what the census got to.

688
01:26:41,610 --> 01:26:46,200
Yeah, I don't know. I don't know.

689
01:26:46,590 --> 01:26:50,720
But we're not yet.

690
01:26:55,620 --> 01:27:00,150
I don't know. Yeah. Oh.

691
01:27:07,680 --> 01:27:12,290
Yeah. Which was like 600 or something like kind of larger.

692
01:27:12,300 --> 01:27:20,570
And I that I. No.

693
01:27:20,570 --> 01:27:25,600
I mean, I think. So much for the definition.

694
01:27:26,170 --> 01:27:29,860
Yeah. Okay. I just don't.

695
01:27:32,940 --> 01:27:39,650
Oh. I don't.

696
01:27:47,390 --> 01:27:51,480
I mean, I don't. I don't know, I.

697
01:27:55,260 --> 01:28:01,050
Yeah, I think it's an important question because it's like and I imagine that is a very heterogeneous group.

698
01:28:01,230 --> 01:28:07,290
But I don't know. You know, I imagine there are some people who are like, I don't know what you're talking about.

699
01:28:10,270 --> 01:28:18,889
Yeah. You know. Yeah.

700
01:28:18,890 --> 01:28:26,300
And it could be people who are like and these categories don't make sense to me, so I'm not going to wear these like I.

701
01:28:26,510 --> 01:28:34,990
So it makes me think of your question all about like when we design these questions, do do respondents understand?

702
01:28:35,390 --> 01:28:39,710
Right, right. Like, yeah, exactly. Like even as I was looking at this the way it was written.

703
01:28:39,730 --> 01:28:49,460
But yeah, I don't remember what I said, I don't know if it's like, yeah, I mean experience of other people do you know.

704
01:28:50,810 --> 01:28:54,049
Yeah. It's like I know if like, you know, I'm like you mentioned like people who are out. Yeah.

705
01:28:54,050 --> 01:28:58,260
Which might be possible. Yeah. Maybe they're terrible who are like, I don't like those questions.

706
01:28:58,310 --> 01:29:03,770
Right. So it's like an anarchist, right. Yeah. No, yeah, yeah.

707
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:11,060
Or somebody who's like, it's none of your business or whatever. There could be all kinds of reasons why you wouldn't answer that question.

708
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:18,890
And here's, here's the data from Bird Fest that that breaks it out.

709
01:29:19,250 --> 01:29:27,650
Um, so on those who respond that they're transgender, 38.5% identify as transgender women,

710
01:29:28,820 --> 01:29:36,530
36% transgender, about 26% around transgender nonconforming were kind of the breakout break breakdown.

711
01:29:43,930 --> 01:29:50,180
Okay. Let's let's take a break because it's 1104 and you probably need to stretch your legs and get something to eat.

712
01:29:50,350 --> 01:29:54,940
And so let's come back at at 1115.

713
01:30:19,270 --> 01:30:48,950
Oh, no, no. Thank you for engaging with my crazy comment.

714
01:30:49,110 --> 01:30:53,310
No, I love it. I thought it was great. My favorite, especially in grad school so far.

715
01:30:54,230 --> 01:30:57,580
Have so many really good notes for. Yeah.

716
01:30:58,470 --> 01:31:02,640
Yeah. One of the like one of the legs of this argument is HIV and AIDS, basically,

717
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:07,460
like where people represent death and represent life, which I just think is really interesting.

718
01:31:07,880 --> 01:31:15,160
It is interesting. It's very spicy to say that in careers office, but opposition.

719
01:31:16,100 --> 01:31:20,179
Yeah. I was thinking also that it wasn't super relevant to what we're talking about,

720
01:31:20,180 --> 01:31:27,920
but like the kind of differences of opinion with the sexual minority community about same sex marriage.

721
01:31:27,970 --> 01:31:31,100
Yeah, the book gets into that.

722
01:31:31,130 --> 01:31:31,430
Yeah. Yeah.

723
01:31:31,490 --> 01:31:40,230
Because, like, you know, if you think about like what marriage is, what it look like, it's really this kind of oppressive tool of the state.

724
01:31:40,250 --> 01:31:50,270
Right? Right. Even sometimes when I'm reading that, I'm like, I'm challenged because the way that they define queerness is so such politically.

725
01:31:50,330 --> 01:31:57,660
Mm hmm. It's always like that. One of the most famous I can show you, because I don't want to say that.

726
01:32:22,430 --> 01:32:25,750
But it says queerness can never define an identity. It can only ever disturb one.

727
01:32:25,800 --> 01:32:29,310
I thought that was really interesting. So, like.

728
01:32:29,910 --> 01:32:36,180
Mm hmm. And it's something to grapple with. That's why I couldn't really articulate what it meant by that.

729
01:32:36,180 --> 01:32:40,560
But I'm like, That's fascinating. Is that this idea, like.

730
01:32:44,860 --> 01:32:48,340
I wasn't exposed to this. Like, I don't remember.

731
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:55,750
I was reading Queer Theory in graduate school. I mean, I remember, like, kind of knowing about it, but not really reading it.

732
01:32:55,780 --> 01:33:00,790
Yeah. And this idea of wearing something is like a verb.

733
01:33:00,820 --> 01:33:03,940
Yeah. You know, like I'm just getting into it.

734
01:33:04,260 --> 01:33:09,729
Yeah. So it's that I'm gonna get that comment as about that because it's like.

735
01:33:09,730 --> 01:33:13,720
Yes. Destabilize. Yeah. It's like a, it's an action.

736
01:33:13,750 --> 01:33:17,440
Yeah. It's like it's not a yeah, it's not an identity offense.

737
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:20,720
And people like Judith would say that's all that it is.

738
01:33:20,810 --> 01:33:23,860
Yeah, it's it's it's a lot.

739
01:33:24,010 --> 01:33:27,520
Okay. All right. Starting here. Yeah, it's the most famous quote from that,

740
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:36,760
which is basically the idea that being being queer is like anti everything that everything stands apart from.

741
01:33:37,270 --> 01:33:45,550
Yeah, I yeah. So that was that's you know, I don't with this this book is amazing.

742
01:33:46,660 --> 01:33:56,920
I read this over the summer. Yeah. I'm, it's purely extracurricular but yeah that's, ah, it's a lot but reading stuff like that.

743
01:33:57,010 --> 01:34:04,510
But yeah, increasingly I'm thinking the project that I'm really early sort of doing my chose to do for this class is going to be

744
01:34:04,510 --> 01:34:11,530
my dissertation and that I would love to do queer there is stuck with it so it's kind of that would be really cool.

745
01:34:11,740 --> 01:34:23,469
Thank you I I'm I'm also very interested in this idea of like AIDS and the meaning of AIDS to people over time.

746
01:34:23,470 --> 01:34:26,860
That's how that, how that shifted. That's the core of my.

747
01:34:26,860 --> 01:34:31,929
Yeah, yeah. I think, I think it's a super interesting idea and I was, I was thinking about this.

748
01:34:31,930 --> 01:34:37,479
It actually happened a long time ago when I so when I first started teaching first started

749
01:34:37,480 --> 01:34:45,910
teaching in 2008 and I was doing a like agenda and whole doctoral seminar when I was 18.

750
01:34:46,690 --> 01:34:55,720
And like we were reading the stuff on HIV, AIDS and gender and it just like wasn't resonating with the students.

751
01:34:56,530 --> 01:35:00,460
And I was so confused. I was like, they just don't to like.

752
01:35:00,940 --> 01:35:06,280
But then I realized that once, like, HIV became treatable.

753
01:35:06,280 --> 01:35:09,910
Yes. It's just, like, didn't mean the same thing anyway.

754
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:18,430
Yeah, there's so I'm interested in maybe talking to younger people too if I do because of that comparison is because like even when I was in college,

755
01:35:18,430 --> 01:35:22,150
it was still terrifying. Yes. Yes. And that changed like really quickly.

756
01:35:22,300 --> 01:35:32,360
Yeah. I think I was like, oh, yeah, yeah.

757
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:36,570
You know what? I'm not going to go the whole time.

758
01:35:37,060 --> 01:35:41,150
I'm going to let people leave early and work on their people. Person okay.

759
01:35:41,410 --> 01:36:05,500
Okay. I'm sorry. As time goes like this, like so many notes and new ideas that I hadn't had before, that's good.

760
01:36:05,500 --> 01:36:10,090
Because I was like, I just remember when you emailed me, I was like, This is going to be like, You're not alone.

761
01:36:10,450 --> 01:36:13,720
No, not at all. Also, like, I need more.

762
01:36:14,830 --> 01:36:18,890
I'm not so strong. And I could.

763
01:36:36,040 --> 01:36:42,780
I just want you to know that I would like.

764
01:37:02,320 --> 01:37:09,380
Yeah. Oh, I.

765
01:37:18,790 --> 01:37:39,700
She? We?

766
01:37:52,630 --> 01:38:04,450
But you know, the fact that we're going to have people over.

767
01:38:26,260 --> 01:38:33,880
Looking for your.

768
01:38:43,990 --> 01:38:53,890
This year. There are.

769
01:39:07,460 --> 01:39:14,610
Our total support.

770
01:40:07,940 --> 01:40:13,720
Let's talk about some challenges in this field of research.

771
01:40:15,940 --> 01:40:21,610
What do you think would make it challenging to study gender and sexual minority?

772
01:40:33,990 --> 01:40:39,220
Yeah. Population. Yeah, that's the first one.

773
01:40:39,240 --> 01:40:50,010
Yeah. Small populations, right. You know, we saw that especially for thinking about the transgender population point 6%.

774
01:40:50,370 --> 01:41:00,810
That's really small. You know, unless you're like serving hundreds of thousands of people, you're not going to be able to get much in the sample.

775
01:41:04,320 --> 01:41:08,640
What else? Makes this a challenging area for you.

776
01:41:11,710 --> 01:41:15,630
Cultural differences has been more about about that. Yeah, I think.

777
01:41:17,140 --> 01:41:32,220
Different. Yeah.

778
01:41:32,470 --> 01:41:38,980
So there could be differences cross-culturally in the expression of like gender or sexuality

779
01:41:38,980 --> 01:41:46,300
that could make it difficult to study or may even make it unacceptable to study in some places.

780
01:41:53,070 --> 01:42:00,410
They? Yeah.

781
01:42:00,890 --> 01:42:04,090
So that might not be right. It could go both ways. Yeah.

782
01:42:04,170 --> 01:42:10,610
Yeah. Um. Like someone like at the age of 18.

783
01:42:11,490 --> 01:42:15,570
Now part of the population that they like. Yeah.

784
01:42:15,580 --> 01:42:21,560
So, like, so this is something that can, can change over the life course for someone.

785
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:29,100
Also this idea of some of these things like attraction, you know, being on the spectrum.

786
01:42:29,100 --> 01:42:35,400
And so it's not these discrete categories in the way that we like to study things in epidemiology.

787
01:42:35,670 --> 01:42:39,300
Yeah, the like, the measurement can be really challenging.

788
01:42:39,330 --> 01:42:42,480
Yeah. Cohen I'm still thinking about that.

789
01:42:44,910 --> 01:42:51,400
Uh huh, yeah. Yeah.

790
01:42:57,120 --> 01:43:00,420
Ah, not that.

791
01:43:02,050 --> 01:43:08,320
Yeah. So you think that people who don't won't report it to you because this is stigmatized?

792
01:43:08,750 --> 01:43:11,980
Um, so you can have issues with reporting.

793
01:43:12,310 --> 01:43:23,920
Um, like back to Jackie's point about measure, like there's also a lack of standardized measures, um, that we can use to compare across studies.

794
01:43:24,430 --> 01:43:30,070
Um, so it's. See if there's anything else I want to say about that.

795
01:43:30,110 --> 01:43:34,060
Yeah, no, those are those are some of the kind of the big challenges.

796
01:43:35,020 --> 01:43:40,840
I'm just going to go really quickly through this sort of evidence of disparities.

797
01:43:41,170 --> 01:43:44,590
You read papers for today that kind of talk about this.

798
01:43:44,590 --> 01:43:50,110
But in terms of mental health disparities, this is more studied than physical health disparities.

799
01:43:52,360 --> 01:43:57,700
Sexual minorities are more likely to have a lifetime history of mental disorder and current mental disorder.

800
01:43:58,660 --> 01:44:06,970
There's higher comorbidity, meaning multiple conditions earlier age of onset and greater chronicity of disorder.

801
01:44:11,640 --> 01:44:15,120
And more likely to report suicidal ideation and behavior.

802
01:44:19,990 --> 01:44:26,799
The results for physical health and health behavior are less consistent than their results for mental health.

803
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:35,240
But there is still evidence of some disparities. So this is coming from the plasma paper.

804
01:44:35,280 --> 01:44:39,220
So this is controlling for age, education, race, ethnicity and income.

805
01:44:41,620 --> 01:44:47,540
Sexual minority women are more likely to report activity limitations compared to heterosexual women.

806
01:44:47,980 --> 01:44:52,959
Current smoking use of smokeless tobacco, drinking and driving HIV rose binge drinking,

807
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:58,600
not seeking care due to cost, diabetes and asthma less likely to report routine checkups.

808
01:45:00,290 --> 01:45:05,230
We talked about that before. The stigma within the health care setting could be contributing to this.

809
01:45:06,440 --> 01:45:13,069
Men were more likely to report activity limitation and sexual minority men are more likely to report activity limitations.

810
01:45:13,070 --> 01:45:22,760
Current smoking, HIV risk receipt of flu vaccine, HIV testing, colorectal screening and asthma, and less likely to report overweight or obese.

811
01:45:30,840 --> 01:45:40,860
And then in terms of transgender health, I mean, we've really only been able to study this from an epidemiologic perspective for a couple of years.

812
01:45:40,860 --> 01:45:46,050
Like this is still a very kind of new area of research for epidemiology.

813
01:45:46,380 --> 01:45:53,250
But we do know from like from the previous studies is that transgender people report worse self-rated health,

814
01:45:53,820 --> 01:45:56,610
more days per month of poor physical and mental health,

815
01:45:56,820 --> 01:46:03,840
higher prevalence of myocardial infarction, less likely to have health insurance and a regular care provider.

816
01:46:04,140 --> 01:46:11,790
Less likely to have seen a dentist in the past year. But no differences in chronic diseases, cancers, depressive disorders or health behaviors.

817
01:46:12,210 --> 01:46:16,890
And a couple of you comment on the findings for depression.

818
01:46:18,030 --> 01:46:21,659
You said that, but I know you did.

819
01:46:21,660 --> 01:46:25,480
I remember. I'm pretty sure.

820
01:46:37,190 --> 01:46:41,000
Does anybody remember saying anything about that? I know. I remember you did.

821
01:46:43,430 --> 01:46:46,580
Well, why was this surprising? Why do you think it's surprising?

822
01:46:50,420 --> 01:46:57,700
There were no differences in depressive disorders. Yeah.

823
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:05,490
Yeah. Okay. Yeah, exactly.

824
01:47:08,740 --> 01:47:13,160
That's. I just wasn't sure.

825
01:47:14,870 --> 01:47:22,870
Yeah, we just talked a lot about how. Yeah.

826
01:47:22,870 --> 01:47:28,629
It seems like from the kind of the theoretical models that are out there that you would see this difference.

827
01:47:28,630 --> 01:47:37,690
And so it was a little surprising and I think it could be about the way that the question is housed in the survey.

828
01:47:39,070 --> 01:47:43,940
Somebody else mentioned it could be just like a small sample size.

829
01:47:43,960 --> 01:47:52,150
Can you kind of make it hard to detect associations? There's various reasons why why maybe the study didn't come up.

830
01:47:52,420 --> 01:47:56,420
But then there is more the ease of reporting in poor mental health.

831
01:47:56,440 --> 01:48:05,110
So, um, now this question I remember if this question is like, have you been diagnosed with depression?

832
01:48:05,110 --> 01:48:08,349
It might be. Um, and so that could be part of it too.

833
01:48:08,350 --> 01:48:13,749
Like if you're, if you are less likely to see it, providers would be less likely to get a diagnosis.

834
01:48:13,750 --> 01:48:15,160
So it could be something related to that.

835
01:48:19,220 --> 01:48:31,470
So in terms of oh, I wanted to make one more comment about that based on things that you guys brought up in your in your commentary.

836
01:48:31,490 --> 01:48:34,940
So, sure, you you were like, these papers are old.

837
01:48:34,940 --> 01:48:46,460
I want to see you do papers. And I think this is a challenging area because it is rapidly changing.

838
01:48:47,480 --> 01:48:56,100
And so you're right that like papers that use data from the 2020 purpose might tell us something really different than papers from the 2014 version.

839
01:48:56,420 --> 01:49:09,410
And that's not always the case in social epidemiology, but in particular with this area of research like it's just a really rapidly changing area.

840
01:49:10,190 --> 01:49:20,599
And so what we know from this study may really not even apply today, so that that kind of takes me back to these challenges.

841
01:49:20,600 --> 01:49:31,690
And so it's a. It's always a challenge in epidemiology or any research to supply that research.

842
01:49:31,960 --> 01:49:36,910
If you're doing research right now, you probably know this. It's very low.

843
01:49:39,030 --> 01:49:44,009
Right. I see some like some eyes light up because, you know, because if you're working on your atelier,

844
01:49:44,010 --> 01:49:46,370
you're working on your dissertation or whatever you're working on,

845
01:49:46,390 --> 01:49:55,440
and you understand that it's very slow and that a lot of times you're analyzing data that by the time you're analyzing it, it's really old.

846
01:49:55,530 --> 01:50:01,650
You know, the data that you're analyzing might be ten years old or older because of how long it takes to collect data,

847
01:50:01,710 --> 01:50:05,940
clean data, distribute data, all of that kind of stuff.

848
01:50:06,240 --> 01:50:11,100
So this is like this is a larger problem just in science.

849
01:50:11,460 --> 01:50:15,750
And then even once you have the data, you can analyze things really quickly.

850
01:50:15,750 --> 01:50:21,239
But then to go through the publication process is very slow and time consuming.

851
01:50:21,240 --> 01:50:24,480
So by the time you actually see a paper come out,

852
01:50:25,230 --> 01:50:34,740
people probably started working on even just the analysis three years before you saw it and data collection many years before that.

853
01:50:34,920 --> 01:50:41,309
So this is always a challenge, but when you're studying something, a phenomenon that is like that is rapidly changing,

854
01:50:41,310 --> 01:50:48,000
it's even more of a struggle to be able to see like timely kind of evidence and data.

855
01:50:49,380 --> 01:50:56,160
So in terms of future directions, I think this is something that many of you brought up in your comments.

856
01:50:56,310 --> 01:51:02,610
And I think I actually did write that down. So type thinking about this idea of intersectionality,

857
01:51:03,570 --> 01:51:15,080
how how these things how gender and sexual identity intersect with other aspects of identity, particularly race or socioeconomic status.

858
01:51:16,300 --> 01:51:18,090
You know, so, Cynthia, we talked about this.

859
01:51:18,090 --> 01:51:24,480
You brought up the race ethnicity section about some Bueller and some of the things that you found kind of weird and problematic about that.

860
01:51:25,350 --> 01:51:38,010
Patricia, you have this comment about handsome Bueller where he makes this assertion that all sexual minorities share the same status.

861
01:51:38,370 --> 01:51:42,360
And you're like, that's not true. And I completely agree with you.

862
01:51:42,450 --> 01:51:51,029
Right. And then I have more in abit Patricia and Jackie all sort of made comments about stigma within

863
01:51:51,030 --> 01:51:58,380
the LGBT community and this idea that not all people here really share the same status.

864
01:51:59,490 --> 01:52:03,920
And then Noma also talked about intersectionality with race.

865
01:52:03,930 --> 01:52:09,360
And Audra, you asked specifically about like studying intersectionality.

866
01:52:09,360 --> 01:52:14,909
Like is that something that we do with interaction terms? And yes, that would be like one way that you could do it, right?

867
01:52:14,910 --> 01:52:19,469
So you could you could have some kind of sexual orientation measure and some kind of race measure.

868
01:52:19,470 --> 01:52:26,550
And you could look at a statistical interaction with some outcome. That is definitely like one way that people study intersectionality.

869
01:52:26,820 --> 01:52:34,050
You, of course, have to have very large sample to like to power this, which is one of the challenges.

870
01:52:36,040 --> 01:52:44,890
But that is certainly an area of an area that's important for future research, but is really limited by sample size.

871
01:52:47,350 --> 01:52:53,230
Also, we've we've talked about this a number of times, this idea of studying this from a life course perspective,

872
01:52:53,800 --> 01:52:58,570
because this really is like a developmental kind of phenomenon.

873
01:52:59,170 --> 01:53:04,400
So thinking about sexual orientation trajectories over the life course,

874
01:53:04,420 --> 01:53:15,030
like what do those look like and how do these different trajectories like how are they related to help in different ways of thinking about aging?

875
01:53:19,910 --> 01:53:26,810
You know, how does sexual orientation develop over time? How does sexual orientation affect health trajectories and aging?

876
01:53:28,100 --> 01:53:32,390
Also another important one. Cohort and period effects.

877
01:53:34,060 --> 01:53:42,430
Are disparities smaller in more recent birth cohorts, right, where being a sexual minority or gender minority is less stigmatized.

878
01:53:43,450 --> 01:53:47,860
You can hypothesize that that it would be the disparities would be smaller.

879
01:53:49,270 --> 01:53:56,020
You could look at period effects are disparities smaller after same sex marriage was legalized, for example.

880
01:53:58,060 --> 01:54:04,990
I think there's all kinds of really interesting, like kind of research questions that you could address in this area.

881
01:54:05,020 --> 01:54:12,370
You just have to have data. And that's the way that's the tricky thing here from a like from an epidemiologic

882
01:54:12,490 --> 01:54:17,680
kind of or population health perspective is challenging because of the lack of data.

883
01:54:27,570 --> 01:54:35,309
So I'm just going to stop there today and let you go home early so you can work on your

884
01:54:35,310 --> 01:54:40,740
assignment that's due next Friday and get a little head start on your fall break.

885
01:54:41,250 --> 01:54:43,530
And if anybody I mean, I'm here.

886
01:54:43,620 --> 01:54:50,040
So if anybody wants to stick around, if you have questions about your final project that you want to ask, I'll hang around for a while.

887
01:54:51,090 --> 01:54:55,140
Have a good weekend and a good break. You're welcome.

888
01:54:58,820 --> 01:55:00,110
You're tired, but I'm tired too.
