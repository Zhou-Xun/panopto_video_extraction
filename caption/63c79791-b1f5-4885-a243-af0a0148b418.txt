1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:12,810
Chuck Todd this summer. It's not like we're not we're kind of like they were trying to to even talk about these people.

2
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:26,280
Well, I guess what how long is it? I don't remember how people realize what it is, but it's like how for, you know, just just things for yourself.

3
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,969
Yeah, I was gonna go.

4
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:36,120
I want you to talk to your husband.

5
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:57,380
No, but yes, sir. First of all, I really like people thinking of that kind of place right where you could use this Harvard, you know?

6
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:09,570
No, no, no. I mean, some of the things that I saw the worst part about him isn't really.

7
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:19,889
Yeah. Yeah. I suppose it's going to be a few minutes before we get started.

8
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:25,410
This lecture, one of those exams that I had a few questions.

9
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:34,180
The exam is going to be well done in class so well and it will be administered through the campus.

10
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:40,409
So we'll give you a pass code at the beginning of class that you can get access to it again.

11
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:53,640
If anybody is can't be around, has accommodations or anything, please email me as we arrange for you all.

12
00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:03,389
And then the there's been a repeating question about the homework and pretty much everybody's

13
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:08,670
question is the same and that is the question about the denominator for question two and three.

14
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:18,540
I think the main point and concept that I want you to make sure you're you're all aware of is that

15
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:23,700
the denominator for cumulative incidents is not just total population with the population at risk,

16
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:30,899
but with respect to getting it. I'm not concerned about you getting a precise number and I realize.

17
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:37,440
So you do go on. You should just go online and figure out what the census for the U.S. is.

18
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:44,290
I know Waves crossover between 2020 and 2021.

19
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:56,050
Technically, maybe the best estimate of what our best most accurate number would be an average of the two if the wave crosses over one of the years.

20
00:02:56,070 --> 00:03:00,360
So I think that's a good, good way to come up.

21
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:07,860
There's no perfect number, but if you're going to use an average, just say what you know, depending what you're using.

22
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:16,440
Clearly, if we did subtract out those that are not at risk, it's not going to make a quantitative difference.

23
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:23,100
But again, we want to be aware that it's population at risk.

24
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:27,270
So the population when you're targeting incidence as opposed to prevalence,

25
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:36,360
any questions about that or any other questions about the homework or exam?

26
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:46,180
Okay. So I will get started on this lecture.

27
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:51,330
Control, elimination and eradication is the theme of this lecture.

28
00:03:52,790 --> 00:04:00,120
Actually, I do want to just repeat again that next week we'll have a guest lecture all that hard.

29
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:09,090
I'm talking about pathogens and that material will be, you know, is going to be part of the exam.

30
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:23,070
Another question that was asked. But just again, the content of the lecture is going to be I don't I haven't gotten involved in any specific reading.

31
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,460
So so at this point, we are not to have reading for that.

32
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:42,230
Sure. Okay. So what what we're going to cover today is three fold here, understanding that this seems to be an elimination and eradication,

33
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:45,930
understanding the distinction between prevention and control,

34
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:54,510
and evaluating the successes and failures of eradication with respect to smallpox,

35
00:04:54,990 --> 00:05:02,990
which is a disease that we have officially eradicated, and polio, which is the disease that we're trying to eradicate.

36
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:17,759
So. We talk a lot about when with these interventions and when we're talking about elimination eradication, there is a large focus on vaccines,

37
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:26,940
but there's a lot of other interventions that we're should be concerned about in the context of control and prevention.

38
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:33,850
Each one of these interventions intervene in a particular life cycle of the.

39
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:42,390
Parasite, the infectious disease cycle. So vaccines target any infectious agent it enters into the body.

40
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:48,360
The vaccine is going to target that and prevent infection.

41
00:05:49,080 --> 00:06:00,680
Prevent. Contagiousness, prevent. Severity and outcome depending on the vaccine, depending on the design, depending on how effective it.

42
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:08,090
We have masks, bednets, hygiene. All target the root of transmission.

43
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:15,470
No mask. Trying to prevent a pathogen from being inhaled.

44
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:21,770
Bednets try and prevent a mosquito from actually landing on you and biting it

45
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:31,280
prevents or eliminates pathogens that might be in the hands that could then be,

46
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:40,520
you know, in you become infected by touching the membranes or the body, mouth and nose.

47
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,540
And then there's vector control, mosquitoes, ticks where you're actually targeting,

48
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:58,010
killing that vector and preventing those mosquitoes from either infecting hosts or being infected by.

49
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:04,880
So decreasing the density of vectors you can actually control.

50
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:23,230
Control transmission. Water treatment, surface cleaning, cooking, those all target environmental reservoirs, those trying to kill the pathogen,

51
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:33,280
trying to kill the pathogen in the environment, reservoir and then medication targets, disease, morbidity.

52
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:38,980
But it also, as we talked about last week, it can target the infectious.

53
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:43,629
It can infectious period that it can decrease the infectious period.

54
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:55,120
If you can actually treat somebody that infected or has symptoms early enough, then their infectious period is effectively reduced.

55
00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:03,040
So it does have a transmission component to it in addition to just treating clinical use.

56
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:19,250
So we're going to go over these different types of levels of control minimally controlled, modifying, transmission, controlling and prevention,

57
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:32,090
control and prevention, elimination eradication, so that each one gets to a more and more extreme level of effort in our control efforts.

58
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:36,020
And so, you know, and somewhat at one extreme,

59
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:46,070
we have things like the common cold where we just don't really have any real control efforts or we have minimal control efforts.

60
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:53,330
It's something that just transmits around and is affected by various environmental factors and social factors.

61
00:08:54,290 --> 00:09:02,750
Then we get to ones where there's seasonality to it or like Ebola, there's going to be periodic outbreaks.

62
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:08,240
And so we're looking at temporary reduction of transmission through efforts.

63
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,330
Then we got endemic diseases that are that are constantly around.

64
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,740
And that's where we get into our control and prevention efforts.

65
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:27,710
Then we get to elimination, which is really just the absence of the disease in a given region.

66
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:37,380
I mean, it could and it could be different spatial extents to that, be both, or it could be regional, it could be through whole continent,

67
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:47,540
but it's eliminating the pathogen from a given area, region, and then eradication, which is the elimination of that pathogen globally.

68
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:58,550
So talked about, you know, there's various viruses that cause common cold and.

69
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:07,910
Most likely that things that that control or regulate transmission is going to be there's going to be weather or climate related.

70
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:11,030
A lot of these these pathogens are seasonal.

71
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:17,060
There could be land use patterns in travel that affect transmission.

72
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:29,870
Again, it's not there's not a huge focus on these pathogens in respect to control hygiene and reminding people to wash their hands before their

73
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:40,370
cooking or after they use the restroom are examples of types of messaging that try and mitigate transmission of the virus in line with others.

74
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:50,780
So we really don't do that much surveillance of these pathogens to know how much.

75
00:10:52,220 --> 00:11:00,740
Well, you know how many cases we're seeing. Any given time or how many cases we see here, they don't know to what extent that he's been on his.

76
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:12,110
So but we can also do interventions that modify transmission into more extensive interventions such as vaccination,

77
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:18,090
such as changing contact patterns or reducing abundance of vectors.

78
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:24,930
So changing contact patterns could be quarantined, which, you know, prior to COVID,

79
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:35,490
we didn't do a lot of that is and so quarantine is anybody that's exposed that we don't have symptoms yet,

80
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:42,330
we'd like them to be quarantined from the rest of the population to minimize transmission.

81
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:51,149
Isolation is something that, you know, has you know, pre-COVID we we talked about we would talk about isolation.

82
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:53,880
If you're sick, if you have symptoms, you should isolate.

83
00:11:55,230 --> 00:12:04,320
And that norm of the degree you should isolate if you have symptoms, has changed radically now that the post COVID used to be okay.

84
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,610
If you're a little sick to go to work now, it's less okay to do that.

85
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:15,659
And so isolation and quarantine, targeted transmission, different ways.

86
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:24,750
Quarantine becomes much more important if a disease, if you can be symptom, if you can be infectious prior to having symptoms.

87
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:28,620
Quarantine becomes much more important in isolation.

88
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:36,030
And in general, people tend to be more infectious in that they have more there.

89
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:42,330
They have more pathogens within them that they're releasing, and also they release them more.

90
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:45,810
So in a respiratory disease, you're going to cough and sneeze more if you're symptomatic.

91
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:50,670
That's going to release a lot more pathogens than if you're not symptomatic.

92
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:58,709
So. Each one has their role in reducing vector abundance is another example for vector borne

93
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:07,050
diseases that could be targeting adults who could be targeting immature stages of the mosquito.

94
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:13,590
But there's a lot for vector borne diseases in areas where vector borne diseases are endemic.

95
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:21,780
There's a lot of focus and a lot of effort and resources devoted towards different types of vector control.

96
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:28,500
A key thing with respect to these kinds of diseases that, you know,

97
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:37,400
are focused in this category would be we're being responsive to surveillance information and actually having good surveillance information.

98
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:45,580
Information is actually a relevant article in New York Times today about how our public health infrastructure is.

99
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:58,970
Basically broken in the sense that there's a lot of surveillance information often doesn't get to even the state level, let alone the federal level.

100
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:04,219
And so it's hard to be responsive at the state level if you're not getting the information.

101
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:10,790
And some of that has to do with the fact that there's a lot of communities don't have electronic data capture yet.

102
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:16,970
They're still using paper and pencil and therefore still need to upload that information.

103
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:25,910
And that doesn't always happen. So there needs to be a lot more of that, a modernization of the way in which we're capturing data at local levels.

104
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:33,920
And some of it has to do with there's different databases keeping track of vaccination and keeping track of cases and keeping track of mortality.

105
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,850
And they aren't necessarily merged very well.

106
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:41,330
So surveillance information is key to.

107
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:47,440
Effectively modifying transmission. So.

108
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:54,380
Here's just an example of how COVID 19 demonstrated how potent a novel pathogen can be.

109
00:14:54,650 --> 00:15:02,090
Here's our baseline information baseline levels that we see in general.

110
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:16,820
And here's what happened during COVID with respect to deaths due to pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19.

111
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:21,469
So just a dramatic increase in baseline.

112
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:25,700
And we see these little increases that that were significant, you know,

113
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:39,260
at the time that had to do with different either severe strains of influenza or a pandemic strain of influenza that often caused cases.

114
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:49,370
That's to increase the baseline. So and I'd also had this indirect impact on Eli.

115
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:59,420
So really. So here we see that these Eli visits and 2020 to 2021 were way below baseline.

116
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:04,610
And we can see how different years they go. They can go significantly above baseline.

117
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:07,190
Sometimes they don't go above baseline.

118
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:21,050
But this is was a significant decrease in the number of Eli visits likely to do with you know with their down that occurred and sort of extreme.

119
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:35,100
Decrease in contact rates. So a little bit about how influenza, how we monitor influenza and develop the vaccine every year.

120
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:44,310
And that's that's an important part of trying to modify transmission with respect to influenza.

121
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:48,210
Every year, there's global surveillance of new strains that come around.

122
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:53,850
Those strains are identified and vaccines are created again,

123
00:16:53,850 --> 00:17:01,970
to develop the creation of these vaccines are relatively simple compared to developing a vaccine for a novel pathogen.

124
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:13,649
We're just basically trying to modify and the epitopes in which and the antigens in which is targeting with the vaccine that the vaccine is targeting,

125
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:16,470
the basic vaccine design is the same.

126
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:26,399
The approval process, therefore, is much quicker than if you're introducing a new vaccine for a new pathogen production and then vaccine campaign.

127
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,690
This is something that goes on every year or influenza.

128
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:40,410
We'll see what we need to be doing for COVID. Like I mentioned last time, this new booster is the first time they actually modified the vaccine.

129
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:44,700
All previous boosters for COVID 19 have been basically the same original vaccine.

130
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:53,280
So how this will work for COVID, it remains to be seen and whether or not hope it really,

131
00:17:54,480 --> 00:18:00,209
you know, in the long term, in the year to decade kind of scale,

132
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:05,010
whether or not we actually need that type of yearly or whether or not it can be investment, you know,

133
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:11,129
every other year in the third year, certainly more often and a lot of it in the child, the vaccines that we have.

134
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:14,190
Well. Okay.

135
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:24,780
So then the next level of control, which we call control and prevention to keep infectious diseases,

136
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:28,350
that is what we would consider an acceptable endemic level.

137
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:37,590
And acceptable is defined by societal norms when it is what is an acceptable risk with respect to.

138
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,980
The level in which we're trying our goals for keeping disease that day.

139
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:50,620
And so. There's a distinction between prevention.

140
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:58,690
So prevention refers to efforts to promote health and avoid infection or disease.

141
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:12,730
So that's where. And hygiene vaccination, providing ample PPE, protective personal protective equipment like masks come into play.

142
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:20,570
And these are all. Activities that are working to prevent infection.

143
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:34,180
And so if you're you know, if you work well in these continued efforts, you could lead to conditions in which a pathogen is actually eliminated.

144
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:44,110
And so malaria is a good example of that, where we've, you know, in different regions, clearly in the U.S.,

145
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:54,970
but now growing into the Americas, we've been able to get to the stage of eliminating malaria from certain regions.

146
00:19:56,950 --> 00:20:02,750
The control efforts are ones that try and reduce disease to an acceptable level.

147
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:10,450
So examples here, contact tracing would be one way in which we can eliminate, you know, reduce transmissions.

148
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:17,110
We reduce the amount of disease, exposure, isolation.

149
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:18,169
We talked about that.

150
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:27,250
So contact tracing would be sort of corresponding quarantine exposure, isolation, isolation, effective monitoring of disease screening.

151
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:37,660
So these are all efforts which. We just have to continue to maintain in order to keep endemic levels of control

152
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:43,660
is something that we need to continue in order to maintain acceptable levels.

153
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:48,520
Prevention is a way in which we can move towards elimination.

154
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:59,880
So that's things in between in prevention and an example would be diphtheria, where we've been successful at that.

155
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:05,790
Diphtheria produces a toxin, has a high case fatality rate.

156
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,990
The vaccine, as I mentioned last time, is a toxoid.

157
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:16,130
It basically targets the toxin that causes the path pathology.

158
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:24,350
And you can see this incredible decrease in diphtheria cases.

159
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:33,600
And on the left is showing from 1940 on and seeing just a few cases that we saw in the,

160
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:43,730
you know, even early 2000 and pretty much eliminated in the Americas, in the U.S. since 2005.

161
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:53,520
But we're still seeing, you know, thousands, tens of thousands of cases globally in Syria.

162
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:57,960
And control efforts through vaccination have been quite successful.

163
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:04,989
Mumps, on the other hand, is something that has been had been successful, has been successful.

164
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:15,820
But we're seeing this recurrent resurgence of outbreaks largely due to waning immunity and doing to lapse in getting good coverage of.

165
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,260
Good coverage in vaccines.

166
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:34,760
So we see these spikes in cases happening periodically, 2006 to 9, 16 and 17 showing that that there's this resurgence of outbreaks in the months.

167
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:53,749
We talked about this outbreak in Iowa, where we saw that even students that had two boosters, a vaccine, still were susceptible to this outbreak.

168
00:22:53,750 --> 00:23:05,030
These people who would be the students? There is a big vaccination campaign and then subsequently the number of cases of the students dropped first.

169
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:14,899
And then in the community, it subsequently drops a really that really showed how the students were driving transmission and by focusing on vaccination

170
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:24,200
campaign with the students infected with not just injured not only dropped the case on the students but also in the community.

171
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:30,710
And this just shows has students receiving that third dose in response to the outbreak.

172
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:42,140
The effectiveness of this virus, the probability of freedom from the Y axis in this report that we can see that the

173
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:49,190
success of those that got that third dose as opposed to students that get two doses.

174
00:23:49,940 --> 00:24:04,450
So clearly. Clearly waning immunity was a big issue with respect to mumps and why we saw it as we were seeing this resurgence in outbreaks.

175
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:19,010
This also shows this need that not only to have boosters, but also to modify the vaccine to keep up with current strains.

176
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:27,570
And so this is a quote. Although the administration of a third vaccine dose may serve as a response to localize outbreaks in universities,

177
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:31,600
referring to that mumps outbreak in Iowa.

178
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,410
One may question whether it's a solution to the overall problem community.

179
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:43,510
An inherent problem with the Gerald Linn strain of mumps vaccine is that it's a different genotype from the strain now circulating.

180
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:49,209
So is the lesson that boosting with that modify may not be enough?

181
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:58,720
And we're seeing that with COVID the need if we really want to drive mortality down further from our roughly at 400 cases per day,

182
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:08,220
we need to boost we need to modify the vaccine to be much targeting better the honiton variant.

183
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:18,580
Not that the original one wasn't targeting it to some degree, but a vaccine that's going to target that current strain is going to be much more.

184
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:32,330
Okay. So. Elimination is the next level of intensity with respect to control.

185
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:43,400
And elimination is defined as a reduction to zero incidents in a defined geographic area due to intervention activities.

186
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:52,030
In order to maintain that reduction, we need continued intervention efforts.

187
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:56,860
And as I mentioned before, this elimination could be at a local, regional or continental level.

188
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:09,340
So polio is the best example of that, where we eliminated polio from various regions in the world, eliminated from the U.S. But of course,

189
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:22,450
we know that's not exactly true in this current time where we see we've identified polio in sewage and in one paralysis case of polio from somebody.

190
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:29,640
And what's important to distinguish if that paralysis case that we saw in New York and it wasn't an imported case,

191
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:36,550
it wasn't like the person got infected somewhere else and then came to New York and then had to show this had symptoms.

192
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:48,940
This person had no documented evidence to travel that that person was infected with polio in the U.S. So that's a huge, huge deal.

193
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:55,489
This just gives a little background on polio. There's three serotypes.

194
00:26:55,490 --> 00:27:05,750
We basically eradicated size two and three really is wildtype is older type one that's still circulating.

195
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:15,290
And again, this is just a reminder. We'll talk about this a little later, that the fact that 90% of infections are asymptomatic,

196
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:25,100
a further 10% provide have a person exhibits broad spectrum of symptoms and that could be almost anything.

197
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:35,149
I mean, only less than 1% reduced symptoms that are that are unique to polio are specific to polio onset

198
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:41,270
of flaccid paralysis so that a lot of transmission can be happening without even knowing it.

199
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:53,560
This graph shows how successful we released the inactivated vaccine, the IPV, in the mid 1950s.

200
00:27:53,560 --> 00:28:06,640
That was the big, huge trial done by Thomas Francis here at the University of Michigan and then their live oral vaccine OPV in the early sixties,

201
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:13,200
less indigenous case, at least the wild polio type 19.

202
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:25,690
Just before 1980, as we know, we had this protective case of the vaccine variety of polio myelitis that just occurred.

203
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:32,840
Importantly, what we're learning more and more now is that sewage surveillance.

204
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:41,600
Is is a much more sensitive way to identify polio transmission prior to us using it through surveillance.

205
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:51,170
The official definition of whether or not there was polio transmitted is whether or not we identified a case of acute flaccid paralysis.

206
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:58,880
Acute flaccid paralysis from this you know, from here is going to happen one in 10,000 cases.

207
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:02,690
There's a thousand cases that are occurring.

208
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:08,900
So a lot of transmission are occurring before you actually see one case, acute paralysis.

209
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:12,860
So not a very sensitive way to identify transmission of polio.

210
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:16,849
Community serious surveillance can be much more effective.

211
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:20,450
And as what we saw in the Israeli.

212
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,440
So what would they call the silent outbreak?

213
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:34,480
Because they identified extensive transmission in Israel through sewage surveillance, but never identified a case of acute flaccid paralysis.

214
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:45,010
They implemented OPV over a three month period, knocked out, you know, knocked out the transmission and then were able to go back to IPV.

215
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:58,690
It's a little history. So we see this. So VA BP is the vaccine associated with polio,

216
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:08,680
which was mostly what we were seeing in between 1980 and early 2000, a little bit a few imported cases also.

217
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:16,390
But this is this is what polio was looking like between 1980 and 2007.

218
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:24,330
So again, most do most of the cases were due to the vaccine strain.

219
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:31,480
There were some questions actually today about or about last week's lecture about why.

220
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,130
There's a risk of using OPV and there is this risk of using OPV.

221
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:49,960
You get this potential for these cases. So six cases, ten cases, up to 12 or 14 cases of vaccine variety of polio.

222
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:59,409
That is a real risk when you're using OPV. But if you if you know, if IPV is not going to prevent the transmission, you know,

223
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:05,410
what happened in the Israel case of administering OPV over a three month period was deemed

224
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:10,600
to be much match the benefits of that with respect to reducing risk much higher than the,

225
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:19,480
you know, relatively rare situation of actually having a vaccine strain mutated into a pathogenic strain.

226
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:28,340
So that was a decision that was made and that that would be the logic between one deciding to implement over a short period of time.

227
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:38,030
OPV Just to get rid of that transmission. And they did not find any cases that three month period of administering OPV.

228
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:43,940
They didn't document any cases of XP, variety of poliomyelitis that occurred.

229
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:54,950
So challenges to regional polio elimination.

230
00:31:56,120 --> 00:32:03,920
These are supply shortages, conflict regions where we're seeing wild polio still still being transmitted in the world today,

231
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:16,190
mostly in Pakistan and in Afghanistan, are regions where there's a lot of conflict and there's a lot of problems with respect to our challenges,

232
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:20,209
with respect to actually administering this vaccine.

233
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:34,190
I mentioned before that because of malnutrition and the fact that a lot of the kids are immuno compromised, one OPV dose is not enough.

234
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:42,769
They need to do multiple OPV doses to actually elicit an immune response and sometimes as much as 10% need for a given child.

235
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:45,920
So it's a logistic challenge there.

236
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:56,510
Acceptability of vaccine campaigns is another big issue, growing issue certainly in conflict in areas like Afghanistan and Pakistan.

237
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:06,860
We talk about fact, the vaccine derived polio transmission, that that's possible,

238
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:11,089
the fact that the inactivated vaccine more complicated to administer.

239
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:20,420
It's a shot, not a not oral ingestion, and it's less effective and requiring multiple boosters.

240
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:27,240
So another big issue that. Be aware about it.

241
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:37,070
You know, eradication is costly. At this point, the total cost of the eradication campaign is 20 billion.

242
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:43,150
What's estimated right now is it's going to cost annually one $1 billion a year,

243
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:53,040
up to 2042, and then $500 million a year, up to 2066 to eradicate polio.

244
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:57,580
Those are current economic estimates. That's a huge, huge cost.

245
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:07,790
Economist Bill Bennett still project that there's going to be a net benefit because once you've eradicated disease,

246
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:15,920
you no longer have to put that in, administer the vaccine to newborns so that that will be a big benefit.

247
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:24,830
But as we're going to see and talk about later, what are the opportunity costs?

248
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:31,220
If you're going to spend $1,000,000,000 a year on all your education, what are you not spending it on?

249
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:40,740
And that billion dollars a year doesn't improve the public health of children right now because polio is a rare.

250
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:51,380
So. But back to the successes of this eradication program.

251
00:34:54,920 --> 00:35:02,930
We've eradicated effectively both one and three and two and three.

252
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:15,110
And there's enough confidence in the eradication of two that we've moved from a trivalent vaccine to the vaccine that targets type one,

253
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:20,630
two and three to a 5 billion track team to one that only targets 43.

254
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:25,880
And there is just it was a very highly coordinated effort.

255
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:30,620
Specifically on April 17, 2016, to make that switch.

256
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:41,390
In order to do that, they needed to ensure that everybody got rid of any samples of a virus.

257
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:48,170
Polio virus that they had stored some researchers that were storing polio virus or even

258
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:57,620
stool samples that may have polio virus or supposed to get rid of those samples by April 17,

259
00:35:57,620 --> 00:36:05,330
2016. So these are just examples of people burying them and burning them.

260
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:12,500
Different ways in which people in different countries were adhering to the W.H.O.

261
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:23,420
mandate of getting rid of all potential for having a polio polio type two.

262
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:30,730
In somewhere that they may escape so that they could switch to this bivalent.

263
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:44,560
MAXINE. So we still are working on trying to eliminate and therefore eradicate polio by eliminating polio.

264
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:49,010
Type one remains endemic, as I mentioned, in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

265
00:36:49,580 --> 00:37:00,710
And the whole big question right now, because is that we're seeing these vaccine derived polio viruses in the sewage.

266
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:06,020
And again, that can be a decade ago we weren't looking in the sewage. So we don't know what's happening now.

267
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:10,069
We're looking at the sewage and we're seeing it in New York City.

268
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:17,300
We're seeing it in Israel, United Kingdom. And so the question is what that means with respect to eradication.

269
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:31,170
So now going to the last. Control effort, which is eradication, which is rarely occurred.

270
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:36,210
This is a permanent reduction to zero worldwide of incidents of infection.

271
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:43,300
If something is truly eradicated, we no longer need intervention methods measures.

272
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:49,989
That's the biggest motivation for continuing these efforts and spending billions of

273
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:56,530
dollars a year or $1,000,000,000 a year on polio is to not have to worry about.

274
00:37:57,430 --> 00:38:01,180
Urination activities are controlled retention activities for polio.

275
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:06,709
So global elimination is eradication. Local.

276
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:11,030
If somebody says local eradication, that means elimination.

277
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,470
So here's just a list of good candidates for eradication.

278
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:24,719
Only one host. That's important.

279
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:33,840
If you have multiple hosts, it becomes easier for that pathogen to be in another host and you haven't really focused on visible symptoms.

280
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:42,810
And like smallpox, you're only infectious when you're symptomatic.

281
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:47,460
So it becomes much easier to target the vaccination program.

282
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:51,930
Good diagnostics elimination has already been demonstrated.

283
00:38:52,800 --> 00:39:00,390
There needs to be smart and strong support for this eradication effort, and the cost benefit analysis needs to be there.

284
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:08,309
So again, smallpox for all for the reasons listed here were was a good candidate for

285
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:15,090
eradication of the clinical onset of disease given infection spread by droplets.

286
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:22,470
Close contact symptoms were very distinct, especially with respect to the rashes.

287
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:29,340
And it caused a lot of the burden, mortality rates of case fatality rates.

288
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:40,980
But the 30%. This is just a map of where smallpox was being transmitted when the eradication efforts began.

289
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:48,020
67. So.

290
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:58,680
Eradication efforts with smallpox started like you would start eradication efforts that is initially is just trying to increase this mass vaccination.

291
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:07,110
You needed to get high coverage of vaccination in, as you know, as many countries as possible.

292
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:14,879
There's lots of technical difficulty. Setbacks in Nigeria in 1960 6%.

293
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:27,330
Here is one example of that. But what smallpox moved towards was this containment strategy that is targeted interventions and trying to isolate cases,

294
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:34,350
trying to have intense vaccination efforts in areas that were showing transmission

295
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:41,850
and moving to those those countries one by one as countries eliminated transmission.

296
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:49,410
Moving on to these countries where there is intense transmission and therefore intensifying the vaccination.

297
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:54,660
So more targeted strategies and trying to contain transmission.

298
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:08,250
So this kind of just details the success of the smallpox eradication in the last case detected in 75 then.

299
00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:16,960
Very old major in the last case, the smallpox vaccine in 1977.

300
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:29,020
So these are all the factors that parallel the prior slide of, you know, what made polio, what made the eradication of smallpox.

301
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:33,570
Successful variant efficacious vaccine.

302
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:40,860
High proportion of the population were vaccinated. Only one serotype no reservoir host easily identified.

303
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:46,980
You could easily identify cases that were infectious. Relatively inefficient transmission.

304
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:55,110
And so all of these led to successful eradication for polio.

305
00:41:56,370 --> 00:41:59,370
Here's four of those that are not true.

306
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:07,630
And there's three serotypes. There is a reservoir host with polio as an oral fecal oral pathogen that can survive in the water.

307
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:17,230
We obviously identified and we talked about lots of asymptomatic transmission, not contagious and they aren't contagious before the symptomatic cases.

308
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:24,760
So polio already, we can see why we are spending a lot more time and a lot more effort.

309
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:28,599
Polio vaccine. Vaccine Campaign. Eradication campaign.

310
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:35,140
Started in 1988. By 2000, they expected that they were going to be able to eradicate polio, as it were, to date.

311
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:40,780
They had two decades longer and still were working on eradication.

312
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:52,220
And measles, which is has been talked about on the list of eradication efforts, has a very efficient transmission pathway.

313
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:55,560
That's actually one of its secrets of success.

314
00:42:55,740 --> 00:43:02,580
So infectious and spread so quickly. And you can be infectious before you're symptomatic.

315
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:12,160
So measles and because. It has such an efficient transmission pathway make measles look very got to be

316
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:16,990
much more challenging than polio because of that one reason for eradication.

317
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:27,750
This just checks out. Extinction will occur when specific agents no longer exist in nature or in the laboratory system.

318
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:33,100
There was a big effort with smallpox actually eliminated. Strange.

319
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:45,760
Not just. In nature, but also lavatories is still a question of whether or not they're being stockpiled by the U.S. and others in various.

320
00:43:48,010 --> 00:43:59,290
Bioterrorism. Rationales released. This is to show that there was another disease of cattle that was successfully eradicated in 2011.

321
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:07,000
It's a disease closely related to measles and huge efforts to successfully eradicate.

322
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:13,450
Your best. So.

323
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:24,640
Wanted to play this before we move into discussion section session of this play, this six minute video.

324
00:44:24,850 --> 00:44:28,060
Hopefully this works. So this is.

325
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:40,440
A professor from City University of New York. Williams burst into Greece in 2012, I think wrote this book, Polio and Its Discontents.

326
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:48,750
And basically this is a critique of eradication efforts in general and the motivations behind them,

327
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:58,680
not really being about public health, being more about successes in global health to with.

328
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:27,140
I just. It isn't all bad.

329
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:35,620
The question I would ask was that polio eradication and why is there so much discontent about polio eradication, which there it is.

330
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:41,680
And what I discovered was that polio was not a disease that was being eradicated

331
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:45,370
because of a massive demand by the countries that suffered some polio.

332
00:45:45,730 --> 00:45:50,590
It wasn't a disease that was being eradicated because polio experts wanted it to be eradicated.

333
00:45:51,070 --> 00:45:51,670
It, rather,

334
00:45:51,670 --> 00:46:00,730
was a disease that a small number of people in your early 1980s who were committed to the concept of eradication as a major public health tool.

335
00:46:00,970 --> 00:46:04,840
Smallpox had been eradicated. They wanted to eradicate other diseases.

336
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:13,420
But the World Health Organization and most of the World Health Community said no more of these vertical coming.

337
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:17,620
Right. Okay. And we programs, we want primary health care.

338
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:20,380
We want to go to these ancient systems,

339
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:29,920
one of those systems that will last forever and that will produce and deliver health codes to children into the future indefinitely.

340
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:35,110
But there were these people who committed to eradication, said, we knew the disease to eradicate.

341
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:41,410
We have to get a model. We've got to prove it is doable. A second time, any disease that's eradicated will work.

342
00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:46,990
And the one that apparently they could get immediately do something about was polio.

343
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:51,069
It was a minor disease. It had a little fatality at a time.

344
00:46:51,070 --> 00:46:55,780
The children were dying in the millions from other diseases, but not from polio.

345
00:46:55,930 --> 00:47:02,469
They emphasize polio, the opportunity corps spending, which we don't do because you're doing something else.

346
00:47:02,470 --> 00:47:10,900
We're very high. They wouldn't even consider any opportunity cause they said, is going to be a very cheap campaign, $100 million.

347
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:18,130
It's going to be done very fast by the year 2000, starting in 1988, and get the benefits will be insane.

348
00:47:18,310 --> 00:47:22,540
They would go on forever because you wouldn't have to give them polio vaccine anymore.

349
00:47:22,990 --> 00:47:32,350
Instead, what they discovered was in the course over one year, now seven or $8 billion, they have not yet accomplished the eradication of polio.

350
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:40,110
The benefits will not be infinite because the vaccine that there is a Sabin oral polio vaccine hides

351
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:45,970
the problem that it could mutate into a virulent strain that indeed could cause epidemics on its own.

352
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:51,879
And because of the danger that there might be some of that lurking out there, they're going to have to use another,

353
00:47:51,880 --> 00:48:01,390
more expensive vaccine, the sold inactivated killed vaccine, perhaps for the next five years, ten years, 20 years indefinitely.

354
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:07,550
And so the actual cost to the developing world is going to be greater than if they had done it,

355
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:12,820
not tried for eradication, but tried for regular, routine immunization.

356
00:48:13,270 --> 00:48:21,969
And so that's what the book explores and explores how a small group of men who came to eradication were

357
00:48:21,970 --> 00:48:29,290
able to basically hijack the world's public health agenda and focus upon this particular disease.

358
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:34,660
You know, people thought they were going reluctantly, perhaps into polio eradication.

359
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:40,690
But what they really were buying into was eradication as a concept, didn't even know what their agenda was.

360
00:48:40,930 --> 00:48:46,420
Only these small groups of people that at the beginning, almost no one was for eradication.

361
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:53,680
But over time, despite all the failures and cost overruns and delays of polio eradication,

362
00:48:53,950 --> 00:48:58,210
the propaganda machine has convince people that eradication is the way to go.

363
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:02,260
The Bill Gates Foundation has been convinced eradication is the way to go.

364
00:49:02,470 --> 00:49:06,880
And the result is that there are now people planning future eradication program.

365
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:14,410
They want to do will decline the polio infrastructure which normally would simply disappear after while polio is eradicated.

366
00:49:14,710 --> 00:49:19,030
We can't let that happen. We have to use it. So why don't we go for measles?

367
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:24,850
Maybe we'll go for lunch tomorrow for Bel-Air also. Or the multiple eradication campaigns.

368
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:30,760
And the reality is that the lessons of the polio campaign were there's so much

369
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:35,440
we don't understand of the biology of the facts on the ground in the world.

370
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:39,520
Unintended consequences and science is not perfected.

371
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:45,370
And here, instead of saying, My God, let's be very careful in the future, the very opposite is occurred.

372
00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:50,800
They say, well, we didn't it the first time, but now we know those areas will do that again.

373
00:49:51,010 --> 00:49:56,410
Now we can do three, three, use eradication simultaneously.

374
00:49:56,620 --> 00:50:02,680
The amount of hubris involved, of conceit involved, of arrogance involved is mind boggling.

375
00:50:03,010 --> 00:50:09,460
And that's what the book deals with. And that's what I dealt with in this discussion yesterday.

376
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:19,420
The problem, the attraction of eradication is that it appeals to politicians and philanthropists because they feel they're going to get some.

377
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:22,820
Going for it. I get my money and I get eradication.

378
00:50:22,970 --> 00:50:26,780
There's a beginning, a middle and an end. And the end is glorious.

379
00:50:26,810 --> 00:50:31,220
It is. I have contributed to the eradication forever of the disease.

380
00:50:31,910 --> 00:50:35,060
Building long term structures is not glamorous.

381
00:50:35,330 --> 00:50:39,490
It's not. At the end of a certain news you said we're done.

382
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:44,030
No one is needed. No more support is needed. It's hard to get politicians.

383
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:52,220
Politicians in America are willing to build new airplanes for their efforts all the time, but not to pay for replacement parts.

384
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:58,930
That's the glorious thing. We've a brand new fighter plane replacement parts because they're wearing out.

385
00:50:58,970 --> 00:51:03,170
There's no glory in that. We can't get that done. You're building new dams.

386
00:51:03,170 --> 00:51:06,800
Fabulous. Supporting that dam over time. Not so.

387
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:12,750
So unfortunate human beings. So there's a lot of glory attached to.

388
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:21,320
To revocation and not so much glory here. It's so much more important for that stadium, whole whole building and maintaining the structures.

389
00:51:21,530 --> 00:51:24,290
And I think that's and that's the basic problem that we have here.

390
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:31,510
It's an easy sell for eradication and to have your name on a statue erected for it years for the

391
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:38,530
boring routine immunization system or the boring health system that protects people's lives.

392
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:44,260
That's the part. Okay.

393
00:51:45,570 --> 00:51:59,010
It's going to be much better than I can say. And so he's in a discussion in question, which is basically goes off of that morning.

394
00:51:59,010 --> 00:52:07,680
We can start. And today we'll be discussing poliomyelitis, but not today.

395
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:15,770
So the first question. Polio eradication efforts have been going on for over three decades.

396
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:20,610
We we're currently on the brink of eradication. Are these eradication efforts worthwhile?

397
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:28,829
You saw the arguments against that just now argue for and against for an argument against eradication.

398
00:52:28,830 --> 00:52:35,370
What would be your prevention control strategy? And then the second would be relate this to malaria,

399
00:52:35,370 --> 00:52:43,859
because as was mentioned in this YouTube presentation was that in the Bill and

400
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:50,280
Melinda Gates Foundation decided a decade ago that malaria eradication was possible.

401
00:52:50,310 --> 00:52:58,140
This was after scientists for decades believed that it wasn't possible and that we needed to really focus on control.

402
00:52:58,470 --> 00:53:05,850
So currently there's efforts to eradicate malaria. How might the malaria argument for and against eradication be different than other polio

403
00:53:07,770 --> 00:53:14,640
issues relative to the fact that it's a vector borne fecal oral transmitted disease?

404
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:22,970
So. With that, you can break out into your discussion discussion group and we'll come back to.

405
00:53:31,850 --> 00:53:54,180
You need to stretch marks like you're going to be a superhero.

406
00:53:55,790 --> 00:54:05,810
Is that going to be paralyzed from the waist down?

407
00:54:08,690 --> 00:54:15,130
Yeah, he's going to send a gun and then everything else.

408
00:54:16,070 --> 00:54:38,480
I just think it's going to cost more to raise this woman's disease, because certainly the intention is to start with eradication.

409
00:54:39,260 --> 00:55:10,010
There was a huge amount of funding that I felt very strongly that, you know, sometimes there is only one left and therefore it would be nice.

410
00:55:11,090 --> 00:55:22,380
But yeah, it's like, you know, that guy is a great person on that like economic scale for like vaccines.

411
00:55:22,490 --> 00:55:30,560
Like, is there a certain I don't know if, you know, is there like a certain level of eradication that exceed and see that it has to be

412
00:55:30,570 --> 00:55:38,399
for it to be positive because it seems like any bit of protection against people,

413
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:48,540
like I say, saving money like a certain number of powders, just kind of, you know, any women who are concerned right now.

414
00:55:48,570 --> 00:55:52,620
Yeah, I don't think so.

415
00:55:54,470 --> 00:55:58,730
Yeah, I think there's been quite a lot of, you know, ex-cons benefit.

416
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:07,970
I'm not sure everything is turning the needle because, like, I even realize that, again,

417
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:27,020
these crazies always have their own agenda and reduce their area of possibility to the adverse events.

418
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:38,190
You know, we're starting to see something really nice.

419
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:47,870
So the when when the rotavirus vaccine was really interesting, I could see it was a pretty rare medical,

420
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:58,120
very serious matter to stop the violence against all diseases this time.

421
00:56:58,810 --> 00:57:10,070
So the vaccine wasn't it was like, yeah, I don't know if your administration was the one to eradicate polio, you'd be like, Oh yeah.

422
00:57:10,930 --> 00:57:20,660
So yeah, more ironically, I eradicate it totally, you know, because I know, I mean, like, like I think that's going to be if you to either.

423
00:57:23,030 --> 00:57:48,790
Right now they are using WhatsApp practice where they talk about shooting the dude like his daughter.

424
00:57:49,580 --> 00:58:07,790
Just like culture. And then he created a vaccine for it to expand it without question.

425
00:58:07,790 --> 00:58:13,920
And that's what this virus is.

426
00:58:15,050 --> 00:58:30,310
Because you're totally wrong. We're done. He's like, Yeah, we're sure malaria is in general.

427
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:47,180
I never felt like one day in my shirt, suddenly in a place like, I don't know where is it going to be, the pinwheel sandwiches or something like that.

428
00:58:48,890 --> 00:58:56,480
He's kind of like, you know, very his.

429
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:08,330
So, yeah. So for me, it was going to be less depressive like there's so it seems like there's so many tickets for sale.

430
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:13,700
Yeah, but you have to see it all depends on like what?

431
00:59:13,730 --> 00:59:21,040
You don't want to get that because we cannot wait for the end of the year.

432
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:30,670
Maybe that's. That's. Yeah.

433
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:34,040
Okay, so there is a malaria situation.

434
00:59:37,070 --> 00:59:43,860
So one is going to be able to control.

435
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:50,660
Yeah. Because you don't have the answer mechanism and think just the matter of the

436
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:54,229
way that the parasites do stuff that there's like a whole complicated cycle,

437
00:59:54,230 --> 01:00:00,570
like the way it's like import complicated is our best disease is on drugs, so.

438
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:03,990
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly.

439
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:20,730
I'm sorry. What we're doing is we're injury related, you know, are we going to have this, like, a breakup?

440
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:29,330
Yeah. So there's, like, a limit on resources and resources. I thought I might do that, but I just told you about that.

441
01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:36,590
Yeah. And sometimes when questions on values are exploding.

442
01:00:36,590 --> 01:00:38,900
So would you say that again? I don't know.

443
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:52,700
Oh, I just think it's probably going against the search engine for something like, yeah, you could use that.

444
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:59,360
And how that uses. Doesn't that mean she doesn't take the example.

445
01:01:00,530 --> 01:01:12,020
Yeah. If you chose the terms. But no it was just a question of like imposing something can only work.

446
01:01:12,130 --> 01:01:27,350
What she goes, that's her business. And then I don't I don't mind if I said I know which it's inappropriate.

447
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:37,400
Yeah. I don't even think it could be cases like.

448
01:01:43,580 --> 01:02:00,380
Yeah. I mean I think although it'd be great to have her back, I know it's still like this is like priorities and like it's really,

449
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:11,210
it's like that's how you think, you know, because every yeah.

450
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:18,990
I'll be like yesterday it was like, oh, well, I don't know which one is one.

451
01:02:23,730 --> 01:02:48,350
80% of those who work under children actually make up the probability that the samples are not designed for destruction, at least for sure.

452
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:56,640
It's not like it's okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

453
01:02:57,310 --> 01:03:02,430
Right. What about what you said?

454
01:03:02,430 --> 01:03:12,100
It wasn't, but I mean, if it's in the waste water cans, which. Yes, it is, but I was thinking about what would happen.

455
01:03:12,150 --> 01:03:17,190
Yeah, I just think these people actually like having specific measures on it.

456
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:21,950
So yeah, I don't know how expensive it is.

457
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:28,170
We have that measure so you can just drop it in Nairobi.

458
01:03:28,170 --> 01:03:37,649
And so they don't transmit as much as instead of just giving them one. Like, I know a lot of us think that there is prophylaxis for it.

459
01:03:37,650 --> 01:03:40,360
That's like you could do it.

460
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:56,969
Or even against that, we do have a way of controlling it without really going through the forum, but we're like, That's true.

461
01:03:56,970 --> 01:04:06,750
They really just raise whatever. I think they're thinking about it and you start to see something you could be thinking too.

462
01:04:06,810 --> 01:04:22,700
Like, you know, but I'll tell you how to use a garbage bag just like that, right?

463
01:04:23,340 --> 01:04:27,000
Because like you're trying to get rid of some of the information.

464
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:43,310
Is that even up to last year, years where this one was saying saying about it?

465
01:04:43,470 --> 01:04:49,730
But I'm not sure. Yeah, yeah, they're very Florida.

466
01:04:49,740 --> 01:05:10,890
I talk to the people around me for my friends and they bring in somebody else like they think that mysterious.

467
01:05:12,030 --> 01:05:26,940
And I don't know what is the died or what is that feeling.

468
01:05:27,350 --> 01:05:35,460
And so many people seem to be able to shock you.

469
01:05:36,150 --> 01:05:42,660
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

470
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:54,610
That's why they don't like something on the news.

471
01:05:55,620 --> 01:06:10,890
Yeah, because it's President Donald Trump could easily have everybody walking in and out feeling yeah really Australia so,

472
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:18,090
so interesting actually he said he's like it right.

473
01:06:18,990 --> 01:06:39,720
Yeah. I guess we don't really automatically going to be like don't I never heard of things like oh I'm totally different

474
01:06:40,350 --> 01:07:00,940
like the bug seems to be because I think you're going to have to ask like who would like to see their credit score?

475
01:07:01,030 --> 01:07:10,620
Well, they use a lot of small, basic things like everything's okay, you can read anything in regulations.

476
01:07:11,130 --> 01:07:19,610
Yeah. So yeah, the first ones from one person was much more.

477
01:07:20,070 --> 01:07:22,709
You basically had to. I think he just needed to help some. Finishing it.

478
01:07:22,710 --> 01:07:28,810
So I add it like kind of a line in the surrounding government in which must succeed because the health system,

479
01:07:29,830 --> 01:07:34,440
it's only because we don't like what I heard.

480
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:40,750
But they do seem to be shuttered and injured.

481
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:47,130
Pyramid of the. You know, I think we don't have a purpose.

482
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:58,930
Yeah I just bite and I think they may also like ah but you know, have closing things, you know, maybe.

483
01:07:59,220 --> 01:08:06,660
But they used to go there for lizards.

484
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:10,410
Okay. It isn't like that, you know the street related to the like.

485
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:14,900
Yeah. Yeah. Definitely have different is what you're about.

486
01:08:14,910 --> 01:08:23,510
What exactly is the of you know I guess they have everything.

487
01:08:24,930 --> 01:08:36,270
Okay let's come back and do some reporting out of like here but I know you have another roommate, group seven.

488
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:46,100
In terms of question one. Yeah. Um, so.

489
01:08:46,250 --> 01:08:47,690
And the.

490
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:59,479
And for the eradication of polio, we kind of argue that we don't necessarily need the vaccination campaigns if there's an outbreak to to give OPV,

491
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:03,380
if that's decided upon, as well as money will be saved.

492
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:09,980
Theoretically, if you don't have to put it towards the eradication, you can go towards other public health.

493
01:09:13,270 --> 01:09:21,640
So many great so many can be saved. And if they would be eradicate, I guess this is a shorter term look at it.

494
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:25,870
But if money, money would be safe to use for other things. I mean, it's a little circulated.

495
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:38,620
It's probably just just. What we want where we're concerned about is we're going to save on the regular vaccines and we don't have to include them.

496
01:09:39,460 --> 01:09:42,550
And then also, there won't be as many there will.

497
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:51,400
If there's no if it is completely eradicated, then there won't be any cases for like polio and then against eradication.

498
01:09:52,300 --> 01:09:57,160
It's like with the guy racing in the video, it's kind of really expensive.

499
01:09:58,390 --> 01:10:03,840
A lot of cases are very severe, and then there's multiple strains, which makes it difficult to eradicate.

500
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:09,050
So I guess we didn't have as much for eradication. I guess it's difficult to find out.

501
01:10:10,710 --> 01:10:14,010
And what would you. What would be your strategy? I'm sorry.

502
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:17,940
What would be the prevention and control strategy? Because you're now have polio.

503
01:10:19,130 --> 01:10:29,209
Endemic. So continuing to use the IPB if there's an outbreak using the OPV and monitoring through wastewater to see.

504
01:10:29,210 --> 01:10:37,460
I know if you're if you're monitoring over time you can see when the the levels of polio in wastewater will be higher,

505
01:10:37,460 --> 01:10:43,010
which can indicate transmission. But that's also maybe a little bit.

506
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:49,900
But I think that is where people are forgetting because it's focused on eradication,

507
01:10:49,910 --> 01:10:54,340
the fact we're in the brink of eradication, we just kind of just hit the vaccine.

508
01:10:54,350 --> 01:11:08,240
The vaccines heavily is that it is a fecal oral pathogen where basic water and sanitation and can control disease.

509
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:16,160
It's noteworthy they're not really how by that in Israel where there was sustained

510
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:21,470
transmission was in the Bedouin communities in southern Israel where they have much,

511
01:11:22,370 --> 01:11:27,170
much poorer sanitation levels than the rest of Israel.

512
01:11:28,130 --> 01:11:36,000
So. Anecdotal evidence that transmission is occurring because of the poor sanitation.

513
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:44,140
So. Something to keep in mind. And it's often forgotten that this is a people oral transmission.

514
01:11:44,750 --> 01:11:53,970
Standard wash interventions could be. Anything to add for Group six.

515
01:11:58,970 --> 01:12:02,150
A lot of the things that they talked about.

516
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:10,700
One. Oh.

517
01:12:12,700 --> 01:12:22,270
Russo talked about developing a better Rick scene as well, with Nathan Lane improving on the vaccine that exists.

518
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:34,540
And any discussion on the OPV IPV. Trade off.

519
01:12:36,020 --> 01:12:42,410
I think we kind of have the same idea, you know, using OPV when we need to for short periods of time, let three months,

520
01:12:43,610 --> 01:12:48,649
three months period like you talk about in lecture and then making sure to monitor

521
01:12:48,650 --> 01:12:53,660
wastewater during that and then transition back to IPV as soon as possible.

522
01:12:56,220 --> 01:13:07,570
Okay. The other thing to mention is that this what you saw in that video is something that you would read about in a critique

523
01:13:07,570 --> 01:13:17,500
of global health and how global health is the motivation behind who chooses activities to do and the fact that.

524
01:13:18,910 --> 01:13:25,299
Now that we have these big foundations like the Gates Foundation making decisions,

525
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:31,360
and their decisions have a lot of impact because if they're going to say we're going to eradicate polio,

526
01:13:32,350 --> 01:13:36,520
they're putting tons of resources in this resource poor area.

527
01:13:37,660 --> 01:13:41,120
And they may. And so primary health care is not being.

528
01:13:41,710 --> 01:13:44,080
Not only is it not being supported,

529
01:13:44,710 --> 01:13:51,940
but the good people are moving to the eradication program because the Gates Foundation is putting huge amounts of money into it.

530
01:13:52,240 --> 01:14:01,150
So there's a way to the issues and the opportunity costs are huge with respect to making a decision to eradicate.

531
01:14:01,870 --> 01:14:10,900
And you'll see again and you'll see this a lot. There's a lot of literature on that topic and how global health like how.

532
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:21,230
So shifting to the second question. Yeah, so.

533
01:14:22,180 --> 01:14:28,150
Thinking about it for an occasion, we said it can be very deadly.

534
01:14:28,780 --> 01:14:38,260
Approximately half a million deaths a year impacting primarily of children under the age of five.

535
01:14:40,870 --> 01:14:46,470
Hundreds of millions of cases every year. In the draw against, he said.

536
01:14:47,970 --> 01:14:50,070
It would be difficult because it's factors spread.

537
01:14:50,940 --> 01:14:57,780
It's also the other thing to consider would be some might argue, against the allocation of resources to certain countries where prevalence is high.

538
01:14:59,740 --> 01:15:05,010
And there was also a fair amount of interventions already in place to control the transmission.

539
01:15:05,700 --> 01:15:11,920
So. In what?

540
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:19,440
And what's one big distinction between the polio case and malaria case?

541
01:15:19,900 --> 01:15:22,740
There's there's a number of them. But some of the big distinction make.

542
01:15:24,970 --> 01:15:31,690
That would affect your argument for or against with respect to malaria as opposed to polio deaths.

543
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:35,720
You want to minimize deaths would be one of them. Right? Right.

544
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:40,430
Right. But also about both that.

545
01:15:42,450 --> 01:15:44,639
You know, we talked about a couple of things.

546
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:51,660
We talked about the properties of the pathogen and what made it attractive to be going toward eradication.

547
01:15:51,660 --> 01:15:57,600
So that's one thing. And we also talked about the different tools that we might have in vaccines or a big one.

548
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:04,249
In the tool kit for smallpox and polio. Malaria.

549
01:16:04,250 --> 01:16:13,430
We have no vaccine. So what we would consider a cornerstone of these sanitation efforts would be very different.

550
01:16:15,290 --> 01:16:28,100
And with malaria. Also, malaria is a sweet spot as far as though it's a much more complicated organism so than that.

551
01:16:29,750 --> 01:16:33,320
Means that the way in which. Not a lot.

552
01:16:33,350 --> 01:16:37,729
Not long term immunity. Just to get more difficult.

553
01:16:37,730 --> 01:16:43,210
It's a it's going to have a lot more. Better ability to evade immune.

554
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:48,250
The malaria becomes sort of amping up.

555
01:16:48,580 --> 01:16:58,570
You know, I didn't even mention malaria to mention childhood diseases as most I think of viruses and measles and stuff.

556
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:08,500
You know, where where a lot of the checkmarks of what makes it attractive because it only has one host that it's directly transmitted and

557
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:20,079
such are met with very stable virus that we don't need to repeat the vaccination very much and we still see some way in community,

558
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:24,630
but relative to other pathogens we don't. That's not so.

559
01:17:32,490 --> 01:17:36,390
For Groupon, anything to add on the second one?

560
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:50,349
Yeah. We talked about like a guns and we talked about like the implications to global health, the eradication strategy,

561
01:17:50,350 --> 01:17:58,240
especially from like as most of the prevalence of malaria, is largely found in low and middle income countries.

562
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:04,629
And you can see the parallels to like the tropical health method of global

563
01:18:04,630 --> 01:18:12,010
health as a like paternal and colonialist imposition of healthcare delivery.

564
01:18:13,550 --> 01:18:15,600
So that would be something that we would argue against.

565
01:18:15,620 --> 01:18:22,879
And then we also talked about how there may be more effective controls of malaria, such as like water purification,

566
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:28,310
mosquito and mosquito control, and make it more cost effective to focus on that sort of an eradication campaign.

567
01:18:29,590 --> 01:18:37,749
Right. That's that's great. I mean, this whole you know, if you would think about it and the less colonial type,

568
01:18:37,750 --> 01:18:40,840
an approach, a colonial approach might dictate that says what we do.

569
01:18:40,870 --> 01:18:49,870
We're doing all this research here in these big fancy labs, and we understand transmission and we understand how to intervene.

570
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:56,930
That's a lot different than going to the and saying, well, what what what do you see as a problem and what would you like?

571
01:18:57,460 --> 01:19:01,580
Where would you like resources to go and what kinds of solutions would you like to see?

572
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:06,760
Hollywood. Never, ever the novelist.

573
01:19:07,030 --> 01:19:11,109
And a lot of places of malaria's, you know, in the areas that we're working in,

574
01:19:11,110 --> 01:19:19,720
in Ecuador, malaria has dropped tremendously to replace malaria with respect to the.

575
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:26,660
Leading causes, so communities would not come up with malaria either anymore.

576
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:34,160
So they're driven by what they're being affected, what's what's affecting them and what's causing these burdens.

577
01:19:34,190 --> 01:19:45,830
So. There is a lot of movement towards that kind of public health reality that is supposed to be the public health model.

578
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:52,800
That you engage with the community and you come up with solutions, and that's often kind of lost.

579
01:19:53,310 --> 01:19:58,800
So I think a lot of the literature and this colonialism, the colonization.
