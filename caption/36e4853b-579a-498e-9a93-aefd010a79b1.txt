1
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:08,220
So there is like a secret. There is a little area around.

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:21,090
When we were out and I was like, Oh, hi, I didn't realize you were speaking to me.

3
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,940
There you go. When you're out on the street.

4
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:30,450
Yeah. Like, you know, I did the same thing.

5
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:38,650
I saw this girl. She doesn't know she's my dad.

6
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:57,390
I was like a guard as soon as I got a call on my drinks.

7
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:05,570
It was like, I think I was going to wear this my hours.

8
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,320
So I think I'm going to wear this jacket once more inside.

9
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:17,630
So. Yes.

10
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:28,970
I was like so. She was extremely happy.

11
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,140
You. Oh, I see.

12
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:52,070
Wow. I think she goes. I can't even tell you what last time was.

13
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:56,270
I went to see how this will happen.

14
00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:03,589
You know, I just I was scared. She was just chilling and, like, it was difficult.

15
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:21,840
We had to, like, really, I'm glad to actually take your time to read.

16
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:51,590
You know, it's very possible that, you know, I went to a freshman year and I didn't want to go on.

17
00:02:52,980 --> 00:03:03,810
And I'm not hurting you guys like that.

18
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:08,540
I like to get everybody on my side.

19
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:20,540
And that's one where you are going to go, you know?

20
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:37,970
And like that was like I, you know, my on the right path on the ground and how they like doing the best.

21
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:49,160
Like you just inspire a drinking journey to be honest to here.

22
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:58,640
So thanks so much for turning in your background population in the first part of your group project.

23
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,699
So we're in the process of getting you comments back and we want to do that very quickly

24
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:10,249
so you can have that feedback as you start to embark on some of these next steps.

25
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:14,540
So keep a lookout for that over the next couple of days.

26
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:21,139
We should be able to turn that around to you. Any questions?

27
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:31,880
We're about a month into the semester. No one gets into the class and these sort of questions that we're we're going pretty straightforward.

28
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:37,700
Okay. So you have another theory assessment this week to Friday.

29
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:43,730
So we had a few off week, so we're back on to it. So you'll have one on Friday.

30
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:50,569
And today we're going to be talking about motivational interviewing as a follow up to self-determination

31
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:56,990
theory of the nice motivational interviewing and then segway from self-determination theory.

32
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:02,500
So last time when we met, um, we talked about this theory.

33
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:07,820
Um, self-determination theory is very specific to motivation and how we take action.

34
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,340
And that's really the crux of that theory.

35
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:19,250
It essentially tells us that we have three basic psychological needs that can foster high the highest levels of motivation and engagement.

36
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:25,070
When they're all activated and when they're thwarted, they can impact our wellness.

37
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:31,260
So self-determination theory is really focused on an outcome of, well, this.

38
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:36,649
We also talked about the degrees of motivation.

39
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:43,760
So we talked about what a motivation to apply in terms of those three psychological need.

40
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:47,030
And then we talked about extrinsic motivation.

41
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:59,420
So things that are really sort of motivated by factors in the environment could be compliance or any sort of external rewards.

42
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:05,149
And then another level that's not quite intrinsic but interjected where it's

43
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:10,160
really sort of controlled by our own sort of internal rewards and punishment.

44
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:15,230
And then, you know, the highest level of motivation is really about intrinsic one.

45
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,760
Innovation. We're something. We do things because they're personally important to us.

46
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,600
Or do you find a lot of value in them?

47
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,560
Or there's a lot of satisfaction associated with them in those levels.

48
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:32,810
You see high self-efficacy, high autonomy and how they relate.

49
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:40,990
So motivational interviewing is not a theory or model.

50
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:50,059
So I want to make that very clear. It's a method of communication that came out of clinical environments through the discovery that there

51
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:55,820
are certain sort of communication techniques that work better than others in facilitating change,

52
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:01,010
especially when we're counseling people with around addictive behaviors.

53
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:07,820
So motivational interviewing is a method of behavior change, a theory or model.

54
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:15,650
It's one of those tools you might use in an intervention that you're designing to address that particular issue.

55
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:23,360
So given the wide range of things you guys are focusing on in this course, motivational interviewing may make sense.

56
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:33,080
Is an intervention strategy that you decide to use as part of your projects, or you may not want to make sure you at least have this in your toolbox.

57
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:42,590
So the connection between motivational interviewing and self determination theory was that the architects, the motivational interviewing,

58
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:48,319
we're really able to look back to a theory that really explains the change process

59
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:54,290
that motivational interviewing tends to is sort of intending to facilitate.

60
00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:02,030
So in other words, motivational interviewing is one method through which we enhance or intervene on intrinsic motivation.

61
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:08,270
So if we're trying to enhance intrinsic motivation in folks, we might use motivational.

62
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:19,430
So self-determination theory and motivational interviewing have both been drawn from evolutionary perspective of psychology,

63
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:28,640
and our from varying perspective is essentially unconditional positive regard and very patient centered.

64
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:40,260
And many of the underlying assumptions, the approaches, Rosemary, in psychology, are really evident and motivational.

65
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:54,540
So some of the assumptions around behavior change.

66
00:08:54,570 --> 00:09:02,210
A lot of these are sadly still in practice, but motivational interviewing aims to challenge all of these assumptions.

67
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:10,969
So when we think about whether a person ought to change or whether they want to change their health is

68
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:17,000
their prime motivating factor that everyone cares about their health and they're really motivated by that.

69
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:26,030
People are either motivated or not. It's just that black and white, you're in one bucket or you're in the other.

70
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,570
A tough approach is always that.

71
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:40,250
These are things that we see being used with behavior change quite a bit in many of us personally might default to it, maybe not in every situation.

72
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:51,600
But you know, I definitely see myself a little bit in this, you know, when I especially when I'm engaging with my husband around some behavior change.

73
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:57,680
And, you know, I think, again, these are all pitfalls of behavior change.

74
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:04,280
And my motivational interviewing aims to challenge all of these assumptions.

75
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:12,799
So Rolnick and Miller were the original architects of motivational interviewing,

76
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:23,390
and they show that it's a client centered directive method for enhancing intrinsic motivation to change by exploring and resolving ambivalence.

77
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:31,250
So motivational interviewing what it's doing in the process of communication is resolving ambivalence.

78
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:40,880
And the directive client centered aspect is really important because it suggests that there's a direction that the coach wants to go in.

79
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:49,190
And this is different from Rotarian Therapy that came out of psychology where it is truly client

80
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:55,339
centered and the goal is to support the behaviors that derive from an individual's values,

81
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:59,719
regardless of whether society views those behaviors as productive, adverse.

82
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:14,720
So in reviewing psychology and its counseling, for example, let's say it's around drug addiction, it's okay to support someone through drug addiction.

83
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:23,150
If you're counseling them using a rosemary and psychology perspective, in their mind, it is more directive.

84
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:26,600
There's a goal you're trying to get them out of drug addiction.

85
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:42,690
So it's not quite the same. So the main the main points of motivational interviewing are that it's a method of communication to elicit change.

86
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:51,120
It's person centered. It is this individuals to work through their ambivalence.

87
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:01,320
It's goal driven and directional. So there's a clear behavioral outcome that you're focused on.

88
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:09,830
When you're going into a situation where you're using motivational interviewing and as a technique, there's somewhere you want to go with it.

89
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:18,860
It's not like that. Open ended and counselors guide the client to really think about their own reasons for changing.

90
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:27,509
So the client's of reasons, that's really the goal of the person conducting violence or sort of facilitating the motivational

91
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:35,560
interviewing and encourages informed decision making through an individual's own motivation.

92
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:38,580
So again, there's an emphasis on autonomy.

93
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:54,220
So in motivational interviewing, views on autonomy are a little bit different than what is intended in self-determination theory.

94
00:12:54,670 --> 00:13:03,850
So in self-determination theory, autonomy is really choice or power in the action that you're taking and not necessarily taking independent action,

95
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:12,840
which can be concerning to a clinician depending on the situation when using an intimate approach,

96
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,980
like not necessarily trying to get them to take independent action, it's really about choice or power.

97
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:26,680
And so self-determination theory is perfectly acceptable to have an outcome of being more visionary, not inherent.

98
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:34,690
But I'm just I'm not going to do something that everyone else thinks is health promoting.

99
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:37,750
And I made that decision. And that is the choice.

100
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:44,200
That's the autonomous choice that I have made. You made a decision to not do something because it aligns with your values.

101
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:49,480
And am I in motivational interviewing? It's not really clear whether that's an acceptable outcome.

102
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:58,360
If you're going into a counseling situation where there is sort of a goal or outcome in mind, and this is important,

103
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:05,050
especially when you're evaluating interventions, since the goal is to really strike someone towards a particular outcome.

104
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:08,170
So that's where it gets a little fuzzy and gray.

105
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:18,670
And self-determination theory and higher autonomy is valued because there are architects that really identified it as a basic, fundamental need.

106
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:24,520
Remember, one of the three psychological needs in self-determination theory is autonomy,

107
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:31,860
whereas in motivational interviewing, autonomy is valued because it got us to the outcomes we want.

108
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:39,100
If people felt like they had a stake in the process of change, they were less likely to sort of drop out of that process.

109
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:46,140
So autonomy is really sort of this facilitator that helps us get to that outcome.

110
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:49,920
So there are some different viewpoints of autonomy,

111
00:14:50,220 --> 00:15:00,240
but we really want to make clear how some of these core basic needs are interpreted based on how autonomy is sort of conceptualized.

112
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:08,220
So it's a little bit so self-determination theory and motivational interviewing view, autonomy and a couple of different things.

113
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:13,530
So remember, self-determination theory is a theory and is a method.

114
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:19,640
So as part of that method, you know, it's part of it is really thinking about, you know,

115
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:27,750
what role does really autonomy play that motivational interviewing and appears to be more of a mechanism to get that outcome which.

116
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:37,350
So how how does motivational interviewing work? How many of you have exposure to motivational?

117
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:52,820
How many of you feel? On this scale of 1 to 10, five or above meaning, we're pretty confident with your motivational interviewing skills OC.

118
00:15:55,340 --> 00:16:02,570
We have some experts in the room. And so motivational interviewing starts with questions about motivation.

119
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:08,930
And we want to use a fairly broad scale to measure motivation.

120
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:14,270
So on a 1 to 10 scale, it really helps us parse out where people are at with their motivation.

121
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:20,689
We really want to find those who are ambivalent and explore that more and change that.

122
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:28,520
So again, mine is about exploring ambivalence and these individuals display all different kinds of motivation.

123
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:31,990
So this is where most people are in terms of.

124
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:39,970
This is where most people are in terms of issues that they may be exploring.

125
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:49,550
So on a range of 3 to 7. You might explore motivational interviewing as a method of maybe resolving some of them,

126
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:58,040
but those are in the 0 to 2 range are really what we would call perhaps pre contemplation and stage models.

127
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:06,170
There are a motivated and not that interested in changing and in the nine and ten range, people tend to be intrinsically motivated.

128
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:14,160
So you're going to start with a scale to see whether you're going to even use that by in this situation.

129
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:21,380
And hopefully the person says 3 to 7, 0 to 2 or 9 to 10, you probably shouldn't use motivation.

130
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:32,360
So these are five principles that really guide the practice of mind.

131
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:40,370
So expressing empathy, using reflective listening, supporting self-efficacy.

132
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:44,930
So getting them getting people to be optimistic about changing.

133
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:55,100
In your reading, there was a study cited that found that more counselors confront clients about their drinking, the more clients drink and follow up.

134
00:17:55,100 --> 00:18:01,999
And this work sort of raises the hypothesis that confrontation may sort of be the

135
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,040
antithesis of building up someone's self-efficacy that have a real impact on that.

136
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:11,659
And there's also rolling with resistance.

137
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:17,510
So if people are resistant, you sort of go along with it instead of confronting or opposing it.

138
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:28,610
You also develop discrepancy between client goals and their current behavior using reflective listening and objective feedback,

139
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:35,959
and you avoid arguing with them. You need to assume that the client is ultimately responsible for their decision to change.

140
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:48,140
It's really up to that. So the goal of the practitioner is to direct the discussion to really focus on ambivalence and its resolution.

141
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:57,049
So the technical elements of motivational interviewing include typically four elements

142
00:18:57,050 --> 00:19:02,690
that you want to elicit as much information as possible by asking open ended questions.

143
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:07,490
So the goal is to keep clients talking. What avoiding scenarios?

144
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:15,140
You want to encourage reflective listening statements and new strategies for eliciting internal motivation from the client.

145
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:23,210
You want to encourage the client to explore ambivalence about change and make their own decisions about why and how to proceed.

146
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:36,690
So I'm glad Dominique is going to have to change strategies to evoke change.

147
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:46,399
And these are all those sort of tools that folks use in a motivational interviewing conversation to explore.

148
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:52,460
And so you might pull a lot of these different tools out as you're having a conversation with them.

149
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:10,700
So we're going to do a little simulation where I'm going to be the ambivalent one that needs to change something and would love someone to come down.

150
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:17,269
Maybe give me some folks who have some experience with motivational interviewing and

151
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:25,680
could model some of the strategies in front of you and try to get me to work through my.

152
00:20:25,790 --> 00:21:16,130
But if you want to volunteer for this guy, we're going to do that now so you can demonstrate that you are just talking about your score for you.

153
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:25,950
So I love food and you know, when it's my favorite food, I want to eat a lot of it.

154
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:37,069
Why is that not good? And I'm really trying to get into portion control, especially with everything I eat, even if it's healthy.

155
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:43,870
I don't think that people acknowledge because some people say, oh, you can just eat all the vegetables and fruits.

156
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:48,300
Everything needs to be portion control. So I really struggle with that.

157
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:49,670
I really love these.

158
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:59,329
So you really enjoy food and you're learning about portion control a little bit, but it's still hard to do because you love these foods,

159
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:04,070
especially the ones that are your favorite foods, and you're thinking about reasons that you might want to change.

160
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:08,750
Yeah. And I bought those, like, little containers with the colors on them.

161
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:15,260
Like, protein is like this, literally this bag and then, you know, your veggie, things like that.

162
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:23,300
And you know, I tried to use those, but I just I don't get it.

163
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:26,750
It's like, how can they eat so little? It's like, get through my day.

164
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:33,970
I think that would just have been just I don't know what to expect or how I might go on.

165
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:39,650
So you've already taken some steps to move towards making this change and you've encountered some issues with that,

166
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:44,600
like not knowing how much food you're going to get or feeling like it's not enough and that's on your back.

167
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:50,140
Yeah, they've been sitting in my cupboard for a few years,

168
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:55,129
so this is something I've been thinking about for a long time, actually, and that you'd like to make a change.

169
00:22:55,130 --> 00:23:00,230
What kind of steps do you think you might be able to take them in your future, maybe the next week or so to move towards using those?

170
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:11,100
You know, I have those, like, Patrick's balls. You know, I pack my own lunch every day, and those are measures.

171
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:14,860
So there's, like, the one cup for the half cup and the one club.

172
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:21,170
Maybe I could. There's your food up there.

173
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:32,270
But I don't know. I'm not sure it's solving the issue because what a piece of pizza or a whole piece I want to eat, like half of it.

174
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,050
Okay. So you have some ideas of what you might do,

175
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:41,360
and it's feeling like it's still probably not that I've given you that you're trying to management because you can.

176
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:45,170
Yeah. Because you can't fit the pizza in that little time school.

177
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:50,360
You're hurting that little portion control box that's like this big.

178
00:23:52,010 --> 00:24:01,639
So pizza or other foods aren't really interested in our part of what's been keeping you from making this change.

179
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:09,290
So you might make the change. And there are some factors or specific things that you feel like are not in there.

180
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:13,520
And that's, you know,

181
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:22,120
is that something that you feel like you try to continue working on or maybe is just something that's not all that important for you to do, right?

182
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:26,750
I mean, my doctor says I'm fine by me.

183
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:33,890
You know, I have energy through the day, so I don't see why there's no signs that I need to portion control.

184
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:46,430
So it's not something that was done right. That's what I would do is not what I can do.

185
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:53,310
But it's for o'clock. Yeah.

186
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:59,100
I mean, I hear what you're saying. Like, this is something I want to.

187
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:08,820
You mentioned some reasons why they're not a good thing or reason I don't want to change.

188
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:22,270
Or you say something is why you do that. You know, I just don't want to keep I don't want to have to.

189
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:27,909
There's a possibility that my clothes will fit me and my 2 to 3 years.

190
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:35,350
And I don't want to buy a whole new wardrobe. I think I should portion control because it will help me stay where I am.

191
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:43,620
So right now you're feeling okay and you're thinking ahead to something you don't like?

192
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:48,580
Yeah. When you get older, like, I mean, it could hit me all of a sudden.

193
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:54,880
Even though the doctors do look fine right now. So right now you're feeling okay?

194
00:25:55,030 --> 00:26:01,270
Right. Thinking about that? Think about as you're getting older, planning ahead for change you might want to make.

195
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:09,530
Yeah, I mean, I. I'm a chronic disease researcher, and I study how expensive it is for people to manage chronic diseases.

196
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:13,770
So I don't want to I don't want to be in that situation.

197
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:20,260
I think this is a this is an area where I can practice some prevention for myself and.

198
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:28,360
An example. So you've mentioned a couple of different reasons why you might want to change.

199
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:35,130
I think you had a few years and this is something you research and you know about the finances as well.

200
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,229
And it sounds like just the change.

201
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,850
You want to make you feel healthier.

202
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:55,000
You guys will probably actually meet with entrepreneurs who've tried those containers and keep chatting about different products for years and.

203
00:26:55,870 --> 00:27:00,029
But something's just stopping you from. Yeah.

204
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:07,730
I mean, I don't know if it's just this like like our life revolves around eating good food.

205
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:15,180
Like, even my mom called me this morning and was like, I'm planning my grandmother's 90th birthday party.

206
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:19,950
She's like, I need you to help me pick out a restaurant with good food.

207
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:25,860
Like, we have to have good food that came up like five times in the conversation because the rent is all around

208
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:32,610
great food and we plan all our vacations around ensuring that we're eating good food on our vacations.

209
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:37,320
So. Life revolves around eating.

210
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:42,840
So this something, right? Foods that are important for your life, your family life, your kitchen,

211
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:46,559
and things that you do for enjoyment and you're trying to figure out how you fit

212
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:54,540
these two things together is important through having parents heard how you are.

213
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,240
It sounds like you've tried everything and nothing has really stuck, so.

214
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:05,940
Sure. Yeah, yeah.

215
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:12,510
So for some people, making that big change, the right way down to those little auctions is really tough.

216
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:19,469
So thinking about it's like a pizza, for example, removing a slice can be a serving.

217
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:24,210
And so I'm trying to think about fitting it into a bowl, just thinking about what a different serving could be.

218
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:30,350
And then being flexible with my friends, family, you know,

219
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,479
thinking about portion control most of the time and that knowing that there are

220
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:39,000
certain occasions or events where that's not going to stick with the same thing.

221
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,330
And occasionally when you do either of those.

222
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:49,969
So I'm not going to. I can just eat the pizza.

223
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:58,040
I don't need to put it into the container. You can choose any portion of the pizza that you were going to eat in a specific half.

224
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:03,890
The pizza you would think ahead of time where you would want that to look like but don't necessarily need two locations.

225
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:11,320
Okay. So first inside, this could be flexible aside from the container.

226
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:16,040
That's what you would. Thinking about your own patients?

227
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:20,940
Well, you know, I really think I should start with people.

228
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:24,980
That's just like that's my weak point.

229
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:30,420
Do you feel like that's something you can start this? So pizza yesterday.

230
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:36,650
Is it too late to reflect on your pizza experience when.

231
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:45,310
Yeah, I. I think I could have eaten half as much.

232
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:57,680
Do you feel like that's something you do the next time you come? I think if I don't put a lot of the toppings I like on it.

233
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:04,370
So it's not my favorite pizza, but it's like I was sick of eating it.

234
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:05,360
I think that might help.

235
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:16,220
Yeah, that sounds like a reasonable change you can make to make it so good, but a little bit less so if you're able to keep with that portion control.

236
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:21,830
That's how you feel about that. You feel good about that?

237
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:35,840
Yeah. Thank you. So what did you think in the middle of the class?

238
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:43,910
We'll start with you, the counselor. I've been about that for a minute.

239
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:51,010
Okay. I'll go to the closet. Did you see some of those change strategies?

240
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:55,600
She was. What was she is? Yeah. So she did a really good job.

241
00:30:56,470 --> 00:31:01,720
A lot of open ended questions and patience and then the discrepancy.

242
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:18,709
You see some of that come to light. But yeah, I was also really great at summarizing what you said and then allowing you to kind of are like that,

243
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:21,890
giving you space to elaborate on it if you want it to.

244
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:28,340
Or it might be like you go to the new type of question that you didn't elaborate, which I thought was really well guided.

245
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:39,570
What else did we observe? So she did a great job of looking back and looking forward as well.

246
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:50,010
Yeah, that's always a tough one. But did you get a chance to reflect on?

247
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:56,500
It wasn't divided with Hong Kong, but that's right.

248
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:05,639
It's always interesting sort of thinking through people's like the first motivation that they'll bring up.

249
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:11,370
The first point or what seems important to them often by the end of the discussion is something totally different.

250
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:13,229
What have you try to do? Those summaries,

251
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:19,530
bringing together all of the different things that you've brought in at different times because you did mention a lot of different motivations,

252
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:25,230
and I think it's important to keep going back to those because they start to add up.

253
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:31,770
You did have motivations and this some people don't when they come to change.

254
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:38,270
Kind of depends on the situation. How I would handle that or.

255
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:54,260
So it was my motivation. No, you're not getting into the financial aspects.

256
00:32:58,030 --> 00:33:01,030
No. So close.

257
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:06,280
Not fitting future product chronic. I have a question.

258
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:11,800
So it's motivational interviewing. Oh, it is.

259
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:18,340
Is it great solely for public health? Because to me it seems like it'd be good to use in social work and therapy.

260
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:27,030
Because like the reasoning behind it, like if your reasoning is because you are closed off that and your future health,

261
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:34,710
like both of those things are very valid. But like what other things are going on that makes you think your clothes have to fit you?

262
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:40,820
Like you have to fit the clothes that you already have and like it's not okay for you to change sizes.

263
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:45,540
Like, I guess like that is like be is motivational interviewing strictly in public?

264
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:49,649
I'll like do like as far as applications someone gets in.

265
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:58,770
So I just wanna spend more money and those are my reasons that I do all social workers.

266
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:04,260
So I sort of draw both of you.

267
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:11,610
I, I've had students in this class do all social workers for many years and they always I think it's taught a little differently,

268
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:16,049
sort of the public health use of it and then social work use of it.

269
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:26,520
Do you both want to comment on her question and how serious question and how social work might approach motivational interviewing?

270
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:41,100
You to start? Yeah, I think it's almost a little easier when you're in like a therapeutic sense of intervention or something less clinical,

271
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:48,930
because in this example you were kind of toeing the line of what's here was getting out potentially some like disorder,

272
00:34:48,930 --> 00:34:51,510
cognitions and things that need to be restructured.

273
00:34:52,470 --> 00:35:00,450
So what could have been done is taking a step back and acknowledging like, what are your values and where are these cognitions coming from?

274
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:04,620
And is this actually something that you value and you want to change,

275
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:09,540
or is that something that society is making you feel like you need to change or past?

276
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:13,860
You know, mental technicians are making you want to change.

277
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:22,740
Whereas if you're like an intervention, then strictly assessing, you know, their willingness to change your questions.

278
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:32,690
Short answer to your question is it's absolutely used in other settings.

279
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:39,719
It's used and mostly like it can be used as a brief intervention in social work psychology

280
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:44,700
or any kind of counseling or just elements of it brought into other kinds of jobs.

281
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:52,399
Um, yeah, it is a little bit different in public health as we're addressing mostly behavioral rather than usually in like counseling.

282
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,799
You would address, you know, values and things like that.

283
00:35:54,800 --> 00:36:05,140
But it's definitely used in a lot of different settings and you can use it in conversation with friends and family to thank you.

284
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:11,480
It just seems like it does seem like behavior might be it might have a lot of input from like values.

285
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:19,189
Yeah. So definitely we are using it in other settings, but I could have done it here, but I would take a little bit longer to address values.

286
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:23,620
That's one of the core ways that you look at motivation. Thank you.

287
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:38,820
So when I go through some fake news about motivational interviewing, things that often come up.

288
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:48,720
So what should I do? Have a patient. Our client is not at all interested in changing the behavior and has multiple excuses for resisting change.

289
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:53,790
That's a reality. What do you do? I'm in this situation.

290
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:58,469
The goal be kind of the goal is really to raise awareness around the target

291
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:04,140
behavior and give people the opportunity to explore their resistance to change.

292
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,819
And it's helpful to indicate that you're not there to force change.

293
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:12,830
But you would like to hear more about the behavior and see what the thoughts are about.

294
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:25,290
You're really exploring the behavior and raising ambivalence and exploring sort of their reasoning around their resistance to change.

295
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:35,520
So how does motivational interviewing work when a patient or client is in denial about a problem that you identify as their counselor?

296
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:44,430
Um, so the answer to that is when people are contemplating regarding some sort of target behavior,

297
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:49,470
the goal is for the person to begin thinking about changing the target behavior.

298
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:55,260
And this can be done using light, thought provoking, open ended questions as you saw this guy do.

299
00:37:55,620 --> 00:38:00,900
I'm not providing advice or trying to convince the patient against engaging in the behavior.

300
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:07,500
So you want to use empathy and affirming the patient's strengths and efforts and really trying to develop,

301
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:13,590
maintain a positive relationship that will help engage the person and lay the ground for further treatment.

302
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:19,300
Is it okay to give real life examples to clients?

303
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:34,300
So if self-disclosure is over use it does not necessarily result in the intended effect and takes the focus of the client and onto the practitioner.

304
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:41,860
So I am I doesn't necessarily say don't use it, just sort of supports don't overuse it.

305
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:53,500
Otherwise it's really not a. Is it common for patients and clients to persuade back and forth towards change in a single session?

306
00:38:54,760 --> 00:39:00,100
That is actually very common in the goal of motivational interviewing in this instance is to really

307
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:08,260
move and respond with a client as they fluctuate with changing their targeted behavior in the session.

308
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:19,720
So you're moving right along. So which health conditions is motivational interviewing effective and of listening change?

309
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:27,160
So things like treatment, adherence, lifestyle changes such as physical activity and dietary changes,

310
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:32,110
self-monitoring such as monitoring your blood glucose,

311
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:41,680
your blood pressure, medication, adherence, self-management, supporting conditions and substance use such as alcohol or tobacco.

312
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:46,280
And the best evidence has been shown in reducing drug and alcohol use.

313
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:52,070
That's where motivational interviewing has shown the most application.

314
00:39:54,340 --> 00:40:01,860
Then what if there's just not enough time to implement motivational interviewing and to make your your current practice?

315
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:15,230
Say, you're a clinician and you have 10 minutes with your clients, or you're trying to use this with perhaps a friend or family member,

316
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:22,340
and you just don't have a lot of time to actually implement it with them for a variety of reasons.

317
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:29,959
So motivational interviewing is not something that can really be fully implemented at every visit with someone.

318
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:33,710
If you're doing these sort of one on one counseling,

319
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:40,370
you want to maximize time by focusing on the patient and really connecting with empathy to build trust.

320
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:46,400
And this sort of paves the way in future sort of discussions regarding the target behavior change.

321
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:53,330
And people generally say that any amount of time dedicated to motivational interviewing is beneficial.

322
00:40:53,690 --> 00:41:05,930
So if you're working with folks in a very time, limited capacities, this is often sort of manifest in incremental ways in terms of using motivational.

323
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:18,330
So some limitations to think about. You know, everything has some limitations.

324
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:22,410
So you want to think about the strengths and the impacts as well.

325
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:29,610
Um, change is not always be the long term, especially in situations where there's really low readiness to change.

326
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:41,830
Um, motivational interviewing is, um, it relies on talking, so it may not work that well with low verbal clients.

327
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:47,790
Like, if there isn't a lot of talking that makes this method, which is a communication technique,

328
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:59,669
are very challenging and it may not work with certain conditions like anorexia or depression, which and then when I say depression,

329
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:10,049
I mean more severe forms of depression where the the factors that play into some of these conditions and then treatments

330
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:18,180
that are needed are just far more complex than what our body has to offer in terms of the sort of strategies you use.

331
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:24,660
So in these sorts of situations, it may not be appropriate or not as effective.

332
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:32,430
There are many other sorts of therapeutic techniques in these for these situations.

333
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:37,850
Here are your questions about motivational interviewing.

334
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:48,290
There are lots of workshops and more in-depth sort of venues to explore motivational interviewing and get trained on.

335
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:56,269
This said, if you're interested that we have a class in our department offered in the winter term to encourage you to take this interest,

336
00:42:56,270 --> 00:43:00,200
you might go here today just to give you like this is what it is,

337
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:09,770
so this is what it is that this might be one method that you might think about in terms of the interventions for your actions.

338
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:15,290
Yeah. Plus motivational interviewing.

339
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:24,140
Very easy. And I believe we're offering it in the wintertime, if you're interested.

340
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:35,510
And then there are many workshops across the university that you can take for you have their day to really learn how to counsel in this way.

341
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:41,890
So I want to give you an opportunity to at least like if you haven't done this before,

342
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:47,150
you if you're lucky enough to get paired with Skye or any of our other colleagues,

343
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:59,720
in your experience with motivational interviewing, just give you an opportunity to try out those change strategies in real time in a conversation.

344
00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:07,040
So I want you to pair up and do a brief negotiation interview targeting the behavior of interest,

345
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:12,880
maybe something you're working on, or you could just make it up and take turns and switch.

346
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:21,320
Being a practitioner in compliance and also in your interaction, reflect on the other person's use of the change strategies,

347
00:44:21,830 --> 00:44:36,590
such as inserting themselves too much, asking too many, motivating questions like I'm giving you a ton of feedback from one of them in character.

348
00:44:36,770 --> 00:44:48,740
Someone you giving advice for me today?

349
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:58,760
All right. So that's regarding.

350
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:05,240
Thinking about it all the time.

351
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:34,030
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, this is like is actually I want to do this joint because I don't have time to play right now.

352
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:40,640
By the way, what you do with your life is actually.

353
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:51,680
So I was like, Let's to curves.

354
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:56,390
I was like, We want you to be whatever you want.

355
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:04,760
I'm like, Oh, great.

356
00:46:04,870 --> 00:46:11,050
I was like, I am.

357
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:25,010
What's your name? Like, how do I like right now?

358
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:37,180
That's my big brother.

359
00:46:46,190 --> 00:46:53,540
I'm sorry about last night.

360
00:46:53,630 --> 00:47:14,000
I just felt like I was 25 years old.

361
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:38,940
I think there are a lot of things that I can start off with.

362
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:54,830
My own thing. It's hard to break it up.

363
00:47:54,950 --> 00:48:11,040
Up what you're thinking.

364
00:48:11,570 --> 00:48:36,570
Let me tell you something that I like and happy.

365
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:51,180
I thought about it. It seems to me like.

366
00:48:51,190 --> 00:49:02,970
Is there something to it now? Yeah.

367
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:08,680
You know, I think that there's a possibility. I already knew that.

368
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:23,290
I I'm really trying to see, but nothing like it or anything like that.

369
00:49:24,470 --> 00:49:25,740
All right.

370
00:49:26,030 --> 00:50:27,120
When you find yourself with these ideas, you know, because you're finding myself, I think in some ways I think it's time to time is a lot of time.

371
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:59,890
I think there are times when it's like I was like, you know, this is what I like.

372
00:51:04,830 --> 00:51:13,720
It's not like I'm actually out there.

373
00:51:14,350 --> 00:51:41,920
Like, I don't want your kids to find out right now because like I said, I don't like to be that way.

374
00:51:42,330 --> 00:52:17,650
Just like, yeah, I mean, it's not like so I mean, actually, I just.

375
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:41,770
I just feel like I just never tell, like, you know, I don't want to when I feel like I have to work that way to get it.

376
00:52:41,970 --> 00:52:53,799
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, so I wonder how I feel.

377
00:52:53,800 --> 00:53:30,390
Like that's kinda hard not to say that it's a lot easier for me to talk to someone else.

378
00:53:30,990 --> 00:53:39,490
Like you start getting in there like, really?

379
00:53:40,700 --> 00:54:53,430
When I was in high school, I was kind of like I said, call your name on it, you know, like I like she was like that.

380
00:54:59,270 --> 00:55:21,679
So then I lost my son, but I didn't have to.

381
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:31,760
It's like I just simply by your eyes.

382
00:55:32,650 --> 00:55:54,920
I was like, I don't know if.

383
00:56:00,830 --> 00:56:05,150
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

384
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:11,780
It's very subtle.

385
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:23,840
And you're like, Oh, my God.

386
00:56:24,230 --> 00:56:36,560
Nice try.

387
00:56:48,140 --> 00:57:12,090
I something about it because it's so hard right now.

388
00:57:14,450 --> 00:57:23,540
Yeah. They're trying to pull it down on the side and stuff like that.

389
00:57:24,690 --> 00:57:58,390
You know, I think it's just like your body's telling you that it's great.

390
00:57:59,870 --> 00:58:09,840
It's like, I'm going to let you go.

391
00:58:13,850 --> 00:58:37,710
I think it's very easy when you talk about it is like.

392
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:57,500
We still have sort of some very nervous things that we think we're together.

393
00:58:57,530 --> 00:59:05,929
You got another? I don't think like two more minutes.

394
00:59:05,930 --> 00:59:42,070
And the first time I saw you guys, especially if.

395
00:59:57,890 --> 01:00:43,150
Even if you don't like it, I know you're going to be nice to me as he was coming.

396
01:00:51,010 --> 01:00:59,380
Whether you like it or not, we're going to put you in the Oval Office like nobody's going back.

397
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:04,119
Like they were like, whoa, you guys are high risk.

398
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:08,860
Let's put you in a small room together. It's like some countries.

399
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:18,970
It's fine. Yeah, I understand that we weren't really prepared for this, but at least we know how, like, viruses can sometimes be small.

400
01:01:19,030 --> 01:01:22,450
Really? I don't know.

401
01:01:23,340 --> 01:01:28,390
You said you didn't hear how it was.

402
01:01:28,540 --> 01:01:32,560
All right, well, the rules are good.

403
01:01:33,050 --> 01:01:38,740
Like we were talking about it, it's, like, almost really interesting.

404
01:01:38,740 --> 01:01:45,790
Like, kind of once you get in that flow, it kind of becomes a little bit easier to just kind of build on top of what you've done.

405
01:01:45,790 --> 01:01:54,940
I liken it to if anybody's ever seen whose line is it anyway, when they play the game questions and you're only allowed to talk in questions.

406
01:01:57,260 --> 01:02:01,540
So as the practice or that as the clinician, that's how you felt.

407
01:02:01,540 --> 01:02:09,050
Yeah. What do you like about this?

408
01:02:10,950 --> 01:02:20,969
I like how it's more so focused on the patient and like asking questions whether like trying to judge them in a way not put our perspective in it,

409
01:02:20,970 --> 01:02:24,810
but kind of gain their perspective and their specific needs.

410
01:02:28,660 --> 01:02:30,819
Yeah, I think too.

411
01:02:30,820 --> 01:02:37,570
It's like if you're actively trying to pursue like motivational interviewing, you're obviously trying to change your health behavior.

412
01:02:38,170 --> 01:02:44,860
So like when you actually take the initiative and you start having that conversation, it forces you to reflect on like what you're doing that's wrong,

413
01:02:44,860 --> 01:02:51,790
that you want to change and how and then having that support system there to kind of go junior thinking a little bit was kind of useful.

414
01:02:52,270 --> 01:02:59,950
So you felt supported in the conversation, supportive also like it kind of helps you like guide your thinking a little bit to like how,

415
01:02:59,950 --> 01:03:03,250
like what actions can you take to change your behavior realistically?

416
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:09,250
Yeah, I think it two things.

417
01:03:09,850 --> 01:03:15,730
I thought it was really interesting and fun to converse with somebody this way.

418
01:03:16,060 --> 01:03:20,580
I think having like a general curiosity about people helps like, you know,

419
01:03:20,590 --> 01:03:26,920
to be a good active listener and actually be more natural, I think, in this type of interviewing.

420
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:39,910
Um, and then the second thing that was really interesting though, I think becomes do you just throw your hands up?

421
01:03:46,490 --> 01:04:03,050
Any epiphanies that anyone has being interviewed. What was uncomfortable about it, if anything.

422
01:04:06,020 --> 01:04:13,420
Rosen said. I actually felt like it was more comfortable, a more comfortable way of having that conversation with someone,

423
01:04:14,830 --> 01:04:18,350
because the stakes just feel a little bit less lowered for the listener.

424
01:04:18,370 --> 01:04:21,970
You don't have to, like, talk someone into a behavior change in one conversation.

425
01:04:22,390 --> 01:04:29,860
Like, it's just a little bit more about listening and, you know, using the structure of this type of interviewing to guide you.

426
01:04:30,490 --> 01:04:34,180
And it just felt supportive and also like, natural.

427
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:37,870
So, yeah, it's not as high pressure.

428
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:50,090
Any discomfort or any of the like the change strategies that were maybe a little difficult to use.

429
01:04:51,010 --> 01:04:55,730
So I have a job using motivational interviewing, so like actually using it in a research setting.

430
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:02,000
It kind of feels awkward sometimes when people say things that you don't expect and not having a reaction to it because like,

431
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:06,170
I'm not trying to make you think I think differently because of it.

432
01:05:06,590 --> 01:05:13,220
So I think it's just kind of hard to navigate sometimes. I disagree with what you're saying, but I'm not going to show it on my face.

433
01:05:14,590 --> 01:05:20,630
Yeah, because I work with like talking about COVID 19 vaccine, so I hear a lot of interesting things.

434
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:31,310
Yeah. So you have to kind of shut off your opinion in a lot of different ways, including your facial expressions and really monitoring that.

435
01:05:38,590 --> 01:05:42,940
Sometimes to a milestone like John becomes a very rare scenario.

436
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:45,640
But sometimes I don't even know what to ask anymore.

437
01:05:45,830 --> 01:05:54,879
If every time I would have knew another thing, another thing, another thing, just knowing how to navigate the competition so it does flow naturally.

438
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:58,770
We are still trying direct in terms of thinking. Yeah.

439
01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:07,240
So there could be sort of just a lot there and like how do you pull out the different change strategies of a good time?

440
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:16,340
Which one makes sense here? Anyone.

441
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:20,810
Not like motivational interviewing. Like, it just isn't for me.

442
01:06:26,570 --> 01:06:34,730
I would say I'm one of these people, so I like to be told what to do and I'm not a big talker.

443
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:39,850
I somehow have married to someone who is, but I have not.

444
01:06:40,540 --> 01:06:44,840
And so I. I struggle with motivational interviewing.

445
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:55,220
So our faculty member who teaches motivational interviewing, Ken Resnick, anytime I talk to him about advice,

446
01:06:55,430 --> 01:07:02,930
I have to preface with the need to shut off fear of my right, use it on me and tell me what to do.

447
01:07:06,650 --> 01:07:09,830
So I mean it again, it's it's person specific.

448
01:07:09,830 --> 01:07:16,190
And we talked about some of the limitations of what works really well with friends or folks who want to explore

449
01:07:16,190 --> 01:07:23,690
their ambivalence or who really want to work through perhaps a behavior change in a very autonomous way.

450
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:32,630
So those are things to think about, the conditions under which this method can be really optimal.

451
01:07:37,390 --> 01:07:42,910
Any other comments or reflections on nearby in general?

452
01:07:43,190 --> 01:07:49,820
I say that once you kind of know the structure of motivational interviewing, it's really hard to not notice it when people are using it.

453
01:07:50,020 --> 01:07:55,629
Yeah, and it's very frustrating. And then you're like, you become very annoyed by your motivational interviewing.

454
01:07:55,630 --> 01:08:00,600
So that's like the thing I don't like about it. No, no, no, I.

455
01:08:00,670 --> 01:08:04,040
I know exactly what you mean. This is what I tell people to turn it off.

456
01:08:04,100 --> 01:08:12,250
Yeah. No, no. Am I on me? I'm just telling me what to do, and I'll be there.

457
01:08:13,190 --> 01:08:17,480
Good. So you have one tool under your belt in terms of an intervention strategy.

458
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:22,840
We're going to explore more. So on Wednesday, we're going to talk about social cognitive theory.

459
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:27,580
And social cognitive theory is very big. There are like a million constructs.

460
01:08:28,090 --> 01:08:39,989
My goal is to organize it for you in a way that hopefully make sense for the policies that have occurred for the day.

461
01:08:39,990 --> 01:08:47,380
I can figure it out.

462
01:08:50,140 --> 01:08:55,800
Oh, no. I was like, Oh, what?

463
01:08:56,630 --> 01:09:14,130
I like that. Yeah.

464
01:09:21,770 --> 01:09:25,940
I was just trying.

465
01:09:37,950 --> 01:09:48,350
I was like, Oh, my God.

466
01:09:51,490 --> 01:10:02,620
I was like, I haven't I have no idea.

467
01:10:07,350 --> 01:10:28,530
And then I was just like, you know, downtown right now.

468
01:10:28,690 --> 01:10:33,450
You got it right now. Like magic over there.

469
01:10:33,540 --> 01:10:45,599
Same thing that I think when I heard something I like, but I like cheesy little things.

470
01:10:45,600 --> 01:11:02,570
Like, that's, like, right down to the recycling. Yeah, once I got the whole house, so then I was like, Oh, my goodness.

471
01:11:02,850 --> 01:11:07,560
I want to hear your homework. And like.

472
01:11:12,460 --> 01:11:20,650
And apparently my need is not like I was curious.

473
01:11:24,150 --> 01:11:37,570
Like, I think I hope that we get like, oh, okay, let me make that part of it.

474
01:11:37,650 --> 01:11:40,830
Don't steal your precious.

475
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:53,460
Be happy. I think, you know, I want to hear how many more years, you know, I don't know that.

476
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:59,190
Ever get asked? Do you know who scored? Scored.

477
01:12:01,210 --> 01:12:05,080
I was just collecting photography, headshots and most of the images,

478
01:12:05,860 --> 01:12:09,550
all they kept saying was, you know, I might have a year and a half or I might have three.

479
01:12:09,980 --> 01:12:13,209
Yeah, it was like, Yeah, that's how it works.

480
01:12:13,210 --> 01:12:23,620
Thank you. I mean, it's like it's based on your productivity and just that.

481
01:12:23,620 --> 01:12:26,650
But there's some things it's hard to explain.

482
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:35,330
I'm kind of like, you know, kind of busy.

483
01:12:35,410 --> 01:12:51,100
Have you their research on, like, structural racism and aging, like how educational inequalities influence, like aging outcomes later in life?

484
01:12:53,350 --> 01:13:03,260
What do you think about studies? Well, I guess I'm going to think about the mental health and the mental health and substance abuse.

485
01:13:03,700 --> 01:13:14,740
I have taken off the charts or even I used to work as basically a place and not part of the house.

486
01:13:15,100 --> 01:13:32,200
There's just no homeless person. Psychiatrist And I suppose Charlie said a room this morning, harm reduction in a way couldn't hurt me at all.

487
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:40,710
Do you do you know, story, lab kick? I'm going to study like now.

488
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:48,520
Yeah, I definitely I want to do that. Okay. So, yeah, it was really how long is it going to be there?

489
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:52,220
I decided, like, I really, really like it now.

490
01:13:53,020 --> 01:13:59,409
Yeah. He's like it was like between 12 and I think it's an hour and a half to do a thing.

491
01:13:59,410 --> 01:14:08,410
And then I was just like, Yeah, but I'd rather go like mentor and just be happy.

492
01:14:08,450 --> 01:14:13,240
Yeah, yeah. Let me correct.

493
01:14:13,250 --> 01:14:17,080
I'm like, I'm good. I didn't do it either. So yeah, yeah.

494
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:21,570
I had him last semester like, like you're saying, let's see.

495
01:14:22,690 --> 01:14:29,679
We're not going to talk about I went but I question that questionable again I

496
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:35,500
don't know if you if you find out you know it was basically like what it was his

497
01:14:35,860 --> 01:14:39,790
were basically to act like he was a student we'll put it we're going to going

498
01:14:39,790 --> 01:14:44,050
to be like so the interventions going because we had to create intervention.

499
01:14:46,530 --> 01:14:50,220
By Paul Fleming. I'm pretty sure we're talking about the same person.

500
01:14:50,550 --> 01:14:58,320
Dr. Collins looks like he's probably in his forties.

501
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:02,990
Probably. Maybe a bit too much.

502
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:16,370
It was a. We could be talking about the records in a 50 year old country, as you say, older or younger, I say, you know.

503
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:24,750
You know we have. What kind of something? Can you show me a picture? He came in late.

504
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:43,140
What? I mean, listen, I forget the name, you know, because it was so funny because he would click off the Zune,

505
01:15:43,140 --> 01:15:47,370
they would come back and go like, Hey, was it Jonathan or something?

506
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:51,510
What? Ask anybody. I am going to do.

507
01:15:52,140 --> 01:15:56,190
I can't remember his name. Thank you. These are really cool.

508
01:15:57,990 --> 01:16:02,130
Are there a lot of you know, like some of them. Some people are like.

509
01:16:03,830 --> 01:16:07,790
Like Janay said, she was working for the first time.

510
01:16:07,790 --> 01:16:16,270
So I was like speaking in my head. I'm like, Are you trying to make she are there any other sec?

511
01:16:16,310 --> 01:16:21,730
You know that I know. Oh, yeah. You guys have been virtual, so you probably didn't even.

512
01:16:23,510 --> 01:16:28,220
I don't think so. I think it might just be me. Okay. Unfortunately, fortunately, I'm fortunate.

513
01:16:28,550 --> 01:16:33,770
Are you dual or not? Oh, I'm just actually achieved with two different certificates.

514
01:16:34,010 --> 01:16:38,600
Oh, of injury science. And three of them are.

515
01:16:40,740 --> 01:16:46,470
Oh, look, I know I've got to get to work, okay?

516
01:16:46,680 --> 01:17:20,710
You have a wonderful. You two taking it. So.

517
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:27,330
Yeah, yeah. I.

518
01:19:05,060 --> 01:24:58,410
She? It looks to me.
