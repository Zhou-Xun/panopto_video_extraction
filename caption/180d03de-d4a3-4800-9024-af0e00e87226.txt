1
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:29,350
Okay. So let's first refresh what we had last time.

2
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:47,410
So last time we basically formulated a collection of assets that would be most useful when describing continuous variables.

3
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:56,800
And this was the where I l um, collection Burrell's Sigma algebra.

4
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:07,170
Yeah. The definitions that we addressed, including all the sets that can be composed out of open intervals,

5
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:15,520
all of them on the real line by countable operations of unions and the sections that complements them.

6
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,460
So as an example,

7
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:30,970
and also we are trying to give you some intuition on the non-trivial stuff around collections in general and Sigma Algebras in particular.

8
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:40,990
So we looked at what would happen if we try to generate sigma algebra from sets of all possible singletons on the real line.

9
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:49,479
And we spent quite some time on it and we found that the collection consists either

10
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:54,730
of countable sets or of sets with countable complements that we call co countable.

11
00:01:55,810 --> 00:02:08,680
And we immediately said as a corollary that, well, we're l has something else, and it's actually a lot of sets that do not belong to this rule.

12
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,980
And starting from the open interval that Burrell is based on.

13
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:22,690
Right. So it's not accountable set. And the complement of that open interval is two pieces of real lines.

14
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:33,010
Neither of them is countable either. And that way we know that the well, there are a lot of sets in Braille that are not generated from singletons.

15
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:41,410
Right. At the same time, it does contain the sigma algebra generated by singletons, but has a lot more to it.

16
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:52,840
Um, so despite the impression that taking all singletons is actually a very rich collection, it's, it's not.

17
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:56,920
It stops short of being as rich as betrayal.

18
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:03,010
That was the main purpose of the exercise to make note of it.

19
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:12,430
Then towards the end of the lecture, uh, we, uh, looked at,

20
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:21,460
we just gave a definition for limits of sets and we said that it would be enough for the purposes of

21
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:29,440
the rest of our course to only focus on sequences of sense that are either increasing or decreasing.

22
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:35,980
And for those, for the increasing ones, we defined that as a countable union of the sequence,

23
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:48,220
the limit and for decreasing, since we defined that as a countable intersection of the sequence elements and.

24
00:03:52,280 --> 00:04:05,120
And this is where we stopped basically with with this definition, if it's worth making a picture of increasing or decreasing sense on a Venn diagram.

25
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:16,850
Um, let's say I have increasing. So increasing was defined as each next set is larger than the previous.

26
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:22,380
So has a previous one as a subset. And that means, well, I start with some set.

27
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:30,470
My next one is larger, my sits next to this is even larger and so on.

28
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:39,920
Right? And then eventually I may have a limit and that would be the, the external circle.

29
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:49,909
Right. With all of its contents. We will later on uh, uh, define differences between next set and previous sets,

30
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:56,450
depending on whether it's increasing or decreasing, which one goes first and which one is subtracted.

31
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:03,530
But you can kind of see on the picture that this is kind of a collection of bagels that that.

32
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:08,290
Forbes There are the limits.

33
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:14,710
So we will use this observation later in a more formal way.

34
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,190
And the decreasing ones would be the opposite, right?

35
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:29,659
So we would start with something and then start defining subsets of it.

36
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:33,379
So my next set is smaller than this one.

37
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:37,670
And so right. And then eventually I may have a limit.

38
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:43,120
That's the field. Circle inside, right.

39
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:51,040
So this one is the limits of the increasing sense, and this one is the limit of the decreasing sense.

40
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:09,820
Okay. So actually so having done this definition, I want to leave the sense for just a while.

41
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:19,390
Um, just to give you one more non-trivial fact about the Sigma Algebras.

42
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:34,810
And you can consider it just a note. On how to both.

43
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:54,730
See Algebras. Because I just want to finish the topic because we are unlikely to come back to see my algebras again.

44
00:06:56,020 --> 00:07:04,450
Yeah. And speaking of the non-trivial stuff about them, uh, just to shape your intuition a little bit better.

45
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:10,239
So let's discuss this thing. So for those of you who start doing your homework,

46
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:17,350
you have a pretty good impression that if I start with a finite collection of elements and start building a sigma algebra out of it,

47
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:24,670
I will end up with a collection as a sigma algebra that will actually be an algebra.

48
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:28,270
There's no sigma to it, and it will have a finite number of elements.

49
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:31,120
So that's that's the trivial case, right?

50
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:42,850
Now, of course, we have very complicated sigma algebra as like the bar is where that we can't at all visualize right now in between.

51
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,330
You may have a question. Well, what if I have a countable.

52
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:54,639
Well, some collection of sales such that I use it to generate the sigma algebra and

53
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:59,760
that sigma algebra becomes a countable collections or a sequence of events.

54
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,610
Right. Um, so what is.

55
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:11,110
We try. To build.

56
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:21,990
Yeah. Sigma algebra. From Accountable Collection.

57
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:52,510
So can it also be? But there's no also telling the accountable.

58
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,580
Collection. Uh, let's say.

59
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:06,610
Yeah. Yeah, it's, uh.

60
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:11,650
Well, comfortable collection, by definition, is just the sequence of sets, right?

61
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:19,030
So that I can index them by natural numbers, keys and so on.

62
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:22,900
So, like these some there are infinitely many.

63
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:31,950
Elements in that sequence, but they are indexed by natural numbers.

64
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:40,710
So what does your intuition tell you? So if I start with the countable collections, let's say I start with natural numbers.

65
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:45,960
Right. So these are singletons, and they are integer and non-negative.

66
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:55,360
And I start taking all possible unions, intersections, countable unions, intersections, complements of natural numbers.

67
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,890
They will also be subsets of natural numbers, of course.

68
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:06,360
Right. And I add them to my collection. So as a result, what has your intuition tell you?

69
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:14,040
Will I get a sigma algebra that looks like this where all of those is just subsets of natural numbers?

70
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:26,140
Or would it be something else? Now, now that I am asking this question, you probably have a weird feeling that it may not be the case.

71
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:28,220
Right? So.

72
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:40,660
And, uh, so the guy we're already familiar with come to our actually proved an interesting fact in the little formula that there's a theorem,

73
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:56,670
uh, due to come to our. So all sigma algebras.

74
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:05,930
Are either. Fine lightly.

75
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:17,280
Countable. Or uncountable.

76
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:30,430
So that is the sigma algebra.

77
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:38,860
Like this one does not exist.

78
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:58,250
There simply not a sigma algebra in this world that has these four with infinitely many elements in the collection.

79
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:19,399
And so the so instead of giving the proof in general, it's intuitively clear that if we can prove it for the examples that I started with,

80
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:23,210
namely the sigma algebra generated by natural numbers.

81
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:28,280
So if it turns out that this sigma algebra is uncountable.

82
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:34,690
So it's intuitively clear that this would be a proof of this theorem, right?

83
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,850
Because in the end we just want accountable.

84
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:50,790
And accountable is about whether I can index things or whether I can build the correspondence with natural numbers.

85
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:57,000
And so before we do that, so let's define.

86
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:02,600
Let's give a definition for another useful thing. Have power said?

87
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:13,540
Often they go. With no tension.

88
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:22,329
Uh, beautiful p. Oh, for me.

89
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:30,960
Go. He's.

90
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:41,180
A collection. Of all possible subsets.

91
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:59,450
Of Omega. Now if I do that, would that be a sigma algebra?

92
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:08,450
Cause all I want from sigma algebra is that unions and the sections that are in the same collection.

93
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:14,930
Right. And if I take everything that can be in the army and throw it together.

94
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,950
Now, of course, every man imaginable.

95
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:23,350
The countable union and the section accomplishment will be in there.

96
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,770
Right. Because I just took the nuclear option. I just threw everything into it.

97
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:31,880
So that's just an example of a sigma algebra.

98
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:38,810
Um, and since we are building it based on natural numbers,

99
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:49,070
it's again intuitively clear that so sigma algebra generated by natural numbers would be a powerful set of natural numbers.

100
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:56,090
So we will prove.

101
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:07,470
That's the power of natural numbers.

102
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:19,280
It's just a set of old subsets where elements of natural numbers.

103
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:41,230
Is uncountable. And like I said, the idea's due to counter and it's approached by a contradiction.

104
00:15:50,350 --> 00:16:01,250
Now suppose. There's a set of natural numbers is countable.

105
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:12,280
So first of all, what's inside, right? So examples.

106
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:23,530
Examples of. Sense in this one, right?

107
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:31,850
Well, it's a sample of 1 to 3, for example.

108
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:36,630
Right. Instead of all even numbers.

109
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,319
And so on. Right.

110
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:56,810
So anything that has that is composed of natural numbers is inside that power sense because it includes all possible subsets of them.

111
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:05,710
Right. And by contradiction, if it's countable, then I can basically order them all, index them.

112
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:13,640
And these would be sets, uh, one E to e three and so on.

113
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:19,580
A key. Yeah. And possibly the well, clearly to infinity.

114
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,990
But each of them will be a collection of natural numbers.

115
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:33,440
Right. So I want to visualize them as a matrix, and I will put natural numbers as columns.

116
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:43,520
So this would be, well, dependent on whether you understand that zero belongs to this or doesn't belong to this, it doesn't really matter.

117
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:49,520
So you would say 1 to 3 and so on.

118
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,870
Right. Some number and and so on.

119
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:57,080
Right. So to infinity, this is a set of natural numbers.

120
00:17:57,770 --> 00:17:58,070
Right.

121
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:12,860
And then so since all of my E's are actually subsets of natural numbers, so I could put zero if a natural number is in this subset and one if it is.

122
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:18,410
Right. So for example, my set. One, two, three. Let's say this is e one.

123
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:27,150
So it will have a one, one, one and then all zeros.

124
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:30,960
Right. That's how I would represent it.

125
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:38,190
And my said, let's say if a two is a set of all, even numbers.

126
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:43,470
So even now, which ones? Uh, two, four and so on.

127
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:47,909
Right. So then it could be zero here.

128
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:52,290
One here with zero one. So an alternating thing like this.

129
00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:00,759
Right. And so and so I would do it. I would be able to do it.

130
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:04,600
If I do have a countable collection, I would have a matrix like this.

131
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:21,480
Right. So and now the crux of the argument by countries to take the diagonal out of these matrix and this would be something like this.

132
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:29,880
So first of all, we note that if.

133
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:38,070
This meaning that it's countable is true.

134
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:44,200
Then each said.

135
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:51,750
Uh, is, uh, can be represented.

136
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:13,260
As a sequence. Of zero one numbers with all of them.

137
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:24,950
Forming The Matrix. Okay.

138
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:29,030
Matrix, right. Depending on how I index them.

139
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:36,220
And Matrix like of this.

140
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:42,410
I like this one. Now.

141
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:55,920
And here comes the interesting thing. So can you tell me, uh, so the diagonal of that matrix is also a sequence of zero one numbers, right?

142
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:03,240
So if. If it has all possible subsets of integers.

143
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:10,530
So my collection that is supposedly countable must have this diagonal written out somewhere.

144
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:17,850
Right. If this is true. So since the diagonal.

145
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:33,390
Is this sequence of zero one numbers, and the matrix supposedly has all of them.

146
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:46,950
Uh, it must represent. One of the aides.

147
00:21:53,030 --> 00:22:03,860
That's that's one thing. Right. And yet another argument is, tells me that that cannot be one of the A's.

148
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:08,690
Uh, because what I can do, I can invert.

149
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,510
The numbers in the diagonal.

150
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:33,390
So if I invert them, it's still a sequence of zeros and ones.

151
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:36,930
So it must also be a part of the matrix.

152
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:42,810
Right. On the other hand, the inverted.

153
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:51,850
Diagonal must also be part of the matrix.

154
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,420
And part of the matrix. Me meaning one of the roles.

155
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:19,840
Right. Eventually. On the other hand, the way I built it is that there is always for any ace in that matrix,

156
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:26,740
there's always one element that's different with the inverted diagonal.

157
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:39,690
Right. So if I just inverted the numbers in the diagonal so I invert the first one, then the diagonal can be the first element,

158
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:45,319
the first row, because this element is different in itself with the second one.

159
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:49,820
So it can be the second one. And I do it for all of them, right?

160
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:56,180
When I am inverting the full diagonal, it's certainly infinitely large.

161
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:03,200
Right. So and because I inverted, it can be any of the A's.

162
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:17,060
So on the other hand. The inverted diagonal.

163
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:29,650
Cannot be. Any of the roles.

164
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:38,800
Because there is at least one element.

165
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:57,250
In each row. That's different.

166
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:07,840
From the corresponding one of the diagonal.

167
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:35,060
And this is by construction. So this is a contradiction.

168
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:49,040
And that means that I cannot count them.

169
00:25:54,570 --> 00:26:00,100
And since. The power said of natural numbers.

170
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:12,660
No, because, well, any countable collection is basically indexed by natural numbers.

171
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:18,450
So that at the same time as the proof of of the original theorem.

172
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:30,480
Okay. So this is another non-trivial fact about them.

173
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:35,810
So there's no sigma algebras that look like sequences.

174
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:46,510
So anywhere as you move from finite collections to infinite collections, uh,

175
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:51,680
so sequences are just another part of it that becomes a lot more complicated.

176
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:59,570
Okay. So coming back to, uh, limits of sets.

177
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:11,160
We already defined what they are.

178
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:25,980
So now and interesting, it would be helpful to build some correspondence with calculus because you have a pretty good intuition,

179
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:31,110
uh, having done calculus many, many times already.

180
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:35,820
So in the calculus, let's say I have a sequence.

181
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:47,600
Of numbers that would be X and algo was one to infinity.

182
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:57,680
And those are real numbers, let's say.

183
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:11,240
So it's a real value in sequence. Um, and then so I will call tail or m tail of a sequence.

184
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:19,970
Uh, that's going to be a sequence. It's key.

185
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:24,790
Where key starts from a given aim of girls to feature.

186
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:37,320
I just want a shorthand for it. Okay.

187
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:48,750
So then so depending on the version of how they taught you calculus, um, well they defined limits for the sequences, right?

188
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:58,550
Um, and, uh, and there was much theory around those limits and one of them, uh,

189
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:09,810
was using things that were called, uh, limits superior and, uh, limits inferior.

190
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:36,740
And if they show a sequence, let's say this is going to be a key where and then my sequence is actually numbers like this.

191
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:49,980
And I can define the supremacy of the sequence.

192
00:29:50,730 --> 00:30:01,290
And this would be and I would be taking I would be moving from left to right and I would be taking supreme all of the elements in the left,

193
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:06,330
for example. So that would be, uh, like these.

194
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:12,389
Until I have an element that is larger than this one, then it's going to stay like these.

195
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:17,490
And in my picture, it's probably staying here forever because everything went down.

196
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:24,889
I can only also make it the other way around so I can take Supreme.

197
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:29,430
I'm over the tail of that sequence, so that would be to the right.

198
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:34,830
So the same story would be playing out somewhere from the right to the left.

199
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:39,600
And I can do a similar thing with with the information.

200
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:47,889
Uh huh. So the, uh, the minimum rate of the elements.

201
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:51,420
So that's going to stay here. Um.

202
00:30:53,590 --> 00:31:00,910
Then eventually when I see a low element, it's going to jump down and then again down something like this, right?

203
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:16,160
And then you had a fact that one of them write that for a sequence to have a limit.

204
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:21,740
So the limits appear in the limit. Inferior. Inferior must be equal to each other.

205
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:25,480
Yeah, it's an if and only if statement.

206
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:34,370
Right. Um, and there were other epsilon delta based definitions for limits of sequences and so on.

207
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:47,740
Right. So I just want to bring up memories of calculus at this point so you can refresh your knowledge there and perhaps be open to it.

208
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:58,310
Uh, so, uh, what I'm going to do next is define a similar concept for sense because we need to characterize limits of sense.

209
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:12,080
So I need some structure to that and will define limits in theory and limits superior force for either increasing or decreasing sets in connection.

210
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:20,180
Well, they're defined for a sequence. Right, but, uh, we will have to, we will talk about increasing and decreasing sets,

211
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:24,740
because part of that definition is either increasing sequence or decreasing sequence.

212
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:34,260
Um, uh, this will allow us to characterize these limits and also to, uh.

213
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:46,550
Later on, they will be used, for example, in strong consistency, in uh, uh, convergence of random variables with probability one.

214
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:53,690
So these are all things that will be based on limits and limiting fear of the sense.

215
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:57,399
Right. So we have them for the numbers.

216
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:00,760
So that's the calculus story. We have them for the sets.

217
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:17,870
Uh, now, uh, I introduced earlier and indicate the function and we talked about so omega belonging to a uh, so two interpretations to that thing.

218
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:23,510
So one was, uh, when this is just the statement of, of, uh, that is true.

219
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:30,270
Right. So it's a statement that Omega is part of a, uh, uh, it's, it's just the fact.

220
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:39,170
Right. And in another consideration, we talked about this statement as possibly as one that could possibly be true or false,

221
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:42,440
depending on which Omega you take.

222
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:51,050
And this was linked to the definition of indicate the function that's a01 dependent on whether Omega belongs to A is true or not.

223
00:33:52,130 --> 00:34:02,480
Right. And the link between the, uh, limits superior and limit inferior four sets, uh, to the ones by calculus.

224
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:14,510
So there's actually a 1 to 1 match. So you could say that if you turn the sequence of SATs into, uh, uh, indicator functions.

225
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,330
So that would be sequences of zeros and ones.

226
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:31,579
Then there's correspondence between limits of beer and limits in Syria for zero one sequences from calculus as a sequence of numbers and the SATs,

227
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:40,670
the sequences of SATs that they represent. Right. And it's also a nice way to visualize what happens, because we want to understand them,

228
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:46,130
give intuition for what kind of sample limits superior of a sequence of SATs is.

229
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:59,670
So what are the AMI? Because that belong to it. So we had this is this is just this, uh, to bring up your memories.

230
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:12,290
And there's actually a problem in the homework to build that correspondence.

231
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:22,120
Right. And it's a fairly easy thing to do. Zero.

232
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:38,780
Otherwise. Okay.

233
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:44,810
So now let's, uh, let's have, uh, kind of an arbitrary sequence.

234
00:35:55,170 --> 00:36:02,580
So let a key tick from one to infinity be.

235
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:13,310
Arbitrary. Sequence of sets.

236
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:29,520
Now the the arbitrary here is the meaning that I'm not making them increasing or decreasing or putting any specific restrictions to them.

237
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:41,600
Right. And let's say I form, uh, two kinds of sets out of this sequence, uh, based on the entail of that sequence, right?

238
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:45,720
So that's similar to the way we defined the entail before.

239
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:58,290
And one would be, uh, the union came from and to infinity a key and one would be the intersection.

240
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:04,350
From him to infinity. A key.

241
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:09,120
Right. So these are, uh, operations.

242
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:21,870
On the entail. Of this sequence.

243
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:34,430
Okay. So now tell me.

244
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:37,490
So the sequence B, what kind of sequence is it?

245
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:43,820
So if we are looking at the first line, so I'm building union, right?

246
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:49,730
So if, if I increase the M, right.

247
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:54,820
So I'm getting smaller Seth or a larger Seth if I taking that union.

248
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:09,020
Smaller, right? Because if I increase the and let's say I have the I had the him, that would be a union from ten to infinity.

249
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:19,220
AK Right. So if I then have B 11, then then a ten will not be part of it.

250
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:22,670
Right? It's outside of the union. So I dropped something.

251
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:26,360
So I have a smaller one, so.

252
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:35,330
And that means that each next set, the M will be a subset right of the previous one if this is happening.

253
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:50,770
So this would be decreasing sets. And if I'm taking an intersection.

254
00:38:53,110 --> 00:39:00,010
So what about the intersection? So my next set is smaller or larger than the previous one.

255
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:12,809
Well, you could just invert the previous one, right? But without thinking much.

256
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:20,070
But you can also kind of think a little and build intuition around that.

257
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:26,340
So if I'm taking an additional element to the intersection, that sense becomes smaller, right?

258
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:32,159
And that would be happening if I'm doing it backwards.

259
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:39,960
Right? So. So it's getting smaller backwards.

260
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:49,230
So mean. If I'm characterizing it as m increasing, then I will have increasing sense.

261
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:12,870
And then. So before. So I'd have to go to the previous lecture.

262
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:20,520
Uh, because I don't think I repeated that statement. Um, but when we defined limits of sense.

263
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:28,210
So limits of sense were defined.

264
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:44,530
Is intersectional and from one to infinity for decreasing.

265
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:59,460
Sequence. And Union and from one to infinity for increasing sequence.

266
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:10,050
So I now have one increasing, one decreasing that I built out of an arbitrary sequence.

267
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:14,790
Right. So I can ask the question what's what's the limit of each of them?

268
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:23,160
And there will be two of them, right? So one is.

269
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:31,320
So if I take decreasing sets now for decreasing, I need to take an intersection to find the limit.

270
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:43,390
So it's going to be first intersection and from one to infinity of the B that are decreasing.

271
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:54,450
So that's the union key from end to infinity, a key that's that's one limit.

272
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:59,480
And another one is the other way around.

273
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:06,630
So the union and from one to infinity, the intersection t from end to infinity.

274
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:21,060
And there is a definition that names these two limits.

275
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:26,040
So the first one is called limit superior.

276
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:38,690
Yes. This goes to infinity of the sequence.

277
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:45,500
A key, and then it's inferior.

278
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:51,670
And he goes to Phenix. It's.

279
00:42:51,750 --> 00:43:07,770
That's this one. Now it's formally clear in terms of symbolic algebra that they can do that.

280
00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:11,280
Right. That's not the point.

281
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:15,280
Right. We want to understand what these things are.

282
00:43:15,310 --> 00:43:20,140
So, first of all, they are sets. Right. So the limit superior.

283
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:28,310
So this is a set. And this isn't the limit of, say, Caesar salad.

284
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:33,230
It's not a number of they.

285
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:51,730
So coming back to, uh, the understanding that we used when we defined, uh, um, the indicator function, for example, right?

286
00:43:51,730 --> 00:44:03,490
So we're going to ask a question, uh, so on a gas belonging to a certain set, meaning the limits set, uh, what, what kind of omegas are those?

287
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:21,680
So first of all, we have this piece.

288
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:32,480
So if I may, God belongs to the union cave and to infinity.

289
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:37,040
A key. Now, let me give another definition.

290
00:44:39,790 --> 00:44:45,070
It's probably belongs to this discussion with with the indicator function.

291
00:44:45,490 --> 00:45:00,190
So we will be saying. That's an event a.

292
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:14,450
He's happening. For a given omega.

293
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:30,120
So it's going to be a function of Omega that same. If it belongs to me, or in other words, if ai0 maker is what?

294
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:36,630
Mark that thing as a definition.

295
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:48,200
Because this understanding brings us closer to interpreting actually the subject matter, construction and other kinds of models and so on.

296
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:59,990
Right when we, uh. So from the mathematics of mathematical language, we actually transitioned a little bit to the language of real life, right?

297
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:08,420
So in the events that we defined in real life could be that happening or not happening, and we can picture defining a model for that thing.

298
00:46:09,230 --> 00:46:18,110
So in terms of a sequences, it's, uh, it could be that we are trying something and we look whether something is, is happening or not.

299
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:25,700
Right. So if we are expecting a call from somebody, uh, so your sequence of events could be, uh, uh, mapped.

300
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:29,190
Today's right. Do I have a call from this person on.

301
00:46:29,230 --> 00:46:35,210
On today than tomorrow and so on?

302
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:41,899
Right. So that's that's a real life phenomena. And you could be happening well over could be talking in terms of.

303
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:46,520
Well, the call happened on the call not happened on a given day.

304
00:46:47,030 --> 00:47:00,590
And so trying to, uh, built intuition around limited city elements in Syria will be, uh, formulated in terms of well, is the call happening?

305
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:06,050
Uh, eventually, infinitely many times for my relationship with that person, right?

306
00:47:06,770 --> 00:47:11,420
Or is it, is it, uh, only happening a finite number of times?

307
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:24,050
Um, and regardless of my history of calls, um, uh, if, if I start looking today into the future, uh,

308
00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:32,140
will it ever happen again or will always happen again, things like that, or will I eventually wait long enough?

309
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:40,610
And my relationship with that person develops into something so that the call will be all happening every single day forever, right?

310
00:47:40,970 --> 00:47:49,280
So things, considerations like that. So this will build intuition around, uh, limits, superior and limit and inferior.

311
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:59,080
Um, and happening a lot happening because of the relationship of that language to indicator functions.

312
00:47:59,090 --> 00:48:03,419
I have a nice way of showing what's going on with the sequences.

313
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:10,640
So if I, if I take an Omega, right, and I picture myself for every member of the sequence,

314
00:48:11,330 --> 00:48:18,350
a key right there is, uh, and I a k of that omega and it's c the zero one.

315
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:24,560
So whether for my given omega, what events are happening.

316
00:48:25,310 --> 00:48:33,410
So that would be a sequence of zero ones or a sequence of empty or field circles that I can use to visualize this story.

317
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:42,340
Right. So visualizing.

318
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:56,480
The relationship. Between a given army omega.

319
00:48:59,130 --> 00:49:09,150
And a sequence. So I could do something like this.

320
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:21,700
So having let me go. And I could have all of this could be a zero.

321
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:26,330
This could be ones in so long.

322
00:49:26,810 --> 00:49:31,280
And the relationship is that the empty circle means.

323
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:39,840
Ahmed does not belong to the respective event.

324
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:54,030
Yeah. The left field circle means that doesn't belong.

325
00:49:55,530 --> 00:50:10,040
To the respective events. And using our language, we would say that this event is not happening.

326
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:15,350
And in this case, we will say event is happening.

327
00:50:20,530 --> 00:50:30,130
Right. And I have a sequence of events that is meant to the same sequence of numbers a one, two, three, four, and so on.

328
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:43,780
So for this particular one, we can say that this particular Omega is part of this set of the set E three and also of the set 85 and so on.

329
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:53,470
And I can go on characterizing the relationship between those sets and my Omega in terms of this zero one thing.

330
00:50:55,810 --> 00:51:08,280
So now, um, and I'm going to use this, this type of understanding when I'm interpreting the limits superior as a certain limit, inferior as a set.

331
00:51:08,290 --> 00:51:15,969
So the next thing after the break will be to ask the question, well, if Omega belongs to this one,

332
00:51:15,970 --> 00:51:27,910
what its relationship in terms of the sequence with the elements ak for any k k so now have a break for 5 minutes.

333
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:37,110
You seem like good stuff.

334
00:53:37,630 --> 00:53:42,010
So if there was a one, I'm putting a zero. And if there's a zero, I'm putting in a one.

335
00:53:45,690 --> 00:53:53,070
So it's like because there was at least one combination being the process that's exploded.

336
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:57,950
Well, first, the argument goes like that. Right.

337
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:10,580
So if if I can if my sigma algebra is account of all right then I can understand it as a matrix like this, right.

338
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:15,200
Where each set is basically a sequence of zero or ones.

339
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:27,440
Right. So then I'm saying that if I invert the diagonal elements, right, then on the one hand, the diagonal is a sequence of zero ones.

340
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:32,450
So it must be one of the roles if, if, if this representation is true.

341
00:54:32,930 --> 00:54:43,100
On the other hand, it cannot be one of the roles because one element is exactly different for each of the roles between the row in the diagonal.

342
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:52,440
There's not a single. Sequence that's in a roll that's the same as the diagonal.

343
00:54:56,100 --> 00:55:03,030
I still don't get why that is.

344
00:55:04,870 --> 00:55:09,070
Well, because, for example, if I do go to write,

345
00:55:09,850 --> 00:55:16,840
it cannot be the same as this diagonal because there's the inverted diagonal because the second element is different.

346
00:55:17,710 --> 00:55:20,920
Right. And that is true for any role.

347
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:24,759
Yeah. So on the one hand, it must be one of the roles.

348
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:27,790
On the other hand, by construction, it cannot be one of them all.

349
00:55:27,890 --> 00:55:31,000
So that's the contradiction. Okay.

350
00:55:57,250 --> 00:56:01,540
Feel that the union is. There's just.

351
00:56:04,390 --> 00:56:12,110
I'm. Constable.

352
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:18,800
As well. You can only show it for for two, right.

353
00:56:18,850 --> 00:56:23,230
Because for the algebra you don't need countable, right.

354
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:26,530
You just need finite. That means you can do with a two.

355
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:38,680
So if you if you show that, you can take and of course, if you take two elements from any of the A's of the beautiful A's, they will be in there.

356
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:45,370
If you take, you know, intersection because by definition, because these are algebra.

357
00:56:45,550 --> 00:56:49,510
Right. But if you take them from different is.

358
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:55,600
Right. So that's the question. So how do you do an argument that they they will be in there.

359
00:56:56,860 --> 00:57:01,930
But then that's a consequence of the mistake, right? You first make them part of one.

360
00:57:02,230 --> 00:57:06,670
One thing. And you use the algebra definition for that.

361
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:19,180
Chauvin was also. Oh, the, the for the omega.

362
00:57:19,450 --> 00:57:34,340
Yeah. So sometimes it's I mean I right that this is not the essential parts of this question.

363
00:57:35,030 --> 00:57:38,800
But, um, but, but yeah. It's the institution.

364
00:57:38,810 --> 00:57:42,800
It's not the. Sure. Right.

365
00:57:43,070 --> 00:57:47,270
Right. So you can define it as a union. Right.

366
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:32,730
Okay. So shall we continue? So like I said, we are dissecting the, the, uh, limits superior and limit inferior is a sample.

367
00:58:33,450 --> 00:58:39,090
And in order to do that, we need to first start with, uh, the inner part of it, let's say.

368
00:58:39,810 --> 00:58:45,540
So if we start with limited, superior, uh, so we take a union.

369
00:58:50,050 --> 00:58:53,140
K from M to infinity. A k. So what?

370
00:59:00,990 --> 00:59:10,190
What does that mean? Right. If this is the case and they have sequence.

371
00:59:15,030 --> 00:59:17,339
The tale of the sequence, right?

372
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:30,569
So this is the element that I'm starting with and looking at all of the members of their tale, and there is a union to all of them.

373
00:59:30,570 --> 00:59:34,230
So if I'm a girl belongs to these countable union.

374
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:43,620
So what does that mean in terms of the circles? So it's a union, right?

375
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:51,110
For for Omega to belong to a union. It takes that it belongs to at least one element of that union, right?

376
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:58,260
So there is at least one shaded circle somewhere between AM and infinity, right?

377
01:00:05,590 --> 01:00:14,240
It could be many or infinitely many. There's one shaded.

378
01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:23,740
Or at least one. Shade circle.

379
01:00:26,410 --> 01:00:31,940
In the tale. Right.

380
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:36,860
Okay. So let's look at how the mid superior is defined.

381
01:00:37,910 --> 01:00:43,010
So if Omega belongs to the intersection from one to infinity.

382
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:53,730
What does that mean? For some events m.

383
01:00:57,170 --> 01:01:01,940
That means that honor belongs to every single detail right here.

384
01:01:18,670 --> 01:01:22,300
Okay. Now, if we put both of them together,

385
01:01:23,710 --> 01:01:33,880
so we're having intersection and from one to infinity and then we have union over the M tail from end to infinity.

386
01:01:34,810 --> 01:01:40,300
A key. Uh, what, what has that actually means?

387
01:01:40,570 --> 01:01:46,560
Right. So because I have the, uh, countable intersection, right?

388
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:51,340
Than I actually have, uh.

389
01:01:51,460 --> 01:02:01,450
So all of these unions that follow must have Omega in it for omega to belong to the limit superior.

390
01:02:01,450 --> 01:02:23,169
Which this is right. So in other words, regardless of where I put my arm and I can do that, it's an equals one or an equal ten or any other place,

391
01:02:23,170 --> 01:02:31,210
no matter how large, I will always have at least one shaded circle to the right of my bar.

392
01:02:32,650 --> 01:02:45,700
Okay. Can you. And this is a very weird say very weird way to say something that you would just say out of a common sense.

393
01:02:46,090 --> 01:02:50,530
Just try to visualize this situation and and simplify the saying.

394
01:02:51,730 --> 01:02:56,230
What does that mean? So I have a sequence of circles, right?

395
01:02:56,230 --> 01:03:01,480
Some shaded, some not shaded. But that sequence is characterized by the following probability.

396
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:09,550
No matter where I cut the the the tail of it, this tail will have at least one shaded circle.

397
01:03:10,660 --> 01:03:14,050
How would you put it in layman's language?

398
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:20,890
Think in terms of how many shaded circles there are.

399
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:31,070
So if my sequence satisfies this property, how many shaded circles I will have?

400
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:43,550
Infinitely many. Right? Because if it's if it's finite, I think by contradiction, then I can put my bar to the right of the last one.

401
01:03:44,390 --> 01:03:47,660
And then I will not have a single shaded circle in the tail.

402
01:03:48,650 --> 01:03:56,570
That's not what I am looking for. Right? So my property is that there is always a shaded circle in the tail, no matter where I put it.

403
01:03:57,320 --> 01:04:14,960
So this event. Is a set of army figures such that there's infinitely.

404
01:04:19,030 --> 01:04:25,690
Many events in the sequence.

405
01:04:29,270 --> 01:04:37,050
Happening. For such lawmakers.

406
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:48,930
So it's a collection of omegas such that I have infinitely many events lined up for every single lawmaker.

407
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:54,540
Okay, so let's now look at the other one.

408
01:04:56,850 --> 01:05:06,270
So limits in Syria. So I have everything inverted, straight versus limit superior and from one to infinity.

409
01:05:06,390 --> 01:05:10,660
And then intersection K from M to infinity.

410
01:05:10,670 --> 01:05:14,100
K k so.

411
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:24,540
So first I apply this understanding to the second piece.

412
01:05:24,870 --> 01:05:28,320
Yeah. In my expression. Right.

413
01:05:28,770 --> 01:05:33,780
So if my omega belongs to the intersection.

414
01:05:37,770 --> 01:05:43,230
Uh, of all the elements in the tail, what does that mean?

415
01:05:44,460 --> 01:05:48,770
That all of them light up? Right. Because otherwise, it's.

416
01:05:48,930 --> 01:05:52,740
It's not going to belong to it. That means.

417
01:05:55,970 --> 01:06:01,230
All events. In the entail.

418
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:22,050
Are happening. So that means that my entail only has shaded circles to the right of of the animal.

419
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:29,700
If this is the case right now for Omega to belong to limit in theory,

420
01:06:29,970 --> 01:06:35,340
I need this to be happening at least for one of the ends, because there is a union here.

421
01:06:36,330 --> 01:06:40,500
Right. So in other words, if I now formulated,

422
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:50,879
that means that I can find a tail far enough to the right so that every single event in that tail

423
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:57,090
will be happening and a collection of omegas that satisfy that would form the limit inferior set.

424
01:06:58,140 --> 01:07:01,800
Okay. So this is a set.

425
01:07:07,130 --> 01:07:13,820
On the gas such that eventually.

426
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:38,900
Meaning for sufficiently large and. All events in the tale.

427
01:07:43,380 --> 01:07:57,660
Will be happening. So let's let's visualize.

428
01:07:57,680 --> 01:08:06,020
Right. So this one is, uh, so a sequence of zero ones, so we don't care how the initial part of it looks like.

429
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:17,630
Uh, but for any place we cut and then tail, there will be at least one shaded circle to the right of it.

430
01:08:21,150 --> 01:08:29,940
And this will make the total count of shaded circles infinitely large right now for limited theory.

431
01:08:30,660 --> 01:08:34,860
I again don't care how the beginning of my sequence looks like,

432
01:08:35,370 --> 01:08:44,100
but I can find in large enough so that to the right of an I only have shaded ones right every single one.

433
01:08:47,610 --> 01:08:54,900
There's another way to say that, particularly if English is your native language.

434
01:08:56,400 --> 01:09:02,160
So you can see all but a finite number.

435
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:12,470
Of the keys are not happening.

436
01:09:34,310 --> 01:09:39,590
Happening, right? English is not my native language.

437
01:09:43,660 --> 01:09:54,460
So what I really mean is that the number of empty circles is a finite here, and all the other circles are shaded in this case.

438
01:09:55,450 --> 01:09:59,630
So now tell me, how many shaded circles are there in the limits?

439
01:09:59,650 --> 01:10:08,800
Inferior. Infinitely many rights and limited superiors defined as the one that has infinitely many circles.

440
01:10:08,810 --> 01:10:12,799
So what can you say about the relationship between minute and fear and limited?

441
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:18,890
Superior. So the inferior one is a subset rights of limited superior.

442
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:29,100
So because the number of shaded circles is infinite.

443
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:36,680
In the. Limits.

444
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:43,850
In Syria. We have.

445
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:50,490
That's lead me in Syria.

446
01:10:51,340 --> 01:10:59,820
This case goes to infinity. The key is actually a subset of limited superior.

447
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:10,520
So you take. And that justifies the name, right?

448
01:11:10,730 --> 01:11:13,730
Because if we're calling something superior, something inferior.

449
01:11:15,460 --> 01:11:22,420
It's natural to expect. And these are sense. It's natural to expect the inferior to be a subset of this period.

450
01:11:25,030 --> 01:11:32,800
Um, okay. So then, so having defined the two sets and build some intuition around them.

451
01:11:33,590 --> 01:11:36,639
Um, so there's, there's this question, right?

452
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:40,270
If one set is a subset of the other. So what's between them?

453
01:11:42,580 --> 01:11:46,130
So I have a name.

454
01:11:46,150 --> 01:11:53,540
So. And that's when I have infinitely many events happening in the sequence.

455
01:11:54,830 --> 01:11:58,100
I have Liam in.

456
01:12:01,260 --> 01:12:07,230
And that's when eventually all of them start happening.

457
01:12:09,180 --> 01:12:14,160
And only a finite number of events are not happening in the limits in Syria.

458
01:12:16,050 --> 01:12:21,030
Right. So what can you say about the number of events in the.

459
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:31,830
In between the two. So between the two, the area between the two is still part of the limits superior.

460
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:35,710
So we have infinitely many shaded circles there. Right.

461
01:12:36,700 --> 01:12:41,709
But the limit inferior. It also has infinitely many shaded circles.

462
01:12:41,710 --> 01:12:48,460
But the circles that are empty, there's only a finite number in the limit inferior.

463
01:12:49,390 --> 01:13:03,670
So the area in between is there is infinitely many events that are happening because it's

464
01:13:03,670 --> 01:13:12,280
part of the limited superiore and it's also infinitely many events that are not happening.

465
01:13:13,030 --> 01:13:23,180
That makes it not part of the limit in Syria. And you could characterize this situation as sort of alternation.

466
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:41,239
In the 80. What perpetual alternation break that that means that I will wherever I cut the tail,

467
01:13:41,240 --> 01:13:50,660
I will have both the shaded and at least one shaded and at least one not shaded circle in that tail.

468
01:13:51,890 --> 01:14:00,280
So that's that's the medial part of it. Yeah.

469
01:14:03,490 --> 01:14:07,750
Who the sequence is accountable collection, of course.

470
01:14:09,530 --> 01:14:18,270
Sets themselves may maybe any. The set of the sets is countable, right?

471
01:14:18,490 --> 01:14:28,480
That that's that you can use a countable set of sets in a sequence of sets interchangeably because that's the same thing.

472
01:14:30,940 --> 01:14:34,389
The sets themselves could be anything, right? We're not detailing.

473
01:14:34,390 --> 01:14:40,340
It's currently. Uh, one last thing.

474
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:44,630
Um, I will probably start probability tomorrow, not tomorrow.

475
01:14:45,410 --> 01:14:49,080
Wednesday. Right. But one last thing.

476
01:14:51,350 --> 01:15:03,130
So we have. Let's see. Suppose. A key is a sequence of disjoint sets.

477
01:15:10,270 --> 01:15:21,639
You can tell why I need that. Because I started saying that we will where about to consider probability there will be a formula of

478
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:30,160
total probability that's based on these joint sets that I if I form a union that creates the full army,

479
01:15:30,340 --> 01:15:35,170
so that's a partition, then that's what goes into the formula of total probability.

480
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:42,760
But we can also use the opportunity and introduce them in the context of the limit inferior limit, superior example.

481
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:47,200
So for such a sequence, what is limits of view and what is limit on theory?

482
01:15:51,870 --> 01:15:56,790
So if they are disjoint, what does it mean in terms of the sequence of circles?

483
01:15:59,070 --> 01:16:02,780
So for every omega, there's exactly one shade.

484
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:11,180
Right. Or not if if they don't make a partition of the for lawmaker.

485
01:16:11,270 --> 01:16:17,120
Right. So and exactly. One is not an infinite number.

486
01:16:18,140 --> 01:16:23,660
Right. There's at most one.

487
01:16:27,460 --> 01:16:35,340
Events happening. For every Omega.

488
01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:45,330
So and that means the limit in Syria.

489
01:16:48,110 --> 01:16:58,700
Yes. Same as limit superior. Of course, I always need to add this thing, but they will some times forget to do so.

490
01:17:00,530 --> 01:17:04,850
So it's of sales, not of something else. And this is an empty sense.

491
01:17:09,470 --> 01:17:10,940
Okay. That's it for today.
