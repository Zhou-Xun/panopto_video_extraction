1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:06,750
I can't. It's because it doesn't mean that you're saying.

2
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:22,330
Yeah, it's because like I've never for any other classes, I've never had anything that would signal that I'm getting the same certificate like.

3
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,940
So I have to take this on my own with the forms.

4
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:32,010
It's like when you form like, like a list.

5
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:41,270
Very. I couldn't all because he was just going to have to like pick one day with emphasis.

6
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,670
Right now, it doesn't make sense. We've done so much work.

7
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:47,690
Yeah. Okay.

8
00:00:48,830 --> 00:01:14,670
So I think that it was time that he got back on the registration register because I realized, like, when I was like, Oh, that'll be at least an hour.

9
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:27,460
I'm like, Oh, I should also mention race because I felt like I like that's really something I completely should be able to do.

10
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:35,950
Yeah. Actually don't like, you know, like when you left those crimes that you were telling me about killing a bunch of people.

11
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:53,120
You got it from Peter by 6.5% is just a little bit unclear what is going to happen.

12
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:59,110
And then I would like to know the total number of things like this.

13
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:07,770
What is happening is that we have to figure in in the.

14
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:14,550
Warren Buffett Yeah.

15
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:22,680
Bernie Sanders. I mean, 1310430630.

16
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:39,700
I want to know all these people. Well, I think I got it to look very realistic with regards to security.

17
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:43,780
It's just part of the discourse.

18
00:02:43,870 --> 00:03:04,340
And I was like, oh, I think it was -2 to 3 times.

19
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:14,770
Okay, sorry, guys. The display was not showing up on the projector, but I figured out how to make it work.

20
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,840
Good afternoon. Sorry for the delay. Hope you guys are all well.

21
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:30,310
Good. It's been nice to meet with many of the students about their final projects and discuss them kind of,

22
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:34,600
you know, troubleshoot things and refine the questions.

23
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:41,320
I have not met with a couple of teams yet, so I really would love to meet with everybody.

24
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:46,540
So if you haven't met with me, please set up a time to meet this week.

25
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:53,170
Give added some extra slots on my calendar for appointments, so please take a look.

26
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:59,790
And if that doesn't work for you all, please email me and we'll find a separate client.

27
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:08,259
That does work for you too. I think it's important because I think there are a lot of nuances in the discussion

28
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:14,430
that I can't really respond to on the assignment that you sent in in by email.

29
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:21,550
So discussing your ideas and how to kind of implement them is going to be very helpful to you,

30
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:26,560
I think, as you get started or continue to work on your final project.

31
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:34,390
Okay. So today we're going to talk about your presentations, which are going to be coming in two weeks from today.

32
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:43,770
So I want to just give you some guidelines about those presentations for your final project, and then we'll continue with proximity analysis.

33
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:50,170
And by the end of today, we should be able to finish all the lab activities for the class,

34
00:04:50,800 --> 00:05:01,810
and you should have at least an introductory kind of uh, uh, idea about clustering and how that applies to proximity analysis.

35
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:08,410
But that's where I'm going to focus on today. Okay. Um, so couple of announcements.

36
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,390
In addition to what I just said, there's no class next week through the Thanksgiving break,

37
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:22,250
but to give you guys some extra time to work on that, that is class work you have to do and also get going for that.

38
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:25,480
Yeah, I figured it out. Okay. Very good. Thank you. Thanks for coming.

39
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:29,560
You're welcome. Oh, um. Yeah.

40
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:33,790
Give you extra time to work on your projects. And what next week?

41
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:37,510
If you have the time on Tuesday for the.

42
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:45,640
The normal time that we meet again, I have some extra slots for calendar appointments, so take a look at that.

43
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:56,860
The other thing I ask you to do for today is to do your own tutorial self-paced about something called Azeris or Shia story maps.

44
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:01,690
Story maps is a is a service that they have,

45
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:12,220
the software that they have that helps you tell a story that uses maps in a visually appealing and multimedia fashion.

46
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:19,840
So take a look at that. I might ask you to incorporate that into your proposals, but you're more than welcome to do that if you like.

47
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,590
Some students have done that in the past to steer clear.

48
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:33,070
What if you're in a story map project based on the maps that they create and the text that they're using for their presentation and or final project.

49
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:44,950
So take a look at that. Also, if you go to your canvas site, not now necessarily, but when you get a chance and they're modules,

50
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:55,390
they have some links here to refer to a few different, uh, story map projects that might be interesting to you.

51
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:59,890
Then they may inspire you to use it for the presentations in this class.

52
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:08,650
All right. So in terms of presentations, let's talk a little bit about that and talk about what's going to happen.

53
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:20,980
That is on Tuesday, the 29th. Two weeks from today, we have ten groups, so each group will get 15 minutes total for their presentation time slot.

54
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:28,900
And I sit I anticipate about 12 minutes for your presentation in about 3 minutes for Q&A.

55
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,230
So don't use up your whole 15 minutes to present.

56
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:37,240
Save some time at the end for people to ask you questions and you to ask folks questions if you need.

57
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:43,150
Okay. Now this is a basic structure you can follow for the presentation.

58
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:51,300
Uh, you know, talk about the background, the significance of your, of your project, you know,

59
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:57,190
what is the research question or programmatic question or aim that you've articulated so far?

60
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:01,900
You know, what's the time frame that you're thinking about in terms of your analysis?

61
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:06,340
Make sure that's communicated in your background and significance.

62
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:14,410
And of course, you should talk about the health issue of why it's important and why is it important to look at it in terms of your your questions.

63
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:21,219
Second, describe your data sources and measures your time frame.

64
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,740
Again, the variables you're using,

65
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:33,970
your units of analysis should be described there description of any methodology that you're using spatial and for statistical methodology.

66
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:46,840
Actually, you may not use statistical methods, but some folks may do things like regression measures of variance or central tendency of correlation.

67
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:50,409
Things like that may be reported, especially between groups,

68
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:55,479
because people talk about differences between some types of areas versus other types of areas,

69
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:01,630
and it can present all of that kind of stuff in a tabular format with statistical tests of inference.

70
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:05,740
So you can include that and then your results.

71
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:09,850
You know what you've learned so far from what you've done so far?

72
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,310
Meaning I don't expect you guys to be completely done with your final project on Presentation Day.

73
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:21,370
It's expected that you will modify things and refine things and finalize things for the paper

74
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:28,090
that you turn in the week afterwards and then talk about why is what you learned important?

75
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:34,840
So the implications are what you learn. Okay, and then pose some discussion questions for the class.

76
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:41,260
You should choose the situations about, you know, interpretation or you know,

77
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:47,560
what the results mean for policy or programmatic issues or anything else.

78
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:55,780
Suggestions for improvement that you might be seeking, etc. Maybe you don't have all your data sources.

79
00:09:55,780 --> 00:10:02,320
You know, maybe people can guide you on that. So they use some of that time to get some feedback from the classroom.

80
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:18,100
All the students that are listening and me, we will and I will evaluate your presentation on a score of 1 to 5, just one score,

81
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:28,840
and you'll get some written comments from all of us for any final presentation that you could use to revise your paper.

82
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:35,860
Okay. Any questions and comments about your presentations?

83
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:51,910
No. All right. Okay. So, you know, I guess when you think about your presentations, you know, think about this diagram, right?

84
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:58,500
They make sure you of think you're going to be basically completing this diagram as part of your presentation.

85
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:02,990
You going to talk about where you got your data, how you processed your data, right.

86
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,930
The measures, the analysis you did, and you're going to present it in maps,

87
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:12,429
in visualizations, and make sure you articulate these things when you do your presentation.

88
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:19,000
And they try to give you some pointers on where you may give this information as part of your planning presentation.

89
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:25,480
So today we're in physical proximity analysis. We talked about density distance measures.

90
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:32,890
We talked about clustering last time a little bit and we talked about the nearest neighbor ratio, which we implemented on the injury data.

91
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:40,960
The point data today, we're going to talk a little bit more about clustering and go into global and local clustering methods.

92
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:47,110
And these have to do with not just clustering of features, but their attributes as well.

93
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:55,089
Okay. So we're going to discuss that today. And I think it won't take more than an hour or so in the remainder of the time.

94
00:11:55,090 --> 00:12:02,499
I will we'll work on your final project, so I'll go to class and answer questions people may have and I'll try to meet

95
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:06,190
with folks I haven't met already as a priority just to get that stuff started.

96
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:11,379
Okay. All right. So spatial audio correlation.

97
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:25,810
What is that? Okay. This is basically talking about how features in the attributes might be spatially clustered or dispersed over a geographic region.

98
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:30,700
Okay. So measures of spatial autocorrelation give you a measure of degree.

99
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:37,030
So how much is our features in their attributes clustered or not?

100
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,080
Okay.

101
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:51,010
And it measures how features on a map with similar attributes are kind of playing out together or pushing themselves away from each other in some way.

102
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:55,899
Okay. We've kind of not done this yet in any way.

103
00:12:55,900 --> 00:13:02,049
We talked about the nearest neighbor ratio, which really just looked at the features themselves and if those are clustered,

104
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:05,140
the point data, but not really anything about that.

105
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:10,209
Those points in terms of, you know, what was the gender of the person who was involved in the accident?

106
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:13,180
What time of day did it occur? Those types of things.

107
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:19,030
And that kind of becomes important many times when you think about clustering the geographic features.

108
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:28,440
Okay, so there is a commonly used statistic called the spatial, I mean, the global Morans statistic.

109
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,950
So this is a global measure of spatial autocorrelation,

110
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:42,310
meaning that it looks for presence of clustering and dispersion, doesn't really tell you where it's happening,

111
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:48,459
whether it is present or not in your dataset and positive value indicate that

112
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:55,660
there is clustering and negative values indicate that there is a dispersion.

113
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:04,390
Okay. So positive it means that things the high values in the attribute field are clustered together.

114
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:12,500
But they actually. My mistake.

115
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:20,090
The high values are clustered together. The negative responses may indicate that low values are clustered together.

116
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:25,670
High values and high attribute values are near low values.

117
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:33,590
That's true. Negative is dispersion. My mistake and no zero values are no clustering or dispersion at all.

118
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:41,510
So, yes, high values are hotspots and low values.

119
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:50,150
Negative values include dispersion. So let's let's get into doing a global Moran size measure.

120
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:55,160
I think that will help us kind of get an idea of what it is trying to tell us.

121
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:59,360
So let's open up all our lab folders.

122
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:13,770
Let's go to our can this website and download HP at 66 lab.

123
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:55,130
And it put it into the sea. Drive and open up our curious probe.

124
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:01,390
Yes. Sorry if I was being a little confusing.

125
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:15,100
So the Morans are high values indicate clustering, low values indicate dispersion and zero values indicating no dispersion or clustering.

126
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:27,160
So when there is a p value associated with the Morans, I statistic is testing the null which is Morans I equals zero.

127
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:48,840
Chris. So finish. All right.

128
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:52,239
So we're going to work with the lung cancer mortality data again.

129
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,550
We're going to move back to that.

130
00:17:53,560 --> 00:18:01,060
And as you remember, we had county lung level lung cancer mortality information for the all the counties in the United States.

131
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:06,430
So we're going to examine that U.S. data to see if there's any clustering in

132
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:09,880
lung cancer mortality at the county level in the United States of America.

133
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:21,940
Okay. So let's open up our the lung cancer mortality cluster AP file, which should be in your lab folder.

134
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:47,700
So. No, I didn't see my folder. You mean just a moment to read.

135
00:18:50,240 --> 00:19:58,670
Extracted some. Okay.

136
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:25,890
Yeah. You should be in the projects folder.

137
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:34,440
There should be a folder called Lung Cancer Mortality Cluster and there should be a file called Lung Cancer Mortality Cluster.

138
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:38,070
Apex Right. That's the one you want.

139
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:08,330
I think I'm in the hard day today. All right, let's sort this out.

140
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:15,380
So let's find this information. It's saying it's looking at not the right place.

141
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:23,270
Right click on U.S. states. I guess this is a good exercise for us to figure out what the source data is.

142
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:29,480
Okay. Go to properties and it's saying that it's looking in totally the wrong place.

143
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:37,670
No, no, I'm saying it's looking here. So let's set the data source.

144
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:47,690
Okay. So that asset data source code to the C drive in the HB 1866 lab.

145
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:52,580
And let's see, I think the data source is in two places.

146
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:57,080
One might be in the lung cancer mortality view database.

147
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:01,459
It is good. So click on the US States and push.

148
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:11,450
Okay. So it was pointing at the location and my home computer, not on my computer here for some reason.

149
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:26,720
You go. Yes. Okay. So right click on the US States, go to properties and then when you go to source, it should not say this path says something else.

150
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:30,950
If there's a red exclamation point here, a warning sign.

151
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:36,140
So you have to go to set data source and find that data source on the computer.

152
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:56,629
The US States um ship feature class is located in HP 1866 lab projects, lung cancer mortality cluster and the GIO database that's there.

153
00:22:56,630 --> 00:23:01,640
Lung cancer mortality cluster G. DB And it says US States.

154
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:05,470
So you just click on the name for Qlc and push.

155
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:10,610
Okay again and then the state boundaries appear. They were not there before.

156
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:16,340
So we have to find this information to the lung cancer mortality rates.

157
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:27,170
So go to properties again. When you right click on that layer, go to source and you notice something different here.

158
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:35,630
The that's my home directory structure so go to set data source and this is the same GIO database

159
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:44,480
it's just called lung cancer mortality for pro was for I think four years pro bush okay.

160
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:51,740
And then fish okay again. So you get all this rates for the contiguous United States of America.

161
00:23:52,220 --> 00:24:00,260
You can shift down and zoom in to.

162
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:06,750
This Alaska hearing projected down below. All right.

163
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:16,890
So this is a, you know, the rates that we've been looking at over the semester and these are the rates the white men from 2000 to 2004.

164
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:26,580
Okay. And we are using equal interval kind of a break point for the the five different categories in the corporate rate.

165
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:35,400
And it's a grayscale. So from this map, we can see that there are higher rates in the south of the country,

166
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:42,870
kind of clustered around, you know, West Virginia, North Carolina, those kinds of places.

167
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:49,950
But what it doesn't tell us if those rates are actually significantly higher or lower than the rest of the country,

168
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,780
and that to do that clustering analysis helps that gets to that answer.

169
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,760
Okay. So first, let's see if there's a presence of clustering or not in this dataset.

170
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:09,840
So we're going to run the global mind's eye statistics, sort of command search and spread global trends.

171
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:16,590
So this is spatial correlation, quote unquote, global brands.

172
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:30,459
Right? So click on that. So you have the queue processing tab open up and then the input feature class is simple.

173
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:34,060
We're looking at this doing cancer mortality in there.

174
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:41,980
So you put that there, you have to have to designate the field that it needs to use to calculate the global brands.

175
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:49,540
So go under field and find our WMI zero zero underscore zero four, which is the rate environment.

176
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:56,980
Okay. So we select those three just so that it correlates with the data that we're looking at now.

177
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:59,980
It's just clustering. Can you say it louder?

178
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:06,440
So when you select the input fields just so it matches the years of the date that we're looking at now, right.

179
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:17,830
Yeah, it uses when you calculate the global Morenci, it's looking at clustering of attributes and features.

180
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:22,240
So attributes meaning the rate of lung cancer mortality at the county level.

181
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:30,280
It's not just telling us that the counties are clustering the counties with the specific high rates of lung cancer mortality.

182
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:37,300
Are they near other counties with high rates of lung cancer mortality, or is their dispersion,

183
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:44,430
are they far away from each other as possible in a non random kind of way, or is it not clustering at all?

184
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:51,070
So you have to choose an attribute that you want to understand and analyze when you choose this.

185
00:26:54,330 --> 00:27:03,390
All right. So take on generate report and the conceptualization of relationships we're going to choose inverse distance,

186
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:10,860
meaning that it's going to take into account all the different counties in the US.

187
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:22,250
And when it calculates the cluster statistic and it's going to give a give an inverse weight to counties that are further away from the index.

188
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:29,759
Okay. Meaning that it's going to look at each county and then look at all the surrounding counties and

189
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:35,850
then all the counties in the United States to to calculate the global mind's eye statistic.

190
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:39,300
You can choose different conceptualizations or relationships.

191
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:42,120
There are things called fixed distance band,

192
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:53,339
which you can tell the the system is pro to only use that the lung cancer mortality rates of the index county and

193
00:27:53,340 --> 00:28:00,809
maybe counties that are x distance away that you choose yourself as a researcher that could be one kilometer,

194
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:06,170
could be 100 kilometers, could be 1000 kilometers, but then that would use a fixed distance.

195
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:13,290
Then it should be driven conceptually about what you think a quote unquote neighborhood is.

196
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:20,280
When you think about this specific issue, it may be that in this case,

197
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:26,880
a fixed distance band you may uses about the size of one county in the United States of America.

198
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:32,760
You need to have at least one county in your neighboring area to be able to compute the statistic.

199
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:44,499
Okay. Zone of indifference is is similar to fixed distance where you you say you give

200
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:49,660
it a it only looks at a specific distance and ignores everything beyond it.

201
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:57,700
K nearest neighbors is you can tell it well look at the ten nearest neighbors and use

202
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:04,839
those for lung cancer mortality rates to calculate the statistically contiguous edges.

203
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:13,569
Only meaning only counties that are touching the edges of Index County will be used when

204
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:19,300
you calculate the statistical edges in corners mean the corners become important as well.

205
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:30,310
And then and then you can actually get specific weights for neighboring counties, promote another file that generates spatial that's for you.

206
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:34,840
So the we're going to start out with inverse distance.

207
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:41,530
My suggestion to you is either use fixed distance band and I'll talk about how you can

208
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:48,910
identify the right distance for a distance band approach or use contiguous edges in corners.

209
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:53,950
When you designate this, we're just going to start out doing inverse distance,

210
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:59,530
but you can then run this analysis using a couple of different options if you like.

211
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:08,410
Okay, and then measure distance using Euclidean method meaning through straight line.

212
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:12,760
The Manhattan method is a few hundred road network or something like that,

213
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:19,600
so you have a kind of jagged lines with perpendicular corners and then standardization.

214
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:25,570
We'll use a real standardization, okay? And there's no threshold.

215
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:39,190
So let's push run. And once you push run, it will calculate the results and you results.

216
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:54,140
Okay. Now there is a report that was generated in your project folder, but that data is also presented here.

217
00:30:55,660 --> 00:31:05,569
Uh, I think the warning has to do with, you know, what's the, the furthest neighbor that it found,

218
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:12,110
which was apparently 49,000 kilometers, meters away, and which is probably the last, to be honest.

219
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:19,790
Um, so the Morenci statistic you get is .3961.

220
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:26,660
And the P value for that statistic is 0.0000.

221
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:34,940
So this is a positive Morenci statistic, meaning there's indication of clustering in this data.

222
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:45,020
And the p value for that Morenci statistic is significant, indicating that there is a statistically significant level of clustering happening,

223
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:51,470
but we don't know where the clusters are based on this specific test.

224
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:58,520
So to figure that out, we would have to look at the local statistics.

225
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:06,890
Okay. For spatial articulation. Now, let's look at the report quickly, just so you know what that might look like.

226
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:10,100
It's going to give you the same information, but with some visuals.

227
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:22,130
So if you go to the project folder and then you go to the lung cancer mortality cluster, there should be a new Morenci results each HTML file.

228
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:26,590
If you double click that, this should open up.

229
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,080
And here are the statistics that we were looking at.

230
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:37,940
It kind of gives you a gradient of what the possible values for the Z-SCORE might be.

231
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:47,450
And the blue values indicate that there is pretty significant level of clustering.

232
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:56,410
Okay. And it gives you some information about the parameters that we used in the calculations.

233
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:08,830
Okay. So so indicates, you know, there is a, you know, this not high but moderate level of clustering going on.

234
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:13,540
Let's think about this conceptualization of spatial relationships again.

235
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:17,650
Mm hmm. So this should be dependent on your research question.

236
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:21,280
For example, a lot of you folks are asking questions like that.

237
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:33,400
Is there variation in some attribute, you know, say, you know, low birth weight or inadequate prenatal care or violent crime?

238
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:37,900
At the county level, we're looking at variation in that.

239
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:44,350
So when you think about the conceptualization of relationships, think about counties as your neighbors.

240
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:53,649
Neighboring counties, not really. Things that are really far away because things that are going on in New York likely are not

241
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:58,990
going to affect birth rates and crime rates and stuff like that happening in Los Angeles.

242
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:06,340
Okay. So think about counties as your neighbors rather than states or areas beyond that.

243
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:15,550
Okay. And this issue has to do with what's the correct scale of your analysis that you may be looking at the geographic communities and county level.

244
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:24,129
But if you increase both the range of and attribute the area of that you're analyzing,

245
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:29,630
when you calculate your clustering statistically to be much larger than counties.

246
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:33,280
Your skill becomes a bit larger.

247
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:43,330
Okay. So think about that when you think about spatial relationships and how to indicate them in the in the software.

248
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:46,390
Now, the inverse difference we talked about, right?

249
00:34:46,390 --> 00:34:55,630
It gives more weight to nearby features and less weight to things that are far away from contiguous neighbors.

250
00:34:55,910 --> 00:35:02,860
It has to do with you're only looking at the attributes of neighboring features and nothing else beyond that.

251
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:08,469
And this is fixed distance approach, which is optimal.

252
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:19,090
If you have information from behind, from other research or even your own data set, that tells you what might be the appropriate scale of analysis.

253
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:23,610
Okay, this might be different conceptually.

254
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:33,430
Like I said, if you're doing county level analysis, maybe think of neighbors as as the width of an average county in your dataset.

255
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:36,700
Okay. Or you can divide this empirically.

256
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:45,430
And the way you derive this distance been empirically is to calculate the global Morenci statistic for different distance spans.

257
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:50,830
So you would say and try to find out where there is highest level of.

258
00:35:52,970 --> 00:36:00,320
Clustering that what districts build. So and in this case we did inverse distance in our calculations,

259
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:06,790
but we could have done fixed distance and said, well, let's look at just a hundred meters nearby.

260
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:13,190
It's like at 200 meters, 300 meters, 400 meters and so on.

261
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:23,810
We would get a range of Z scores in Morena values and you would pick the value that gives you the peak in clustering in your dataset.

262
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:28,820
Okay. So it's called incremental calculations of global.

263
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:34,970
And I actually suggest that approach over anything else.

264
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:41,299
And if that approach fails and you try your own conceptualization and select a

265
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:47,070
fixed distance that suits you or use some other approach that is available to,

266
00:36:48,380 --> 00:37:04,180
okay, so how about you just play around with this tool for a few minutes and calculate the global enzyme for the estate of your choice?

267
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:06,410
Right. You guys been doing that in the past,

268
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:19,040
so maybe you could select the same state and run the calculations again using the same inputs that we used up above.

269
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:27,110
But remember, when you want to look at, let's say, Michigan, you have to select out the Michigan State counties.

270
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:40,100
The nice thing about the geo processing tools in our first probe is that it will run the statistic on the selective features.

271
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:54,290
So you can just select out, let's say, Michigan counties in the select by attribute of lung cancer to layer in the state name abbreviation.

272
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:04,729
For my okay to select of the Michigan counties.

273
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:09,770
And then you can just rerun the statistics.

274
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:23,000
Okay. And when I ran it for Michigan, I got 1.5.152 and 3.005.

275
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,630
There's a P-value and 2.8 as the Z score.

276
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:34,970
So that indicates that there is some level of clustering happening in Michigan in terms of lung cancer mortality.

277
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:44,690
So try out your own state or federal. Other state is pretty straightforward to do and see what you get and try to interpret the results that you get.

278
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,069
You just select the best thing you say.

279
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:32,740
And then right here I used straight abbreviations but I think state name should work so you can select Michigan State for.

280
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:47,030
Yeah. So anybody want to share what they learned?

281
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:06,000
Which state did you choose and what did you get as the results from global brands?

282
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:25,930
Yeah. The one little machine I used to memorize, I was point 45, which is positive, and the P value was .005, which is significant.

283
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:31,500
So I guess it's less frustrating than it was for the entire United States.

284
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:35,580
Mm hmm. And it's it's like.

285
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:40,810
Yeah, great. So there is some level of clustering in Michigan.

286
00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:46,940
Anybody else? Yeah.

287
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:52,790
In Colorado. And I got something to say.

288
00:40:53,120 --> 00:41:02,800
Mm hmm. So it's also a cluster, and the mind's eye statistic was right to it.

289
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:07,790
Okay. Yeah. That's also indicates some level of clustering. Great.

290
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:13,370
So when you're writing your report, you would run this test and say, you know, method section.

291
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:20,660
We calculated the global insight for my cancer mortality at the county level in State X.

292
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:28,910
We found that the more nice that Texas was y z value is this and the P value was significant or not.

293
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:36,530
You see, yes, there was a presence of clustering. When you do that, the next thing you should see in your mind is, Well, where are the clusters?

294
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:40,490
Let's find them. So that's the next activity. Lab 35.

295
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:46,490
So now that we know that there are cluster clustering happening, we're going to look at where they are.

296
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:53,600
And there are two approaches to doing this work. One is looking at clusters and outlier analysis.

297
00:41:55,040 --> 00:42:04,730
So it will give you hotspots, cold spots and outliers, which are areas that are surrounded by dissimilar features.

298
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:10,220
Okay. That's the insulin loco Morganza statistic.

299
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:20,180
And then there's hotspot analysis, which is called in this or GI Star statistic, which you've all read about in papers and the readings in class.

300
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:33,080
Okay. So in contrast to global local looks at where clustering occurs and global only tells you presence and degree of clustering in a specific area.

301
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:38,930
So I think this this is we looked at this earlier.

302
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:48,770
This is the measure of local clustering here. And this is a measure of just corporate of the data.

303
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:54,260
And we talked about this last week. So the answer in local Morningside,

304
00:42:55,490 --> 00:43:07,070
it looks at a set of features and that attributes and identifies high or low value clusters in features with values that are very different than the,

305
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:19,410
uh, the index feature. So when you do this test, you get a local Morenci statistic for each feature in your dataset.

306
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:24,499
So if you ran it for all the counties in the country, oh, I don't know, 3000,

307
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:30,650
4000 counties in the country will have a global mortality statistic associated with it.

308
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:41,150
The z-score in a p value and those z scores in p values will let us know if there's clustering and what type of clustering is happening

309
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:53,420
because of positive values indicate that neighboring features are similar in high or low values and that they're part of a cluster.

310
00:43:54,500 --> 00:44:00,560
And when you have a negative value for Morenci in the case, the neighboring values are dissimilar.

311
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:04,310
Okay. And they're outliers.

312
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:09,410
So these are the inputs in a way. These are maybe the lung cancer mortality rates.

313
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:19,100
And this is what a local index may look at a few map, but you can map the local Morenci index,

314
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:25,190
or you can map the Z scores or P values or the cluster type variables.

315
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:28,400
And those are all generated for you when you run the test.

316
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:32,840
So let's just do it. Let's look at the same data set.

317
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:40,970
Then we're just going to look for Hansell and local Morenci in the command line.

318
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:51,150
It's like local MORAN And you get cluster enough layer analysis.

319
00:44:55,690 --> 00:44:59,020
So the input feature class is lung cancer mortality.

320
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:05,050
Sorry. And the field again is.

321
00:45:05,490 --> 00:45:13,650
But I know that when you ran those state level statistics earlier, you could have you could have changed the field.

322
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:20,040
But what is it clustering for white females, for black females, etc.?

323
00:45:20,070 --> 00:45:28,379
We only looked at it for white males. Right. And I just want to make sure I'm clearing up any selection here before I run the

324
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:33,090
test to make sure you push clear or else the test will only run on California.

325
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:37,660
The data gap.

326
00:45:37,770 --> 00:45:47,220
This time we're going to change, but we get output feature classes named and it's put into our database.

327
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:56,280
We're going to change this conceptualization of spatial relationships to contiguous edges and quarters.

328
00:45:56,730 --> 00:46:05,130
Okay. And then we're going to use row standardization and apply false detection discovery rate,

329
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:16,610
which basically is a correction for multiple comparisons because you're generating so many P values in this in this analysis and then push.

330
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:34,340
Right. Okay.

331
00:46:34,350 --> 00:46:40,440
So this is the map that we get right now.

332
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:50,280
All the the beige colored counties are areas that are not significantly higher or

333
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:57,090
lower than their surrounding counties in terms of the lung cancer mortality rate,

334
00:46:57,570 --> 00:47:05,400
that if you're seeing red counties here,

335
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:15,570
those are counties that have significantly higher rates of lung cancer mortality than their surrounding counties.

336
00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:21,210
And the blue ones are low, low clusters.

337
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:25,550
Actually, these are high, low outliers.

338
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:38,370
These are these are the high, high clusters, meaning they are high cancer mortality counties surrounded by other high cancer mortality counties.

339
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:42,800
My mistake, these dark red outliers.

340
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:47,820
So they're high but surrounded by low mortality rates.

341
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:54,450
These are low, low clusters, meaning they're low grade counties surrounded by other low rate counties.

342
00:47:56,040 --> 00:48:02,880
And we don't really see one real outlier in the low area where there's low rates surrounded by high rates.

343
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:15,780
And this is a hotspot here and some outlier counties within the hotspots in their high counties surrounded by high counties.

344
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:22,919
We're going to run it again using a different conceptualization of relationship to see what we get.

345
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:35,129
But before we do that, let's look at the let's actually look at the attribute table number five for this new layer that was generated.

346
00:48:35,130 --> 00:48:47,190
And that kind of tells us. The data that were created for the counties in our data set.

347
00:48:57,210 --> 00:49:01,830
So this is the local marine eye statistic right here.

348
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:05,910
For each county, each of the 3000 counties.

349
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:14,100
This is the z-score and this is the the P value for that Z score.

350
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:26,520
And if you look at the sea load type, this is the the variable used to visualize here indicating I'm going to sort of say.

351
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:35,000
Definitely see, this is the low, low cluster counties.

352
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:49,090
And then low high cluster the low, high outliers, high low outliers, and then the high, high clusters.

353
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:53,500
So that's what's being symbolized here. When you look at this data.

354
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:58,540
But you can also symbolize these other values as well, if you like.

355
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:06,070
Let's see how those results differ when we change the conceptualization of relationships.

356
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:10,030
So let's go back to our Call Your Processing Tool.

357
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:11,859
And, you know,

358
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:21,970
maybe we're going to push put the number two here is going to create another output feature and we're going to change this to inverse distance.

359
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:26,690
Right. That's what we used last time when we did the global measure.

360
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:40,880
Let's run that analysis again. Okay.

361
00:50:41,930 --> 00:50:48,740
So you see how how different things look depending on the conceptualization of relationships that you use.

362
00:50:51,650 --> 00:51:01,640
Okay. So this this is taking into account all the counties in the United States when it tries to identify these clusters or outliers.

363
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:06,230
Um, and giving less way too far away counties.

364
00:51:06,470 --> 00:51:15,520
Okay. Now, so it's really important in your work to think about this variable or this,

365
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:22,970
this conceptualization here and use use the one you think is correct and defend it somehow.

366
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:28,940
I would not use inverse distance because it doesn't quite make sense to me why lung cancer mortality

367
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:35,629
rates would be affected in Washtenaw County relative to what might be happening in Alaska,

368
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:44,660
for example. There may be some reasons, like we have a shared national policy for tobacco control, but there are so many local variations.

369
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:47,660
I wouldn't really think about it that way.

370
00:51:48,410 --> 00:51:52,720
I would look at more local areas when I calculate the statistics.

371
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:58,100
If you have your hand on that as well, I know that it gives less weight.

372
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:03,890
The further away. Is that like I'm growing mentally last week or is it like wait for the ones that touch on that?

373
00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:08,270
But that doesn't make sense. I think it's decided through distance.

374
00:52:08,710 --> 00:52:13,640
Yeah. Okay.

375
00:52:13,650 --> 00:52:25,280
So let's talk about the other statistic that 36, which is the hotspot cold spot analysis.

376
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:31,310
So we're going to do the same L.A. here with a different approach.

377
00:52:31,370 --> 00:52:39,800
Right. So we're going to not we're going to use the C type hotspot analysis from the command line.

378
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:50,080
And we're going to do the same use the same data.

379
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:16,970
We're going to start with contiguous edges and corners and then for the soft potential where the Frye falls discovery rate.

380
00:53:30,950 --> 00:53:35,540
So here it's just hotspots and cold spots and not any outliers.

381
00:53:36,170 --> 00:53:40,800
So if you don't care about outliers, don't run. The local Marines are okay.

382
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:45,320
If you just take care about hot spots and cold spots. Run the statistic instead.

383
00:53:45,950 --> 00:53:52,190
And here it is more easy to kind of understand. The bluer values are cold spots.

384
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:55,940
The darker red values are hotspots.

385
00:53:56,060 --> 00:54:03,620
And there is some gradation or degree of hot spot of hot spot that's given to in the output.

386
00:54:04,430 --> 00:54:12,080
Okay. So the beige ones are not significantly higher or lower than their surrounding communities.

387
00:54:14,870 --> 00:54:29,419
Similarly, you can look at the attribute table here and you get a gi z-score p value and the number of neighbors that were looked at in the analysis.

388
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:41,960
So there are six neighbors here in the bin, meaning the of the seven levels in the data which was level that county belonged to.

389
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:50,440
So the blue areas is that there's clustering there, but it's like lower clustering.

390
00:54:50,650 --> 00:54:54,400
Yeah. So these are considered areas that are low.

391
00:54:54,760 --> 00:55:01,330
Lung cancer mortality. Kennedy's surrounded by other lung lung cancer mortality killings.

392
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:10,120
So it's a cluster. Yeah, but you don't get any outlier information there that if there are little counties surrounded by high counties,

393
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:19,400
you won't get that with this analysis. So those with contiguous edges and corners.

394
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:25,880
Let's change this to inverse distance and see what the map looks like there.

395
00:55:29,250 --> 00:55:37,310
Not to put a number two after the output feature class name because we have a new feature class that's going to be created.

396
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:53,430
So here we get dramatically different results when he is inverse distance.

397
00:55:54,490 --> 00:55:59,830
So I suggest sticking with contiguous edges and corners for for most of your analysis,

398
00:55:59,830 --> 00:56:09,490
unless you are looking at, you know, small areas, it's in small geographical units within those areas.

399
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:22,900
Okay. Now let's talk about we can you can practice after we finish,

400
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:32,620
but let's do one more activity and then you can generate these statistics for a specific state where each race, gender, etc.

401
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:38,410
Which is number nine in this exercise. Let's look at this idea of incremental spatial autocorrelation.

402
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:48,700
Okay. So let's say you are not really sure which conceptualization of spatial relationships to look at to identify here.

403
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:53,220
So I suggest using a fixed distance band. Right.

404
00:56:53,230 --> 00:56:57,340
But what distance band should I use to figure that out?

405
00:56:58,630 --> 00:57:01,970
We're going to use the incremental spatial and a correlation tool.

406
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:35,770
So let's try incremental. It's incremental spatial and a correlation and generally is lung cancer mortality through input field.

407
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:44,500
Our wm00 scores are a four and we're going to say, well, let's run.

408
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:50,560
How many distance spans? 30 different calculations of this statistic.

409
00:57:51,610 --> 00:58:01,300
And we're going to start with the the distance of 40000 to 40000 meters.

410
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:14,800
So it's 40 kilometers. Right. And we're going to go up by, what, ten kilometers in every distance?

411
00:58:15,070 --> 00:58:19,750
So that's 10,000 meters. Euclidean distance.

412
00:58:20,350 --> 00:58:27,460
Yeah, I don't think I projected this data. So it should be in meters, seven feet.

413
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:35,680
So let's do an output table. We'll call it incremental spatial auto.

414
00:58:56,470 --> 00:59:03,480
I see. I think we're going to do it just for. We're going to do it just for Michigan.

415
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:10,260
So let's put the mindset of the U.S. And then for the record, we're going to call it the same thing.

416
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:26,020
So since we're going to use Michigan, we need to select Michigan.

417
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:45,510
Celtics. Okay.

418
00:59:46,860 --> 00:59:51,630
And once you had Michigan Counties selected and all of the SEC push run.

419
00:59:54,720 --> 01:00:04,410
And what we'll do is we'll give you a message is here with the results through the table with the results and a report with the results.

420
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:15,720
So let's just I guess let's just look at the report.

421
01:00:16,470 --> 01:00:20,240
So go to your folder for this project.

422
01:00:24,810 --> 01:00:32,950
It's incremental spatial auto am I should be their PDF file and double click that.

423
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:41,360
We will see this report. Well.

424
01:00:44,010 --> 01:00:52,770
So what this is telling us, it's flooding the distances and the X axis and the Z score values in no by axis.

425
01:00:53,310 --> 01:00:54,600
And you're looking for peaks.

426
01:00:56,040 --> 01:01:03,990
The peaks indicate the distance at which you're going to observe the highest level of clustering in the attribute data that you're looking at.

427
01:01:04,830 --> 01:01:18,270
So this is telling us there's a peak at the peak about 60,000 meters, which is 60 kilometers and 100,000 meters, 400 kilometers.

428
01:01:19,230 --> 01:01:27,360
So you can look at the table here and you can see that's the z-score and the P value for 60.

429
01:01:27,870 --> 01:01:36,570
And it's of a peak. Right. And then there's another peak that starts emerging further and it peaks a 100,000.

430
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:51,240
So you could use 100,000 meters as a fixed distance band when you call calculate the local Morandi statistic for for.

431
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:55,520
For Michigan. Okay.

432
01:01:57,690 --> 01:02:06,090
So when you do this type of work, you're doing clustering analysis in your in your final project, do the incremental work more inside.

433
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:15,630
First, choose a fixed distance spend based on those results and then and then apply that to your local test.

434
01:02:16,470 --> 01:02:20,970
Let's say you don't find any clustering, but there are no peaks, right?

435
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:28,560
That probably means that you do find that there is clustering, but you don't find a peak.

436
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:30,090
Then you have to.

437
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:37,080
I would revert back to contiguous edges in corners or some other conceptualization that makes sense to you for your research question.

438
01:02:39,390 --> 01:02:45,200
Um, so you can, you can run this again and we can do it for the are the states.

439
01:02:45,210 --> 01:02:55,680
Let's see what we get. So we're going to change my to use this so we can differentiate the reports and the tables.

440
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:07,980
And we're going to do the same number of distance spans.

441
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:17,400
You know, assuming kept the issue with the Mexican border, Michigan is the counties are pretty homogeneous in their size.

442
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:23,070
But if you start looking at the whole country to go further west, things get a little bit messy.

443
01:03:23,850 --> 01:03:26,970
So that's going to create a problem. But let's see what happens.

444
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:33,720
Okay. So we may you may need to adjust the distance beginning in the bands.

445
01:03:34,050 --> 01:03:37,950
They may need to be a little larger because we have such large counties over here,

446
01:03:37,950 --> 01:03:48,660
like here for San Bernardino County, you know, this is much bigger than 60 kilometers or 100 kilometers.

447
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:18,940
Okay. So here we're not seeing any peaks, but we knew from the global test that there is there are clusters in the United States.

448
01:04:19,750 --> 01:04:22,780
It is not we're just not clear so far where the peak is.

449
01:04:24,430 --> 01:04:33,610
So maybe we need to do, you know, look further down in terms of the distance bands.

450
01:04:34,210 --> 01:04:40,120
Maybe we want to do more increments instead of 30 to 60 and see what what we find a peak.

451
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:44,260
If you don't ever find a peak, I would revert back to what I said earlier.

452
01:04:44,740 --> 01:04:51,610
Use a conceptually driven method of examining the relationships either contiguous edges in

453
01:04:51,610 --> 01:04:56,020
corners or some other method that you think is appropriate for your research question.

454
01:04:57,490 --> 01:05:06,910
The other thing I tell people is you can use the average size of counties and it gets harder to do that when the the polygons are not the same size.

455
01:05:07,140 --> 01:05:11,710
Okay. So that's the problem with the whole U.S. Okay.

456
01:05:12,820 --> 01:05:18,920
Any questions or thoughts? Okay.

457
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:28,020
I ask that you all try to incorporate some of this clustering work in your final papers, if that makes sense to you.

458
01:05:28,110 --> 01:05:32,770
I think it makes sense for almost all of you to see if you can do that.

459
01:05:32,820 --> 01:05:40,800
It's not a requirement if you feel like it adds to something you're examining that would be great at that leads to a global test.

460
01:05:41,790 --> 01:05:42,120
Right.

461
01:05:42,750 --> 01:05:51,330
Because that will give you an indication if there is actually any difference in terms of your attribute data across the the regions you're looking at.

462
01:05:51,660 --> 01:05:57,270
Because conflict maps are nice, but they don't really tell you much more about the degree of difference.

463
01:06:00,210 --> 01:06:08,670
All right. So I suggest you practice some of this stuff with other states.

464
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:20,340
You know, I mean, I guess maybe run to the hot spot called spot analysis for another state instead of just go to the local Morenci statistic,

465
01:06:21,090 --> 01:06:25,829
maybe try four different variables in the same state race,

466
01:06:25,830 --> 01:06:29,520
gender variables, alcohol and cancer mortality,

467
01:06:29,970 --> 01:06:35,010
and then see if you can play around with the incremental on of correlation tool

468
01:06:35,010 --> 01:06:40,560
for a specific state and see if that helps guide your your local testing work.

469
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:48,660
You can do that for I think the next I'd say.

470
01:06:51,460 --> 01:06:59,680
See Stewart for the next 10 minutes or so, and then we can take a break and then we can come back.

471
01:07:00,310 --> 01:07:06,550
And you work on your final projects, and I'll walk around and answer any questions that you might have with me.

472
01:07:06,850 --> 01:07:18,310
Okay. All right. So let's say Brick starts at 350 and then at 4:00 we're back working on our final projects.

473
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:23,690
Okay. The.

474
01:07:38,470 --> 01:07:41,590
Down the.

475
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:51,030
Right? Yeah. Yeah.

476
01:07:54,200 --> 01:08:08,000
Where were you? There has been a special significance to the.

477
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:11,580
It's also.
