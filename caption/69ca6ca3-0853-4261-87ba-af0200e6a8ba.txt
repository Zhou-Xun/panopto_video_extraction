1
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:32,770
Year. Yeah.

2
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:51,690
Yeah. Yeah, you know. Yeah.

3
00:00:54,730 --> 00:01:08,680
I can't help but wonder out.

4
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:35,170
You did have. So I.

5
00:01:54,280 --> 00:02:12,940
I. I to be.

6
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:51,700
Okay. Good morning.

7
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,840
How is everybody's weekend? The.

8
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,620
It's getting colder. So if you're new, make sure you have your coat.

9
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:12,420
It's going to get cold on you really fast. So welcome back.

10
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:20,100
Today we are going to be discussing process evaluation.

11
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:23,970
This is this loud, really, really loud. Okay. That's what I was thinking.

12
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,500
It feels like to me. I'm.

13
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:39,080
And I know how that might not actually turn it down. See if I do.

14
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:46,750
Oh, I got it. Go.

15
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:50,330
Okay. Is that better?

16
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:57,720
Okay. So today we're going to be talking about process evaluation.

17
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:03,810
This week is really focused on basic.

18
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:11,340
We'll start introducing you to evaluation design.

19
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:18,750
Today we'll be process. And then on Thursday, we'll get into outcome evaluation.

20
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:25,590
The way we talk about outcome. It will look different than the way we talk about process,

21
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:32,070
in part because of what process evaluation can do versus what outcome evaluation is meant to do.

22
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:44,790
Namely, outcome evaluation is meant to document change so that the designs that we talk about on Thursday and subsequently will be a little bit.

23
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:52,940
We'll be closer, I guess if you've ever had research designed two things you're used to seeing, like pretest, post-test.

24
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:58,740
Um. But process evaluation is really not meant to document change.

25
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:06,480
So today what I will do is offer you a framework that has different elements or dimensions

26
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:12,060
of you will a process that will be helpful as you go about developing your plan.

27
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:23,980
So announcements. If you were just sitting in front of canvas this weekend or your email because you love school,

28
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:35,710
we or I rather decided to revise the evaluation plan assignment two, which is the data collection plan.

29
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:39,250
I want it to. There was a gap, I guess,

30
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:48,400
in sections that I wanted to close because the data collection plan was really just focused on the data collection and the design.

31
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:55,890
And I wanted to. Allow you to be able to get feedback on.

32
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:00,559
That particular on the purpose as well as the question.

33
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:10,340
So that section was added, but in return I took away the requirement to actually have an instrument that you designed so that,

34
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:16,190
you know, I'll just say in advance that if you had started designing an instrument, I apologize.

35
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:25,770
But I'm guessing there probably weren't a lot of groups, if any, that actually had got that far into the assignment.

36
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:32,660
So that's the trade off. You have to, but you are going to need to do the purpose and the questions anyway.

37
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:36,900
So now you get to get graded for that and have something taken away.

38
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:47,120
And I hope that the revision will actually make the expectations for that part of the asylum or

39
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:54,170
that assignment slash that part of the plan be a little bit clearer in terms of expectations.

40
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:59,660
So if you have any concerns, please feel free to let myself or Hannah know.

41
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:07,940
Speaking of Hannah, she is. She's changed her office hours for this week.

42
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:14,570
I can't remember all hand, which I think she changed into Wednesday, but that's just for this week.

43
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:21,290
I would strongly just encourage you to use her as a resource if you can't, you know, for instance,

44
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:28,700
come to my office hours or you want to, you know, for whatever reason, work with a student.

45
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,810
She's. She's on top of things. I'm really excited.

46
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:42,580
This this is again what makes me and there we were reviewing the graving for the logic model assignment and her comments were just like.

47
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:49,890
Chef's kiss. So. So I encourage you to use her as a resource again.

48
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:56,780
You know, she's got background. She actually works more in health care than I do.

49
00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:04,139
I do kind of overarching human services, social services bent to my evaluation.

50
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:08,520
But she works a lot in health care. So just a different setting.

51
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:13,500
So I again, encourage you to use her as a resource.

52
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:19,890
You know, if you have any questions, feel free to run it by her. And if she doesn't know the answer, she always runs it by me.

53
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:25,500
And then speaking of logic models, we are pretty much finished,

54
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:32,640
so we should have the grading for the logic models out now if they haven't been released yet.

55
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:37,850
We only met yesterday, so I don't. She was almost done. And then.

56
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:44,200
Yeah. So any questions about any assignments or.

57
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:51,600
Yes. Yes.

58
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,740
Yeah. We'll account it. I don't understand why I came, as does this.

59
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:03,050
If it makes you put them in the group and it doesn't account.

60
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,990
Forgot about this because again, I hadn't used canvas in years.

61
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:15,380
It I don't know why it doesn't acknowledge the groups like for the gray but but you know we will account for that in the back end.

62
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:22,010
Any other questions? All right.

63
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:31,010
So we'll jump in. So just, you know, last week we talked about purpose Tuesday.

64
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:42,320
You know, we, you know, talked about purpose statements and how they should include elements like the decisions being made and the decision makers.

65
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:46,640
On Thursday, we talked about strong evaluation questions.

66
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:53,900
So when we're thinking about strong evaluation questions, they should consider merit worth and significance.

67
00:09:56,130 --> 00:10:07,800
You know, they're about taking action. So, you know, those are three aspects of assessment, if you will, that you should consider.

68
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:16,199
They should be specific, relevant and answerable, you know, and answerable has something to do with feasibility as well.

69
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,230
Can you feasibly conduct this evaluation?

70
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:27,840
If we're applicable, they should reflect components and relationships in the logic model.

71
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:36,930
So, you know, the slides, you know, really kind of dug down into relationships between different variables.

72
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:45,270
So wherever possible, where you have a logic model, really use that to help build your evaluation questions.

73
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:52,229
And then finally, depending on the approach you're taking, consider equity,

74
00:10:52,230 --> 00:11:01,200
cultural responsiveness and community engagement to ensure that the action that you are taking at the end of the project or during the medal,

75
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:09,420
if you will, are actually making the world a better place, a more socially just place.

76
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:18,030
So as I mentioned at the beginning, we're talking about process evaluation.

77
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:22,770
Um, generally process evaluations are going to be exploratory.

78
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:27,180
And that is in contrast to what you'll see on Thursday,

79
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:38,489
where you might have an experimental design that helps with causation or determining causation or even the quasi experimental design,

80
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:41,970
which again, helps with causation. But the.

81
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:49,830
Process evaluations are really not about determining if a cost be.

82
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:55,350
They're really not able in themselves to be able to answer those kinds of questions.

83
00:11:56,610 --> 00:12:10,200
What they're what they are is they're meant to monitor a program, and they are descriptive to help you assess the services provided in a program.

84
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:19,170
And services can be broad, as well as basically how satisfied key stakeholders are with the services provided.

85
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:30,710
So again, we're thinking about this objective measure of what happened, and then we have a subjective measure of how the people feel about it.

86
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:39,380
And just so you know, sometimes I throw these questions at the bottom of slides.

87
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,490
Reflective questions. So you're going back and studying might be helpful to think through.

88
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:58,280
You know, as the goal here states, they're meant to document or record program activities and outputs.

89
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:06,280
So that's where they sit. If you're looking at a logic model and also inputs, they can also include inputs.

90
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:19,330
But ultimately it's about documenting whether a program has been implemented as intended, that it is intended.

91
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:33,120
In some ways it's something that. You can take or leave because sometimes you might have a program like, say, for example,

92
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:40,500
a pilot and you might have a pilot study or a pilot program and you might not have.

93
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:52,000
A super, you know, very detailed way that or plan for implementing that program so you can still use process evaluation.

94
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:59,800
But the idea then is that you are doing more of an open ended documentation of the process of the program.

95
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:06,880
And they're often process evaluations are often paired with outcome evaluations.

96
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:14,500
Because really they help complement the results of the outcome evaluation.

97
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:25,520
They work very well together, as I've mentioned in the past. Again, the outcome evaluations are about documenting change and and measuring change.

98
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:31,700
And so what a process evaluation can do in conjunction with the outcome evaluation

99
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:38,420
is to help distinguish why what might be the cause of the outcomes you're seeing.

100
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:50,810
So for example, if you run a program and that program is meant to promote, you know, safer sex behavior and youth, my favorite example.

101
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:57,620
But no one engages in safer sex.

102
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:02,530
This has happened to me. This is why I'm standing here. Because that's what I learned.

103
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:10,050
That sometimes that happens. A process evaluation can really help distinguish the causes.

104
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:19,140
Was it that the program was a bad idea or was it a good idea that could not reach the standard for implementation that was set?

105
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:33,170
Um. You know, and an important thing about process evaluations is or just a kind of an important thing to know is that they are systematic.

106
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:40,010
Mean. I think probably many of us who have been in the practice world before have had the

107
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:47,720
experience of either running a program or seeing a program be implemented and said,

108
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:54,320
oh, that's not working. I bet it's because of this or I think it's because of this.

109
00:15:54,890 --> 00:16:06,590
And I mentioned that one of the reasons why I do evaluation is that I was running a pure health education program to reduce sexual risk behavior.

110
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:10,490
And one of my peer educators.

111
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:20,600
16 became pregnant during during her time as a peer educator.

112
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:25,639
And I'm not saying that I'm not chuckling in a judgmental way, but it was obvious sign.

113
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:31,010
But it didn't work, at least for her. So the question is why?

114
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:36,730
I have, you know, my ideas about context, but how do I really know that it was the context?

115
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:45,410
I've always felt like, you know, we we were missing some important contextual factors and how we prepared our health educators.

116
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:52,040
But I really don't know that I because I didn't engage in any kind of process evaluation to see.

117
00:16:53,240 --> 00:17:01,490
Could have been context could could maybe are materials that we use to train our peer health educators where they're

118
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:12,050
engaging to the students because we don't know it's hard to make adjustments to a program that are informed.

119
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:20,660
We can adjust all day, but a process evaluation is really going to help us be able to do that work in a systematic manner.

120
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:29,150
To have a pretty good guess with evidence that these are the changes that we might need to make in this program.

121
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:39,780
When we're thinking about when to implement a process evaluation.

122
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:43,500
You know, we've seen this this particular slide before.

123
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:52,860
Ideally, we're going to implement process evaluation during a program's implementation.

124
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:04,090
And we do that because it helps mitigate biases like recall bias.

125
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:12,390
Because I you know a person who is implementing in that in the moment.

126
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:21,400
Is able to kind of quickly recall what happened yesterday versus if we implement a process evaluation afterwards,

127
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:27,130
we might be asking them to recall something that happened six months ago.

128
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:33,160
So ideally, we're going to do a process evaluation during it all.

129
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:42,610
It's also beneficial to do it during program implementation because it also allows for observation of.

130
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:47,030
A holistic picture of program implementation.

131
00:18:48,350 --> 00:19:00,890
You know, once I as an evaluator can't observe what's going on, I'm relying only on the types of questions I ask.

132
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:05,390
I'm only relying on what people recall.

133
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:11,930
So ideally, again, it's best if you can implement.

134
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:20,520
A process of evaluation during a program, but they can be conducted afterwards.

135
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:29,729
So this isn't to say that if you are coming in as an evaluator or or if you're on the other side

136
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:35,580
and you're commissioning commissioning an evaluation on the back end or the end of a program.

137
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,750
That you're out of luck.

138
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:49,580
You can actually still do a process evaluation, but you just need to be aware of the threats and to the conclusions that you make,

139
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,870
any limitations to the conclusions that you make or the findings you have.

140
00:19:55,070 --> 00:20:03,050
You can also plan for a process evaluation before a program is being implemented.

141
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:12,440
Say, for example, you you're brought in at the very beginning with an agency.

142
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:18,230
They're, you know, maybe they've gotten a grant, maybe they're applying for a grant,

143
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:24,500
and they want to be able to include process evaluation in the grant application.

144
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:35,780
You can do that. And if need be, you can adjust the plan once you get into implementation, right?

145
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:42,830
So you might find that, oh, we shouldn't, you know, maybe we should actually ask participants about satisfaction.

146
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:52,459
You can do that. The idea again is that when you are doing any type of evaluation and you make changes to the plan,

147
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:58,490
that you're justifying the reasons because again, that work should be systematic.

148
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:06,469
So there needs to be a good reason other than I think it's interesting or I just really want to make more money.

149
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:12,380
So I'm going to add another piece of evaluation or data collection on to this this plan.

150
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:22,800
So as I said, you know, with respect to process evaluation and with respect to outcome evaluation,

151
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:31,200
it's great to do a process evaluation either before or during the outcome evaluation.

152
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:38,840
And then it went in with it comes to like, well, why would I do a process evaluation?

153
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:45,290
Some other purposes it might address assessing therapeutic activities.

154
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:54,320
And when I say fair and I know I use that a lot. The idea of therapeutic versus operational.

155
00:21:54,710 --> 00:22:03,170
What I'm trying to do is emphasize is that there are some activities and some well,

156
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:12,170
there are some program activities that are really meant to elicit the change in behavior or change in attitudes are changing conditions.

157
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:15,200
Those are the activities that I'm referring to.

158
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:27,680
Um, so maybe you want to know, okay, we've implemented this program and we've added this component that's,

159
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:32,810
you know, meant to elicit further change or increase change.

160
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:41,480
That's when you can use a program or process evaluation to be able to document what that looks like.

161
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:47,870
Maybe you have two approaches to practice. So one modality versus another.

162
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:55,940
Maybe you have a program where, um. One version of it is on the web.

163
00:22:56,270 --> 00:23:01,690
One of it. One version or virtual. One version is in person.

164
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:07,390
And a process evaluation can be useful to be able to document.

165
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:11,790
Okay. What what did the implementation of these look like?

166
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:15,680
So that if you see a difference between the programs.

167
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:27,030
You can also look to see was it the modality or was it the way those modalities were implemented?

168
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:34,180
For example. So I might find. So if you're for example, if you were my online class.

169
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:40,080
In. You can look back at the first day, which was an absolute hot mess in terms of technology.

170
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:46,410
And I think it was horrible. It was horrible. But that doesn't mean that online teaching is horrible.

171
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:51,690
It just meant that the person implementing it that day was not doing very good with technology.

172
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:53,970
And then finally,

173
00:23:53,970 --> 00:24:02,970
you might want to do a process evaluation when you want to gain some knowledge about what specific processes led to specific outcomes.

174
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:09,420
Because what a process evaluation can do is help document things like.

175
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:17,550
You know, to what extent did participants respond to specific activities?

176
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,200
And that will help you understand. Okay.

177
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:31,460
Maybe it was this component that they responded to in Van that elicited this specific change in behavior or this specific change in attitude.

178
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:48,450
Yes. It really feels like.

179
00:24:54,130 --> 00:25:07,780
Like. In some cases like.

180
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:24,840
I. Yeah.

181
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:35,780
So if you if you come here, the example was giving in, you know, giving a tap on the hand because you did not follow the script.

182
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:41,750
She she didn't follow the script of. I'm sorry.

183
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:45,260
She is over. I thought she was fine.

184
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:50,940
Okay. I'm. I'm still okay, though.

185
00:25:54,530 --> 00:26:03,620
So didn't follow the script of an intervention that was written to be implemented exactly as it was written.

186
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:07,730
And then she deviated from the script to.

187
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:13,500
To respond to questions that you had actually given.

188
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:20,490
And so kind of where so it's a question more about like where, where with a process evaluation fit within that.

189
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:26,130
Yeah. So one thing we're going to talk about in a second is fidelity.

190
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:35,250
And so fidelity in fidelity basically means sticking to the script.

191
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:39,410
That's. That's essentially what it means. Um.

192
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:48,630
Sometimes that's important, sometimes it's not. We don't know until we actually do a process evaluation to see.

193
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:53,860
For example, the session that you led. I mean, I'm not going to lie.

194
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:56,140
I'm not. I will deviate from the script to.

195
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:06,120
And it might be that the outcomes that the youth you facilitated are the same as the ones that followed the script.

196
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:10,410
So now we know that the script.

197
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:17,299
Maybe that's not as important as we thought it was. Maybe there might be.

198
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:20,910
Other factors were poor building. There might be.

199
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:29,630
It might be important to follow the content logic of the script, but not necessarily the specific wording of the script.

200
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:34,250
So, yes, a process evaluation could help kind of give insight into that.

201
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:39,589
And if you're you know, if you facilitated programs before, that can be really helpful then,

202
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:43,340
though, because then I can though I can understand better.

203
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:52,280
Yes. If I deviate from the script, I have to make sure I still hit on this subject or this piece of content somewhere in here.

204
00:27:54,030 --> 00:28:02,030
So yeah, I think that's a great example and. A great example of how of why a process of valuation is helpful.

205
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:09,790
And so what processes are we actually talking about?

206
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:17,030
We're talking about the activities and characteristics that describe how a program operates.

207
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:27,170
So, for example, you know, the center of it is that program or practice, whatever the lip service delivery system we have.

208
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:43,830
Then we know that there are aspects of the agency that or organization that the program is in that have important processes.

209
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:48,660
How many resources is a great example? What resources were provided?

210
00:28:49,860 --> 00:29:00,830
And then we're also talking about the context, the community in which this program or communities that this program is taking place.

211
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:07,530
So not just a geographic community, but it could be a social identity community.

212
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:13,710
It could be. A community of practice.

213
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:21,180
So there's number there's a number of communities that could be considered when we start thinking about context.

214
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:28,210
So here are some examples of potential measurements of process.

215
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:35,620
And just note that these are evaluation questions or you know, they are.

216
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:42,890
They aren't necessarily the answers. You want to come out of an evaluation question.

217
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:47,750
They're measurements that you might take as part of a process evaluation.

218
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:55,190
So, for example, you might want to measure the number of people receiving services.

219
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:59,420
This is generally one that you're going to want to always have.

220
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:06,690
Economic status and racial ethnic background of people receiving services.

221
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:11,740
This is another one that is typically common.

222
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:17,350
The actual events that occur while the services are being delivered.

223
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,749
Another common one,

224
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:32,630
the number of activities and meetings or I'm actually I'm put on both them because there's very similar the number of training sessions conducted.

225
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:40,040
So these are typically the kinds of you know, these are things that you would want to.

226
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:44,960
Measure when you're going about a process evaluation.

227
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:56,760
And we'll talk about this more in future units. But process evaluations can incorporate both quantitative and qualitative the data collection,

228
00:30:57,390 --> 00:31:02,390
whether it's surveys and assessments, interviews, observations, etc.

229
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:13,970
So now that I've given you an overview of process evaluation, when we do it, I'll finish my sentence.

230
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:19,790
I see you're here. But we'll talk about these key concerns.

231
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:23,960
So I have a question. Was one of the questions on the floor is about.

232
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:29,450
There was process evaluation, but it was like an evaluation that.

233
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:35,460
Works. And.

234
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:43,830
Why they would be. Like how would.

235
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:49,790
Lots of. Yeah.

236
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:53,940
And I have a feeling somebody is going to bring up the quiz. That's why I had the quiz open on my iPad.

237
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:04,320
So the question was what type of evaluation within the value ater conduct?

238
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:09,930
If the client wanted to better understand and the client being the evaluation client,

239
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:16,440
which drop, which youth drop in center locations were most intended and why?

240
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:21,300
And so your question was about the like why with the.

241
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:31,460
The why be part of the process evaluation. I guess it just seemed like it was evaluating, like the outcome, like the program.

242
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:39,700
And then, of course, the process. Yeah.

243
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:49,690
So the reason why. So again, what lo what locate center locations were most attended and why?

244
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:58,480
Um. In part it falls in process because it's about the implementation and that really kind of is the I mean,

245
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:02,070
I say in part, but in many ways that's what drive,

246
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:05,290
that's what drives it being a process evaluation,

247
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:14,710
because it's really about an aspect of the implementation of the service versus thinking about the change that's supposed to be a list of it.

248
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:20,840
So. You know, part of it also has to do with what?

249
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:36,870
I don't want to make it too complicated, but. It's also defined by with respect to the questions that you have and the purpose of the intervention.

250
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:41,100
So. Right. The assumption of this question is that.

251
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:45,580
The change you're trying to elicit is not increase.

252
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:50,290
It's not about how many people attend the youth centers, right?

253
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:54,580
It's about the services that are provided at the youth center.

254
00:33:57,050 --> 00:34:07,700
So if we're thinking like in this frame of like our health promotion programs, which are typically individual level or community level programs,

255
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:14,480
the change they're meant to elicit happens in the individual or the community in the people.

256
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:21,390
So really the center is about, okay, where's the best way to our place?

257
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:24,390
Rather, where's the best place to deliver these services?

258
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:29,460
And so there might be something that we need to know about the difference to the centers.

259
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:36,870
It might be transit is a transportation, it might be parking, it might be the people who staff the centers.

260
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:42,910
All of that has to go. Hat is helpful to consider.

261
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:50,850
When we're talking about. The program or the change that we actually want to see in the youth.

262
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:59,750
And the reason why I say I didn't want to make it too complicated is because when you get kind of higher,

263
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:06,620
higher into the ecological model, there might be some programs that are actually designed specifically to.

264
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:17,310
To. You know, operate like if it's a systems change intervention, it might actually be operating for that to be an outcome.

265
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:24,720
But in the framing of this question, it's really it's or the frame of this course, rather, it's really about.

266
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,650
Why didn't you care about that center?

267
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:37,450
You know, why are they going there to receive services versus somewhere else that they help answer the question and make it more complicated?

268
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:43,030
Yeah. So it's an outcome evaluation because the outcome will be about what the outcome of the program.

269
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:49,870
What? Yeah. Yeah.

270
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:57,320
So I'm in and I started to put a logic model in here just to be able to.

271
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:06,380
There's another sly. I don't know if you remember. I've shown a slide with Matt.

272
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:10,780
Should I put it in there? It's like it. It's all.

273
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:14,379
It's white and black, and it has a basic logic model,

274
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:22,210
but it shows that some of those boxes are related to performance and some of them are related to effectiveness.

275
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:27,550
And so. Process is really focused on performance.

276
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:32,110
What was the performance of the program activities?

277
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:39,450
And then they're used to answer to kind of inform the effectiveness.

278
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:48,059
But you know, again, I think it's a good question because, again,

279
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:57,090
I can't stress enough that you really do have to think about this in conjunction with who's the subject of the program,

280
00:36:57,090 --> 00:37:10,530
who's met who, who are we operating on, whether it's a person or a city or a system like an educational system that has to be clear in your

281
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:16,650
head in order to be able to decide what's part of a process and what's part of an outcome evaluation.

282
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:29,060
So key concerns. There's different ways of thinking about, okay, well,

283
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:37,820
there could be 50 million processes related to operation of our program or the implementation of our program.

284
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:41,150
How do I know where that concentrate my efforts?

285
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:52,020
Or even how do I organize all of that into a functional, useful framework?

286
00:37:52,980 --> 00:38:05,520
So I like this framework that's offered by Sanders et al all or whatever, which is really specifically designed for health promotion programs.

287
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:13,710
And it focuses on seven elements of process that you can.

288
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:20,540
Account for either and part or all as part of a process evaluation.

289
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:27,950
And so those are fidelity. Delivered those received participant satisfaction.

290
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:33,950
Reach. Recruitment and context. And so we'll spend the rest of the class kind of going through that.

291
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:41,470
So we'll start with fidelity. And this was getting to your question.

292
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:50,800
So fidelity is the extent to which the intervention was implemented as planned or how will that program implementation follow protocol?

293
00:38:53,200 --> 00:39:00,520
And a variation of that that I actually I don't put on this slide because it's not part of the framework but.

294
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:09,590
Because I always have to. You know, push for what I think should be versus.

295
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:16,530
Just what is a variation that you might see of that is fidelity and adaptation.

296
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:28,170
The adaptation part is often omit it when you you expect or what you expect that there might be some

297
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:35,850
changes to a program and it allows you just to be in terms of responding to evaluation questions,

298
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:40,020
allowing you to be a little bit more open about what you might find.

299
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:47,980
And so. In this case, adaptation is really about what changes were made and why.

300
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:56,240
But if we're going to, you know, strictly think about Sonders framework, it's about fidelity.

301
00:39:56,260 --> 00:40:05,410
How was it planned to be implemented? And some examples of evaluation questions that you might answer in this area.

302
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:11,650
Oh, sorry, I. Fidelity.

303
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:24,250
The program. For the evaluation of. Does that mean automatically?

304
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:30,180
Or is it a. That and that.

305
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:37,200
Yes. So the question is. So if you're just focusing on fidelity, if a program does make changes,

306
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:45,450
does that mean they kind of get a fail because they implement it as planned in some some use of this.

307
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:55,380
Yes. Concept. That's why the adaptation got added because of the concerns that, you know, have it when programs were being considered.

308
00:40:56,450 --> 00:41:03,890
As implemented badly because they were adjusting to the specific contextual needs of that audience.

309
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:10,010
But then when that information and again, I think remember, the evaluation is political.

310
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:15,890
So if you say a program failed because they changed the script, because you've answered questions.

311
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:20,410
That might that might mean that a program doesn't get funding next year.

312
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:27,040
So adaptation was incorporated to account for that.

313
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:32,100
Because, you know, there are good reasons sometimes that people change.

314
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:38,880
There's bad reasons. Sometimes people change as well. They don't they're not prepared.

315
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:45,470
They didn't even bother to pick up the curriculum or understand the theory behind it.

316
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:50,150
So, you know, you do have to consider those factors as well.

317
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:59,270
But sometimes there are good reasons for changing a program and that modification to the term allows.

318
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:05,910
Especially like in the bigger picture of negotiating this stuff with funders.

319
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:18,100
So evaluation questions that this my answer. To what extent was the intervention implemented consistently with the underlying theory?

320
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:22,330
So say I have a social cognitive theory, but.

321
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:30,570
Now, that's a theory that has too many constructs, like you can borrow anything, anything could be social cognitive there.

322
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:34,120
So let me say health belief.

323
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:38,810
Let's go with health belief because I don't think there's an if I recall correctly, there's no intention and health belief.

324
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:47,179
You can't do it or you're not. So if I'm you know I have an intervention with that's helpful help believe model

325
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:53,720
driven and after some intention activities in there to elicit intention well.

326
00:42:56,210 --> 00:43:01,120
I haven't stuck with the theory. So that will help answer that question.

327
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:12,280
And you know, in terms of taking action, that might help me to know, do I need to consider other or incorporate other theories?

328
00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:18,750
In this in the creation or revision of this program.

329
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:28,380
Another question I might ask or ask in this area, to what extent was training provided this plant?

330
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:32,890
So they might help me from an action perspective. No.

331
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:38,470
Um. Are more resources needed for training.

332
00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:48,280
Could we have done the training for less expensive cost, or does it need to be a more expensive cost?

333
00:43:48,850 --> 00:44:00,730
So you know how looking at fidelity, how a program is implemented is helpful in knowing what's important to make sure we include.

334
00:44:04,870 --> 00:44:15,190
In the protocol, that is. So the next element is dose delivered and dose deliver is.

335
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:24,110
This. When I talk about the next one, the next one will kind of feel like output related.

336
00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:34,300
This one is activities related. So it's really focused on the staff and how what what they delivered in the intervention.

337
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:40,240
So it includes the amount or number of intended units of intervention delivered.

338
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:49,660
Some questions that you might ask. To what extent were all of the intended units or components of the intervention provided to participants?

339
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:58,810
So that's something that can help you understand what needs to be delivered to participants.

340
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:10,500
Another question you might ask. To what extent were the materials that were designed for use in the intervention used?

341
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:12,049
So again,

342
00:45:12,050 --> 00:45:21,950
this is thinking about dose and dose is important because that tells us how much of the program do we have to deliver to see a therapeutic effect.

343
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:29,990
So if I were pairing it with an outcome evaluation, which that is a good question to pair with outcome evaluation,

344
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:38,000
one thing I might seek to understand is that OC group a receive 12 hours of intervention.

345
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:42,410
Group B received 8 hours of intervention.

346
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:47,610
What's the difference in their outcomes? That can help me understand.

347
00:45:47,970 --> 00:45:51,570
Okay. Well, maybe I'm. I can get away with doing eight.

348
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:56,310
That's either doing it more cheaply. Doing it more often.

349
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:04,300
Or do I have to have 12? Hours of instruction.

350
00:46:06,850 --> 00:46:09,910
Then the flip side of the coin of this is dose received.

351
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:15,910
So this is more focused on participants and it refers to the extent to which

352
00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:21,640
participants actively engage with and use materials and resources from the intervention.

353
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:30,520
So some example questions to what extent were all of the intended methods, strategies and or activities used?

354
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:37,200
To what extent were participants who were present at intervention activities engaged?

355
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:46,790
And, you know, we can observe this, you know, through surveys, through actual observations, through interviews.

356
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:54,830
But the idea is what we really want to understand is what did participants receive?

357
00:46:56,090 --> 00:46:59,760
And it's it can be measured objectively.

358
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:07,790
So I can sit there and see or, you know, I might have some other form of data that says objectively,

359
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:17,300
I know that participants received this these materials or these resources from the intervention.

360
00:47:17,930 --> 00:47:22,520
But I can also look at those received from a subjective perspective.

361
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:29,350
Our participation. You know what? To what extent do participants actually perceive what they receive?

362
00:47:31,830 --> 00:47:38,580
You know, I'm I, you know, thinking about this local example right here, I'm I think I'm giving you,

363
00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:45,750
you know, points A, B, C and D, but you only say that you received A and D.

364
00:47:48,590 --> 00:47:52,070
Why is that important? Well, might be because.

365
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:59,100
I went through B and C really quickly. Or maybe you were so eager to leave.

366
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:02,880
You just forgot. And I only paid attention when I said last point.

367
00:48:04,290 --> 00:48:15,720
And then you were like, okay, I'm, you know. But the idea, again, is that there might be a gap in between dose delivery and dose received.

368
00:48:16,170 --> 00:48:20,010
And that's going to tell me something again about the process of the program.

369
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:25,660
It could even be something as simple as it was really hot that they deliver B and C.

370
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:31,630
So now no one paid attention because they were so worried about how hot they were in the room.

371
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:59,020
Yes. It's less about the the change that you.

372
00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:03,430
So the question is like so is it kind of like about the knowledge or whatever they receive?

373
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:09,430
It's more about the tangible. Outputs and deliverables that they actually received.

374
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:13,960
So did they receive a book? Like I say, there's like handouts,

375
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:23,080
what handouts that they receive because then that will then be fed into what you are referring to, which are the changes.

376
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:27,220
So changes in attitude, changes and knowledge, etc., etc.

377
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:37,750
I try to divide it into like activities and outputs because the point that I want to emphasize is that.

378
00:49:38,870 --> 00:49:44,420
If you're looking at dose the liver, you're often you're looking at what the staff are doing.

379
00:49:45,570 --> 00:49:51,690
And then when you're looking at dose received, it's really about what the participants have gotten out of it tangibly.

380
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:55,710
So again, hours of instruction.

381
00:49:56,890 --> 00:50:03,090
Workbooks. You know, if they were supposed to get an incentive to participate.

382
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:07,380
What incentives that they receive. Um.

383
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:12,670
You know, because that could be helpful, for example, in knowing.

384
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:19,960
Um. Do? Do we have to give incentives for people to participate?

385
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:31,100
That can tell you something about what resources you need. Does that help distinguish a difference?

386
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:41,060
Again, like the process, evaluation will not measure anything that falls into your short term or long term outcomes.

387
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:55,280
It's kind of the wall, if you will. Yeah.

388
00:50:55,280 --> 00:51:00,620
So the question is, would you ever ask them did they receive other materials, other side of the program?

389
00:51:01,070 --> 00:51:10,780
Yeah. You wouldn't you wouldn't ask it in terms of like if, you know, we want to categorize.

390
00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:17,060
Like you could ask it for a process evaluation, but it actually falls into a different category,

391
00:51:18,890 --> 00:51:22,460
probably either recruitment or context, depending on what you're asking.

392
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:35,160
But. Yeah, um. That is actually something great to always considered like what might what other programs might be operating outside of this program?

393
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:43,680
And this is the exercise that just I realize I did it twice.

394
00:51:46,290 --> 00:51:52,530
So just cross it out. So the fourth one is participant satisfaction.

395
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:59,040
And this is really this is the extent to which participants were satisfied with the intervention itself,

396
00:51:59,490 --> 00:52:02,580
as well as their interactions with program staff.

397
00:52:03,610 --> 00:52:11,170
Anybody who has interacted with anybody for any service knows that staff and the way they interact with you is important.

398
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:18,070
So this is where you're going to capture. This is kind of the category, if you will, that you're going to capture this information in.

399
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:29,300
So a typical question you might see and this that falls under this kind of umbrella,

400
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:33,980
how their participants react to specific aspects of the intervention.

401
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,360
And note that these questions are kind of broad, right?

402
00:52:37,390 --> 00:52:44,590
Remember, when you're writing your evaluation, questions are not meant to be super, super specific, supernatural.

403
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:52,050
You want them to be specific, but you don't want them to be so narrow that the answer is basically like a sentence is not very.

404
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:55,540
You don't want it to be a not informative answer.

405
00:52:56,020 --> 00:52:59,050
But in this case, specific aspects of the intervention.

406
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:08,280
And you can choose the operation, you might operationalize it as you know how they react to the facilitators,

407
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:14,850
how they react to the materials that they were giving, how that they react to the slides.

408
00:53:15,870 --> 00:53:21,630
These are all examples. You might you might find out participant satisfaction by survey.

409
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:27,090
You might learn it by observations or interviews.

410
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:32,520
And this is kind of gets to your question about the quiz question about centers.

411
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:39,970
Part of asking that question about where do kids go is often about satisfaction.

412
00:53:41,210 --> 00:53:48,170
Where do they feel most comfortable? So it doesn't have to be the actual specific wording, satisfaction, the ideas,

413
00:53:48,470 --> 00:53:54,380
how the participants feel about the services or the activities they participated in.

414
00:53:56,570 --> 00:54:05,790
That's really what this is about. And it can be helpful to know that, for example, you might learn, okay,

415
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:13,270
facilitators need to have this background or they need to come from the same communities as the participants do.

416
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:21,549
So answers to this question can be helpful and making sure that your program is implemented

417
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:27,370
in a way that draws participants in and engages them rather than turning them away.

418
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:40,370
The next element is reach. And reach is if you think about reach, how far are you reaching out?

419
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:46,670
It's the degree to which the intended population participated in an intervention.

420
00:54:48,230 --> 00:54:55,700
If any of you have ever worked in health care and used a re aim framework, I see a couple of hints when I say re aim.

421
00:54:56,030 --> 00:55:01,930
It's the same definition of reach. So how far are we?

422
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:05,510
How much are we reaching the people we mean to reach?

423
00:55:06,710 --> 00:55:12,510
So to what extent there are interventions include individuals or groups from our intended population.

424
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:19,520
That could also be answered in thinking about subpopulations or subgroups.

425
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:32,090
You know, if we're thinking about issues of equity and inclusive inclusivity, are we reaching different subgroups within that intended population?

426
00:55:33,490 --> 00:55:44,230
So that can be helpful. Another question we might ask in reference to reach what were barriers to participating for those in our intended population.

427
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:49,340
So note here that the questions almost build on each other.

428
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:55,040
Right? So first, how much did they how much did we include them?

429
00:55:55,610 --> 00:55:59,380
And then if we didn't reach them as we expected.

430
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:10,070
What were the barriers to participating? When we talked about logic modeling first, my handy dandy Pam.

431
00:56:12,450 --> 00:56:16,790
You know, we talked about. It's. It's better to have.

432
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:30,940
To whatever extent you care to have numerical values associated with something like per la blah blah percent of youth.

433
00:56:34,270 --> 00:56:42,410
Engaged. Engage. 40 hours plus in the program.

434
00:56:43,250 --> 00:56:50,489
Something like that. It's helpful to have that numerical value because then it's easier to measure

435
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:56,250
reach that way because if you know you have an expectation that's been justified,

436
00:56:57,150 --> 00:57:04,530
then as an evaluator and I can see that we don't reach it, say we said we were going to reach 80%.

437
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:11,830
But we only see 60%. And the question is going to be why?

438
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:17,260
So this is, you know, a big thing with reach.

439
00:57:17,590 --> 00:57:22,000
Why aren't we reaching the people that we we designed the program to reach?

440
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:28,110
And that in itself, again, can help a program improvement.

441
00:57:29,330 --> 00:57:32,540
Because it might be, for example, recruitment,

442
00:57:34,370 --> 00:57:42,230
which is documentation of procedures used to approach and attract individuals, groups and or organizations to participate.

443
00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:55,430
When I first came here in 1997. When I first stepped onto campus at the union, there were credit card companies.

444
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:00,260
Up and down State Street. At tables.

445
00:58:00,770 --> 00:58:08,780
And they gave us t shirts. They were super awesome in recruiting us to get credit as a whole generation of people like

446
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:12,830
me who ruined their credit because they got 50 cards because they just wanted some t shirts.

447
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:21,049
Don't do that. But tell your kid I always tell my kid my kid's going to school next year.

448
00:58:21,050 --> 00:58:28,760
I'm like, if you see the people, they can't do it anymore. But like, like if you see a credit card company offering you a shirt run.

449
00:58:30,170 --> 00:58:37,190
But that recruitment is important, right? Like I did some I did something totally ridiculous because of the recruitment strategy.

450
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:43,909
And so. In the same way as an evaluator I'm going to look at.

451
00:58:43,910 --> 00:58:48,710
Okay, well, how are people being drawn in? Because it could be the opposite.

452
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:57,710
It could be a great program, serves it, you know, such beneficial aspects to participating.

453
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:07,910
But the way that they recruit participants is really dry and engaging, and it does not reflect the program's benefit.

454
00:59:09,270 --> 00:59:15,420
So it's important to think about this aspect of process, because if you can't get the people in, you can't serve.

455
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:23,000
So the questions that you might answer with this. What recruitment procedures were used to attract participants?

456
00:59:23,690 --> 00:59:27,290
How did the procedures used differ from the plant procedures?

457
00:59:27,890 --> 00:59:38,480
So for example, on my plan, and this is a big thing like how are we going to get youth engaged in pure education?

458
00:59:38,810 --> 00:59:45,440
The way that we recruited participants when I was younger and peer education is

459
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:52,390
that we held this big girls leadership training where we have twice a year.

460
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:59,400
We have to do this big recruitment effort to get youth to come and participate on a Saturday.

461
00:59:59,420 --> 01:00:00,980
They got paid $100.

462
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:13,880
The come event out of that big, big sample, we would recruit further for those who we thought would make peer edge good PR educators.

463
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:19,690
So. It's a great idea.

464
01:00:19,710 --> 01:00:24,960
It worked really well, but it was also a very expensive way of recruiting me.

465
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:35,700
And especially because we did not evaluate the benefit of the leadership training, so we could not get funders really to pay for it after a while.

466
01:00:37,530 --> 01:00:41,400
So recruitment is helpful, like taking some time to really think about it.

467
01:00:41,820 --> 01:00:48,150
You know, are there other could there have been other ways that we recruit that youth into our peer education programs?

468
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:55,120
Yes. Were there people that we were missing out on because we recruited it that way?

469
01:00:55,660 --> 01:01:02,010
Yes. Those who identify as male. Because again, it was a girls leadership training.

470
01:01:02,010 --> 01:01:06,510
So we would only get girls. Those who identified as girls.

471
01:01:08,670 --> 01:01:11,880
So. That was a barrier right there.

472
01:01:12,570 --> 01:01:24,960
Once we were ready to expand, to have peer educators that were both identifying as male and female or those who identify as transgender.

473
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:29,560
There. There were two groups that we just left out of the equation whatsoever.

474
01:01:36,950 --> 01:01:43,370
And then so then the action that we took this is I'm trying to also incorporate actions that you might take.

475
01:01:43,370 --> 01:01:53,240
So the action we took once we realized that was to actually hire a staff person who was who was closely connected to the community,

476
01:01:53,450 --> 01:02:01,790
her relationships with a lot of young men in the community who many of them were actually gang members.

477
01:02:01,790 --> 01:02:10,730
So, you know, you had to we had to have a staff member that felt comfortable engaging with males, including those who identified as gang members.

478
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:19,760
So recruitment, you know, paying attention to that can be helpful and serving your population more widely.

479
01:02:21,010 --> 01:02:29,840
And then finally, context. And this is the big the big bucket.

480
01:02:29,870 --> 01:02:34,370
This is the extent to which the environment influence intervention, implementation.

481
01:02:34,980 --> 01:02:45,980
So I mentioned the example of contextual factors that I felt were driving our ineffectiveness and eliciting behavior change with our peer educators.

482
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:50,820
The context I actually referred to was family context.

483
01:02:53,210 --> 01:02:59,060
So, you know, but if I go on about it, about it systematically, I probably will the better understood it.

484
01:02:59,420 --> 01:03:03,200
Then I came here to try and answer that question, and here I am today.

485
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:11,950
They sucked me in. I just came here to get a promotion at work, and I'm teaching you.

486
01:03:12,690 --> 01:03:17,000
That shows you. I'm still friends with my boss too.

487
01:03:17,850 --> 01:03:21,660
She has never worked there anymore. Like, well, I guess I may get that promotion.

488
01:03:23,710 --> 01:03:27,670
The extent to which environment influenced intervention implementation.

489
01:03:28,090 --> 01:03:33,219
So it questions what fact and this I'm going to tell you like here is a freebie right now for

490
01:03:33,220 --> 01:03:38,410
a question if she just can't think of any process evaluation questions for your assignment,

491
01:03:38,410 --> 01:03:47,049
here you go. What factors in the organization, community and socio political context could have affect that intervention?

492
01:03:47,050 --> 01:03:57,250
Implementation it is a freebie question is also one of the hardest to answer because you have to take the time to find out what those organization,

493
01:03:57,250 --> 01:04:00,940
community or social, political, contextual factors are.

494
01:04:01,660 --> 01:04:09,580
Jim Interview. You can do things like document review, basically reading materials like reading minute minute notes.

495
01:04:09,910 --> 01:04:15,930
Meeting notes that minute, meeting minutes. Case notes.

496
01:04:16,620 --> 01:04:22,410
So that's the example of document review. You can do interviews with.

497
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:35,020
There's a word that I was trying to think of, but basically the people in your community that know everything that's going on.

498
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:41,770
There's a technical word for those people, the people that know the history, they know they know everybody in the neighborhood.

499
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:46,240
So you can interview people like that to learn more about context.

500
01:04:47,230 --> 01:04:51,280
You can learn that through observation. People you see, I always throw a story in here.

501
01:04:51,280 --> 01:05:00,010
People love to tell stories. Document that. I would whenever I would just go meet a client, I would have my phone with me.

502
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:08,360
And as soon as I got in the car with document, I would document a series of our answer, a series of questions related to the visit.

503
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:13,639
That's data. So it's it's not the hardest.

504
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:16,850
But you do have to be thoughtful about answering this question.

505
01:05:19,700 --> 01:05:23,270
So those are the seven concerns. Seven elements.

506
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:32,120
And generally, especially when it comes to the health promotion programs, these are you know what?

507
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:38,660
Whatever you need to know will generally be covered by one of these seven elements of process.

508
01:05:40,490 --> 01:05:44,830
So I just wanted to end with an example from the reading today.

509
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:54,050
So the article you read was a process evaluation of comics for health, and it actually does incorporate this framework.

510
01:05:55,640 --> 01:06:02,060
But for those who have not got to that reading yet, Comics for Health is a social cognitive.

511
01:06:02,090 --> 01:06:06,650
There you go. Just third on everything, social cognitive is the best theory ever.

512
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:14,870
Social cognitive theory based childhood obesity prevention and intervention implemented at 12 afterschool programs.

513
01:06:15,950 --> 01:06:23,389
It uses theory oriented program activities to mediate behavior change, such as taking small,

514
01:06:23,390 --> 01:06:30,200
achievable steps for learning and mastering new skills and participating in role play plays a practice,

515
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:34,940
new skills in behavior and pretend settings with either a peer or parent.

516
01:06:35,810 --> 01:06:44,930
Program also includes aspect of making and reading comic books and included activities to help children create their own original comic book or strip.

517
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:54,170
And then the in terms of the data that they collect in both qualitative and quantitative process, data were collected using surveys,

518
01:06:54,680 --> 01:07:05,630
filled notes, open ended questionnaires which assessed it assessed fidelity dose deliver, dose received, reach, recruitment and context.

519
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:12,950
So here are some. So those are some of those elements.

520
01:07:13,340 --> 01:07:20,630
And what was measured. Or what indicators they use to measure those.

521
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:24,470
So for example, a wanted to know dose delivered.

522
01:07:25,340 --> 01:07:33,530
So they looked at the order that the lessons were delivered in, as well as the amount of time taken to deliver the lessons.

523
01:07:34,470 --> 01:07:38,820
Again trying to understand what. What did the staff put out?

524
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:47,520
And then dose received staff members opinions about feasibility and acceptability by their students.

525
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:52,260
So this kind of gets to your question about like. Like what is it?

526
01:07:52,620 --> 01:08:05,240
What is dose received? So even though they're asking and collecting data from the staff, the answer is really about what did the students think?

527
01:08:06,550 --> 01:08:13,780
Like what were the students? Perceptions of feasibility and acceptability is that they asked the staff.

528
01:08:17,230 --> 01:08:22,120
I probably would have quibble about that in the design because.

529
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:27,610
You could have just asked the students what they thought about feasibility and acceptability,

530
01:08:28,090 --> 01:08:33,880
but I want to point that out, just to see that you don't have to ask the participants.

531
01:08:35,980 --> 01:08:41,440
To understand the dose that they received. Reach.

532
01:08:42,410 --> 01:08:47,800
So they looked at attendance at each lesson. Context.

533
01:08:48,250 --> 01:08:52,510
So one thing they did to address context on the front and is that they made sure

534
01:08:52,510 --> 01:08:58,660
that it was the same facilitator across the the deliver the lesson delivery.

535
01:09:00,090 --> 01:09:07,980
So that there wouldn't be concerns about how the staff or the facilitator delivered them the lessons.

536
01:09:10,290 --> 01:09:16,650
Or how the the students perceive the facilitator because it is the same facilitator.

537
01:09:17,970 --> 01:09:24,270
And then they look at the presence of any competing or similar programs being implemented at the same time.

538
01:09:25,670 --> 01:09:30,440
Self-report. At number of times they the youth were taught about healthy eating,

539
01:09:30,770 --> 01:09:35,030
the number of times that they were taught about importance of physical activity at home.

540
01:09:36,050 --> 01:09:41,240
So. You know, looking at family in the home context,

541
01:09:41,930 --> 01:09:48,830
then they're looking at the social public health context when they're looking at the similar programs.

542
01:09:51,180 --> 01:09:57,870
And then recruitment they looked at was the recruitment deliver consistently in person by the same person.

543
01:09:58,810 --> 01:10:07,480
So these are different at a way that you can see that different aspects of process were translated into this study.

544
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:18,190
So in summary, we use process evaluations for monitoring, for documentation programs,

545
01:10:18,190 --> 01:10:28,870
activities and outputs and inputs with the kind of focus being on objectively what services were provided

546
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:37,450
and then subjectively how satisfied key stakeholders were with the with the services that were provided.

547
01:10:39,010 --> 01:10:44,110
And then if you're thinking about especially if you're evaluating a health promotion program,

548
01:10:44,590 --> 01:10:49,600
some key concerns or elements of process evaluations include fidelity.

549
01:10:51,130 --> 01:10:54,810
So extent, we're sticking to it. To the script.

550
01:10:55,320 --> 01:11:04,170
Don't deliver what the staff put out. Dose received what the participants received or feel like they received.

551
01:11:05,130 --> 01:11:09,780
Participant Satisfaction. How that participants feel about what they got.

552
01:11:10,410 --> 01:11:13,860
Reach How far are we reaching out and.

553
01:11:13,890 --> 01:11:19,250
And. Capturing or drawing in the people we are trying to draw in.

554
01:11:21,020 --> 01:11:25,850
Recruitment. What are we doing to get people in the door?

555
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:30,440
And then context, what might be going on that will affect outcomes.

556
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:37,850
So any questions? Yes.

557
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:47,960
Yeah. You don't have to do all seven of them, all in part.

558
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:53,840
You know you can do it all in part. Yeah. Any other questions?

559
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:59,310
How many questions? Like an actual.

560
01:11:59,590 --> 01:12:10,600
Like an actual one. Um. In part it depends on the funding, but generally it gets a bit.

561
01:12:13,150 --> 01:12:18,880
I probably end up hitting around five, but I will also have some questions.

562
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:23,500
So I could be anywhere from like 5 to 12.

563
01:12:24,250 --> 01:12:30,250
I generally will have like, you know, because I mentioned like what the specific at like that question about the specific aspects.

564
01:12:32,050 --> 01:12:36,440
Where to go? Well, look. No.

565
01:12:37,310 --> 01:12:42,830
I might have a subquestion like a couple of sub questions, how they react to the,

566
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:48,710
you know, the part the facilitators, how they just to kind of keep it, you know, focused.

567
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:55,290
And I think I'm what I say for the assignment and I say to.

568
01:12:56,430 --> 01:13:00,180
It's three and two, but I can't remember offhand which one was three and which was two.

569
01:13:00,930 --> 01:13:05,680
I think it's two process and three outcome. But don't take my word for it.

570
01:13:05,700 --> 01:13:10,350
Look at that assignment. Any other questions?

571
01:13:16,230 --> 01:13:21,540
All right. So you're free to go a few minutes early if you have any questions.

572
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:25,590
Feel free to come up to me by one 1130.

573
01:13:25,590 --> 01:13:30,210
I'll drift over to. Think a 1725.

574
01:13:30,220 --> 01:13:34,000
It's a little room over there on the others on the other building.

575
01:13:45,890 --> 01:13:46,910
I've got.
