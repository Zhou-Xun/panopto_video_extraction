1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:06,540
Okay. So what we're going to talk about now is just how we can extend the same

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,410
principles that we talked about when we just had two variables into more than two.

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:17,430
Right? So any time that we're going to have more than one predictor, we move into this space of multiple regression and analogous principles.

4
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:22,590
Analogous output. In many ways, you're not going to notice a difference except for there's a little bit more.

5
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,770
There are small caveats, small little things that we have to consider that are different when we just have those two variables to worry about.

6
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:36,540
But in the end, it makes for a much more powerful analysis and is more like much more likely to be seen in practice.

7
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:43,380
So if you recall earlier this week we were looking at anxiety is our outcome and we had self-acceptance as our predictor variable, right?

8
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:48,660
We figured the more I slip acceptance, the more you endorse that measure, perhaps the less anxious you are about things.

9
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,330
But we know that there could be a lot of other things that could be related to one's anxiety.

10
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:00,840
Right. And so we're going to think about controlling for accounting for partially out.

11
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,440
All of these things mean the exact same thing. All right. They're synonymous with each other.

12
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:12,630
We are going to we want to make a statement that understanding that people's ages and sex, for example, differ.

13
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:20,550
What is the effect of self-acceptance on anxiety, holding age and sex constant?

14
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:28,620
What is the effect of self-acceptance and anxiety discounting or setting those two variables aside?

15
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:34,440
What is the effect of self-acceptance on anxiety? Start to kind of rehearse that language in your head.

16
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:39,270
That's the power of multiple regression accounting for all of these extraneous variables.

17
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,040
What is the relationship between my focal variable of interest and the outcome here?

18
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:55,920
Okay, questions about that. Notice that our equation is just an extension from what we saw on Tuesday.

19
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:03,020
Right. So all of these all of these variables are going to have a very similar interpretation.

20
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:12,749
And we saw on Tuesday. So things like The Intercept, which we would normally say is what how would we interpret intercept if their predictive value,

21
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:21,450
when everything else in the equation is zero intercepts, that means the exact same thing.

22
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:27,780
I don't care if there's one variable here or if there's 50 intercepts, no means it's our predictive value when everything else is zero.

23
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:36,390
We're going to change our interpretation of these very coefficients from, you know, a unit change in ages associated with,

24
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,870
you know, a, B, one change in our outcome variable to holding sex and self-acceptance constant.

25
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:48,970
A unit change in H is associated with this much of a change in anxiety.

26
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:57,180
That's the big difference, taking into account whether in this example you have a male or female and their level of self-acceptance.

27
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:00,390
This is the relationship between age interaction variable.

28
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,220
And that's the same if we if we took self-acceptance taking into account someone's age and their sex.

29
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:09,120
This is the association between self-acceptance and anxiety.

30
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:19,230
You see the power of multiple regression, or at least the advantage over just kind of a single regression equation or a single predictor.

31
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:29,220
The error piece doesn't change. Same kind of idea, except for now we're talking about a multivariate normal distribution.

32
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:36,480
But really what we're thinking of is we're expecting our error terms to be normally distributed within the ID zero in some kind of variance.

33
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:40,830
But really error still is what we predict versus what we actually see.

34
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:47,760
Right. It's the same kind of idea. The better part here is our equation.

35
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:55,410
Look at this. They actually think it's the exact same thing with the addition of a couple of pluses and variable names.

36
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:59,790
That's what I love about this. Coding makes this super easy.

37
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:06,660
Dangerously easy, right? I can add all kinds of crazy variables into my regression equation just to see what happens.

38
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:09,430
Now, do I want to do that? No. No, I don't.

39
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:15,420
I want to make sure that there's at least some theoretical rationale for why I think age and sex should be associated in the outcome variable.

40
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:19,770
Right? The opportunity and challenge of regression.

41
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:26,190
When we do that, look at this then this deal. I mean, this is this is our happy space, right?

42
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:30,060
We all feel comfortable in this space. Yes. At least get in there.

43
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,350
Yeah. All right. Well, you could probably do this.

44
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:39,360
Yes. Could you do number one? I'm not going to make you do it. But do you know how would we do this or what?

45
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:45,540
To turn out the regression equation? By sure hands.

46
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:48,720
Not confident. Pretty confident. Super. Super confident.

47
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:53,070
If I asked you to do this right on a piece of paper, you see those hands?

48
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,700
Not confident. Somewhat confident. Very, very confident. All right.

49
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:03,060
That's all right. It's all right. This is our regression equation, right?

50
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:08,070
All we need to do to write this out is a regression model.

51
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:13,410
Take these estimates. Right. Remember, these are all debates.

52
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:18,840
These fancy Greek letters just translate directly into this.

53
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:23,730
This is. Yes. So for The Intercept, we take this point nine, six, four.

54
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:32,340
We plug it into this data that builds. You build enough intercept, predicted value when everything else is zero.

55
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:36,330
Rehearse it in your head. That's where the rest of this.

56
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,650
So self-acceptance. Is this a positive or negative association? Love it.

57
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:47,850
Right. So here, instead of a plus three, we would have a minus point one fourth.

58
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:54,320
And then for every individual. I don't care who it is, whether it's Heather, Jamie, but it's Oksana.

59
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:59,550
We would take their individual responses to this age, this sex here, this level of self-acceptance.

60
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:06,540
We plug you in there, right? Wherever those values are, we multiply it by these coefficients, add them all together.

61
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,220
And that's what our insight is. This is not esoteric.

62
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:16,860
You know how to do this. It's not we're we're not going to have to do it by hand because the program's going to do it for you.

63
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,520
But that's good to know that this is where those lines come from.

64
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,140
Right. Each one of those points. That one.

65
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:28,980
When I take all your individual responses and I plug them in based on these these data values,

66
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,850
it's going to give us where kind of we would expect you to be in our regression.

67
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:40,140
Right. But we know it's never enough. So your your your actual self or your actual anxiety might differ from what we predict,

68
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:46,320
but that's how we're getting questions about writing this thing out.

69
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:52,140
And again, what's great about R is it's going to do all that in any program, really.

70
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:56,820
But they can do all this for you. But it's good to know that's kind of what's happening behind the scenes.

71
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:06,300
In interpreting this, coefficients I'll have an hour. Is the error value somewhere on that table that that adjustment.

72
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:16,500
It is it B well so yes, in like an individual case, this is going to be the difference between what we predict and what you actually observe.

73
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:19,350
Right. So this is going to be our predicted path.

74
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:26,880
Yet whatever the difference between what we predict on that line and what you actually said for your anxiety, that's what this is going to be.

75
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:28,440
That's how this always works out.

76
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:37,110
But we expect that in the aggregate, this more or less cancels out an average of 8 to 0, which is why we can in some ways kind of enormous.

77
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:46,790
Coefficients starting an intercept. Somebody coming at me, Tony.

78
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:58,469
Right. Tell me when everything is zero, there will be a point.

79
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:09,280
Nine, six. Oh, for anxiety or anxiety score, whatever it's going to be.

80
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,879
That's the general case, which I love. We can be even more specific.

81
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:19,150
We can say when someone's self-acceptance is zero, when someone's age is zero, when someone's sex is zero.

82
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:23,650
This is our predictive score. Did any part of what I just said not make sense?

83
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:30,280
In particular the second one when someone's age is zero.

84
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:35,350
Can you have zero age? Probably not in most coding circumstances.

85
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:44,410
So our intercept here has limited utility, limited value, because there is not a plausible zero value for really either this variable or this one.

86
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:52,870
Because the way we scored it, self-acceptance, it was a 1 to 5 or age variable, which is like 14 years old or 14.5 years old or something.

87
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:57,250
Right. So we can't use this intercept in any meaningful way.

88
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:02,890
Now, there are some tricks that we can use to make this intercept value more meaningful.

89
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:10,030
For example, we could use we could center a variable so that a zero for added value means like 14.5.

90
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:18,010
So when we talked about The Intercept, it's for someone of average age and then this level of self-acceptance, by the way.

91
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:24,000
So this is this is just a way to make these results a little more interpretable if we need to.

92
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:31,480
We don't have to, because the key information for most of our practice is whether or not these are some of these associations exist.

93
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:35,860
The direction of those associations and sort of the magnitude of the association.

94
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:40,820
Right. That's kind of where we're where we're going to try to get to, but know that we can tweak it if we need to.

95
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:48,010
So when you say when gender is zero, are you saying when an individual is female?

96
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:54,670
Good question. So in this case, our reference is going to be male because I think it's true in female.

97
00:09:55,060 --> 00:10:03,280
Right. So we have males and females in the sample, right. If we had if we had multiple categories, we could have we would have two, two way ones.

98
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,670
And it would tell you which the the target the treatment category is.

99
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:10,690
But you're going to have to look at your coding to figure out what the reference is. Right.

100
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:19,960
So it's based on how you enter in the data. And so in this case, it would be males are zero, you know, ones are female, which tells us good point,

101
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:27,130
that this intercept, you know, ignoring these two values would be the predicted value for, in this case, males.

102
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:32,050
Right. So it's going to be a someone with zero self-acceptance, who's your years old,

103
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:37,270
who's a man, and that the same for race, ethnicity, whatever, that reference.

104
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:46,600
It's going to have a record category. So in that case, it would be, you know, if there's black, white, whatever questions about these coefficient.

105
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,890
Well no we haven't done that for we just start with the intercept. There's like K.

106
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:55,720
Yeah. How about self-acceptance interpreting for me.

107
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:02,200
What was the original question. Can you drop this coefficient.

108
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:11,970
Oh. Is that negatively correlated with anxiety when it's zero?

109
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:15,270
Like there's a negative correlation going on.

110
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:25,940
That's true. Yeah. And we talk about regression coefficients when one of them is zero.

111
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:32,959
Sorry. This is going to I'd like you to change kind of language.

112
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:36,400
You can think about that when everything is, like, standardized.

113
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:43,120
Not quite. We're not there yet. Like a unit change. So remember with that, with the regression equation or regression coefficient,

114
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:54,640
we talk about like a one unit change in our self-acceptance is associated with about 2.1 for increase or decrease decrease in our predicted anxiety.

115
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,490
Yes, there is a negative association here. Right. You want to try to solve the latter part?

116
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:08,020
I mean, it looks significant. It does look significant.

117
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:12,790
Yeah, right. So what we've got, we're kind of saying is that under the null hypothesis,

118
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:20,380
which is that there's no association to observe, a coefficient of about this size seems very, very unlikely.

119
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:30,610
So we kind of reject the null hypothesis that there's no association and in turn and instead retain our kind of alternative hypothesis or endorser.

120
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:33,790
I totally agree with you.

121
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:40,570
There was an important omission from the way that I just interpreted this data coefficient.

122
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:47,440
Can you pick it out? So I said it was the unit change was really associated with a predicted decrease in

123
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,390
significant life is good with multiple regression relative to by very regression.

124
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,810
What is an important caveat or addition addendum that we need to include?

125
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:09,210
That. I holding or anything else is not zero, but holding everything else constant.

126
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:12,660
Yes, absolutely. This is a wonderful thing about regression.

127
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:20,160
We get to say, you know, if we just kind of hold you know, we put age aside, we put sex aside, we hold those constant.

128
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:24,690
This is our predicted association between self-acceptance and anxiety.

129
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:33,090
And that's huge, because if, for example, males are more anxious than females actually looks like females are more anxious than males,

130
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:38,130
then this, this, this, this coefficient, it wouldn't matter who we're talking to.

131
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:43,469
Are we talking to people who are identifying as female or male with an R with a multiple regression?

132
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:51,080
We can say it doesn't matter. After accounting for that piece of things, this is what our predictor or expected association is.

133
00:13:51,880 --> 00:14:00,690
Well, my first question in terms of the formula, when you're plugging in, say, no, we don't have to calculate the results.

134
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:07,910
But will you keep you'll keep the intercept and then you'll keep the one variable to look at everything else we.

135
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:16,940
Zero, right? So if you're actually plugging in someone's predicted score, you would take someone of Justin's age.

136
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,960
Justin Sexe Justin's level of self acceptance.

137
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:28,700
I plug in the literal values that I put on my survey. I multiply them by these coefficients.

138
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:34,780
Right. Because that's what all of this data, one is going to be over.

139
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:44,090
The age is going to be this value. Data two is going to be a two or so beta.

140
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:47,910
One is going to be, I forgot this value data is going to be this very bad.

141
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:56,690
Three is going to be this thing. So we multiply Justin's age 41 by this we multiply Justin's sex male by this is going to be zero.

142
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:00,739
We multiply Justin's self-acceptance level. And I know, right?

143
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:06,920
Because I'm all right. I'm almost zero. No, three and a half or something like that. Three by that time, you take all that information into account.

144
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:12,590
I plug those values into this equation. That is my predicted anxiety score.

145
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:17,570
Now, I also wanted their trouble of responding to your anxiety scale.

146
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:26,300
We would want to see whether your prediction of my anxiety is a lot different or just a little different from what I actually said from a search.

147
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:33,450
And if your model's good, these differences will be small. If your mouth stinks, these differences are going to be large.

148
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:44,599
And there's no utility for us. And that usually means adding different variables or additional variables or potentially more more intensive revisions.

149
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:56,040
If we need to make of the books, do we need to go through another interpretation relying on Darwin as agent at the next level?

150
00:15:56,390 --> 00:16:10,940
Which one? Over the next five. All right, then, Jenny, as you know.

151
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:15,739
Okay. All right. Sorry. I'm so sorry. Hey, you again.

152
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:19,280
Our coefficient on it. Yeah, yeah, I know.

153
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:24,710
I just interrupted his age line, so I guess if.

154
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:31,830
You to have it.

155
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:43,840
I want you to change. Okay, so there's a life change in 80.0 79.

156
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:49,490
Yeah. Does it matter as a significant. Yeah.

157
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:53,360
Yes. Yeah. Yes. Right.

158
00:16:53,930 --> 00:17:03,620
So even though the coefficient is actually quite small, we can still say that relative to what we might expect, it's a fairly large deviation.

159
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:08,030
If there was no association. Right. And so this is you can see how these standard errors.

160
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:14,870
That's the kind of distribution or sampling distribution. Right. They're going to vary depending on the way that we measure the values.

161
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:16,669
Right. And that's we'll get to that in just a second.

162
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:24,350
So the way that we've measured age and some exceptions, etc., is going to have an impact on what these standard errors of one,

163
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:28,670
but still relative to what we would expect in an all hypothesis.

164
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:37,540
This is a pretty surprising value, so much so that we say it's statistically significant or significant or different from here.

165
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,630
Different from a from no association. Well, it's kind of fun about each.

166
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:49,460
So in this in this case, a one year change is like going from age 14 to 15 or 14.25 to 15.25.

167
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:57,380
So we could to say something cool, like for every year old, we would expect this much change in someone's self-reported anxiety.

168
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:01,550
So are adolescents getting more or less anxious as they age?

169
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:06,080
More controlling for or holding other things constant?

170
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:10,610
Right. And we can reflect on that, whether that mattered to our experience or we think there might be an issue there.

171
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:17,080
This is good stuff. It really is good stuff.

172
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:20,790
You didn't know that. Or maybe you did. I sure didn't know that.

173
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,190
So I got to think about my children as they start to move into adolescence.

174
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:30,129
Could we expect them to get a little bit more anxious over time? And what could be contributing to that is that their school, is that their sports?

175
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:35,070
Is it their all the other things that are going on in their lives, is it having relationships and all that stuff that could be messing with things up?

176
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,860
We should throw some of that in there. We should ask them about their schooling.

177
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:41,230
We should ask them about their significant relationships.

178
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:46,900
Maybe that will help us figure out why it is that their get more inches of age quite yet, you know.

179
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:53,610
So you saying that kind of made me think about the next one and other factors?

180
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:59,750
Yeah, we're looking at this unique change. So you're saying like for every unit change you're getting,

181
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:09,610
there is a point to one increased anxiety with that trigger with a categorical variable but a similar interpretation,

182
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:13,120
a one unit change in our variable.

183
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:19,210
So in this case, moving from male to female, we don't move in that sense, but we are as we go from males or females.

184
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:25,480
This is actually a mean difference, but you can still kind of think of it the same way as we move from male to female,

185
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:29,620
we would expect about this much predicted change in our convert.

186
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:36,490
So if there are multiple group so we included like non-binary right other would

187
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:41,979
it be that same change of you have to include different levels of gender.

188
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:45,129
You would see a second W8 or W1,

189
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:53,950
A2 and then bracket T period non-binary and it would have its own coefficient relative to our referent category, which in this case is male.

190
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:56,740
You can always flip there the reference category if you wanted to,

191
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:06,460
but if you wanted to see how males and females were changing relative to non-binary folks, we could have female male as in and the output.

192
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:16,010
So this probably isn't comparable but is it kind of like with Tukey how you can see the comparison in some ways that is.

193
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:22,960
Yes. So I think it is cool how it's saying, oh, yeah, yeah, going from male to female, there's a change.

194
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:29,220
But let's say you wanted to just look at the male variable and see how much it related to anxiety.

195
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:32,750
I mean, that's kind of hard to do because there's no like change. But how can we do this?

196
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,560
Are a lot of like that. Well, you do kind of have a sense of male because of the intercept, right?

197
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:42,920
Because that's when we talk about when this values is zero, you're talking about all the males, right?

198
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:50,590
So I mean, if if if there's no variability in our predictor variable, then we can examine it in the same way.

199
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:59,169
Like, so if we just took a subsample of all males, no females, this would drop out this term and all we would have is these two values.

200
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:04,720
And we would say among males, this is the association between except self-acceptance and anxiety.

201
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:08,140
This is the association between age and anxiety.

202
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:14,800
You are stratifying the sample, which is a kind of a quick and easy way to run an interaction term,

203
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:24,100
which is when we think that the relationship between predictor variables and the outcome vary as a function of some third variable.

204
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:33,160
The strength or direction of this association and this association changes based on whether you are a male or female respondent.

205
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:38,230
That's kind of what the interaction idea is all about, and that's what we do when we exercise.

206
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:42,820
So we'll definitely get to that piece of it. All right.

207
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:46,930
We've written the model. We've talked about the coefficients. We've looked at testing.

208
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:53,590
If I want to take this one on what it was doing. Yes.

209
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:57,370
Yeah. Can you tell me a little about the model? Fit and interpret mean?

210
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:18,450
How much of the variability in the outcome are explaining? Thank you for.

211
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:27,360
Yeah. So think about all the variability in anxiety. We can explain a little bit about about 5% of it with these three predictor numbers.

212
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:32,640
Okay. Is that a significant amount of variability explained in the outcome area?

213
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:41,400
You know, I guess. No.

214
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:53,430
Oh, yes. Yes. So we take this decimal place, we move it nine spaces to the left.

215
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,559
Yeah. We had a big, strong p value, which is more or less say, is this multiple r squared?

216
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:03,150
It's no longer just r squared. R squared. Was that for a proportion shared varies between two words.

217
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:08,220
Multiple R squared is going to be however many predictive variables we have in our convert.

218
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:16,170
We know it is about 5%. This AB statistic is kind of telling us what our model predicts relative to what our model doesn't do well.

219
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:20,580
The error for doesn't predict it. Is that proportion significant or large?

220
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:27,690
Yes, it is. So this is our way of kind of saying our model as a whole is explaining outcome variability.

221
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:31,620
It's explaining some variation in an adolescent insight.

222
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:38,910
Okay, we can go down to the individual coefficients or we can think about them as a model as a whole.

223
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:48,510
We could still have a significant model, even if some of the predictor values that we have are not significant, which is kind of important, right?

224
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:53,190
So even if we have some very simple, some predictors that don't do a good job,

225
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:57,180
we might still be able to say that our model is at least representing reality pretty well.

226
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:03,120
How is how well? It's pretty well known. It's about 5%. And you get to make that determination.

227
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:09,560
And the random. Yes, that statistic, 1493 is the three the number.

228
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:19,990
I think she's right.

229
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:32,310
So she was asking the statistic is 14 was huge on three and 844 degrees of freedom three predictor variables.

230
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:37,290
And then we lose degrees of freedom for having every prediction in the model.

231
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:44,520
So we start out with 848 or something like that and we subtract some of those predict every single parameter and three, four.

232
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:52,610
We ready to move on and we have questions about this.

233
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:58,600
You going to see this kind of slide over and over and over again is another great time about this question.

234
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:08,750
When you're creating and doing a data collection is do you collect the data that you want to look at anxiety or is it just collecting,

235
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:15,230
collecting all kinds of data points and then being able to pull out these things that you might be interested?

236
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:22,990
It's a combination. So this was a very specific study that was focused on substance use and persistence through high school.

237
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:27,270
There was a longitudinal study and they wanted to see things that might be related to driving.

238
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:31,870
You might have some administrative data sets that just collect a ton of information.

239
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:36,180
Think about some of the physicians in this room. When I have to go to a doctor's appointment, I fill in all sorts of stuff.

240
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:42,070
It has nothing to do with them. And then look at my hand. But maybe that data just kind of sits there and people say, Well,

241
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:46,610
I'm going to examine some of these associations that could be that could be extent or whatever.

242
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:53,440
So it's I would say you would want to be a lot more intentional about what you're collecting and why ideally,

243
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:59,980
you would even have some of these equations or some of these these analyzes in mind as you're proposing some of this data collection.

244
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:03,250
I'm going to collect anxiety because I know that's what I care about,

245
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:06,400
but I'm also going to collect a whole bunch of stuff that I think is associated with that.

246
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,059
And then maybe there are some auxiliary variables that we're not sure about.

247
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:14,710
They're making more exploratory, or we just know that we want to have that information for other sorts of analysis.

248
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:18,249
But again, hopefully you're planning some of these things rather than just saying,

249
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:21,370
Oh, I have some data, I'm just going to play around and see what I see.

250
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:36,650
Right. This slide is just meant to tell you that we can take the outcome here and how everybody to it.

251
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:41,110
I give you all an anxiety questionnaire. We're going to have variation.

252
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,240
Some people going to be high. Some people are going to be middle. Some people will be lucky.

253
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:49,819
The goal of regression is to take that variability and try to relate it to our

254
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:55,280
predictor versus the way in which these regression analysis are going to do this.

255
00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:02,059
As it said, we're going to we're going to set up a model and it's going to explain or we're going to find

256
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:09,200
some associations between some of our predictors and some of the variability in our right.

257
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:17,209
What we can explain with our model versus what we can explain is ultimately how we partition out some

258
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:22,880
of this variance and we make some of these claims about whether our model fits well versus not.

259
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:32,510
We were going to try to settle on two to identify a line that's going to close the distance between all the two different points on our scatterplot,

260
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:35,030
anxiety and all our predictor variables. Right?

261
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:41,959
The closer our line is to all those points, and I've only shown you a two dimensional line at this point, right?

262
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:46,250
We had our our y variable was our outcome. Our X variables are predictor.

263
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:52,910
As soon as we get into multiple regression, we have to think about like a multidimensional space and our minds can't do that.

264
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:58,130
We can really only go to three dimensions and then we're kind of done by understanding the same kind of principle.

265
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:02,720
We're trying to draw a line that's going to be as close to as many of these points as possible.

266
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:07,910
That's what this is how close our line is to all the observed points.

267
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:12,980
That's what this is. The distance is when we when we went for we made mistakes.

268
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:19,520
Similar principle to what we saw with ANOVA as well, where our model predicts versus our error.

269
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:25,790
And so we'll break that down when we're kind of calculating our ANOVA.

270
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:30,890
So I'll use this I'll use this language fairly frequently.

271
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:36,650
But the total variability that which is explained by the model, that which is not explained by the model.

272
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:40,790
All right. You might hear me use things like total sums of squares.

273
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:45,560
That's the difference between all the observed points and our worst possible guess.

274
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:52,700
I haven't said it before. Our worst possible guess typically in regression is the mean, knowing nothing else about everyone's error.

275
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:58,729
Everyone in this room. If I was going to try to predict your anxiety, the best thing I could do is just take them in and make them.

276
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:00,660
I guess I know everybody.

277
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:08,540
If the mean of the class is four on a five scale, then if I have point out my guess is going to be four, knowing nothing else about point.

278
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:16,620
But as I start to learn information about you folks that might help me tailor my guess to something better than just the mean.

279
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:27,110
Right. So that will be what I said, that that'll be the difference between my regression model and kind of the the worst possible guess.

280
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:32,570
And then these are essentially the difference between my regression model and what we actually observe.

281
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:38,300
Those are the errors. This is funky language,

282
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:44,969
but what it really comes down to is we are going to use are the differences between what

283
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:50,550
our model predicts and what we actually observe to try to assess the fit of the model,

284
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:58,500
how well our model is working or how well it's predicted that that's what this is.

285
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:05,400
You might be familiar with some of these tables. We did this last week. We can use this ANOVA command on the time of year.

286
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:10,110
I was going to give myself ten more minutes. We can use R.

287
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:13,950
We can use this ANOVA command from our regression object rates.

288
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:17,550
So this was the model that we ran to slide. The goal is rank two.

289
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:24,660
We are going to have now individual kind of contributions to explain variability.

290
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:32,700
This is more or less the same information that we see on the output.

291
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:43,110
When we have significant predictors, chances are we are going to be explaining significant variability in the outcome on occasion.

292
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:45,420
And this is why I like this particular example.

293
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:55,500
There might be a disparity or discrepancy between what our model output and our coefficients suggest and what our ANOVA is going to suggest.

294
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:59,520
So when we take again the total chunk of variables,

295
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:05,640
you explain differences in people's integrity and we try to break out that which is explained by self-acceptance.

296
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:09,870
That's which is as explained by age and that's that which is explained by sex.

297
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:14,070
That's essentially what this test is doing for us.

298
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:19,650
And so we can say something like self-acceptance explains a significant percentage of the outcome variance.

299
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:24,280
Sex explains a significant percentage of the outcome variance.

300
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:30,090
H Maybe not. Even though we believe based on our last or two slides ago,

301
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:36,390
that there's an association between the two when you include it, we're in a model with self-acceptance and sex.

302
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:44,820
It's not explaining unique variability and therefore could be a little redundant with some of the other predictors in the model.

303
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:50,670
And so this is where we can get into changing our regression model based on some of this information.

304
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:57,570
If I know that age is not really explaining much beyond what self-acceptance and sex are already explained.

305
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:02,280
Maybe I don't need it. Maybe I don't need to know your age in order to predict trends.

306
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:11,050
You might also remember that this is very sensitive to the order in which we include them.

307
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:20,290
So how this is kind of working as we start to see with what self-acceptance can explain, taking all of that out, then what does age explain?

308
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:24,740
Taking acceptance in age out? What is sex explained? Right.

309
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:32,260
And we can change that if we want. And if we use more of like a, like a type three sums of squares where it kind of puts everyone on equal footing,

310
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:37,120
you would get results that are more consistent with what we saw in the regression output.

311
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:43,450
Okay. These are different pieces of information to kind of help us refine our model.

312
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:50,200
All right. This would be more of an empirical based decision on whether we should keep these three variables as predictors.

313
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:55,780
If you but in your heart of hearts, believe that all three of these absolutely need to be in your model,

314
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:01,570
we would ignore this result and just keep on moving forward with the results that we found from a couple of slides.

315
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:11,700
All right. Yes. When you've done your regression model, it's a good practice to then run ANOVA on that.

316
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:20,030
Hmm. How is it different from a. In a lot of ways very similar, actually.

317
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:25,480
So postdocs are specific to group comparisons and they're kind of ruling out type one here.

318
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:28,909
In some ways this is analogous,

319
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:34,190
but really what it's saying is of that big chunk of variability to explain if we think about the outcome, variance is a big pie.

320
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:41,300
I mean, if you watched it, you know, we kind of had this is the idea of partial as any partial correlation.

321
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:45,980
What we're saying is that self-acceptance is explaining some chunk of it.

322
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:50,870
Right? So this is all kind of explain of our anxiety. Right.

323
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:54,500
And then we have what is it, age?

324
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:58,999
Age might be doing something like this, right?

325
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:08,030
Where it's explaining some unique variability, but then also sharing some.

326
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:19,300
With What is this? What is self-acceptance? Right.

327
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:24,930
It's kind of saying that these two variables are explaining some of the same outcome variance.

328
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:29,360
And there's a lot of vapors in that sense. Right.

329
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:40,000
But the idea is, does knowing something about my age tell me anything about anxiety that I don't already know from understanding your self-acceptance?

330
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:44,260
Those are the types of questions that we might be able to answer with something like this.

331
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:51,670
All right. And part of this is based on convention that it's better to have a more simplistic model with

332
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:57,070
the fewest amount of predictors possible relative to one that has tons and tons of predictors.

333
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:06,790
And that's why we do some of these refinements. But in terms of interpreting these things very much like we did last week,

334
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:14,530
we will look to see whether or not the sums of squares that were explaining what our model explains relative to what it doesn't explain,

335
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:19,510
as long as that proportion remains large, this relative to this, this relative to this,

336
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:22,810
this relative, this, we get these significant predictors are not.

337
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:32,990
Okay. The question. All right.

338
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:40,170
So right now we are kind of down here at the bottom. We're trying to figure out whether or not our model fits the data well.

339
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:47,540
But I do want to, before I turn you over to your own devices or introduce or introduce this idea of standardized coefficients.

340
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:52,700
And this is a fun example because thinking back to this model, which we just interpreted.

341
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:57,200
Can anyone tell me why this age coefficient is so small?

342
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:10,270
There. I said, you government. It's like, you know, the question is, life is so small.

343
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:13,420
Yeah, this one's big. 14.1 for this one.

344
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:23,890
They point to one person. Only 27 account. Is it the same as you get older?

345
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:38,470
Is it because age has a much larger range than male, female and their acceptance score of 1 to 5?

346
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:41,049
Exactly. So remember what this really think about?

347
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:44,650
I told you, you don't have to worry about the equations too much, but maybe just a lot of thought experiment here.

348
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:54,220
This anxiety variable ranges between one and five. We are going to multiply everyone's values by these these coefficients.

349
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:59,740
In my case, you know, my self acceptance. I said I was going to do it for three and a half or something like that.

350
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:06,160
My age is 41. By multiplying this by three and a half, I get to whatever value.

351
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:12,730
If I multiply this by 41, it gets to something within the range or a plausible range of outcome variable.

352
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:21,160
So these coefficients are very dependent on the scaling of these predictor variables.

353
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:28,300
This can only be a zero or a one. So it makes sense that these this might be a little bit smaller, right?

354
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:37,840
But if I had to multiply this coefficient by something large, like 41 or 14, 15 in this sample, that's why we start to see it be a little bit small.

355
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:44,620
The trouble that is, we are not comparing apples to apples, we are comparing apples to oranges.

356
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:49,090
And we need to make some form of adjustments so that we can put them all on the same scale.

357
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:55,209
Standardization does exactly that. We did this with binary regression.

358
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:59,680
We started in original metrics, and then we talked about what it would mean if we standardize things.

359
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:04,810
We take every single variable we subtract. I mean, if I am understanding version.

360
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:10,299
So we all have a mean of zero standard deviation of one these cause all we're doing is we're

361
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:15,100
making Z scores and plugging our Z scores into the equation instead of the original source.

362
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:21,930
I will pause and ask if there are questions about that. Everybody remembers these scores.

363
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:29,040
Right. If you remember these scores, some, you know, no problem.

364
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:37,120
This is going to help us answer this question. If we can put all of these regression and coefficients on the same scale,

365
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:44,300
we can now see which ones the biggest which one is having the most influence on our insight.

366
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:49,690
That's an important question, especially if one of these variables is your intervention.

367
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:55,570
We want our intervention variable to be quite big relative to all the other predictors in the model.

368
00:38:56,830 --> 00:39:00,580
All right. In this case, if we think self-acceptance is the key to anxiety,

369
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:05,470
we would want to see that self-acceptance relative to these other predictors is large.

370
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:14,550
Right now, we could standardize every single variable in the model, the outcome in the three predictors.

371
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:19,499
We could just take the data, mean subtract the standard or sorry, take the value,

372
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:26,399
subtract many drivers version and are going to do this with this Elm data command,

373
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,780
which is part of the it might be this little package in the same name.

374
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:37,770
If you look at the very top of the script, there's a package that you've never seen before you might not have installed, like the elevator package.

375
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:47,280
And this is just going to do this work for us. It's going to take every single variable, standardize it, and then rerun a regression model for us.

376
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:52,320
What it's going to spit out are standardized coefficients.

377
00:39:53,610 --> 00:40:02,820
These are now more comparable than just looking at coefficients in their original metric with a big old asterisk next to that statement.

378
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:12,810
Now, just like when we apply the regression, a standardized equation is helpful to make comparisons between predictor values.

379
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,360
But then we have to change our language,

380
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:22,980
because now a unit change in our predictor variable is actually a standard deviation change in our predictor variable.

381
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:33,540
Remember me? Same as before, right. So now a standard deviation change in self-acceptance is associated with about a .11

382
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:40,410
standard deviation dropped in our outcome variable holding other things constant.

383
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:47,570
Right. That interpretability is not super helpful, in my opinion.

384
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:52,970
It might be for other people, but it's hard to think about, well, what's the standard deviation in self-acceptance, for example?

385
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:59,150
What it does allow us to say is here we had 0.14 and .07.

386
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:06,860
Once we've standardized these two values, they're on the same scale and the magnitude is directly comparable.

387
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:14,260
So self-acceptance is a stronger predictor of our outcome variable than age.

388
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:24,530
Right. The tricky one is when we get to a categorical variable, which we've standardized,

389
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:31,040
even though you can't standardize a categorical right, we can't find a meaning of sex here.

390
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:38,060
Now, it does help us get a brief sense of what is, in fact, probably the strongest predictor in this equation.

391
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:46,910
It probably is sex, but the interpretability in this case is going to be very difficult because the standardization just doesn't make as much sense.

392
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:53,690
But it does kind of give us at a quick glance, instead of having to try to fumble through these coefficients and say,

393
00:41:53,690 --> 00:42:01,670
which is the biggest, it's probably sex, followed by self-acceptance, followed by age.

394
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:06,840
And that should map on. Phyllis.

395
00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:16,400
Okay, so that's just to give us, like, a quick idea. Like, let's say we're, like, presenting this research plan, that's for sure.

396
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:20,250
Everybody's gonna give me this because now I can talk about a year change.

397
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:24,360
Like as you get older by about a year. This is what I think is going to happen to your anxiety.

398
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:31,290
Holding other variables comes this I might do in the background to say okay,

399
00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:35,820
yes, this is about this is what happens when you get older by about a year.

400
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:41,940
But if I'm really focusing on something, it's probably going to be self-acceptance in age because the effect size,

401
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:51,210
these are now effect sizes because they're all the same scale, effect size for female and self-acceptance is larger.

402
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:59,880
How much larger? Almost twice as big for sex and probably about one and a half or about, you know, about 50% bigger for self-acceptance.

403
00:43:02,350 --> 00:43:05,380
Standardization is great in that regard. Apples to apples.

404
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:17,050
Apples to oranges. Apples to apples. If you can get those pieces back, I'm happy.

405
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:22,930
Okay. So I'm going to turn it over now to you in our last 40 minutes here.

406
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:30,970
I'm happy to answer questions about this. I'm happy for folks to work under an oversight, and I can answer questions about that.

407
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:37,260
If you wanted to spend some time trying to reproduce what I've done here with a script, that's fabulous.

408
00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:41,559
If you want to take a look at the homework assignment and start to work on that, that's awesome.

409
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:51,280
Fabulous. What I care about more than anything is getting to a couple of these output screens that you can walk me

410
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:57,400
through and tell me why you think these coefficients are important versus not significant versus not.

411
00:43:57,970 --> 00:44:01,300
How do you how would you express or convey some of this information?

412
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:05,740
What is the model fit? What happens when we standardize things?

413
00:44:06,550 --> 00:44:10,810
If there are coding things that are giving you problems, that's a reason to reach out to me.

414
00:44:10,810 --> 00:44:15,040
That should not be the thing that prohibits you from moving forward with this assignment or any of this stuff.

415
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:19,270
I'll help you work through the code, but the interpretability piece is key.

416
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:24,040
Okay. All right. I will.

417
00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:35,560
I'll be walking around. Feel free to call me over. Like I said, if I was going to be spending my time, I would focus on either reproducing this,

418
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:41,650
working on your assignment from last weekend of assignment or starting an assignment for the regression.

419
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:48,010
And then if we have a few minutes left, I will give you one last piece of this information.

420
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:53,590
But this this right now, I want folks to feel good about this slide and this slide.

421
00:44:54,280 --> 00:45:03,850
Okay. And you didn't hear me, John.

422
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:10,060
Okay. It's all good. I mean, talk. Talk to your friends. Use.

423
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:21,500
Here.
