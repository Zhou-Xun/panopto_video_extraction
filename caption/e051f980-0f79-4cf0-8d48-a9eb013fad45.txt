1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:05,540
An operating budget is a forecast of the revenues, expenses, and

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:14,110
profit expected for a period of time such as a month, a quarter, or a year.

3
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:19,840
Operating budgets are prepared at multiple levels within an organization.

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,020
They are prepared for individual departments, service lines and

5
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:29,320
pairs, and then aggregated to the entire organization.

6
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:34,630
The starting point for preparing the operating budget is the volume forecast or

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:37,255
statistics budget.

8
00:00:37,255 --> 00:00:41,550
The statistics budget includes forecasted measures of workload or

9
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,320
activity, such as the number of inpatient days or

10
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:50,260
clinic visits for each department, program, or unit.

11
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:53,280
Forecasting volume can be challenging.

12
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,670
The future volume of a specific service depends on many factors,

13
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:03,510
including population growth, population aging, disease trends,

14
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:08,130
changes in medical practice, internal changes such as

15
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:14,730
the retirement of key medical staff, and the activities of competitors.

16
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:20,280
Information from the statistics budget is used in preparing the revenue budget.

17
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:29,430
The revenue budget combines volume and reimbursement data to forecast revenues.

18
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:32,320
Revenue forecasts are prepared at many levels,

19
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,850
starting with individual services and procedures which are then summed up

20
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:43,710
to obtain an aggregate revenue estimate for a department, program, or unit.

21
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:48,420
Similar to the revenue budget, the expense budget is a compilation

22
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:53,800
of expense forecasts by department, program, or unit.

23
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:58,200
The expense budget focuses on forecasting the costs that will be incurred in

24
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,650
providing services.

25
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:06,780
To forecast expenses, managers distinguish between two types of costs.

26
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:11,030
Cost that vary with the volume of services provided and

27
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:15,880
cost that do not vary with the volume of services provided.

28
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:20,810
Graphically, the two types of costs can be shown as follows.

29
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:25,530
Costs that increase with the number of services provided are shown here.

30
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:28,990
These costs are called variable costs.

31
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:31,660
An example of a variable cost is the cost of

32
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:35,670
clinical supplies needed to provide patient care.

33
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:39,880
Costs that remain the same regardless of how many services are being provided

34
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,610
are shown here.

35
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:44,970
These costs are called fixed costs.

36
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:49,540
An example of a fixed cost is the cost of the building, equipment, and

37
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:53,080
staff needed to provide patient care.

38
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:59,920
Adding together variable costs and fixed costs gives us total costs.

39
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,900
The operating budget combines the revenue and

40
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:08,210
expense budgets, and uses this information to forecast profits.

41
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:09,830
The difference between revenues and

42
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:14,550
expenses is the profit of the department, program, or unit.

43
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:18,070
When expenses exceed revenues, the department, program, or

44
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:20,167
unit incurred a loss.
