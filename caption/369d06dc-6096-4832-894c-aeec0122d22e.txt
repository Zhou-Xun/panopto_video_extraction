1
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,529
amondul: alrighty let's go over this piece, what do you guys say.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,679
amondul: Okay, so.

3
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,310
amondul: I know that this was a long one.

4
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:22,980
amondul: Which is why we always build a little extra time but.

5
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:32,520
amondul: So let's go through this first section, so this first section is really about determining if a third variable as a founder of an exposure and outcome relationship or not so it's kind of walking you through.

6
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:43,050
amondul: All the steps of deciding miss right so and I think one thing that's really, and this is a conversation that have have a couple groups at this point, but I think it's good to.

7
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,140
amondul: just talk through with everybody, so I think, especially when you have examples like this.

8
00:00:50,730 --> 00:01:01,350
amondul: were like the exposure the outcome or not like super clear exactly which one is, which I think it's really helpful to just as like a note to yourself, when you're starting like what is our exposure here.

9
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,210
amondul: yep time.

10
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,300
amondul: Between birth.

11
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,210
amondul: and return to work.

12
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,260
amondul: Right and then I might also just say what's my outcome.

13
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:30,930
amondul: or disease right, and in this case it is depressive symptoms right.

14
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:47,190
amondul: And as we get further down will list out which thing we think is our exposure is our founder, so I think just writing down for yourself Okay, this is my exposure, this is my outcome might expose category is returning early.

15
00:01:53,790 --> 00:02:02,970
amondul: Right early is exposed returning later is unexposed I think just kind of getting that straight in your head at the beginning, is important.

16
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:17,700
amondul: So, then you are asked to calculate and interpret the appropriate measure of association, what is the appropriate measure of association here what piece of information, do you need to notice first in order to figure out what the appropriate measure of association is.

17
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:33,630
amondul: The design that's exactly right so in order to decide what the appropriate measure of association is you need to identify the study design and here it's a cohort right.

18
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:48,840
amondul: So that means you have two choices, it can be an incidence rate ratio or a relative risk, you do not have any person time information here so you're going to be calculating a relative risk or risk ratio.

19
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:50,460
amondul: Right.

20
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,280
amondul: So you should have gotten this.

21
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:08,490
amondul: Right now, one thing that people have said to me is that they're having a little bit of trouble with these interpretations.

22
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:22,620
amondul: And I think a good way to start with this is again you've identified what's your exposure and what your outcome is, and so, and now you've got this measure, and so you can say Okay, you can start by just saying.

23
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,770
amondul: i'm exposed.

24
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,630
amondul: Are 1.78 times.

25
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,030
amondul: more likely.

26
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,870
amondul: To get disease.

27
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:39,000
amondul: Right.

28
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:56,610
amondul: And then you can go back to your cheat sheet and say Okay, what was the exposed what was exposed so that was women who returned to worth less than five weeks following the birth of their child or the exposed right are 1.78 times more likely to get depressive symptoms right.

29
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:08,130
amondul: Compared to unexposed right, and then you say compared to women who returned to work five or more weeks following the birth of their child So if you just start very simply, and say.

30
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:19,140
amondul: Alright, this this real relative measure means that among the expose the exposed or this much more likely or this much less likely to get the disease.

31
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:32,070
amondul: Then you can plug in your exposed and unexposed and disease groups into that statement right, and then you can add all the detail about the study population.

32
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,990
amondul: Does that sound like a reasonable approach to people.

33
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,460
amondul: that a good way of starting to think about how you can kind of.

34
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:54,240
amondul: Just keeping yourself grounded in what the exposure is what the exposed versus unexposed group is and what your outcome is will help you start to formulate these interpretations right.

35
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:55,800
Clifton Addison: yeah do you.

36
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:56,760
Clifton Addison: Do you have a.

37
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,390
Clifton Addison: Do you have a.

38
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:03,120
Clifton Addison: I guess some clues as to.

39
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:12,630
Clifton Addison: How specifically what goes in and the the columns and what goes in the rules.

40
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:26,280
amondul: yeah so the the the Convention and what we have been doing in this class is that the columns are the outcome, and it is the disease and the non disease in that order.

41
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:44,280
amondul: The road closure and as the host and the unexposed in that order Okay, if you want to the A, B, C D notation and the ABC D formulas that we've given in class your table needs to be set up this way.

42
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,020
Clifton Addison: Okay.

43
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,900
amondul: Okay, otherwise, if you flip it.

44
00:05:50,880 --> 00:06:06,210
amondul: Right you if, instead, you said say you said, disease and then disease and then you put unexposed and exposed right, then it would be a B, C D right your a's and b's and c's these would be in different places.

45
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:15,720
amondul: This is not wrong you just have to be thoughtful about how you do your calculations you can't just take this number.

46
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:20,010
amondul: and expect it to be a if you haven't set your table up this way.

47
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:23,070
amondul: Does that make sense yeah.

48
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:32,340
amondul: Okay, so here you've got 1.78 you've got a confidence interval here and.

49
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:34,530
amondul: The fact that this does not cross one should.

50
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:43,800
amondul: tell you that this is a statistically significant findings right what I mean when I say it does not cross one so here, this is a relative measure, so one point O is your middle value.

51
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:53,340
amondul: You have your point estimate is here 1.78 that's your relative risk and your confidence intervals are 1.37.

52
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,130
amondul: can't make a point I can't do it there, we go and.

53
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,460
amondul: 2.31 okay.

54
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:12,990
amondul: So that is this kind of your confidence band, it does not cross one do you see that how it's it does not include one.

55
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,250
amondul: So that means that this is statistically significant.

56
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,310
amondul: That makes sense to everybody.

57
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:28,920
Nolaundron Harris: I can't stand myself, thank you for that the line helps big.

58
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:40,830
amondul: we're gonna sing class today guys it's gonna be a musical like the musical episode of buffy.

59
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:43,860
amondul: dating myself.

60
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:48,000
Nolaundron Harris: No question my favorite never let me shut up.

61
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:57,420
amondul: joshua says no.

62
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:00,930
amondul: he's going to defend, please do it.

63
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:11,160
amondul: Alright, so now you're asked to draw a causal diagram to show the possible relationships between household income return to work and postpartum depressive symptoms so remember.

64
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:24,480
amondul: This is our exposure, this is our outcome, this is our potential confounders right, and so, when you set up this triangle you're starting to think through the relationships right and the questions we have to ask ourselves are.

65
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:27,810
amondul: Crossing that one.

66
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:43,140
amondul: Is our co founder associated with our exposure to his are confounded associated with the outcome, and then three, is it not on the causal pathway right his income, not a result of return to work.

67
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:47,970
amondul: So.

68
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:54,120
amondul: You now have this data from up above and they've stratified it by income.

69
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:05,820
amondul: Okay, so now we're going to go through the steps of trying to determine those three questions so since it can founder must be associated the outcome and exposure.

70
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:17,760
amondul: you're being asked to calculate an odds ratio to evaluate the association between income level, which is our potential confounders and the amount of time before returning to work, so we are evaluating this question question number one.

71
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:22,200
amondul: Okay.

72
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,290
amondul: So.

73
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:28,020
amondul: Now.

74
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,470
amondul: you're being asked to do this as an odds ratio.

75
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:39,630
amondul: which everyone probably is like but wait you just told me that the route, the relative risk is the right thing here, because this is a cohort study.

76
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:54,600
amondul: The reason for this is because in a cohort study this is baseline you're recruiting your people you're asking them about all of their potential exposures and confounders and everything and then you fall.

77
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:57,810
amondul: Over time see who develops the outcome.

78
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:07,680
amondul: exposures your confounders are collected at the same time, so the relationship between the exposure and the founder is cross sectional.

79
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:18,540
amondul: Which is why you're just calculating the odds ratio also you're not particularly interested in that actual number like you're not going to report that in your paper it's not your.

80
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:33,360
amondul: Your relationship of interest, and so you just want to know if its associated an author issue is a quick way of telling that right, so an odds ratio is always a correct and true measure of association that's just if you can calculate the relative risk you prefer to do that.

81
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:44,400
amondul: In this case we don't really care what the magnitude is we're not going to report that we're not trying to understand anything about this relationship, except does it exist, is it not one that's all we want to know okay.

82
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:49,440
amondul: So you should have constructed this table and gotten an odds ratio of 2.6 to.

83
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:53,130
amondul: Anybody get something different there.

84
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:00,090
amondul: Alright, so.

85
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:08,280
amondul: This explains this if that doesn't make sense, you can read through this Okay, you could also estimate a relative for us right in this case.

86
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:12,090
amondul: So what do you guys think.

87
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:29,190
amondul: Well we're going to get to that later, I guess, so now we're going to evaluate that question to his income level associated with postpartum depressive symptoms, so if we go back to our little triangle we're evaluating this piece is this arrow real okay.

88
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:34,140
amondul: And they asked you to do that, among the unexposed.

89
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:51,990
amondul: Right in a cohort study, if you want to evaluate that piece of the confounding tribal the association between the founder and the outcome, you will generally look at that, in the unexposed and in a case control study you will usually look at it among the controls.

90
00:11:54,900 --> 00:12:01,170
amondul: To look at that i'm sorry to look at the first question, the founder and the exposure and you'll usually look at that, among the controls in your case control study.

91
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:16,230
amondul: So that's why they're asking you to do this, among the non-exposed Okay, and so you should have gotten a risk ratio here that is 3.22 because now you have this you're looking at you're actually prospective the collected outcome, and so you can calculate the risk ratio.

92
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:18,720
amondul: Right.

93
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:25,860
amondul: So.

94
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:34,860
amondul: I think we've answered yes to both of these questions right 2.62 is definitely not one, so if we go back up here.

95
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:43,560
amondul: Our odds ratio here equals 2.62 is that right and the relative risk here equals What was it 3.22.

96
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:49,590
amondul: Okay, so 2.62 is definitely not one.

97
00:12:51,240 --> 00:13:00,930
amondul: So we can say yes to this question there's an association 3.22 is definitely not one So yes, we have an association there so we've answered yes to our first two questions about it being.

98
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:15,060
amondul: A co founder and I don't think because their income was determined before they went on maternity leave, like how long they're taking to go back to work is not influencing their income that's already exists right, and so we can say no to question three.

99
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:18,090
amondul: Okay, so.

100
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:29,940
amondul: Now we're going to look at the Stat of the specific recruit risk ratios, so we looked at the association between our exposure in our outcome among.

101
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:43,530
amondul: One stratum of our exposure among the lower income, but when we got a better breakfast ratio of 1.51 and, if you look them on the higher income women you get a risk ratio of 1.48 and you're asked how did those compare.

102
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,850
amondul: I would argue that those are essentially the same.

103
00:13:50,280 --> 00:14:02,430
amondul: And I realized that you guys haven't done a lot of this, and so they're not exactly the same number, and it may not be clear to you, but that's that's very, very close, I would consider that to be not meaningfully different from each other.

104
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,310
amondul: Okay.

105
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:12,900
amondul: And now you've given you've been given these competence intervals.

106
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:24,390
amondul: Okay, and you can now tell for sure that these are not statistically significantly different from each other, because if we do low income.

107
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:29,310
amondul: Right we've got if we do our number line again.

108
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:34,230
amondul: we've got one point O is our.

109
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,130
amondul: No value.

110
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,580
amondul: Among lower income, women are our relative risk is 1.51.

111
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:48,120
amondul: And the competence interval is.

112
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:51,540
amondul: Like 1.15 up to.

113
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:56,310
amondul: 1.98 right, so this is kind of our low income.

114
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:58,380
amondul: thing.

115
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:09,030
amondul: i'm going to do a different color for high income women look at me being fancy okay so high income, women are like right here, right there like 1.48.

116
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:13,680
amondul: And their.

117
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:21,330
amondul: Confidence intervals, point six six up to like 3.3 right and so.

118
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,960
amondul: So those definitely overlap right.

119
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:33,750
amondul: Big time, and so they are not statistically significantly different from one another.

120
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:43,620
amondul: As an aside, part of the reason that the confidence interval is so much wider and these low income women.

121
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:58,770
amondul: Is because you have 616 or excuse me, the confidence interval is much wider and up higher income what and pardon me, you have 669 low income women and elite 250 higher income women a smaller sample size is always going to give you a wider confidence interval.

122
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:06,480
amondul: Because you're just less confident in your results right because you don't have as much statistical power with fewer people.

123
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:20,550
amondul: that's more of a biostatistician but I thought I would mention that, for those who are interested Okay, so this tells us, these are definitely not right, we looked at them, we decided they were very close and when we look at the competence intervals super not different because they overlap.

124
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:30,570
amondul: So you were asked to use the information that we previous questions to determine whether income confounds the observed association.

125
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:37,140
amondul: So we've worked through all of it so basically we've decided that it must be associated with the exposure.

126
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:54,210
amondul: And the the controller must be associated with the outcome we did that and we do that on our little triangle 2.62 and 3.22 definitely meets the criteria and based on income is not in the causal pathway between returning to work and postpartum depression okay.

127
00:16:55,380 --> 00:17:00,510
amondul: So it meets all the criteria when we look at the stratum specific risk ratio, they are the same as each other.

128
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:08,370
amondul: And women compare it to the crude our crude if you go back with 1.78.

129
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,430
amondul: Now that looks different to me.

130
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:21,390
amondul: Question see here is having you actually quantify how much different it is we didn't go over this in detail in the lecture.

131
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:31,440
amondul: Because when epidemiologist like to introduce people to the concept of confounded we really want you to think about those three criteria, does it meet those three criteria.

132
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:42,480
amondul: there's also this thing about the 10% rule and I don't like I don't like calling it a rule because it's not right it's not a hard and fast rule but people call it the 10% rule.

133
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:52,890
amondul: So the idea is that if adjusting or stratified by your co founder changes your point estimate from the crude by more than 10%.

134
00:17:53,250 --> 00:18:00,030
amondul: You can consider it to have meaningfully change and be meaningfully different than the crude and, therefore, be a Co founder.

135
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:10,740
amondul: So in this case we're going to take 1.78 which was our crew we're going to subtract from it, our strategy specific estimate for the I forget now, this was the higher low income women.

136
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:22,290
amondul: Low income women and you're going to divide that by the original 1.78 so what percentage of the original has changed and it's changed by 15.2% and if you do the same.

137
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:35,670
amondul: For the high income women it's changed by 16.9% so that suggests to you that the strategy specific are meaningfully different because they're more than 10% different from the crude.

138
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:50,670
amondul: and definitely this would suggest to us that, as a co founder now if you were to do this and you found it was 9.5%, would you be like oh nevermind it means all of the other criteria but it's not 10% so i'm not going to call that a Co founder.

139
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:52,740
amondul: nope.

140
00:18:54,780 --> 00:19:00,510
amondul: Data genealogy students, no, no, no right that's why I hate calling it a rule because it's.

141
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:09,300
amondul: it's a guideline it's a suggestion right you're not going to ignore something that meets all of these other criteria but it's only almost 10% right so it's it.

142
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:15,630
amondul: Is kind of a guideline is a rule of thumb it's another piece of information is a way for you to try to quantify.

143
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:27,540
amondul: How much is meaningful enough, but again that's going to be a judgment call I don't I think everybody in epidemiology would tell you not to like take that 10 and be really rigid about it.

144
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,150
amondul: A realistic suggestion there you go.

145
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,510
amondul: very nice.

146
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,740
amondul: A suggested rule guideline.

147
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:46,230
amondul: Okay, so.

148
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:54,720
amondul: Does everybody feel good about kind of working through those steps, was a very step by step way of trying to decide if in from was a Co founder we decided it was.

149
00:19:55,560 --> 00:20:03,990
amondul: So then you're asked Mike they're still be residual confounded by income, even after controlling for high and low income and why, and the answer is yes.

150
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:16,920
amondul: Right and the idea here, I was talking to one group and like say you say you split it at 50 you have to split it somewhere right these people have an actual income that's a continuous amount of money right a yearly income.

151
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:29,670
amondul: So say you split it low income is less than $50,000 per year, you could have people anywhere from like I don't know $19,000 for your 240 $9,000 for a year right in your low income category.

152
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:37,770
amondul: Do you think that there are differences in these relationships between people to make 19,040 $9,000 per year.

153
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:50,310
amondul: If you drew your little confounding triangle and you had your your exposure of time returning to work and your outcome of depressive symptoms and here's income, and I mean, even with this spread.

154
00:20:50,700 --> 00:21:03,540
amondul: We decided we decided before that income was associated right, but even between 19,040 9000 there's probably different relationships here right that could still have, confounding present within that strategy.

155
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:12,060
amondul: And you could make the same argument for the high income right you get people anywhere from 51,000 to I don't know 200,000 right and that's different.

156
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:19,290
amondul: So that is residual confounding within Australia.

157
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:31,530
amondul: Now one thing you could do is you could use find her straight up right you could create more than two straight up you could do like 19,000 to 25,025 to 3535 48 like you could create finer straight up.

158
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:36,990
amondul: The trouble is you might not have enough numbers to really do that in real life, but that's one way you could do it.

159
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:39,510
amondul: That makes sense to everybody.

160
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:53,220
amondul: And then you were asked to think of other factors that might explain the observe association so there's certainly other things that could potentially be confounders other than income right.

161
00:21:53,730 --> 00:22:02,490
amondul: And a bunch of those are listed here, so these are all other potential confounders so just because you've taken care of one potential competitor doesn't mean you taking care of all of them right.

162
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:09,720
amondul: Did anybody come up with anything different here or does anything not make sense.

163
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:24,510
amondul: Alright, so Question nine here is is basically giving you an example of where you violate that question number three.

164
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:30,660
amondul: In your questions about whether something's that can founder okay that's why you were hinted to draw a diagram.

165
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:35,310
amondul: So the idea here is if women who returned to work less than five weeks after giving.

166
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:42,900
amondul: Birth were less likely to maintain breastfeeding, and breastfeeding is known to impact those part of symptoms is breastfeeding a Co founder.

167
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:52,200
amondul: And the answer here is no because breastfeeding is in the causal pathway, so we keep talking about that, and all the examples I gave you in class and the example of income before.

168
00:22:52,530 --> 00:23:00,300
amondul: The answer was no it's not in the causal pathway, so these things could be confounders here's an example of where it is and allowing you to kind of see what that might look like.

169
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:09,930
amondul: So if you return to work earlier it's harder to maintain breastfeeding, going back to work, causes you to potentially stop breastfeeding, because if you.

170
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:19,920
amondul: Anybody who's had a baby, you have to like pump if you're at work all day away from the baby, they are breastfeeding so to maintain your milk supply, you have to like use breast pump you have to have a place to go to do it.

171
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:30,240
amondul: You know there's a lot of women in jobs, who probably can't do that right, so if you go to back to work earlier you're probably less likely to maintain breastfeeding so returning to work earlier.

172
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:41,820
amondul: causes you to stop breastfeeding, which can then impact postpartum depression symptoms, so this is an example of where the third factor is actually on the causal pathway.

173
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,010
amondul: Quite okay.

174
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,160
amondul: Any questions on Section one before we move on to section two.

175
00:23:55,080 --> 00:24:02,640
amondul: Okay, so section two is about addressing counting so here you have this question about end stage kidney disease and.

176
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:10,380
amondul: You were looking at your cohort study and you were interested in two different types of dialysis carrot meal or haemodialysis a patient survival.

177
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:29,010
amondul: And you find out the patients on peritoneal dialysis have better kidney function prior to dialysis that haemodialysis patients right, so you have rbs need to make a picture, yes, so this is your again thinking about what's your exposure the type of dialysis treatment is your exposure.

178
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:41,160
amondul: Your outcome is survival your potential confounders is pre dialysis kidney function right so thinking through this is kind of doing everything that's in that first.

179
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:52,110
amondul: Question in one question right, so does it make sense, so does it do we answer question, what do we think are confounders is associated the type of dialysis treatment.

180
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:59,640
amondul: Yes, okay type of dialysis treatment does vary by pre dialysis kidney function right so.

181
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:07,890
amondul: It occurs because pre dialysis kidney function will affect which kind of dialysis prescription a physician prescribes.

182
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:14,520
amondul: number two is our co founder associate with the outcome, yes for pre dialysis kidney function as a risk factor for dying.

183
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:26,370
amondul: So while kidney function difference between patients with different types of dialysis it doesn't result from the different dialysis types kidney functions prior to dialysis right so that can't it can't be in the causal pathway.

184
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:30,480
amondul: So, yes it fulfills all three conditions to be a Co founder.

185
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:41,100
amondul: So suppose you were given the data from this cohort study how would you control for count, confounding so you can stratify between dialysis and patient between type of dialysis.

186
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:56,640
amondul: Excuse me, you can look at the association between type of dialysis patients Bible stratified by pre dialysis candy function right you could look at clinically important cut offs or media or something like that you can also adjust right using some sort of statistical modeling method.

187
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:06,000
amondul: So if you're in the very beginning stages of planning the study and you haven't decided on the study design.

188
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:18,030
amondul: You were asked to name three different techniques, you can use in the design phase right So how could you address, confounding in the design phase, so one thing you could do is you can do a trial right like you could randomize patients to different dialysis.

189
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:20,520
amondul: um.

190
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:27,180
amondul: And then it would be irrespective of based on kidney function now, it might.

191
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:31,890
amondul: It might not be ethical right i'm not a.

192
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:38,700
amondul: renal specialist I don't know if it's okay to give someone with a certain like if they have.

193
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:45,090
amondul: kidney disease stage five I don't know if it's okay to suggest peritoneal dialysis for that person like I don't know.

194
00:26:45,690 --> 00:27:01,410
amondul: It seems to me that if the stage they're at determines what they're prescribed them there's some reason you wouldn't want to do this, but, in theory, this is an option, you could also do matching up to a case control study in this case, your cases would be people who died.

195
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:04,290
amondul: You would pick people who didn't die.

196
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:11,100
amondul: who have the same pre dialysis kidney function, and then you would look at type of dialysis and outcome.

197
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,750
amondul: You could do that individually or group matching.

198
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:29,130
amondul: The other like seeking answer C is to restrict, which is essentially like stratification except you're only looking at like half of it right you're only picking a certain kind of.

199
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:35,190
amondul: Individuals with a specific kidney function major saying okay we're only going to look at people with with stage, four and five.

200
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:51,990
amondul: In our study, so we don't have a confounding problem because we restricted the variation of that right it's almost like you have all the data and then stratified in the analysis phase, but you're designing it so you're only looking at one strata essentially does that make sense.

201
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:02,130
amondul: Okay.

202
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:13,440
amondul: So, then, for each of the techniques, you described above you're supposed to speculate on whether you think there could still be by us to to confounding like residual confounding is what that is after applying the study design.

203
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:26,670
amondul: I mean randomization should do it right, if you had a big enough sample size if it's a small study you can, by chance, get people who aren't the randomization cannot work right, but if the randomization.

204
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:35,460
amondul: If you have a big enough sample size it's going to work right so you'd have to have a pretty small study for this to work randomization is fairly foolproof if you have a big enough study.

205
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:39,870
amondul: If you match, but you don't match super closely.

206
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:47,940
amondul: it's essentially that same problem with residual confounding with your straighter right, so if you're basically matching on strata.

207
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:59,580
amondul: Of stage, so if you're saying if you're matching on people will like within two stages say and that's not close enough, you can still have, confounding does that make sense to everybody.

208
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:02,850
amondul: If you still have variation.

209
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:05,670
amondul: In the founder.

210
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:09,420
amondul: within your match pairs or within your group matching.

211
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:14,010
amondul: Then it's not it's not fully taken care of contaminant potentially.

212
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:28,110
amondul: All right and just like it'd be at the range of your kidney function for your inclusion criteria when you restricted is too broad, you could still have residual compounding.

213
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:31,680
amondul: Any questions about that.

214
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:39,810
amondul: everyone's still awake.

215
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:44,460
Nolaundron Harris: we're.

216
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:45,630
Okay.

217
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:50,160
Nolaundron Harris: i'm keeping up i'm just thinking about taking those but thank you.

218
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:56,100
amondul: yeah it's just hard when everyone's got their camera off and no one's responding i'm like.

219
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:01,950
Nolaundron Harris: I would have it on my face looks a mess right now so i'm sorry everyone.

220
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:09,930
amondul: Now is fine, you don't have to turn your camera on i'm not making you do that, I just want to make sure everyone's with me okay.

221
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:16,980
amondul: Part two now researchers are trying to better estimate the association between obesity and kidney disease.

222
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:27,420
amondul: So this is an important question, since the risk of obesity increases with age and delete adulthood and obesity is a risk factor for diabetes it's well known that diabetes and age are both associated with worse kidney function.

223
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:41,970
amondul: So you're designing a cohort study of older people to exam the association between BMI and kidney function in this case change and kidney function over time in 1000 adults, so what is our exposure.

224
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:51,840
Nolaundron Harris: Give me.

225
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:52,890
amondul: your mind.

226
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,500
amondul: What is our outcome.

227
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:05,040
amondul: yep changing kidney function.

228
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,920
amondul: what's our potential founder.

229
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:14,070
Nolaundron Harris: Oh, I see what you do it.

230
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,640
amondul: what's the potential, confounding reevaluating here.

231
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:23,370
amondul: it's right there in question five.

232
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:26,520
Denise White Perkins: Age.

233
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:29,070
amondul: Age yep okay.

234
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:31,230
Nolaundron Harris: i'm talking to him, you don't get.

235
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:35,070
amondul: So if you make your your triangle.

236
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,750
amondul: You know you got the my.

237
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:46,500
amondul: kidney function that's the ugliest K and if anyone has ever made there you go kidney function.

238
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:50,790
amondul: super ugly but it's there so we're interested in this relationship.

239
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:54,150
amondul: Do you think age associated with BMI.

240
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:59,070
amondul: I am sad to say that it is.

241
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:03,690
amondul: Yes.

242
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:07,350
amondul: How about age and can be function.

243
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:09,960
amondul: yeah i'd say so right.

244
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:15,600
amondul: Okay, so, and then I would say that BMI is not causing age.

245
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,140
amondul: So yes, as a potential co founder.

246
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:33,480
amondul: And then you want to know if it's a Co founder in this particular study and I think that this is a good example of restriction right you've restricted to people 50 to 55 so there should be limited variability and age and low and relatively little opportunity for confounding.

247
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,130
amondul: Okay.

248
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:41,160
amondul: Now they want to know what diabetes is a contender in the study.

249
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:51,150
amondul: And then, this case we decide, maybe not because it violates that third one BMI can obesity can cause diabetes.

250
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:54,810
amondul: which can then cause produce kidney function right.

251
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:05,790
amondul: So you've got that straight line causal diagram that violates that third assumption, and then the question is, should you adjust for diabetes, and the answer is no right.

252
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:16,260
amondul: If you've determined, it is not a can founder because it violates any of those three you don't have to adjust for it, or a stratified by it, or anything right it's not a Co founder, so you can just leave it alone and not deal with it.

253
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:27,810
amondul: In this case, this would be considered something else it's called a mediator we're not going to get into that in the study that's a more advanced.

254
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:32,970
amondul: methodological concept, but there are mediation analyses that people can do.

255
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:38,370
amondul: alright.

256
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,820
amondul: let's talk about sunscreen.

257
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:48,750
amondul: If you were you were asked to calculate and interpret the odds ratio of.

258
00:33:50,250 --> 00:34:02,760
amondul: In this case, using sunscreen is the exposed not using sunscreen is unexposed that makes sense right exposed to anything you're putting it on you so you're exposed to it right, and then the outcome is sunburn.

259
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:05,910
amondul: Right that's diseased, and this is not diseased.

260
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,240
amondul: So if you calculate your odds ratio.

261
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:22,020
amondul: You can say that the odds of using sunscreen or 2.25 times higher than the odds in those who have a sunburn, then the odds of using sunscreen have none of those who didn't get a sense for.

262
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,480
amondul: what's weird right.

263
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:30,750
amondul: Some screens should keep you from getting sunburned but here it looks like the people who used it were more likely to go somewhere.

264
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:46,260
amondul: And this is sometimes what happens, you get a weird answer that doesn't make sense and then you go looking for what's going on, is there a bias right, and in this case we're like okay what what could be causing this what kind of confounding let's let's think about confounders right.

265
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,940
amondul: So I heard lots of different answers, as I was going through the group's.

266
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:58,110
amondul: One relationship could be season right more people were phones ringing in the summer and that's also when people are more.

267
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:08,760
amondul: susceptible to getting a sunburn so if this if you were recruiting people over like a full year, the people who use sunscreen in the previous week might have been recruited of the summer and these people might have been recruited in the winter.

268
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:10,290
amondul: Right.

269
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:21,330
amondul: or predisposition to sunburn I know that every time I go out in the sun, I am like getting this SPF 50 and I am putting it on because I am.

270
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:29,250
amondul: very, very light skinned I on white person and I turned bright red in the sun, I am a sunburn are absolutely.

271
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:40,290
amondul: And so I am always this person who's going to be using sunscreen I am more susceptible to a sunburn right, whereas people who choose not to use sunscreen probably are doing so because they don't get sunburned right.

272
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:48,690
amondul: So that is another potential, you know the your skin tone lightness of your skin is another potential controller there right.

273
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:51,450
amondul: All right.

274
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:54,660
amondul: So.

275
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:58,440
amondul: Does anybody have any other ideas about things that could.

276
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,800
amondul: Be potential confounders here that we didn't list.

277
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,470
amondul: That they wanted to mention.

278
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:17,700
Nolaundron Harris: Interesting thought, but it just made me think of if we were comparing people who were going on vacation.

279
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:24,150
Nolaundron Harris: For people who are not more people when they go on vacation go like you were saying sunny your areas and so.

280
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:36,600
Nolaundron Harris: Typically, like up here in the Pacific Northwest and nobody was playing right now, because folks have been at home, but leaving you can forget and then come back I got burned, because I haven't been using it so.

281
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:45,540
amondul: yeah that's exactly right yes yeah I mean, I think you could even generalize that more and say that the people who use sunscreen are probably in situations where they're.

282
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:46,800
amondul: exposed to some are.

283
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:47,400
Right.

284
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:56,010
amondul: Using like the people who didn't use sunscreen the previous week, maybe they didn't use it, because they're sitting inside watching movies right where did you put them.

285
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,300
Nolaundron Harris: Right right right right.

286
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:06,720
Nolaundron Harris: that's a good one, if you're active outdoor activities or indoor if you stay outdoors indoors that's another one, this is interesting i'm sorry i'll shut up.

287
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:09,090
amondul: you're exactly right that's a great one.

288
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:20,160
amondul: Alright, so one critic of your previous study said the researchers should have used matching to account for confounding so in 2015 a match case control design was used to look at the same question.

289
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:33,180
amondul: So in this case, they matched on time, meaning, I guess, like season of the year, race, ethnicity, which gets to some degree at skin tone right and sex and they found the following data.

290
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:56,790
amondul: So this is matched so note that they're looking at this is pairs not people right, so there were 600 people in this study 300 match cares Okay, so, if you would, in this case it's a match study, so you get a matched odds ratio and so you would take 40 over 75.

291
00:37:58,230 --> 00:37:59,160
amondul: Does that make sense.

292
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:12,720
amondul: So among the participants, the odds of wearing sunscreen were point five, three times lower among those who had developed sunburned as compared to those who did not develop summer so this looks much more like we would expect right.

293
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:18,870
amondul: You can flip it and say that the odds of words and scream or higher among those who did not.

294
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:21,600
amondul: develop a summer and compare those who did.

295
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:24,030
amondul: Either way, is correct.

296
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:43,350
amondul: So now you're asked to compare the crude associations and, in fact, you see the crudest way higher right after matching you see actually the complete reversal of the association so once the confounding was accounted for associate the true association was observed.

297
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:53,400
amondul: Any questions about that before we move on to effect modification.

298
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,030
amondul: All right.

299
00:38:58,290 --> 00:39:04,860
amondul: In 2005 a cross sectional study was conducted on 5000 employees at the University of fame fortunate friends.

300
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:22,890
amondul: Employees to the survey into evaluating whether living within one mile of work was related to walking to work so employees have you have fff who were surveyed we're also asked that car ownership and others things right Okay, so our exposure here is proximity to work.

301
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:30,240
amondul: Being near is exposed being far is unexposed outcome is walking to work.

302
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,890
amondul: Not having the outcome is taking motorized transport to work.

303
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:38,550
amondul: So not walking okay.

304
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:42,480
amondul: So you're asked to.

305
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:55,050
amondul: compute the overall prevalence odds ratio of the relationship between residential proximity to work and walking to work, so it should be the Cross product here and your your crude is 1.64.

306
00:39:56,070 --> 00:40:06,870
amondul: Okay, so in this study the also walking to work with 64% higher among people living within one mile of their work that among people living greater than one mile from work that sounds pretty reasonable right.

307
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:15,780
amondul: So we are now thinking about whether car ownership ownership influences walking.

308
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:23,880
amondul: So now we stratify by car ownership, so our third variable here is cars owning one of our cars are owning zero cars.

309
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:33,510
amondul: And you were asked to compute the association separately for car owners and those who did not own a car So here we have car owners and here we have people who didn't have a car.

310
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,030
amondul: That also makes sense right.

311
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:49,410
amondul: And you were asked to fill in this table so you've got your crude your stratum specific on your car and your strategy specific for no car note that your odds ratio falls kind of neatly in the middle.

312
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:56,070
amondul: of your competence that our goal if you're doing this on a test say you for your crude you got to.

313
00:40:57,150 --> 00:41:05,610
amondul: You should immediately go back and figure out what you did wrong, because it should be between 1.46 and 1.83 right big clue.

314
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:20,730
amondul: Alright, so you were now asked is owning a car and effect modifier so if we use that flow chart there was on the last slide of the lecture last time are your strategies specific odds ratios different from each other.

315
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,840
amondul: And the answer here is yes.

316
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:28,350
amondul: And so, yes, we have effect modification.

317
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:30,390
amondul: Okay.

318
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:41,160
amondul: So the association between living in close proximity to work and walking to work is different among people with and without a car car owners are just like no I don't care how close I live i'm getting in my car.

319
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:45,210
amondul: I, like my car driving lazy and have a car.

320
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:50,310
amondul: Non car owners are much more likely to walk if they live close to work.

321
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:56,700
amondul: Alright, so you're now asked to interpret and discuss.

322
00:41:57,930 --> 00:42:13,380
amondul: This and so essentially you're going to say among these people surveyed people who don't own cars have three times higher odds of walking work if they live within one mile than if they live farther however among the same people who own cars it didn't really matter how close they lived.

323
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:14,820
amondul: Right.

324
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:22,950
amondul: And so you were asked to kind of come up with a story about why that might make sense.

325
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:32,280
amondul: Here we said, the people who live close to work might have an easier time walking through this with a faraway if people have access to cars, they might be more likely to drive, regardless of how far they live.

326
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:38,760
amondul: Maybe they have Aaron saran are they they're picking up kids or they might just be more used to driving.

327
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:40,950
amondul: Okay.

328
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:48,840
amondul: Does anybody else have anything else interesting that they came up with here for this explanation.

329
00:42:56,010 --> 00:42:59,040
amondul: Alright, so you are you present your findings.

330
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:09,990
amondul: At a national public health conference and audit audience Member brings up the fact that among those who own cars people with lower income, maybe less able to pay for maintenance or gas costs, and so they asked what an income is an effect modifier.

331
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:17,970
amondul: Of the association between proximity to work and walking among people who own cars, so now we're like looking at it even further effect codification so we've got one of our straight.

332
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:28,140
amondul: Straight outta we have one stratum one of our straighter sorry I said i'm like that's that was not right, we have one of our straight up.

333
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:42,630
amondul: The car owners and we are now further stratify by income right and you were asked to compute the problems odds ratio for the association between proximity to work and walking among high and low income individuals who have cars.

334
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:50,730
amondul: So we get 1.89 and 1.51, and this is one of those like judgment call things right and you've got the.

335
00:43:52,110 --> 00:43:55,800
amondul: you've got these confidence intervals, so if we do our little number line.

336
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:01,170
amondul: I would say, those look pretty similar right, especially if you do.

337
00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:05,940
amondul: Our number line thing like say this is 1.0 that's our no value right.

338
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:10,680
amondul: we've got our high income car owners with 1.89.

339
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:17,010
amondul: going from like 1.432 2.50.

340
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:23,790
amondul: And then, if we go i'm going to go blue this time getting really fancy super fancy.

341
00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:29,130
amondul: So now we've got our.

342
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:35,490
amondul: Oh no, I think I think I was to cancer at the back here, so if we've got our.

343
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:51,720
amondul: Low income car owners now so they have a 1.51, ranging from 1.18 up to 1.93 right and so these definitely overlap, the overlap is like.

344
00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:54,720
amondul: All in here right.

345
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:57,090
amondul: Lots of overlap.

346
00:44:58,230 --> 00:45:00,840
amondul: And so, these are not statistically significantly different from each other.

347
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:02,490
amondul: Right.

348
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:05,760
amondul: Yes, your activity.

349
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:21,180
amondul: If we if we assume that the odds ratios are us table, but our confidence intervals, the two tickets straight up didn't overlap, but they were still close together.

350
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,860
amondul: Well, if they were that close together.

351
00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:37,350
amondul: And they were not overlapping I mean they are statistically significantly different, that this would be higher right, it would probably mean that you had an extremely large study sometimes when you have a really large study.

352
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:51,210
amondul: Things that aren't meaningfully different can be statistically significantly different from each other so small differences can be statistically significantly different, so at that point, you would have to determine whether you thought.

353
00:45:52,770 --> 00:45:57,270
amondul: that this was a meaningful difference or not right that would be sort of a judgment call at that point.

354
00:45:59,070 --> 00:46:02,370
amondul: You might still report it but not make a big deal out of it in your paper.

355
00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:13,830
amondul: Okay, so we decided, though, in this case that they're really not different because the confidence intervals overlap quite a lot.

356
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:17,160
amondul: And so.

357
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:25,050
amondul: You probably don't think that income modifies the effect of proximity to work on walking to work among car owners, but now we want to think about whether.

358
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:36,840
amondul: confounded by income helps to explain why be observed, no association between proximity to work and walking to work among car owners right So this was our This was our odds are odds ratio right.

359
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:44,430
amondul: i'm not coroner's it was like three and it was basically no among our current, so now we want to evaluate with it, whether this thing might be a.

360
00:46:45,990 --> 00:46:51,330
amondul: Co founder, so we draw our causal diagram we've got our exposure in our outcome of this our potential co founder.

361
00:46:53,580 --> 00:47:00,420
amondul: And if we think about the relationship between proximity to work and income among car owners, for those who live near to work.

362
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:11,670
amondul: You want to report the proportion of those who are high income and those that living far from work or high income so we've got 34% who are 34.5% who are high income.

363
00:47:12,450 --> 00:47:23,070
amondul: Among those who live near to work and 67.3% among those who live far to work, and if you calculate the prevalence ratio, you can see clearly that it is not one right, so I think.

364
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:29,190
amondul: That tells us that, yes, we can check this There does seem to be an association there right.

365
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:34,350
amondul: Now we want to know about income and walking to work.

366
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:40,470
amondul: So we know that that is associated in that in that direction right inversely associated.

367
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:57,900
amondul: Next okay so you're supposed to put a plus at the proportion of individuals who are high income is greater than those living the work and minus if it if there's a lower proportion of high income people among those living near work right and so that's what we just did.

368
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:08,760
amondul: So now we're asked to consider whether hiring people walk more or less than low income people, independent of where they live, so now we're looking at among car owners who live far.

369
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:16,920
amondul: What proportion of high income people walk to work and low income people walk to work OK, so now we're looking among the unexposed.

370
00:48:18,030 --> 00:48:21,210
amondul: At this can founder outcome relationship.

371
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:23,820
amondul: And so.

372
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:40,140
amondul: Among high income 60% 61% walk to work on low income 27.4 and you get this high prevalence ratio so again, I think we can now put a little checkmark here, and in fact we can put it with a plus sign right.

373
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:54,270
amondul: So there's a higher prevalence of walking to work among the high income population compared to the low income group, so the plus sign here to indicate a positive association, so I think we have.

374
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:59,490
amondul: and your network is not causing income right.

375
00:49:00,870 --> 00:49:05,940
amondul: So we have evaluated that yes, this very well, could be a Co founder and if you follow that.

376
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:10,020
amondul: flow chart right We calculated.

377
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:19,770
amondul: The stratum specific they're the same as each other but different from the crude which means, confounding right according to our flow chart on the last slide from last time.

378
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:26,940
amondul: Alright guys any questions.

379
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:41,670
Nolaundron Harris: To me tippett from the last one, you did, I think it was be can we typically so if it says proximity between what I mean nevermind i'm going to take that back my question does not exist.

380
00:49:42,390 --> 00:49:42,870
Okay.

381
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:45,900
amondul: Okay.

382
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:48,540
amondul: anybody else have any questions.

383
00:49:52,650 --> 00:50:02,550
amondul: Alright, then here's what we're going to do here's our plan we're going to take a five minute break and come back at 425 and i'm going to give you the lecture on causality which is not that long.

384
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:13,140
amondul: And then next time at the beginning of class, we will do the exercise about causality and then we will spend the rest of the time working on.

385
00:50:14,190 --> 00:50:15,480
amondul: Reviewing for exam to.

386
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:26,490
amondul: I had asked people to fill out a questionnaire about whether they had topics to discuss on the last day of class, we only got one response to that, so I don't think we have enough.

387
00:50:27,330 --> 00:50:36,720
amondul: topics to to break into groups and discuss out, so I think what will happen is I will give a lecture on that day about my own research and give you some examples of how these.

388
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:42,630
amondul: Different study designs different methodological issues have come up in my own research and how we dealt with them.

389
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:47,880
amondul: So I think that's kind of a cool way to sort of bring it all together How does that sound.

390
00:50:51,930 --> 00:50:54,480
amondul: Okay, so that'll be the last day.

391
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:56,850
amondul: fun with abby.

392
00:50:58,770 --> 00:51:02,220
amondul: there'll be a little status for you joshua I promise a little bit scouting stuff.

393
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:08,490
amondul: Okay five minute break come back in five minutes ready to do causality.

394
00:55:28,170 --> 00:55:29,490
amondul: alrighty guys.

395
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:36,780
amondul: started in the middle, we can't have that.

396
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:42,720
amondul: Alright, so we're going to talk about causality.

397
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:56,100
amondul: So this is sort of integrating everything we've learned over this course because remember our whole point is to try to decide if some exposure is causing a health outcome okay.

398
00:55:57,330 --> 00:56:07,230
amondul: And so you know the big picture motivations behind this everyone to make public health division decisions, we want to design interventions, we want to prevent disease, we want to use our research dollars wisely.

399
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:17,850
amondul: And you know the factor we act on must be a true cause an event conditioner characteristic the proceeds of the disease event and without which the disease event either would not have occurred.

400
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:28,710
amondul: at all, or would not have occurred until some later time, so we want this to be a real cause if we're intervening on something that isn't a real cause we've wasted our time and effort.

401
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:35,070
amondul: And this is one of my favorite does anybody else like X KC D does anybody big nerd like me.

402
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:48,690
amondul: Today excuse eaters so to me, this is one of my favorites I used to think or legislation, and then I took a statistics class, and now I don't sound like the class out well, maybe.

403
00:56:49,710 --> 00:56:56,760
amondul: I would may only be because I really think it should say that I took an epidemiologist class, not a statistics class so.

404
00:56:57,870 --> 00:56:59,910
amondul: Like you know Sydney he didn't ask me.

405
00:57:01,650 --> 00:57:09,480
amondul: All right, alright, so an epidemiologist must be a skeptic right that's kind of our job that's what we're really good at we we like to tear apart.

406
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:19,590
amondul: Everything come up with why it might be wrong right because we found some association right a study will report some association between an exposure and an outcome.

407
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:32,040
amondul: But we have to decide, do we think that that association is biased, we have to think through is there selection bias information bias, confounding or could it just be due to chance right, you have to decide.

408
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:46,020
amondul: and be critical about this association before you decide you think it's real, you have to kind of rule out all of these possible sources of bias or chance findings before you're like yeah I think this is a real causal associations.

409
00:57:47,190 --> 00:57:59,730
amondul: So this isn't easy right, it requires critical judgment and enter interpretation you have to rule out confining bias and chance and remember that no single study is ever sufficient in establishing causal inference we do our we do lots of different studies.

410
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:09,300
amondul: Because any study population is not going to be comprehensive right, you need to study it in lots of different types of people lots of different situations you're going to find out.

411
00:58:09,630 --> 00:58:15,480
amondul: Each study is like a piece of the puzzle, and you need multiple pieces of the puzzle to really see the full picture.

412
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:28,980
amondul: So here's an example of kind of how this plays out the association between vitamin E and coronary heart disease alright, so this is all the way back in 1984.

413
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:32,460
amondul: year I graduated from high school.

414
00:58:33,570 --> 00:58:42,240
amondul: an ecological study of vitamin D and coronary heart disease mortality in 24 countries alright so each of these little dots as a country, Finland, New Zealand, the UK.

415
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:53,970
amondul: You can guess what the art what many of them are right and they're looking at alpha copper all supply per capita and heart disease.

416
00:58:57,030 --> 00:59:07,110
amondul: And so what it looks like I would say is that the more you know after call for all there is per person in terms of supplements the less coronary heart disease there is.

417
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:13,830
amondul: But somebody told me why we're not blown off our feet by this finding.

418
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:19,170
amondul: sneak logical study, which is subject to what.

419
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:30,180
amondul: The July ecological fallacy exactly right, so the people who are who are taking supplements may not be the people who are being not getting our seats right, we need individual level data so.

420
00:59:31,470 --> 00:59:33,570
amondul: This was published the next year in 1985.

421
00:59:34,410 --> 00:59:43,980
amondul: This was a cross sectional study of vitamin D and coronary heart disease right, so this is plasma vitamin D, so this is blood levels it's not even just like what they're what they're taking it it's not supplements or diet.

422
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:54,450
amondul: it's actual blood levels vitamin D, this is elderly people in India Okay, these are all Indian people and they're old and so we're looking at different quantities.

423
00:59:55,230 --> 01:00:08,340
amondul: of exposure and so as we increase across quintiles and looks like looks like the people with the lowest vitamin D levels are the highest risk right and that is a statistically significant result, the rest of these are not.

424
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:14,190
amondul: But this lowest group the people with the very lowest levels are higher risk okay.

425
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:19,770
amondul: Okay, but tell me what could be wrong with this it's cross sectional So what does that mean.

426
01:00:21,540 --> 01:00:22,110
morality.

427
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:26,580
Joshua Tucker: You can't establish cause and effect or even direction of association.

428
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:34,980
amondul: that's right, because what did they do, they took these people and said hey give me some of your blood also do you have heart disease you're not.

429
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:37,860
amondul: Right so.

430
01:00:38,970 --> 01:00:46,860
amondul: Tell me a story about how vitamin so we think, maybe vitamin E low vitamin D is causing heart disease tell me a story about how it could be the other way around.

431
01:00:53,610 --> 01:00:59,250
Nolaundron Harris: Oh good question, maybe not enough, is in the blood that was drawn out at the time, and so.

432
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:01,200
The person already has.

433
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,230
Nolaundron Harris: Do not start there's no.

434
01:01:06,090 --> 01:01:08,760
Nolaundron Harris: difference between like the beginning of.

435
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:19,020
amondul: you're almost there like what are the people who have heart disease stopped taking supplements.

436
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:22,230
Nolaundron Harris: Because they were saying they were making them not feel good or their doctor told them.

437
01:01:22,230 --> 01:01:22,590
To.

438
01:01:24,570 --> 01:01:27,600
amondul: write what if coronary heart disease.

439
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:40,410
amondul: People are, for whatever reason they're not absorbing it as well because they're sick I don't know like there's a million ways that you can imagine that the disease is causing the blood levels to be low.

440
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:52,530
amondul: Rather than having low blood levels causes the disease right, so this is interesting pretty cool but we can't really say for sure, also, I would say, this is a very select population small select population.

441
01:01:53,730 --> 01:02:00,060
amondul: Alright So here we have a bigger side, this is from 2004 also in India apparently they're the vitamin E.

442
01:02:01,890 --> 01:02:02,820
amondul: Researchers.

443
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:12,540
amondul: Okay, so we've got all these different things that they're measuring serum antioxidant levels in the study population, this is a.

444
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:26,250
amondul: prospective now we're looking at vitamin E is higher in the controls that in the patients Oh, excuse me now, this is the case control study OK so again, we have a problem with temporality right.

445
01:02:30,810 --> 01:02:31,680
amondul: But interesting.

446
01:02:33,030 --> 01:02:37,830
amondul: That is statistically significant because the p value is less than point 05 So these are different from each other.

447
01:02:39,390 --> 01:02:39,600
Right.

448
01:02:41,190 --> 01:02:54,150
amondul: Interesting to that is the only one right it's very specific to vitamin D you're not seeing differences in vitamin A or any of these other things so that makes you think, maybe, maybe it's something really going on with vitamin E right.

449
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:59,130
amondul: could still be the coronary heart disease is specifically affecting vitamin A we don't know.

450
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:11,400
amondul: All right, this is the nurses health study, this is a prospective cohort study they recruited women at baseline who are healthy and did not have heart disease, and they took their blood and the second in the freezer.

451
01:03:12,450 --> 01:03:23,460
amondul: Okay, so we have blood samples on these people from before they ever had disease, and then we follow them for many several decades, and we find out if.

452
01:03:24,270 --> 01:03:42,870
amondul: They are a higher risk or not alright So here we have people using vitamin D supplements and people using multivitamins we've got crude now we've got them adjusting for lots of other things, so now we're taking, we have a study design that takes into account temporality.

453
01:03:44,430 --> 01:03:49,290
amondul: We also have a study design that minimizes selection bias, because it has a prospective cohort study.

454
01:03:50,310 --> 01:03:54,120
amondul: We also have a study design, that is.

455
01:03:55,170 --> 01:04:05,250
amondul: accounting for confounding at the analysis level by doing a multi variable model okay information bias let's talk about this, what is the exposure here.

456
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:17,940
amondul: yeah do they are do they not used by many supplements, do you think the non users could be getting a lot of vitamin D and other way.

457
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:23,490
amondul: Or the non users necessarily people with low vitamin E.

458
01:04:25,950 --> 01:04:32,670
amondul: Not necessarily right like if you eat a diet very high in vitamin E I think it's like certain oils and nuts and stuff.

459
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:41,400
amondul: Then you could not be taking a supplement and have very high levels right, so we could have some information bias here.

460
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:57,360
amondul: I think it would be difficult, if you had information bias, because this is a prospective study you asked to them about this use of this vitamin before they ever became a case, would you expect that information bias, to be differential or non differential.

461
01:05:05,970 --> 01:05:12,720
amondul: For to be differential it would be have to be different in the cases and controls and ask them about this before they were ever sick.

462
01:05:15,030 --> 01:05:30,840
amondul: See, it seems hard to imagine away and in this kind of study, where you're asking about an exposure at baseline before they ever got sick it's really hard to imagine how any misclassification can be different in cases and controls right.

463
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:33,420
amondul: So.

464
01:05:35,190 --> 01:05:43,260
amondul: anybody has might be toward the know so we see something and it's statistically significant so that suggest to us that there could actually be a stronger association than this right.

465
01:05:44,910 --> 01:05:50,070
amondul: And so we are seeing that using vitamin D supplements is protective for coronary heart disease, so that's pretty cool.

466
01:05:54,360 --> 01:06:03,780
amondul: And it's stronger than the multivitamin association which makes some sense right kind of specific divided mini all right i'm getting a little more getting more convinced.

467
01:06:05,370 --> 01:06:06,750
amondul: there's something there let's do a trial.

468
01:06:09,180 --> 01:06:09,960
amondul: Where you guys think.

469
01:06:11,130 --> 01:06:12,240
amondul: we'll run out and take my money.

470
01:06:25,530 --> 01:06:37,110
amondul: they're close to one and the confidence intervals include one so there's really no significant difference in any pretty gastric disease outcomes are definitely cause the vitamin E use credit placebo.

471
01:06:39,180 --> 01:06:44,820
amondul: However, again, I would like to point out to you that you could have very different.

472
01:06:46,950 --> 01:06:54,450
amondul: You could have information bias here right because the people taking the placebo could be eating a lot of vitamin D heavy foods right.

473
01:06:55,290 --> 01:07:03,510
amondul: food sources are not really taking into account here, so if you're doing this in I think this was done in the US population that is generally replete provided money.

474
01:07:04,260 --> 01:07:13,500
amondul: you've got people who are replete are being given a placebo and people who are replete who are being given more vitamin E so maybe if you already have enough giving more doesn't do anything.

475
01:07:14,370 --> 01:07:29,790
amondul: Maybe if you're deficient it's bad right, so this is where I told you that randomized control trials are the best evidence, they are the least biased evidence, but they only answer the exact question you're asking.

476
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:37,980
amondul: Right, this is not really answering this child's not really answering the question about whether vitamin D status.

477
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:42,270
amondul: which you would probably measure by a blood level.

478
01:07:44,010 --> 01:07:48,120
amondul: is associated career corner, heart disease or credit as good as these outcomes right.

479
01:07:52,410 --> 01:07:52,800
amondul: So.

480
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,020
amondul: something to think about.

481
01:07:57,360 --> 01:08:04,650
amondul: Alright, so we have a theory, we have a hypothesis, a study is designed to collect data analyze results and interpret them.

482
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:10,680
amondul: So you want to think about is this theory even biologically possible, are there any other studies that have been done.

483
01:08:12,180 --> 01:08:14,190
amondul: When you're kind of making this hypothesis.

484
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:23,880
amondul: you're going to design your study you're going to think carefully about sources of bias how we're going to recruit and retain our participants what confounders are we going to collect information on so that we can adjust for them in our analysis phase.

485
01:08:24,330 --> 01:08:33,750
amondul: And how are we going to collect our data to minimize information by us then we're going to analyze the results are we going to stratify are we going to adjust do we think we've got the founding effect modification, what are we going to do.

486
01:08:34,650 --> 01:08:40,800
amondul: And then we interpret them how confident, are we that we got a causal relationship between our exposure and our outcome.

487
01:08:42,360 --> 01:08:43,650
amondul: that's kind of the whole.

488
01:08:45,090 --> 01:08:45,630
amondul: gamut.

489
01:08:46,650 --> 01:08:51,600
amondul: And one of the ways that we think about this in that last piece is hills criteria right.

490
01:08:51,990 --> 01:08:58,110
amondul: So its roster Bradford Hill and Richard doll were the first to demonstrate the connection between cigarette smoking and lung cancer and hill adapted.

491
01:08:58,530 --> 01:09:09,240
amondul: His criteria from the 1964 surgeon general's report on smoking, health, so these criteria or something that people see in all of their first fb classes, they are talked about still a lot to this day, and they came out of this work.

492
01:09:11,490 --> 01:09:18,360
amondul: i'm not going to read this to you can read his his words, if you want so here are his criteria for assessing causality.

493
01:09:19,470 --> 01:09:23,670
amondul: Is there a temporal relationship, what is the strength of association dose response.

494
01:09:24,150 --> 01:09:37,710
amondul: replication of findings biological plausibility consideration of alternate explanations cessation exposure specificity of the association and consistency with other knowledge right i'm going to go through these and we're going to talk about each one and what they need.

495
01:09:38,940 --> 01:09:52,950
amondul: We talked about this a lot right exposure most come before disease that is essential, you cannot establish causality without knowing the correct without having the correct temporal relationship so cross sectional studies are great is control studies, maybe.

496
01:09:54,390 --> 01:09:56,100
amondul: might suffer from the same problem.

497
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:03,660
amondul: You know this is where we have this problem, you also have to think about do we have the right timing.

498
01:10:05,190 --> 01:10:15,570
amondul: And I will tell you a good example of this is breast cancer, there are windows of exposure that are very important for breast cancer, and it is during important moments of breast development so in utero.

499
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:22,410
amondul: adolescence when breast tissue tissue is developing during pregnancy, when the breast is undergoing a lot of tissue remodeling.

500
01:10:23,310 --> 01:10:31,050
amondul: menopause right So these are important time windows for breast tissue development and exposures are more important in those windows and other windows.

501
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:36,720
amondul: So if you ask about a woman's exposure to something in like her 30s when she's not pregnant.

502
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:48,930
amondul: It might not show in association with the outcome of breast cancer, but if you asked her about that during pregnancy or if you asked about that exploded during adolescence that's what it might be important right.

503
01:10:49,470 --> 01:10:58,740
amondul: So that's the right timing thing right, so you have to be asking about exposure at the right moment for it to be relevant to disease that makes sense.

504
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:06,030
amondul: If we go back to our dumb example from the very first.

505
01:11:07,110 --> 01:11:12,780
amondul: exercise we did about outbreak investigation, if you ask people about eating chicken two weeks before the party who cares right.

506
01:11:13,830 --> 01:11:17,340
amondul: You need to have asked them about eating chicken in the window that was important.

507
01:11:20,190 --> 01:11:33,810
amondul: I was a possibility, so, is it biologically possible this idea could this exposure biologically cause disease, I will tell you that we get real creative and you can probably come up with a story to make almost anything biologically laws of what you tried hard enough right.

508
01:11:34,830 --> 01:11:46,200
amondul: there's some fiction in some discussion sections of papers right, and this requires you to understand the biology and the cause the etiology of disease so it's important you know this is important.

509
01:11:47,430 --> 01:11:54,300
amondul: um but, again, this isn't, the only thing right because you can, if you try hard enough, you can come up with a story for almost anything.

510
01:11:55,950 --> 01:11:58,770
amondul: This is consistent with other knowledge right if the findings.

511
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:11,250
amondul: aren't consistent with other knowledge, the evidence should be regarded with more caution so, for example, we know that cigarette smoking is associated cardiovascular disease, so it makes sense that air pollution might also be associated with it right that's an example of consistency.

512
01:12:16,020 --> 01:12:22,410
amondul: replication of the findings, this is really important, do you see an association, consistency and other subgroups or populations.

513
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:28,680
amondul: Now, keep in mind, you could have effect notification right.

514
01:12:30,210 --> 01:12:35,400
amondul: So, if you look at an old group, and then you look at a young group and you find an inconsistent association.

515
01:12:35,730 --> 01:12:45,720
amondul: It could be that your findings in one of those studies are not correct, or it could be that you have effect modification by age, which is why we do this lots and lots and lots of times right.

516
01:12:46,140 --> 01:12:47,520
amondul: To try to kind of hone in on.

517
01:12:47,820 --> 01:12:55,320
amondul: Okay, most of the studies were looking older people are seeing something the ones that are mostly the ones that are looking and younger people aren't so we think there's something going on there or.

518
01:12:55,530 --> 01:13:07,950
amondul: While there is this one weird study that didn't see anything and old people, but all of the other studies are seeing stuff stuff so we think that one's a weirdo right that's why we have to do lots of studies one thing you have to be careful of is.

519
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:16,980
amondul: You know if there's this is sort of the vitamin E problem right if you have some range of exposure right.

520
01:13:18,330 --> 01:13:32,700
amondul: And so, like let's say diet in here we're looking at pictures of donuts right so say if you eat like this is like less than one per year, and this is like two per day right in terms of donut eating.

521
01:13:34,110 --> 01:13:46,890
amondul: And let's say if you're eating like this, many donuts you're at higher risk but you're looking in a population that will needs this many donuts because I don't know dunkin donuts has not been franchises in that country, yet.

522
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:53,670
amondul: you're not going to see any association between donut eating and your disease right because you have to eat this many.

523
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:55,980
amondul: For it to show up.

524
01:13:57,360 --> 01:14:03,600
amondul: So this is why you have to look at lots of different subgroups because you might have low variability and exposure in one group.

525
01:14:03,870 --> 01:14:12,510
amondul: And then higher variability another we see this a lot with vitamin studies right, if you look at maybe developing populations, where there are people who are truly deficient.

526
01:14:12,780 --> 01:14:16,800
amondul: You might see an increased risk of disease and the deficient people, but if you look in the US population.

527
01:14:17,460 --> 01:14:28,530
amondul: there's variations, but they're all replete like there's people who are they have a variation and their levels but there's nobody who's truly deficient because everybody's pretty well nourished right, and so you might not see anything.

528
01:14:31,410 --> 01:14:35,940
amondul: You have to consider alternate explanations and this is what we've spent most of the class talking about right.

529
01:14:36,930 --> 01:14:46,560
amondul: Could there be, confounding could there be selection bias information bias chance what other factors might explain the association right our coffee and pancreatic cancer example we have.

530
01:14:47,070 --> 01:14:56,700
amondul: A selection bias, it could be smoking as a co founder right there's lots of things you have to think about that could potentially be biasing your association okay.

531
01:15:00,210 --> 01:15:08,310
amondul: The dose response criteria is interesting, with increasing level of exposure do we see an increasing risk of disease right so smoking is a really, really.

532
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:15,960
amondul: Very good example of this right, it is a very strong dose response relationship, the more exposure lungs have.

533
01:15:16,530 --> 01:15:24,300
amondul: to smoke in a person's lifetime, the higher that person's risk of lung cancer, so the number, the more cigarettes you smoke per day.

534
01:15:24,630 --> 01:15:37,290
amondul: The age who started smoking, the younger, you were the higher your risk of lung cancer, the death of inhalation all of these things are strongly associated with risk of lung cancer dose response very nicely linear increased risk, the more.

535
01:15:37,980 --> 01:15:46,320
amondul: Exposure you have now, the lack of a dose response does not mean you're finding as a real, you can have other kinds of associations right.

536
01:15:47,190 --> 01:15:50,490
amondul: A U shaped association a really good example of this is like bodyweight.

537
01:15:51,300 --> 01:16:03,420
amondul: Really really thin people are often and mortality right, so if you're if you're if this is on weight right, and this for BMI, and this is like less than 18 down here, and this is like 35 plus up here.

538
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:12,870
amondul: You know the higher we always think of higher BMI is being associated with increased risk of mortality, but, at the very low levels, very thin people are also at increased risk because they might be sick.

539
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:30,600
amondul: Right, people who are at the end of life, or who are very ill will often lose weight and so there's this U shaped relationship between BMI and fighting it, I told you about threshold right if you vitamin examples are really good examples of that if you're if you are.

540
01:16:32,670 --> 01:16:39,330
amondul: You know you have a low risk of disease and then at some point, your risk goes your risk goes risk goes up.

541
01:16:39,900 --> 01:16:53,880
amondul: But it kind of plateaus right So if you have if you're replete your risk is low, if you're deficient your risk is high, but like more vitamin doesn't get you anything better does that make sense at some point you Max out.

542
01:16:55,470 --> 01:17:06,540
amondul: So these are real as well, so I don't want you to ever think that because you don't have a dose response it isn't real, but if you do see one, it gives you some confidence that your association is real.

543
01:17:10,140 --> 01:17:15,090
amondul: cessation of exposure to the elimination or reduction of exposure to the factor, reduce the risk of disease.

544
01:17:16,410 --> 01:17:19,980
amondul: This is really helpful in things like.

545
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:24,480
amondul: cleaning up environmental contaminants for.

546
01:17:26,550 --> 01:17:28,920
amondul: Getting rid of a look, an infection.

547
01:17:30,030 --> 01:17:30,360
amondul: Right.

548
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:37,320
amondul: One of the damage is irreversible, so, for example, things like cancer, this may not work so well.

549
01:17:39,930 --> 01:17:44,820
amondul: So, this one is one where you have to decide if this makes sense or not.

550
01:17:48,270 --> 01:17:57,870
amondul: strength of association, so if your association is small, perhaps it's less believable the odds ratio or relative risk for smoking and lung cancer is like.

551
01:17:58,890 --> 01:18:15,870
amondul: 25 to 50 depending on what study you look at that is huge you never see that most things you're going to if you're lucky you get an odds ratio to that's a strong association average of 25 off the charts right.

552
01:18:17,340 --> 01:18:23,100
amondul: So if you have a really like 1.2 1.3 maybe it's less believable.

553
01:18:24,270 --> 01:18:32,250
amondul: Confidence intervals, you know you have to be calibrated a little bit to the size of your study, if you have a small study new the first one to look at this and you find something.

554
01:18:33,930 --> 01:18:45,570
amondul: Maybe it's real could be chance right so competence intervals tell you something about how likely it is that your results are due to chance the magnitude of the association is what we're talking about here, but the strength of association criteria.

555
01:18:49,650 --> 01:18:52,950
amondul: This one is one that I think is a little bit less.

556
01:18:55,230 --> 01:19:00,690
amondul: Especially as we've moved into chronic disease, this one is less.

557
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:11,940
amondul: used or less believe the idea is that one exposure, causes one disease, so this might be true of like an infectious agent because of the particular infection particular disease right.

558
01:19:12,420 --> 01:19:20,430
amondul: But in the area of era of studying chronic disease there are lots of exposures that caused lots of chronic diseases smoking causes everything right.

559
01:19:21,090 --> 01:19:37,500
amondul: Obesity is associate multiple different diseases dietary factors for associate multiple different diseases right So this has fallen out of favor of it, since they came up with this right, so this is still on the list, but one that we don't use or don't believe is as important.

560
01:19:39,450 --> 01:19:40,950
amondul: So these are those criteria.

561
01:19:43,140 --> 01:19:48,240
amondul: And then really you know all of this is kind of coming down to like how much evidence, do we need to act.

562
01:19:49,050 --> 01:19:59,550
amondul: All scientific work is incomplete, whether it be observational or experimental This does not confer upon us, the freedom to ignore the knowledge that we already have, or to postpone the action that it appears to demand at a given time.

563
01:20:00,570 --> 01:20:13,440
amondul: And so, really, what we're trying to ask ourselves is, do we have enough information to be have enough data that we believe that we have a causal relationship, and we can actually make a recommendation or do something about it right.

564
01:20:14,190 --> 01:20:24,870
amondul: we're not in this business as epidemiologists and as public health professionals to like I mean we're curious, and we want to know the answers but that's not really our end goal our end goal is to do something about it right.

565
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:33,870
amondul: we're not just sort of esoteric Lee interested in the knowledge of is this exposure associated with this disease, we want to be able to act, we want to be able to.

566
01:20:34,170 --> 01:20:45,720
amondul: Stop the exposure, we want to be able to intervene and stop people from getting the disease and so that's why we want to have this knowledge, and so you it's a judgment call to decide at what point.

567
01:20:47,010 --> 01:20:59,550
amondul: We can stop doing studies and we can start designing interventions right and that's something everybody struggles with in this field, but I think it's really important to keep in mind that that's our goal right that's the end goal.

568
01:21:02,010 --> 01:21:02,310
Okay.

569
01:21:04,890 --> 01:21:07,470
amondul: So that is my causality lecture.

570
01:21:09,150 --> 01:21:11,340
amondul: Any questions thoughts.

571
01:21:12,030 --> 01:21:14,790
Nolaundron Harris: Where do we find the recorded lectures.

572
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:20,550
amondul: They are on each so let me share my other screen.

573
01:21:27,660 --> 01:21:28,050
amondul: yep.

574
01:21:30,300 --> 01:21:38,370
amondul: So, like if we go home and we go to one of the earlier ones where it's been posted like let's go to the first Thursday.

575
01:21:40,470 --> 01:21:44,040
amondul: The lecture recording link is on the page under the PowerPoint slides.

576
01:21:44,940 --> 01:21:45,330
Nolaundron Harris: Thank you.

577
01:21:46,140 --> 01:21:46,800
amondul: No problem.

578
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:53,610
amondul: Any other questions.

579
01:21:56,610 --> 01:21:59,880
amondul: Alright, next time, we are going to come and we will do the.

580
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:07,830
amondul: Because ality exercise i'm looking right now I think it's 12 questions, and I think there's no math.

581
01:22:11,220 --> 01:22:13,320
amondul: it's either 12 or nine I can't remember.

582
01:22:15,060 --> 01:22:18,000
amondul: it's 1212 questions and no math guys.

583
01:22:19,230 --> 01:22:28,500
amondul: You are welcome, so I will see you next time we will do that and then we'll take a break, and then I will answer your questions about exam too so.

584
01:22:29,430 --> 01:22:37,200
amondul: You know by tomorrow do do if you have a chance go through those exam to practice questions that are on the exam to review day page.

585
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:46,860
amondul: and bring questions about those and we can go over any questions that you guys, have we can also just go over general questions that you have about the material before the exam okay.

586
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:49,770
amondul: Right.

587
01:22:50,610 --> 01:22:51,540
amondul: hi guys.
