1
00:00:10,007 --> 00:00:11,626
Welcome back everyone to Nutrition 590.

2
00:00:11,626 --> 00:00:18,581
Did you ever think that your genome is
sort of like your computer's hard drive.

3
00:00:18,581 --> 00:00:24,197
It's full of data, but that data just sits
there until the software comes along and

4
00:00:24,197 --> 00:00:25,974
tells the data what to do.

5
00:00:25,974 --> 00:00:30,728
Actually, every cell in our body
contains the same complement of DNA,

6
00:00:30,728 --> 00:00:32,797
the hardware in this example.

7
00:00:32,797 --> 00:00:37,411
But it's the epigenetic software
that decides how when and

8
00:00:37,411 --> 00:00:39,909
where our genes are expressed.

9
00:00:39,909 --> 00:00:45,630
It also allows genes to react to their
environment, and even helps determine

10
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:51,185
how a stem cell will become a heart cell,
a liver cell, or even a hair cell.

11
00:00:51,185 --> 00:00:57,267
In this unit, we will learn about
the epigenetic mark, DNA methylation.

12
00:00:57,267 --> 00:01:02,443
The three learning objectives include
to describe why DNA methylation

13
00:01:02,443 --> 00:01:07,112
is important in regulating gene
expression and human disease.

14
00:01:07,112 --> 00:01:13,319
Second, understand how DNA methylation
is inherited from cell to cell.

15
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:19,493
And finally, look into the primary
literature and review the association

16
00:01:19,493 --> 00:01:25,373
between maternal folic acid use
an infant cord blood DNA methylation.

17
00:01:25,373 --> 00:01:32,087
DNA methylation is simply a quartet
of atoms, 1 carbon and 3 hydrogens.

18
00:01:32,087 --> 00:01:37,619
And this methyl group attaches to DNA and
shuts down genes.

19
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:41,731
The altered cytosine acts
like a 5th DNA base and

20
00:01:41,731 --> 00:01:45,651
is most associated with
shutting down a gene.

21
00:01:45,651 --> 00:01:51,792
DNA methylation at the 5th position of
cytosine in what we call CpG sites,

22
00:01:51,792 --> 00:01:57,553
is the major modification found in
vertebrate in mammalian genomes.

23
00:01:57,553 --> 00:02:03,797
This modification is catalyzed by
DNA cytosine methyltransferases.

24
00:02:03,797 --> 00:02:09,433
And there's a few of them Dnmt1,
Dnmt3a, and Dnmt3b,

25
00:02:09,433 --> 00:02:14,282
and they use what we call
S-adenosylmethionine or

26
00:02:14,282 --> 00:02:18,583
SAM for short,
as a universal methyl donor.

27
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:22,311
We also know that DNA methylation
patterns are heritable.

28
00:02:22,311 --> 00:02:25,550
And by heritable,
we mean from cell to cell and

29
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:30,134
not necessarily across generations
from parents to offspring.

30
00:02:30,134 --> 00:02:35,015
And finally, as I mentioned,
DNA methylation is most often

31
00:02:35,015 --> 00:02:39,716
associated with gene repression or
shutting down a gene.

32
00:02:39,716 --> 00:02:46,481
In mammals, DNA methylation occurs
primarily at what we call CpG sites.

33
00:02:46,481 --> 00:02:51,061
CpG is shorthand for
cytosines that are 5 prime,

34
00:02:51,061 --> 00:02:54,342
which means upstream of guanines.

35
00:02:54,342 --> 00:03:00,045
And these cytosines and guanines
are linked together by a phosphate group.

36
00:03:00,045 --> 00:03:05,638
Phosphates link any of the 2,
4 nucleotides that are in our DNA.

37
00:03:05,638 --> 00:03:10,539
The CpG notation is therefore
to be interpreted as cytosines

38
00:03:10,539 --> 00:03:13,429
being 5 prime to the guanine base.

39
00:03:13,429 --> 00:03:17,190
CpG should not be confused with
the opposite, which would be GpC.

40
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:21,900
The latter meaning that guanine
is followed by a cytosine in

41
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,830
that 5 prime to 3 prime direction.

42
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:29,831
The right side of this figure shows
DNA methylation catalyzed by those

43
00:03:29,831 --> 00:03:36,275
DNA methyltransferases, which transfers
methyl groups from S-adenosylmethionine,

44
00:03:36,275 --> 00:03:40,767
SAM, to cytosines and
yielding S-adenosylhomocysteine and

45
00:03:40,767 --> 00:03:43,750
the final product 5-methylcytosine.

46
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:48,311
The methyl group in methylated
DNA comes from SAM.

47
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:54,033
When S-adenosylmethionine donates that
methyl group to the cytosine base,

48
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:57,854
its converted to SAH,
S-adenosylhomocysteine.

49
00:03:57,854 --> 00:04:02,743
In mammals DNA methylation occurs
at the carbon 5 position of

50
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:04,725
the CpG dinucleotides.

51
00:04:04,725 --> 00:04:10,389
And it's carried out by two classes of
enzymes, both the maintenance methylation,

52
00:04:10,389 --> 00:04:15,582
which is responsible for putting DNA
methylation a newly synthesized strands

53
00:04:15,582 --> 00:04:20,631
of DNA, and de novo methylation,
which occurs during fetal development.

54
00:04:20,631 --> 00:04:27,983
This group of enzymes is called DNA
methyltransferases or Dnmts for short.

55
00:04:27,983 --> 00:04:32,614
The methyl group associated with
DNA methylation is produced via

56
00:04:32,614 --> 00:04:35,235
the one-carbon metabolism cycle.

57
00:04:35,235 --> 00:04:39,787
The one-carbon metabolism cycle
comprises a series of interlinking

58
00:04:39,787 --> 00:04:44,810
metabolic pathways that include both
the methionine and folic acid cycles.

59
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:48,436
These are critical for cellular function,

60
00:04:48,436 --> 00:04:52,758
the synthesis of DNA, and
amino acid homeostasis.

61
00:04:52,758 --> 00:04:55,839
In fact, the figure included
in the slide is only one

62
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:58,930
section of the full
one-carbon metabolism cycle.

63
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:03,260
Here, we are highlighting
the importance of folic acid and

64
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:08,552
choline as cofactors in the production
of SAM S-adenosylmethionine.

65
00:05:08,552 --> 00:05:12,269
Through converting
homocysteine to methionine and

66
00:05:12,269 --> 00:05:17,337
then to S-adenosylmethionine via
a series of biochemical reaction,

67
00:05:17,337 --> 00:05:21,728
the one-carbon metabolism cycle
will eventually use SAM and

68
00:05:21,728 --> 00:05:26,048
methyltransferases to start
the DNA methylation process.

69
00:05:26,048 --> 00:05:29,433
Because these diet-derived
methyl donors and

70
00:05:29,433 --> 00:05:34,597
cofactors are necessary for
the synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine,

71
00:05:34,597 --> 00:05:38,573
environmental factors that
alter early nutrition, or

72
00:05:38,573 --> 00:05:44,412
the efficiency of SAM synthesis, can
potentially influence adult phenotypes or

73
00:05:44,412 --> 00:05:49,234
disease risk, via alterations in
DNA methylation that can occur at

74
00:05:49,234 --> 00:05:54,248
critically important epigenetically
labile regions in our genome.

75
00:05:54,248 --> 00:05:59,543
CpG islands refer to short
CpG rich areas that are areas

76
00:05:59,543 --> 00:06:06,920
in which we have greater than 55% of
the expected frequency of CpG sites.

77
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:12,034
These CpG islands are typically
located in the promoter region, so

78
00:06:12,034 --> 00:06:17,252
that's 5 prime or upstream of
transcription start sites of genes.

79
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:22,436
And CpG islands in promoter regions
are usually unmethylated so

80
00:06:22,436 --> 00:06:25,222
that the gene can be transcribed.

81
00:06:25,222 --> 00:06:31,521
CpG shores is another term that refers to
regions that are outside of CpG islands.

82
00:06:31,521 --> 00:06:35,925
They have a little bit lower CpG
density than the islands, and

83
00:06:35,925 --> 00:06:41,190
they lie within two kilobases upstream and
downstream of the CpG island.

84
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:46,934
And it turns out that variation in DNA
methylation in both the CpG islands and

85
00:06:46,934 --> 00:06:52,411
CpG island shores, can be correlated
to nutritional and environmental

86
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:58,452
exposures that link early life experiences
to adult disease susceptibility.

87
00:06:58,452 --> 00:07:03,276
Because most 5-methylcytosines
lie within repetitive regions

88
00:07:03,276 --> 00:07:08,271
known as retrotransposons,
methylation may have evolved as what we

89
00:07:08,271 --> 00:07:13,094
call a host defense mechanism to
prevent these repetitive regions

90
00:07:13,094 --> 00:07:17,847
from jumping around our genome and
causing genome instability.

91
00:07:17,847 --> 00:07:24,072
So therefore, DNA methylation interferes
with transcription by two mechanisms.

92
00:07:24,072 --> 00:07:28,860
The first is simply blocking
the access of transcription factors to

93
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,465
these GG-rich response elements.

94
00:07:31,465 --> 00:07:36,826
The second is by attracting different
proteins called CpG binding proteins.

95
00:07:36,826 --> 00:07:40,237
And these proteins can
also act to inhibit and

96
00:07:40,237 --> 00:07:44,999
may stimulate additional chromatin
modification that acts to

97
00:07:44,999 --> 00:07:49,776
constrict the genome in a way
where genes cannot be expressed.

98
00:07:49,776 --> 00:07:54,155
So till this moment, we have
introduced the biological mechanism,

99
00:07:54,155 --> 00:07:59,136
DNA methylation, and its importance in
regulating gene expression in how DNA

100
00:07:59,136 --> 00:08:02,020
methylation is inherited
from cell to cell.

101
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:07,396
Now, we are going to change gears and
take a look at a primary literature

102
00:08:07,396 --> 00:08:12,686
article to begin to understand how
early environmental influences,

103
00:08:12,686 --> 00:08:17,345
and in this case,
we're looking at maternal folic acid use,

104
00:08:17,345 --> 00:08:22,660
how that can influence DNA methylation
of the cord blood of an infant.

105
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:29,051
So in the study, which was published in
2011 by researchers at Duke University and

106
00:08:29,051 --> 00:08:34,479
NC State, they were interested in
folic acid supplementation before and

107
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:35,984
during pregnancy.

108
00:08:35,984 --> 00:08:40,232
It had been shown in the past
that the use of folic acid can be

109
00:08:40,232 --> 00:08:45,274
associated with a decreased risk
of neural tube defects in infants.

110
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:49,288
However, the mechanism
linking this exposure and

111
00:08:49,288 --> 00:08:52,469
outcome had not been readily examined.

112
00:08:52,469 --> 00:08:59,069
Some recent studies had suggested
that DNA methylation maybe the link.

113
00:08:59,069 --> 00:09:03,782
So to explore this further,
the group of researchers evaluated

114
00:09:03,782 --> 00:09:08,846
exposure to folic acid before and
during pregnancy in relation to DNA

115
00:09:08,846 --> 00:09:13,735
methylation at a gene called
insulin-like growth factor 2, and

116
00:09:13,735 --> 00:09:19,437
whether these modifications relate to
susceptibility of chronic disease.

117
00:09:19,437 --> 00:09:25,332
In general, this research study
enrolled 438 mother-infant

118
00:09:25,332 --> 00:09:30,395
pairs in the Newborn Epigenetic Study or
NEST for short.

119
00:09:30,395 --> 00:09:35,251
They evaluated preconception in
prenatal folic acid supplementation via

120
00:09:35,251 --> 00:09:37,877
a self-administered questionnaire.

121
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:42,727
And they collected leukocytes, or
white blood cell cord blood DNA

122
00:09:42,727 --> 00:09:48,357
methylation from the infants after they
were born, and analyzed this DNA for

123
00:09:48,357 --> 00:09:54,010
two differentially methylated regions
associated with IGF2 expression.

124
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:59,751
And they used mixed method models
to examine the associations.

125
00:09:59,751 --> 00:10:04,794
This table is one of the main
results from the study.

126
00:10:04,794 --> 00:10:10,504
And in fact, if you begin to zoom in
on the column that's labeled IGF2 DMR,

127
00:10:10,504 --> 00:10:15,326
you will see that there are no
significant effects with maternal

128
00:10:15,326 --> 00:10:19,811
folic acid use and
altered DNA methylation at this region.

129
00:10:19,811 --> 00:10:24,788
This was in contrary to a different
study that had found significant

130
00:10:24,788 --> 00:10:28,891
DNA methylation, and
whether mothers had a moderate or

131
00:10:28,891 --> 00:10:31,785
no use of folic acid during pregnancy.

132
00:10:31,785 --> 00:10:36,435
While there was no evidence for
differential DNA methylation IGF2,

133
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:41,003
I'll draw your attention to
the second DMR, which is called H19,

134
00:10:41,003 --> 00:10:43,544
which is a long non-coding RNA gene.

135
00:10:43,544 --> 00:10:48,819
And in this case,
you can see associations between whether

136
00:10:48,819 --> 00:10:54,638
the mother used folic acid and
altered DNA methylation at H19.

137
00:10:54,638 --> 00:10:59,711
And additionally, in a second table,
which is not shown here, you can see that

138
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:04,789
the difference in H19 DMR methylation
was more pronounced in male infants and

139
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:10,699
also in those born to Caucasian
versus African American mothers.
