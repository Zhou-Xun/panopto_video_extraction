1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:06,410
Okay. The owl is staring at me. This is very strange, but.

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:15,870
Okay, great. All right. So if there's no more just general questions and that's for me, I'll get started.

3
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:23,309
Okay. All right. So I already went over the basics, so I'm not going to go over that again.

4
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:28,650
But just again, please review those the syllabus and the course information, you know, carefully.

5
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:32,280
Make sure you don't have any questions or there's anything that doesn't make sense.

6
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:37,680
Please let me know. Okay. So this is my a little bit of my background.

7
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:43,530
I actually got my mph here in what was at that time called International Health,

8
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:47,100
which is now what you guys are doing, which is h e that was about 20 years ago.

9
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:51,450
So there is 20 years ago. So that was interesting.

10
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:59,370
And so I kind of have like that connection to the program that you all are in a little bit smaller then we only have like six people in my cohort,

11
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:04,950
but so I did did that here and then I went on and completed my Ph.D. here in the program.

12
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:14,490
Um, I was on the faculty, the University of New Mexico for 11 years before I was kind of recruited back here.

13
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:26,980
So I joined the program here in 2019. I'm also a named professor of Global Health and is I was the tech leader for JT for two years from 2013 to 2020.

14
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:31,799
And I'm trained as kind of a who I'm slashes,

15
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:38,430
I'm like environmental occupational social criminologist also productive focused a productive me ologist.

16
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:43,350
And my focus is really on maternal child health, health equity issues,

17
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:50,520
PR engagement and I do mainly primary data collection and mixed methods, so qualitative and quantitative.

18
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:57,579
You can talk to me more about this later or if you can look at my faculty page.

19
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:05,739
But just really briefly, my current research areas are mainly under the umbrella of occupational closure and child health.

20
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:10,510
So I focus on kind of worker health, particularly female workers and pregnant workers.

21
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:20,569
And so I have an and I use funded cohort studies the birth cohort study Cox Media in Ecuador with colleagues where we are looking at occupational

22
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:24,620
exposures among pregnant workers and those that live in the are very large

23
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:29,150
industrial platforms in Ecuador on the terminal and child health and wellness.

24
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:39,440
And then I once I started the program here, when I came back in 2018, I started a program or research program called the Michigan Farm Worker Project,

25
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:44,960
focusing on occupational exposure among migrant and seasonal farm workers in Michigan.

26
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:56,090
And in all of my work, I look a lot at not just chemical exposure to toxic exposures, but also social and structural determinants of worker health.

27
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:03,410
And I use CPR based participatory research wherever I can, as well as can engage in research.

28
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:09,710
I just finished working with colleagues in New Mexico on intervention research, and we mentioned this because I think it's interesting.

29
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:13,280
You know, in epidemiology, sometimes we have to we focus on like the epic work.

30
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:20,989
The the more the first start of the on the spectrum of public health research.

31
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:25,370
But being involved in intervention research is really interesting because you can see where the collection of data

32
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:31,009
and then those findings actually can apply to the development of interventions and evaluating those interventions.

33
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,680
And so that's something I was involved in in Mexico.

34
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:41,209
So the goals of this course, this and I'm sorry for those of you on the very end, it might be hard to see.

35
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:50,420
You can always like push in a little bit. So I'm not going to read all these this come from your syllabus so we can read them later.

36
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:55,309
But what I do want to highlight is that in terms of the goals of this course,

37
00:03:55,310 --> 00:04:02,170
I'm just trying to introduce you to some of these aspects of conducting a national epic work.

38
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:09,680
You know, considering things like cultural issues, ethical issues and operational issues, how do you actually do this kind of field work?

39
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:17,360
And you're not going to learn everything in one semester. I've been doing my work for over 20 years, starting with my master's work,

40
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:23,180
because if you include that and I'm still learning things every day when I'm doing my fieldwork, right?

41
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:26,030
So you're not going to learn everything in one semester in six weeks.

42
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:33,680
But what I'm trying to do in this class and what my goal is, is that you are going to get this introduction,

43
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:38,569
you're going to learn about how to connect a lot of these aspects that we talk

44
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,870
about in this course with what you're learning in your Epic Methods courses,

45
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:50,900
right? What you learn in 600 3601 So to see where that those connections happen and then it's

46
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:55,010
going to give you those skills not only to do the work this summer for your internships,

47
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:00,830
but also in the future, if that's your goal to do international this work.

48
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:12,350
It's also really important in this class that I and I'll talk about it all throughout the course is learning how to be flexible,

49
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:17,150
how to adapt to situations. We've learned this quite a bit with the pandemic and doing fieldwork,

50
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:22,190
but it's something that when you do international work, you're going to always face.

51
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:26,720
You're going to have to be adaptive to situations and be very flexible.

52
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:31,550
And so hopefully learning the confidence we talked about in this course will help you with that.

53
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:41,020
So the the relevance of this course, it has both kind of immediate implications,

54
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:44,440
which is basically helping you plan your summer work, your summer internship,

55
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:50,350
and also more long term implications, you know, helping build the foundation for you,

56
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:54,840
for getting you ready to work in any type of setting, particularly a global.

57
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,739
So this is a book that I use in this course, the first few chapters of it.

58
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:10,120
It's the readings that you have for your first sort of approval ratings that are that you'll have been able to do by next week.

59
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:20,920
This is a really nice text. It's James Castles, an anthropologist, but he connects anthropology with epidemiology and associates.

60
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:28,899
Now, these are really great work and um, it just is a nice connection to issues of culture and things like that.

61
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:32,170
So, and for myself as a social technologist,

62
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:37,659
feel like this is a really nice book that connects anthropology with social effort and with effort in general.

63
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:41,020
So we're going to just cover the first five chapters.

64
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:43,419
It's a really great book if you have interest in it for later.

65
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:48,879
Like the later chapters talk about things like intervention and program development, things like that,

66
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,240
which we're not talking about this class, but it might be an interest for you later.

67
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:55,990
So you will be using the first few chapters.

68
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:01,850
So this is just an outline of the course topics.

69
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:07,909
I'll go through a couple of these as if it isn't a little bit, but it's basically the course is divided into two big sections.

70
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:15,950
One is around understanding the research environment, and then the other is the actual work.

71
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:20,660
The design, administration and analysis of international or global effort work.

72
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:26,450
Okay. So I'll just go through a few of these now.

73
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:29,600
But again, we're going to be talking about this throughout the semester.

74
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:37,409
So the first is understanding the health infrastructure of the community where we're working on the population.

75
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:44,139
This is critical. Again, this is the goal of the course is just to touch on these things and these issues

76
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:47,990
so that it gives you that foundation so that when you go to do your work,

77
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:49,580
you're going to be able to think about these things.

78
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:59,389
And I think you probably hopefully touched on some of these things in the last semester's class in international health.

79
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:05,420
Right. So the idea of thinking about health system structure.

80
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:09,200
Did you guys talk about that in class? A little bit? Okay.

81
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:17,059
So these are the issues that you want to be thinking about in terms of the infrastructure you want to understand.

82
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,920
And the goal in this course is to understand,

83
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:26,600
like how these different aspects actually would impact your question, your ability to do work in a community.

84
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:36,260
Right. So what kind of governance was it? What is the policy regulation that is in place in a community or in a population you're working in?

85
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:41,890
What kind of financing is is in place?

86
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:49,220
What kind of insurance is in place? What you have to kind of understand that you can't assume that it's similar to to here in the United States.

87
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:55,870
You want to understand what resources are available, right?

88
00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:02,180
Doctors, nurses, public health workers, key leaders. How is how is the infrastructure structured?

89
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:08,990
And then also in terms of information gathering, you know, what kind of data are available and at what level?

90
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:16,340
Right. Do you have data, the country level? Is it a province level, county in a city, etc.?

91
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:19,820
Right. And what's the quality of the data?

92
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,340
So you want to be speaking about that.

93
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:30,210
And then how are the how is the health system kind of set up in terms of in terms of the public health and health care delivery?

94
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:37,040
So, you know, do you are there rural and urban hospitals like other health centers?

95
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:42,690
Is there a system of other health workers that aren't necessarily clinicians and nurses?

96
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:50,460
Like is there a health promoter system in place? Is there a midwife system, that kind of thing you want to try to understand.

97
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:58,589
And also, you know, how is the delivery? Is it public versus private workers versus non workers?

98
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:07,830
So in the case of Ecuador, there is a ministry of public health that manages the public hospital system.

99
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:14,460
I work with workers. They go to the hospitals that are managed by the Ministry of Labor Hospitals.

100
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,810
So the Ministry of Labor has a separate delivery system.

101
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:26,190
So if you thought going in, oh, I'm going to work just with the Ministry of Health, you would miss that whole other group, which is the worker, right?

102
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:30,330
So you have to understand how that is set up in a country where you're working.

103
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:35,810
We're all going to.

104
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:42,120
We're also going to talk a lot about this in the next few sessions about culture and how epidemiology is actually a cultural practice.

105
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:45,590
So this is what triathlon has looked up to a lot about.

106
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:52,910
So the idea here is that instead of thinking about the analogy as simply a biomedical science,

107
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:58,940
which I think sometimes people think that's what this analogy is, we also need to think about it as like a cultural practice.

108
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:05,770
Right. So Trussell talks in his in his readings, and you'll see that when you do them that, you know,

109
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:11,299
he talks about the what we call the human reactions to disease, which create patterns of patterns.

110
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:17,360
Right. And this is super important to understand because in epidemiology and hopefully you learn this in your first semester,

111
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:21,710
the goal of epidemiology is we're trying to understand patterns of disease and health.

112
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:28,220
Right. And we're trying to do this through causal models and causal mechanisms and causal associations.

113
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:36,200
And so we need to understand all the different pathways and the mechanisms that are at play who really, truly want to understand causality.

114
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:46,580
And many of those mechanisms, the pathways are structured by or influenced by culture, by cultural practices, by bigger context.

115
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:52,470
Social context include the political context to the economic context.

116
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:57,890
So it's not just about these kind of individual risk factors, right?

117
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,820
So it's really important to think about them.

118
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:11,129
And if you don't, then you will kind of develop causal models and your hypothesis for you raises questions that will be missing,

119
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:14,480
perhaps really key important pathways and mechanisms.

120
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:20,850
And that means most like in your data and your findings won't be quite as valid as they need to be.

121
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:29,880
And then that can obviously have an impact on how you address those issues in the population if you're missing kind of key pathways.

122
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:36,209
So this aligns very much with also the social analogy and kind of how we think

123
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:40,530
about the broader context and impacting health outcomes in health patterning.

124
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:49,080
So he does give a nice example and I just took this from from the book, but you'll see it when you read it and I won't read it all the way through.

125
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:53,670
But he does give a really nice example in the chapters you're going to be reading about, about his work with epilepsy.

126
00:12:54,390 --> 00:13:04,500
And he provides this discussion about how the how culture can impact the assessment of epilepsy depending on which population or context you're in.

127
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:10,460
And he worked. In this field in Minnesota and also in Ecuador and also in Kenya.

128
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,140
And he talks about how the differences in the cultures.

129
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:22,890
Impacted how people reacted to the disease and types of epilepsy and how they how that also impacted treatment and healthcare and all of that.

130
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:29,549
So he is a quote from him. And people's reactions to disease can influence epidemiology because of genealogy

131
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:33,390
is primarily an observational science that relies on other people's reports.

132
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:39,989
So again, I'm not going to go too much into this right now because we will have a few sessions on this later and you'll be doing that reading.

133
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:43,710
But it's just important to think about how culture plays a role.

134
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,780
And this is especially important when you're doing global good work.

135
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:53,040
And actually, I would say any kind of effort work depending on the population you're working with,

136
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:57,300
even within a country, there's different cultures and different populations.

137
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:03,380
The other part of the research environment is the overall general infrastructure,

138
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:07,630
not necessarily just the health care delivery infrastructure, health care infrastructure.

139
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:10,179
We'll talk about this throughout the course as well.

140
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:17,469
So thinking about what are the existing research infrastructures that are actually in place in a country, if there are any,

141
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:24,310
there may not be any where you're going to be working and what kind of new infrastructures need to be developed.

142
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:31,540
And this was always we're thinking about your partners working with partners at the local level.

143
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:38,649
And we also want to think about, you know, developing collaborative relationships with local partners.

144
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:42,490
But it's super important to understand kind of their role.

145
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:48,750
So are there local leaders where you're going to be working and what's their role?

146
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:53,979
How are they accepted by the broader community? Are there NGOs and what's their role?

147
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:58,629
And are they accepted or not, you know, and, you know, to right in that community.

148
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:05,860
So you have to kind of understand that, too, as well as, you know, other other groups like government agencies, etc.

149
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:14,670
So I think in your last class at International by semester you all did a mapping profile of the countries that write this.

150
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:19,540
And okay. So that that's important because when you do that,

151
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:27,489
hopefully it's the goal of it is kind of that first step when you're starting work in a forum where

152
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:31,510
you're going to be interested in working and it's kind of this first step of thinking about,

153
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:37,730
you know. What do I need to get this project going right?

154
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:41,210
What is available to me at whatever different levels?

155
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:44,980
It is the first step you take to think about your collaborations.

156
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:50,990
How are you going to build the collaborations? What kind of research questions are important to ask?

157
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:54,290
What is the study design that you're going to be able to do?

158
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:59,600
And what's the the ability you have an ability to implement that design.

159
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:08,420
So that's an important first step. And so that also can help you think about what are the resources that are available to you.

160
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:17,610
In terms of calories. We're going to have a few sessions building. We're talking about this issue of building equitable collaborations.

161
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:25,170
So this is really important. It's really important to me to focus on this, and I think it's important in general for me just to think about this.

162
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:33,809
So how do we develop research teams with policymakers and collaborators in international settings that are that are

163
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:41,940
collaborative and equitable so that all the voices of all the partners are included in the decision making processes.

164
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,320
You want to make sure you're at the health priorities that you're thinking about.

165
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:52,830
Like we might have a wonderful research question you're thinking about doing, and that might not be a priority at all for your local partners.

166
00:16:53,280 --> 00:17:00,630
And so you need to have that flexibility to think about whether, you know, maybe that's not the priority that we should be,

167
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:09,209
that we should be doing the focusing on in a country and and also the procedures.

168
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:14,520
You know, one of the procedures that you need to think about with your collaborators for developing agreements,

169
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:21,509
contractual agreements with partners is establishing competent research teams, having a real systematic approach to doing that.

170
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:23,730
And we'll talk a lot about that throughout the course.

171
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:32,370
So in terms of community engagement, again, the topic for me that's the most and the key word here is equitable.

172
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:42,560
This is really important. And we do. Always see this especially with global I've been work so you know the idea is and this is from this

173
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:49,210
book that I'll show you later apartment at all we talk about the centering of authority right?

174
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:59,630
And making sure that there is, um, knowledge and power and spaces that's equal among and equitable among all partners here.

175
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:09,049
Those coming maybe from a high income country going to maybe a setting like a lower middle income country setting and making

176
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:17,060
sure that it's doing so so that there's better and more sustainable and equitable dialog and and work in a community.

177
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:23,810
If you ask these kinds of mutually beneficial collaborations that can do a lot more harm than good.

178
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:29,420
And so we have to be really careful about that. I think this is critical and global, good work.

179
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:33,040
I think it's critical in any good work from my perspective, right?

180
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:41,090
So we will focus on global effort work in this stuff. But I always kind of throw that in because I think working in any populations,

181
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:51,110
particularly those who have been marginalized and in with research and with in general those who are more vulnerable no matter what country you're in,

182
00:18:51,110 --> 00:19:00,139
you're going to have to think about this. And so this this is from the index module that you'll be doing.

183
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:04,250
It'll be doing a few of them. And one the first thing you should do by the end of this week.

184
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:11,899
And this comes from that first introductory one. So this is a module that was developed by the Ginsberg Center.

185
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:18,620
And they're going to be coming in also to do absolutely have to confirm with me that they're supposed to coming in to do a session on power privilege,

186
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:25,520
which I think is really important for when we're doing this and talking about some international, global, global effort work.

187
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:30,380
So I just want to highlight this particular graphic that they show.

188
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:38,660
So they kind of have like the spectrum. And so on one side is that the Russian authorities, although it is doing.

189
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:48,350
Okay. That's okay, I guess. So on the left side where it says volunteers and so that I'm outside that

190
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:53,060
spectrum is like more what's typically the what's a benefit to the recipient?

191
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:59,330
Although a caveat, there are some really good examples where this has not been the case and one

192
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:03,709
of the big areas of discussion has been around volunteerism and orphanages,

193
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:13,070
and that's really looked down upon. It was kind of a big thing for a while and it's been shown to be extremely harmful to children in those settings.

194
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:20,390
And so that is not of the benefit to the recipient. But generally speaking, that's kind of what this graphic is showing for volunteerism.

195
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:26,899
And then on the right side is kind of where the benefit is more to the what we call the the provider,

196
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:30,170
the learner, the researcher, if it's research, right?

197
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:41,960
You guys internships. Right. Um, and so we want to try to be more in the middle where there's kind of equal benefit for, for all parties.

198
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:46,370
So we're going to watch a clip that comes from that that addicts.

199
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:51,980
Okay. From that video. We'll just do one more clip on it.

200
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:56,200
I hope this works. And then we'll pass it on to.

201
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:04,650
Or not. Consider.

202
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:12,810
Well. Okay.

203
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:16,140
Maybe not. All right.

204
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:22,320
Why not let me do this? Because I'm recording. Okay.

205
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:25,760
You can go back and look at this one hypothesis live. Right.

206
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:30,629
And you will be watching this because this is part of the ethics, the assignment that you'll be doing.

207
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:37,140
So you'll see it. So this was a clip that where they talked about what does community engagement actually mean?

208
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:38,820
Right. What do you mean by it?

209
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:46,799
And so it's a it's a good clip because it kind of talks about all these different perspectives and how people see community engagement meaning.

210
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:53,460
And there's a little thread like throughout all of the people that they're interviewing, kind of what they talk about, which is that,

211
00:21:53,640 --> 00:22:02,460
you know, there's a need for transparency when we're working with different communities and different groups that community should have.

212
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:10,470
However, this design should be included with an equal voice, as opposed to working with marginalized and vulnerable populations.

213
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:17,850
So that's something to keep in mind. We're going to go into this and much more detail it when Ginsberg does their session.

214
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,480
So sorry about the video.

215
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:31,960
Two other videos of the day and I got to ask you this, but, um, so what gets a little tricky for us is how we define community, right?

216
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:35,790
What do we mean by community? Everyone might have their own kind of definition of community.

217
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:43,500
This is how the attacks module and how Ginsburg kind of defines it, which is a unified body of individuals.

218
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:49,590
And it can be unified either by common characteristics or where they're living in a society,

219
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:56,820
or if they have like a common history or a common kind of context or interests, or if they're linked by some sort of common policy.

220
00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:01,110
So it doesn't always have to be like a physical community, like living in one area.

221
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:05,910
They can be community based on these other things. So.

222
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:12,200
Why do you think it's important for us to in global epidemiology?

223
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:16,700
So just to understand who your community is, who you're working with.

224
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:35,360
So you think? I think it's one of the ways that you can, I guess, achieve health equity.

225
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:40,180
Okay. Okay, great. Yeah.

226
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:44,670
So you can properly assess the needs. Other than what you think we need.

227
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:54,630
Okay. Yeah. You know, just to be, like, respectful of their beliefs and what they, you know, what they hold.

228
00:23:55,560 --> 00:24:03,510
So, you know, end up hurting the community and said, you're too good to me so you can build trust with the community.

229
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:12,620
Yeah, for sure. And the other comments is that you can also educate yourself more about the language

230
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:20,580
and the cultural aspects and how they refer to different communities and cultures.

231
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:24,220
They may not use the exact words, but they still hold the same phenomena.

232
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:31,260
Okay. It's like doing them, like watching tennis.

233
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:36,600
Okay. Yeah. Those are all really, really, really good points.

234
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,590
Um, I'm going to add that specifically as a cardiologist,

235
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:47,700
you know that our goal is to design studies that are the sample, that are representative of like the truth.

236
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:55,920
Right. That's the goal of analogy of we take a sample and hopefully that sample represents the source population in a valid way.

237
00:24:57,150 --> 00:25:02,580
You've heard that, right? Okay. I just want to make sure that that's what you heard.

238
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:08,009
Um, so the the idea is beyond all of the comments and all that you all talk about,

239
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:14,159
which is really critical, it's also really important for like designing valid study is right.

240
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:22,290
If you don't really understand the context or you don't understand what the research questions that are important for a community or what would be,

241
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:25,529
you know, kind of the focus for that community,

242
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:30,179
you're not going to be designing studies that an instrument, for example, surveying students or whatever.

243
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:33,210
And so you use them, do questions that are going to be valid.

244
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:38,430
And as you probably heard, hopefully in other classes, garbage in, garbage out, right of your that term.

245
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:46,770
So if you have not really great instruments that are not very valid for that particular environment of that community and you're hosting data,

246
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:54,959
the data is not really going to be very valid. Right. And so as a from that from a pure kind of epidemiologic design standpoint,

247
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,410
it's also really important to understand and work with communities closely

248
00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:02,960
because that's going to help you design the best kind of study the most outs.

249
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:07,919
And that was going to show you another clip, but apparently that's not going to work.

250
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:15,870
So you guys are going to look at this later and this is just a clip again on like what do we mean by community, right?

251
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:21,300
What's the definition of community? So you guys can look at that later.

252
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:26,549
They also talk about and one lockdown and they talk in this.

253
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:32,970
But I put a note for myself to let you all know that sometimes what's important to think about to um.

254
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:39,120
In terms of doing international at good work is that. You know what?

255
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:43,540
Who you define as community or community might actually change over time.

256
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:49,510
And sometimes when we're doing research, it takes a long time to get funding where there might be like really long breaks in time for getting funding.

257
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:53,490
And the community or whoever you going to work with might actually change.

258
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:59,860
There might be changes in organizations or changes in leadership or changes in the broader social context of the community.

259
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:06,639
And that's going to change. So maybe what started when you first maybe wrote a grant proposal and then when you actually got the funding,

260
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,060
that can be sometimes one, two years later, it can be very different.

261
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,889
And so you have to always keep that in mind.

262
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:18,219
And that also just again highlights this idea of being flexible and adaptive when you're doing this kind of work,

263
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:25,230
because nothing is ever very clear and straightforward when we're doing this kind of work.

264
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:30,970
So you have to be very, very just able to adapt and we'll talk a lot about that throughout the course.

265
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:39,919
Okay. See, there has been this kind of movement around this issue of ethical, global learning.

266
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:45,200
And I wonder who this because, you know, being that you're going to be doing internships, I think this is important.

267
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:53,580
So it is important for us coming from the University of Michigan and to acknowledge our privilege,

268
00:27:54,230 --> 00:28:03,500
to be able to travel, to go to work, to, you know, kind of the the ability to get funding.

269
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:11,660
Right. That that can promote, even if you don't mean to that just can promote right off the bat kind of in an equitable partnership.

270
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:16,910
Just by that the nature of where we're coming from and the kind of work that we're doing.

271
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:27,259
And so, you know, we're often the ones coming with the resources, with the funding, you know, with with that ability to to do the work.

272
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:30,559
And so that right there can start off with an imbalance.

273
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:36,200
And so we just have to be really kind of aware of that and think about that and how can we mitigate

274
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:41,959
that and make sure that we're doing the work in the best and most equitable way that we can,

275
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:46,100
and then that allows us to have more sustainable relationships over time, too.

276
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:54,799
Right. This is from a quote from the American Associate Association of American Colleges and Universities.

277
00:28:54,800 --> 00:29:00,260
And there really is more and more of this focus now on global learning exchanges,

278
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:03,589
the kind of talks about where those like maybe semester abroad kind of things.

279
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:08,890
But I'm just so it's not quite what you guys are going to do, but you are going to do internships in this premier learning process.

280
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:16,790
So I thought I'd be quick to point out, but they're talking more about this idea that we need to be more attentive to diversity,

281
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:23,029
understand issues of equity and in and just be more open minded with the work that we're doing.

282
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:27,889
So there we actually are seeing this more and more institutions of higher ed where there's more of that

283
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:33,440
focus on like social responsibility and integrative learning when we do these kinds of exchanges.

284
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:43,800
So this is, again, going back to that same. I just added my own little touch of the arrows,

285
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:51,580
because if this is just to reflect how dynamic this is and how it's a circular process, it's always ongoing, right?

286
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:56,700
So that's part of that idea of keeping an open mind and being flexible and adaptive.

287
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:00,000
And then finally, I'll just mention this.

288
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:06,809
This is a strategy that has emerged that's called the Fair Trade Learning, which is I thought was interesting.

289
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:13,380
I mean, it has its drawbacks, too, but it's just another way of thinking about this process of exchange, educational exchange.

290
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:20,610
So kind of the same way that we think about fair trade economics, we think about this in the context of learning.

291
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:27,780
This is a video. So this is not it's not, of course.

292
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:34,379
Okay. So you guys can look at that later. And I think I did link this one in your Kansas under today's session anyway, so you can watch it.

293
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:38,459
But it shows a history of where kind of fair trade learning came from.

294
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:46,620
It talks about one area that was really interesting and I think it's relevant for you all is one of the big key pieces of fair

295
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:54,689
trade learning is this idea of financial equity so that there's equal or there's an equity in like the funding situation.

296
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:58,740
And this is important for us in public health. We think about grant funding, right?

297
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:04,589
So usually, you know, there's only one institution that's typically like for kind of the US,

298
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:09,629
the US institution gets the funding, the grant funding, we manage it on our end.

299
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:19,500
And so there's this, this like unequal power with the finances that can really kind of also contribute to some of this inequity.

300
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:24,840
So it's just something to think about and to encourage you to look at that that video.

301
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:29,880
This is actually a rubric that came from that. This is called the Fair Tree Trade Learning Rubric.

302
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:34,379
And it is I have to put this on canvas. It's something interesting.

303
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:39,360
So when you're doing work, this is just a snippet of it. You can see the whole thing in the document.

304
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:46,350
It just kind of gives you a really interesting, depending on the indicator, like common purposes or rights of the most vulnerable.

305
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:53,520
You look at the the rubric and what's what's kind of entry level, the kind of basic what you should be doing basic right.

306
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:01,350
And then what would be the most ideal situation to have true kind of equity with partnerships over some interesting rubric?

307
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:05,339
Not everything is relevant for us in public health, but some of it's kind of interesting,

308
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,919
and that might be interesting for you when you're thinking about developing

309
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:12,270
partnerships or when you're developing a project and you have collaborators.

310
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:18,090
Okay. And this a lot of this information came from this text.

311
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:23,879
And I just want to show it to you that if you want to look at it, it's in the library.

312
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:33,180
I'm not sure, but it's a really great book if it's a resource that you want to to get a little bit more information on.

313
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,500
Okay. So what time is it?

314
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:43,080
We can keep going. We're good with time. Everyone doing okay? You guys need to stand and stretch.

315
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:50,040
Good. We can if you like. Okay, we can keep going.

316
00:32:50,790 --> 00:33:04,320
So I just. The second part is just talking again about the second umbrella area that we focus on in this course, and that's around research aspects.

317
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:09,630
So design, administration analysis, all of those aspects that you need to think about.

318
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:15,210
So before I go into that, are there any questions for me on what we covered?

319
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:22,590
And I know it's a lot because first day, but it's just to get you kind of feet wet and get you thinking about these things.

320
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:27,630
I think. Okay. All right. So.

321
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:34,239
Okay. So this is kind of what we think about when we thinking about studies.

322
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:41,500
Again, this is kind of for conducting a big international object study or any kind of Internet something object study.

323
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:51,569
Virtually any study does have an international right, but it might have relevance for you even as you're thinking about a summer project,

324
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:54,690
which is also what you need to be thinking about this term.

325
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:57,690
Right, for your for your internships. You may not do all of this.

326
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:00,540
You might be kind of inserted into an already existing project.

327
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:05,160
But this is just to give you an understanding of kind of what a project using looks like.

328
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:10,730
So there's usually kind of this planning phase and a lot and this is a really important part, right?

329
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:18,059
The planning phases, the whole pre work, you know, understanding the relationships, the community partners you might have, you know,

330
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:22,799
the the context are going to be working in all of that and then all the things that come with that,

331
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,850
which is like getting ethics approvals, any permits,

332
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:33,959
anything you need, getting all your research instruments is designed pilot to finalize,

333
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:40,860
you know, hiring and training staff and and all of those issues that can take a long time,

334
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:45,660
especially if you're in the population or you're working with a community where there isn't a culture of research.

335
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:53,309
And it can be hard to find, for example, staff that you can train that can be doing that kind of field work.

336
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:56,400
You know, there can be a lot of challenges with that.

337
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:02,010
And you'll see that when I talk about my project in Ecuador later in the semester,

338
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:09,330
I'll talk about a lot of these challenges I face, particularly due to the pandemic, and you'll see some of those examples.

339
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:17,600
Then you go to the execution of the study. Which is actual collection data doing oversight of the work and then quality control.

340
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:24,440
And then it goes back and forth. Sometimes you might start the study realized something is not going well.

341
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:30,170
Quickly go back and get like redo the instruments, get new permit approval and new idea.

342
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:35,060
So that's kind of that can be like a circular situation there.

343
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:37,670
And then post study is, you know, your analysis,

344
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:45,440
data analysis and you can also go from execution but kind of go through between and then presenting out your findings,

345
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:50,390
dissemination of your findings, etc. So we'll talk more about that again.

346
00:35:53,270 --> 00:36:00,230
The key here is that doing anything logic study is never clear cut.

347
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:06,170
Ever, ever, ever. You're not going to like think of this wonderful study and then it's going to go perfect because it never will.

348
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:12,170
Right. And that's okay. So you just have to know that we have to be adaptive and flexible.

349
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:15,710
And this is especially the case when you're doing international.

350
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:20,600
It could work or work in any kind of what I would call challenging contexts.

351
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:29,660
And this has also been extremely clear with the pandemic and what we had to face as researchers during the pandemic.

352
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:37,280
Okay. So logistical issues are really important when you're starting off thinking about a study.

353
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:40,160
It's really important in the context,

354
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:47,540
in a context where maybe the overall infrastructure isn't that great in the community or in our population or our country.

355
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:52,020
This is why working with local collaborators is so critical.

356
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:57,979
So some things that you might not think about are like the logistical issues for initiating the study,

357
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:01,670
like other banks, like can you have bank accounts?

358
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:07,400
Like how do you pay people? Where do you put your money? How do you support the salaries of the workers?

359
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:11,690
Are there things you need to understand about that? What does the transportation look like?

360
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:14,959
Is it even there? But is it available?

361
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:21,200
You know, can you do the kind of work that you want to do? And what are the communication issues that you might be facing?

362
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:25,700
So these are kind of basic things that are really essential. And again,

363
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:29,719
working with local collaborators is why that's critical because you're not going

364
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:32,890
to understand and know all of this unless you come from those communities.

365
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:38,970
Right. So then even so, even with that, you still might not know the day to day issues if you're not actually living there.

366
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:45,350
But understanding research traditions and areas of interest in previous foreign collaborations is really important.

367
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:51,500
So this is important because you know. In terms of foreign collaborators,

368
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:55,790
if there were other foreign powers that have come in and prior to your work or your time

369
00:37:55,790 --> 00:38:03,170
there that either did unethical research or had some negative impact on the population,

370
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:09,980
or at the very least just came in and did what we call helicopter research, just kind of came in, the data left.

371
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:19,370
There can be kind of a real bad taste in the mouths of the folks of the communities where you might want to work, like, well, I'm going to do this.

372
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:25,459
We're not doing this again, right? We're not going to get we're not going to have these bad kind of separations again.

373
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:34,100
And so you understanding what kind of that history is is really helpful because then you can kind of work

374
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:39,799
to assure that that's not going to happen again and kind of work with local collaborators on that aspect.

375
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:46,430
So that's really, really important. This is where, you know, you guys want to do your internship.

376
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:53,899
I mean, we don't have a ton of time, but a lot of times the very beginning of your of your internship really should just be you kind

377
00:38:53,900 --> 00:39:01,400
of listening and understanding kind of what the context is like because you may not know,

378
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:06,800
like, right. You're not going to like go somewhere and then right off the bat going to be able to do everything right away.

379
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:11,180
You're going to have to pay, listen and, you know, talk and see,

380
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:15,440
like what are the what are the what's the current situation like so that you can complete the work?

381
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:23,570
And then funding again is important. Whether you have it or not.

382
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:32,360
One of the limitations when I do grant work or the work that I've done, you know, I work with an institution that will honor that,

383
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:40,610
that can receive NIH funds, but not every institution in other places and other countries can.

384
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,360
So what happens if you write a grant, you get money, and then your collaborators,

385
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:48,680
maybe they work through local organizations and they how to get that money to them.

386
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:54,709
You know, is it it's it's not realistic and it's not very equitable if you're in a totally different country,

387
00:39:54,710 --> 00:40:02,670
managing all the funding and the local covers don't have any power over that measure of those funds.

388
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:06,829
So that but that can sometimes be restricted just by the funding mechanism.

389
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:10,160
And it might be out of our hands that we have to think about ways to be creative.

390
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:15,590
And so that's something you think about. You might not have so much this issue of students doing internships,

391
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:20,570
but later on when you're doing the work in the field, you might face these situations.

392
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:28,879
I'm not going to go through a lot of this in detail because this should be things that you talked about in your methods courses.

393
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,540
I really hope this is familiar. Yes. Okay, good.

394
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:42,250
Okay. But what I wanted to say is that kind of more broadly speaking, when we think about our study design, if we're thinking about doing something,

395
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:52,159
a project, you need to not only think about how the design is good for your specific research question and aims of the study,

396
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:57,260
but also what can realistically be done in a setting that you're going to be working on,

397
00:40:57,260 --> 00:41:04,730
particularly if you're working in a low income country setting or just in more challenging context, right?

398
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:12,490
So you have to think about and so everything you've learned about the strengths and the limitations of these designs is lending your methods courses.

399
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:17,240
Well, I think about that, but think about that in terms of like being in a challenging context.

400
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:23,220
So you may think like it's a great idea to do a cohort study, right?

401
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:27,470
You remember the designer cohort is that you start and you follow over time, right?

402
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:38,270
So if you're in a local context where there's a lot of instability or there's a lot of migration in and out, if there's political unrest,

403
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:44,480
that might not be possible to do that design, even though that might be your kind of ideal design for the study.

404
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:51,950
If you have real high turnover of staff, the cohort may not be a good design.

405
00:41:52,070 --> 00:42:03,700
Right? Because if you're doing. Over time doing interviews and you train staff and then you constantly have to retrain new staff.

406
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:11,709
That's a big problem. And I'm speaking on this like firsthand personal experience, and I'll talk about it when I talk about my own work.

407
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:19,540
But so these are issues that to think about. If you want to collect bio specimens as part of your study, like blood or urine or things like that,

408
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:25,120
is there an infrastructure to store those, not just to collect them, but to store them?

409
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,430
Is there, you know,

410
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:35,620
there these kind of the ability to have deep freezers and is there an ability to ship them or even or to analyze them within country?

411
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:43,719
Maybe not so. And is it acceptable to ask to take those samples from a population like culturally speaking?

412
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:50,380
Right. So you to think about that. So anyways, that's just to give us some examples, but you want to think about that, you know,

413
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:54,760
you want to think about what are the challenges with the designs for the concepts

414
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:58,390
you've been working in and which one what's going to seem to work really well?

415
00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:04,140
I'll just say one other thing about the sampling frame that's important, right?

416
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:10,480
Perfect analogy. You talked about that, about, you know, getting the right sample that represents your source population.

417
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:20,470
But if there's no data, census data or any kind of data describing the population, how do you know what your sampling frame is?

418
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:27,370
All right. That that can be a real challenge. So when I first did my first very first study, I was doing it as part of my back to work.

419
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:34,799
And I had I was working with three communities and I was I wanted to be able to recruit or

420
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:39,480
invite all families that had children five years old and under in these three communities.

421
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:43,560
There was no information at all about.

422
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:49,600
What the target population is like, how many that work? I actually did with my community partners.

423
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:54,790
We went house to house and did an actual census, actually went into the census and all that,

424
00:43:54,790 --> 00:44:03,240
all households in three regions so that I would know what my sampling frame was and then also what my participation rate was because I didn't know.

425
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:07,030
I didn't know, we didn't know. So we had to do that because there just wasn't that level data.

426
00:44:07,570 --> 00:44:10,630
So it's something you have to think about as an epidemiologist.

427
00:44:12,610 --> 00:44:18,009
Okay. Research instruments. I'm not going to say much on this piece because I have a whole session on this.

428
00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:20,470
So we'll talk about this later. Just two points I want to highlight.

429
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:28,880
One again is you want to think about what you can realistically collect and still get valid data on, right?

430
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:32,890
So it's better to collect less data if it's going to be more valid and accurate.

431
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:37,120
You don't want to like use really complicated instruments and then the data right now.

432
00:44:38,230 --> 00:44:47,380
And then the other thing I want you to think about is when you're thinking about all your instruments and three instruments and all that,

433
00:44:47,590 --> 00:44:50,880
there are other like a whole other set of documents that are really important.

434
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:55,329
Sometimes we don't think about when we think about study instruments and a quote unquote set of instruments.

435
00:44:55,330 --> 00:44:58,600
And those are things like the training manuals that you're going to need,

436
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:05,589
the descriptions of your protocols, manuals, all those documents that are really important.

437
00:45:05,590 --> 00:45:08,919
But sometimes we don't talk about them. Right. And they're they're really critical.

438
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:14,979
This is especially important for doing field work in primary data collection when you're in kind

439
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:20,230
of a more challenging context and you're having to train local folks to do the work and stuff,

440
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:23,320
you need to have these documents available.

441
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:30,650
There's also pilot studies that you always want to think about.

442
00:45:30,650 --> 00:45:35,030
And a lot of times the work you might be doing in your internships might actually be more pilot work.

443
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:41,780
And that's okay. I feel like pilots, you get looked at badly like they're not as valid or they're not as rigorous, but they're important.

444
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:47,629
They're a key part of our research because they help us think about our objectives

445
00:45:47,630 --> 00:45:51,230
and like what's really going to work with the community and helps with our planning.

446
00:45:51,230 --> 00:45:56,930
It helps us look at like staffing and training issues that we may need to face in a bigger study.

447
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:01,250
It tells us kind of what works, what doesn't work, right?

448
00:46:01,730 --> 00:46:06,950
Doing qualitative work at the space can be really helpful because that can help you think about developing a better study,

449
00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:11,019
a quantitative study instrument. So I like pilot studies.

450
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:14,380
I do pilot studies, and I feel like they should not get such a bad rep.

451
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:21,400
Yeah, that's the thing. So what's on that? Okay, so biological specimens again, we'll have examples.

452
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:27,940
I have so many examples. I could write like a series of books about my research and regular on this

453
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:32,919
because this has been really very difficult for the work that I've been doing.

454
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:39,370
But, you know, this is you know, this is an issue of like planning and methods, selecting and storing, transporting samples.

455
00:46:39,370 --> 00:46:43,600
If that's something you want to do, you have to respect cultural beliefs and community values.

456
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:52,810
Think about what kind of laboratory procedures are you actually able to do in a community that has limited laboratory capacity or other resources?

457
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:57,219
What kind of quality control can you do? The kind of permits and approvals do you need?

458
00:46:57,220 --> 00:47:01,840
So, you know, in the work in Ecuador that I've done, we had kind of what we call the quasi laboratory.

459
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:08,080
It was just like the space that we have our study kind of housed in and more of a semi kind of rural area.

460
00:47:08,890 --> 00:47:17,410
Um, and we had to get permits from many different levels to really just have a freezer there that has samples to store.

461
00:47:18,070 --> 00:47:30,940
Um, you know, and the infrastructure, you know, we have, we had a very, like a -80 degree freezer, like a real, real high, low tech freezers.

462
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:39,129
And we were in this home that we were renting, and because of the electrical infrastructure that wasn't really great.

463
00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:45,370
It blew out the whole electrical system of the home that we were renting. So we had to get all that fixed.

464
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,080
And of course that wasn't in our budget for a bit.

465
00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:56,610
So again, flexibility and being adaptive, but there's things to think about like can come somewhere else.

466
00:47:56,950 --> 00:48:00,459
We don't have anywhere else to put those samples. So what are we going to do? Right. We have to do that.

467
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:05,890
So and then just shipping getting shipments, shipping samples out, what kind of permits?

468
00:48:06,430 --> 00:48:10,989
It took us almost a year to get a permit to to ship samples out of the country.

469
00:48:10,990 --> 00:48:15,910
So from the from the from the higher ministry of expectations.

470
00:48:15,910 --> 00:48:24,130
So there's a lot of issues here doing material transfers between institutions, you know, actually having contracts of like.

471
00:48:25,370 --> 00:48:28,190
Who's going to have the ownership of the samples.

472
00:48:28,550 --> 00:48:36,290
That's a big issue when you're doing kind of international work and being more equitable in that sense.

473
00:48:36,770 --> 00:48:42,219
Okay. We'll talk a lot more about I RV later.

474
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:46,930
But just the idea that you keep in mind is like what's that part of infrastructure as well?

475
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:50,210
We have RB here, but is there RB where you're going to be working?

476
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:58,410
Are there other ethical boards that you need to? To get approval from the US.

477
00:48:58,410 --> 00:49:06,880
If we get an NIH grant, then they have to show this institution that's been funding has what's called it after the to assistance.

478
00:49:08,310 --> 00:49:14,550
And so like other institutions outside of the US in order to receive funding you have to get that.

479
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:20,849
So then you're putting that on the burden of those other institutions that they have to do this in order to receive grant funding,

480
00:49:20,850 --> 00:49:25,860
and not every organization in other countries is going to do that.

481
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:29,130
And so that goes back to that issue of funding. Who gets the funding?

482
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:33,930
So and then issues of, you know, consent and language and ethical issues.

483
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:38,940
And we're going to do some interesting case studies around this later on in the term to think about.

484
00:49:41,310 --> 00:49:45,719
We've covered a lot of this already and we're going to cover it a lot in this course.

485
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:47,730
I'm not going to say too much more here.

486
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:55,260
All I want to highlight is in terms of field operations, actual field work, I want to highlight that scientific rigor,

487
00:49:55,440 --> 00:50:02,550
right when we think about doing a rigorous study is really important, but perfection is not okay.

488
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:11,970
And let's just keep that in mind, right? I tend to be kind of a perfectionist and that doesn't always work out to be right.

489
00:50:12,390 --> 00:50:14,070
So you try to do the best you can.

490
00:50:14,430 --> 00:50:21,240
You try to do your studies, the best you can to limit any bias or any issues, and even the most valid studies you can do.

491
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:27,870
But it's it's not going to be perfect. Right? So so, you know, it's a balance.

492
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:33,449
It's about. All right.

493
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:38,219
And then in terms of data collection entry, again,

494
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:44,820
you want to always think about what's going to be working for the context that you're working in, for your internship or for your future work.

495
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:51,330
You know what can and we'll talk again when I talk about surveys in this session on instruments

496
00:50:51,330 --> 00:50:55,580
about implementation of questionnaire and things to think about with a questionnaire,

497
00:50:55,620 --> 00:51:00,839
a lot of you may be doing that in the summer, like maybe. Doing some sort of data collection questionnaire.

498
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:11,340
So we'll talk more about that and issues around data entry and management and cleaning and those kinds of things, you know, in.

499
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:20,299
The lower and middle income countries in particular. There's not a lot of second hand data that you can analyze.

500
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:23,010
So to do secondary data analysis, it just isn't right.

501
00:51:23,490 --> 00:51:31,860
So that's why and in my own situation, I've always collected my own data because there just wasn't data to analyze, you know?

502
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:39,450
So when you do global type of work, you tend to end up being really good at work and we're always good at it.

503
00:51:39,450 --> 00:51:46,919
But you're, you tend to get a lot of experience collecting around data because you just aren't big data sets to analyze.

504
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:51,700
Or if there's data as I get data available, might not be super a great quality.

505
00:51:54,930 --> 00:52:01,350
And then we'll talk a lot about this. And this is, again, connected back to like kind of the equitable collaboration pieces,

506
00:52:01,890 --> 00:52:07,140
the importance of returning back to your findings and returning data.

507
00:52:07,530 --> 00:52:11,159
So doing presentations like if you're going to be doing an internship,

508
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:18,330
can you can you think about what you can do while you're there, wherever you're at prior to finishing your internship?

509
00:52:18,330 --> 00:52:24,570
What happens once you start analyzing like some of you might use your internship data for your early work?

510
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:31,170
So setting up a plan to return those findings to the communities and the partners that you've been working with,

511
00:52:31,170 --> 00:52:37,770
that's super important and it's an essential component of having an equitable partnership.

512
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:43,709
Okay. And then I'm just going to finish up here talking a little bit about CPR,

513
00:52:43,710 --> 00:52:47,760
because I don't believe you get a lot of this in the program, at least early on.

514
00:52:47,770 --> 00:52:53,610
So how have you all had discussions about CPR in your courses so far?

515
00:52:54,480 --> 00:53:00,440
No. So, Hans, if you know what city PR.

516
00:53:03,850 --> 00:53:07,660
No one's brand new. That's. That's. I mean, it's.

517
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:12,720
Exciting for me to see you because I think it's really important.

518
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:18,360
But it's also kind of. Disappointing that it hasn't been talked about yet, but that's okay because you're only in your second semester.

519
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:22,439
But I do think that we don't talk about this enough, enough genealogy and it's really important.

520
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:27,810
So. So I was going to ask, what do we mean by CPR, which is community based, participatory research?

521
00:53:30,010 --> 00:53:33,190
You haven't had much experience with it, but what do you think it means?

522
00:53:33,430 --> 00:53:39,860
Like, what would you think when you see that? Yeah.

523
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:48,530
Does that have to be one of his other projects that are talking about?

524
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:54,290
That's okay. That's good. It can be. It can be.

525
00:53:54,530 --> 00:53:58,970
It's not always about just intervention kind of work, but it's definitely about sustainability.

526
00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:10,110
It definitely has the connection that. Isn't it kind of like building a like long standing relationship with the

527
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:14,780
community and like actually understanding kind of like what was mentioned before,

528
00:54:14,810 --> 00:54:23,220
what is community and making sure you understand what they need, what they want, what what they see their problems as.

529
00:54:23,230 --> 00:54:27,310
Because you might be like, Oh, this is the biggest problem here. I know what you mean.

530
00:54:27,370 --> 00:54:38,430
Right, exactly. Like, I know like focusing on the community as opposed to the outsider trying to be like closer to being like an insider,

531
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:41,800
an ally in whatever they want to do in that community.

532
00:54:42,010 --> 00:54:46,630
Okay. Yeah, that's exactly right. It does connect with what we're kind of about with those, like, equitable collaboration.

533
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:54,160
Yeah. Yeah. Um, what an aspect. It must be directly hiring community members and training them to work in your research.

534
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:58,870
Yeah, so it's part of that. It's a little bit more nuanced than that.

535
00:54:58,870 --> 00:55:07,540
And I'll go to the second part of that is, is definitely like having a team that represents the community that you're working in, right?

536
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:18,389
Yeah. No regrets. And so no experiences, I gather, using this approach.

537
00:55:18,390 --> 00:55:22,200
Right. Okay. All right.

538
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:27,480
So this is this is a these are two definitions about it.

539
00:55:28,410 --> 00:55:36,510
Some of the founding folks of CPR are from here in Michigan, and it's pretty high bar for Israel.

540
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:42,680
And Amy Schultz and that crew. And then at New Mexico was Nina Alston, who was my colleague of mine.

541
00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:45,780
So these are kind of the big the big legs of the CPR approach.

542
00:55:45,790 --> 00:55:50,680
They tend to be more like intervention work, not necessarily epidemiology.

543
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:55,230
I am a major proponent of CPR in that analogy, and that's not super.

544
00:55:56,550 --> 00:56:05,730
Common. There's a couple of us, the two of us in the department, myself and Dr. O'Neill, Marie O'Neill, who do this in good work.

545
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:16,140
I hope this changes and there's more acceptance and more use of CPR in a good work, but for now it is not as common.

546
00:56:17,310 --> 00:56:22,440
Collins, who's also one of the other big wings of CPR, this is from the text.

547
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:27,000
So cities are defined as a collaborative approach to research that engages partners and community.

548
00:56:28,110 --> 00:56:31,960
This will be on. I'll put this on. Um.

549
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:41,720
But, um. So geographic or otherwise, define what we talk about the role of community in all phases of the research project.

550
00:56:41,730 --> 00:56:43,950
And that's the key piece of CPR, right?

551
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:50,790
So with a shared goal of producing knowledge, that's translated to action, a positive social change for the community.

552
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:57,240
So in this case, all phases means even starting from thinking about the aims of a study or grant, you're going to know, right?

553
00:56:57,250 --> 00:57:01,170
Right. The community partners and partners all have an equal voice.

554
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:03,450
They all contribute equally.

555
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:11,489
There's a financial equity piece to that, that there's, you know, there's equal kind of responsibility to the finances of the study.

556
00:57:11,490 --> 00:57:21,530
It's all phases. All right. So that's what I meant when when you mentioned Sophia about, you know, the training and including the staff.

557
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:30,509
That is key. But it's also in addition, it's actually having like three partners as part of the the the design group about the,

558
00:57:30,510 --> 00:57:35,340
you know, the state team that actually is defining and creating the work.

559
00:57:35,350 --> 00:57:38,879
Right. So all partners have influence at all.

560
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:44,940
Partners have ownership. Um, and so this is just another, another definition.

561
00:57:45,270 --> 00:57:50,330
It's a partnership approach to research that equitably involves diverse partners in all steps of the research process.

562
00:57:50,340 --> 00:58:00,510
Again, just kind of highlighting that again and that there is equal approaches, influence and decision making and ownership of share.

563
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:09,710
So in terms of epidemiology, so this is a very useful approach for a few reasons.

564
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:14,400
One, it's very useful for identifying social determinants of health in the community.

565
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:21,900
So when you're going to go to start working with partners and designing studies, you're going to have a much better understanding of the context,

566
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:24,480
whether the social or the cultural factors,

567
00:58:24,810 --> 00:58:30,510
if you're having partners as part of the team or having an equal voice, right, it's just going to be helpful.

568
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:39,030
It's useful for understanding inequities in health. Again, this is super important when working with marginalized populations.

569
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:45,000
Especially those where there's like a breakdown of trust with researchers.

570
00:58:45,310 --> 00:58:51,100
So it's really helpful with that. And again, important for identifying needs in this lecture.

571
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:56,890
I think, Whitney, you mentioned that, which is identifying the needs and the issues that are of priority to the community.

572
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:05,800
So their strengths and their challenges, right. So the strength is it fosters collaboration.

573
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:10,210
You know, there's everyone is bringing to the table their knowledge.

574
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:15,550
And that's that's important for the design of our studies.

575
00:59:16,030 --> 00:59:21,910
But also, in addition to these strengths of just the overall sense I just mentioned.

576
00:59:22,950 --> 00:59:28,439
In terms of epidemiologic studies and epidemiologic fieldwork, which is what we're focused on.

577
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:33,569
Right. It's really helpful for enhancing recruitment and participation.

578
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:38,050
So remember, we want to have a pretty good participation rate or we'll have selection bias, right?

579
00:59:38,850 --> 00:59:45,270
So that's really helpful for that. And it also improves our research methods and the measurement of our variables,

580
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:52,710
because we'll design better instruments when we have community partners and people that are all at the table designing the study.

581
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:58,799
And again, that goes back to our fundamental focus of the reality is that we're trying to have a

582
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:03,300
sample that represents the source population and that gathered data and about where.

583
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:06,510
Right. And so that's that's a crucial aspect of this analogy.

584
01:00:06,510 --> 01:00:12,000
And so CBP actually very helpful to them. The challenges are a few.

585
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:17,670
It can be very time consuming. Right. And this can often conflict with funding agency timelines.

586
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:26,460
It's hard to write into a grant timeline that you need all this time prior to starting to build these relationships.

587
01:00:26,580 --> 01:00:32,250
More and more grants out of NIH are recognizing CPR, thankfully,

588
01:00:32,250 --> 01:00:40,470
because in the past we've had the kind of those of us who do some of this work had to kind of write it in a way in a grant like

589
01:00:40,590 --> 01:00:47,580
figure out our budget in a way that actually includes some we call it pre implementation work that is part of that CPR work.

590
01:00:48,210 --> 01:00:51,480
But it's it's hard and it was hard to get funding for it.

591
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:55,500
It's it's changing very slowly, but it's changing.

592
01:00:55,500 --> 01:01:01,290
There's certain institutes at NIH that are better at recognizing the value of CPR than others.

593
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:05,070
I think hopefully that just sets the momentum up.

594
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:10,140
The other big challenge is what we already talked about, which is the finding community.

595
01:01:10,470 --> 01:01:14,730
All right. That's goes back to like what do we mean by community and who is representing the community.

596
01:01:15,150 --> 01:01:19,080
So you might be working with organizations you think are great that represent the community.

597
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:25,500
Then you can find out that actually those they're not there's like this group of folks in the

598
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:30,959
community that don't really value that organization or their intentions or things like that.

599
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:34,110
And so it's like you have to think about like, how do you define community?

600
01:01:34,110 --> 01:01:41,670
Who gets involved in the study? And then I just had this quote and I think it's good for EP it again focusing on our EP work.

601
01:01:43,170 --> 01:01:51,860
Paul writes, CBR has the potential to be as good or as bad as the research design, collection methods, analysis and interpretation of results below.

602
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:59,340
So in other words, just because you're using CPR doesn't mean I'm sending this great design of a research study.

603
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:03,660
Right? We still have to think about all those other aspects of designing a good study,

604
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:11,010
and that still highlights how important scientific rigor is right for our work.

605
01:02:11,010 --> 01:02:19,740
So whether we use CPR or not, it's really important that we still are doing the rigorous work that we need to do for science, for our science.

606
01:02:24,330 --> 01:02:25,920
And I'll just finish up here with this.

607
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:33,750
A couple of quotes that I always like to give about the definition of genealogy, just to kind of ground ourselves back again in this field.

608
01:02:34,620 --> 01:02:37,320
So this is from the Dictionary of Do out of this mode,

609
01:02:37,350 --> 01:02:45,839
the text that it says epidemiology is the study of the distribution and determinants of health related states or events in specified populations,

610
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:54,120
and the application of the study to control health problems. And then another quote is Epidemiology is the science and practice,

611
01:02:54,120 --> 01:03:00,780
which describes and explains disease patterns of populations and puts the knowledge to use to prevent and control disease and improve health.

612
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:09,270
The reason I show these two definitions of epidemiology is I want to versus one graphics of back analogy,

613
01:03:09,270 --> 01:03:14,640
and then I want to show the commonalities of this, which is that epidemiology is a science, right?

614
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:20,320
We're doing rigorous scientific work. We have our methods and everything to do our work.

615
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:28,409
But it also has a societal role. Right now we have a society, so we're trying to assess causation.

616
01:03:28,410 --> 01:03:35,969
We're trying to get these data so that we can be able so that others can use these data

617
01:03:35,970 --> 01:03:42,420
to develop appropriate interventions or programs or to push for certain policies.

618
01:03:43,710 --> 01:03:48,750
And so we're not just collecting the data. We're not just data collectors and data analysts, right?

619
01:03:48,750 --> 01:03:54,810
We have a societal role. And this is very much the case in international or global effort work.

620
01:03:54,900 --> 01:04:02,700
Right. We're often working in areas where there aren't a lot of other folks doing anything.

621
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:09,719
And so we are often kind of doing it all well. Sometimes we're doing all the data collection and we're helping with thinking about policies.

622
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:13,020
And, you know, sometimes we're kind of in all those roles.

623
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:17,790
And so it is important to think about kind of the role that we play is as the scientist,

624
01:04:17,790 --> 01:04:22,650
as a criminologist, and also part of the bigger public health picture.

625
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:28,550
And then I'll just finish up with this last slide about the name.

626
01:04:28,790 --> 01:04:33,610
I just want to say this. There's an issue that I have with the name of this course.

627
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:40,940
It's a name that precedes me from taking it over the Philippines in developing countries.

628
01:04:41,990 --> 01:04:45,680
The way we use terminology and the way that we use words I think matters.

629
01:04:46,010 --> 01:04:50,720
Right. And so I don't really particularly like the term developing.

630
01:04:52,010 --> 01:04:54,590
And I would argue that we need to shift a little bit away from that.

631
01:04:54,950 --> 01:05:01,130
There are a lot of assumptions that come with this term developing versus developed.

632
01:05:01,370 --> 01:05:01,760
Right.

633
01:05:02,420 --> 01:05:12,200
There's kind of this hierarchy almost like almost the idea that developed countries are more ideal at the perpetuation of stereotypes a lot of times.

634
01:05:13,670 --> 01:05:19,280
And so this is a quote from Jose Cassey, who's a professor at the University of Cape Town,

635
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:24,260
and said The developed, developing relationship in any way replaces the colonizer colonized relationship.

636
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:28,700
The idea of development is a way for rich countries to control and exploit the poor and can see

637
01:05:28,700 --> 01:05:32,660
this is a development industry where billions of dollars are spent but very little gets cheap.

638
01:05:32,710 --> 01:05:41,750
And so I think this is important. Developing countries can have developed areas within their country that are more developed than other places.

639
01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:50,360
Right. And so we want to recognize that they may be more developed in cultural practices or social relationships or things like that,

640
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:56,220
where natural resources. So, you know, some are also said like more resource countries, we may have heard that.

641
01:05:56,600 --> 01:06:00,950
That is also, I think, can be problematic because, again, what what do we mean by resources?

642
01:06:01,610 --> 01:06:06,769
Some less well resourced countries may have really good resources in other things.

643
01:06:06,770 --> 01:06:11,690
So we need to think about that. There isn't a perfect term at all.

644
01:06:11,690 --> 01:06:15,950
At all. And I will say this, Ellen, I see is what I tend to use,

645
01:06:16,250 --> 01:06:22,490
but it's still problematic in the sense it's based on this like what's economically developing nations is based on GDP.

646
01:06:23,060 --> 01:06:27,170
There's a limitation there with the availability of data and all that. So there's a caveat there.

647
01:06:28,070 --> 01:06:31,900
It's. It's what the World Health Organization uses.

648
01:06:31,990 --> 01:06:37,910
I'll use that. It's not perfect, but I like it more than developing, so that's why I'm going to be using that.

649
01:06:37,930 --> 01:06:41,480
I just wanted to say that and let you all know why.

650
01:06:41,550 --> 01:06:45,400
Why I'm going to be using that terminology. Okay, great.
