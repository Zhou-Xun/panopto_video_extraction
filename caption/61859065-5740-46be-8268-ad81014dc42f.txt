1
00:00:02,182 --> 00:00:06,182
So the next one we're going to talk about is perusal.

2
00:00:06,182 --> 00:00:21,182
And again perusal is that collaborative social annotation e reader is pretty straightforward. We actually have an in house made handout, and also a video here that will be in the slides, in case you want to look at any of those information, as well as

3
00:00:21,182 --> 00:00:26,182
an Instructor Guide. But I do want to give you a quick tour of what that what personal looks like.

4
00:00:26,182 --> 00:00:43,182
Basically you can upload this is when you go into your course for perusal, and you can have hashtags for labeling each of those components in there as well as having students actually highlight and leave comments comments on there.

5
00:00:43,182 --> 00:00:59,182
So to kind of give you an idea as to what this looks like I'm going to share the example assignment you guys can kind of engage with an assignment of perusal on there, some of the perks to perusal is that you can have this as a, there's an AI algorithm

6
00:00:59,182 --> 00:01:14,182
that's built into it if you want a great component of it so so much engagement maybe 15% of their grade comes from engaging with perusal, and this can actually be the default version of approvals algorithm or it can be a customized one that you want so

7
00:01:14,182 --> 00:01:26,182
we could sit there and say that they need to read it at a slower pace so they need to spend so much time on each page together and I just briefing through, and they can get so many points that racked up for engaging with the content on there, competing

8
00:01:26,182 --> 00:01:32,182
with other students coming, having an initial comment on there as well.

9
00:01:32,182 --> 00:01:38,182
And so if you go to the Canvas site.

10
00:01:38,182 --> 00:01:46,182
Canvas site in our resilient teaching, there is a practice assignment for the perusal assignment.

11
00:01:46,182 --> 00:01:50,182
And you just have to click on the actual grey button down below.

12
00:01:50,182 --> 00:01:58,182
Open up perusal. And we have a reading in there already.

13
00:01:58,182 --> 00:02:16,182
And you can see there are some conversations that you can click on the actual highlighted pieces and it'll give you some ideas as to the kinds of conversations that are happening here.

14
00:02:16,182 --> 00:02:31,182
You can view them by clicking on the actual navigation pan and it'll take you directly to where that comment is, and then give you idea as to who's discussing this information as well.

15
00:02:31,182 --> 00:02:35,182
And so there are two main selection types.

16
00:02:35,182 --> 00:02:59,182
Mike, if you don't mind, I'll just demo those real quick. By default, it comes, goes to the annotate text. So, when you upload a PDF, it's going to do an optical character recognition OCR so that you can select the text here, and then leave a comment

17
00:02:59,182 --> 00:03:12,182
about it, a comment, a question, a discussion starter. And then there are going to be some items, perhaps that are able to be selected for example, there's some images in here.

18
00:03:12,182 --> 00:03:27,182
This other tool that sort of like a picture icon is going to allow you to sort of click and drag to select Oh, I can't highlight that much at once.

19
00:03:27,182 --> 00:03:50,182
about that part. Select a static image. So in the case of looking at a table or an image that is not text selectable text that's another option so those are the main ways that you post conversations and comments to the document.

20
00:03:50,182 --> 00:04:00,182
Thanks again for free that if you have that link you can go ahead and go in there and play with it as much as you like.

21
00:04:00,182 --> 00:04:08,182
And if you're having any troubles with getting into that resilient teaching so it didn't push you through just let us know and we'll be happy to add you.

22
00:04:08,182 --> 00:04:22,182
So again, some of the features the variety of content types, we showed you PDFs that's what professors are typically using it for or their journal article readings, but you can also upload docs web pages and video links as well.

23
00:04:22,182 --> 00:04:34,182
You can make this a class wide scale, but maybe you have a very large class and you can also divide these up into small groups and have different groups reading different readings or just interacting at a smaller group setting so that there's more engagement.

24
00:04:34,182 --> 00:04:48,182
And as mentioned, there is the grading component i would say probably half and half of the professors that I've worked with who have an integrated perusal have an underrated component to it, or, or do you like to use a graded aspect, or some type of just

25
00:04:48,182 --> 00:05:01,182
patient points. And one of the other great things about perusal is it does have an LTA which that simply means that it does integrate directly into Canvas so you can have a link in your Canvas site that directs them directly to the article in personal

26
00:05:01,182 --> 00:05:03,880
site, and it pushes the grade back into your grade book.
