1
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:20,000
start, that

2
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Telling you, the instructional assistance, how to enable that, and asking them to enable that for all of the remote virtual meetings in this screenshot here you can see you should have a live transcript button in your zoom.

3
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Toolbar, and when you click on that you get some options for how to view the live transcript.

4
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,000
If you don't click it you don't need to turn it on. if you don't want but for those that it might help.

5
00:04:49,000 --> 00:05:05,000
There is a subtitle option that shows it in sort of a closed caption style a full transcript which pops out in a side panel for you as the instructor That's gonna be on the classroom

6
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
side. this line transcript is gonna work best the closer I am to the microphone.

7
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:17,000
That's picking me up and in our rooms those microphones are the meeting owls.

8
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,000
So as I go away the meeting, I will does a good job of following me as I move around the room.

9
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:31,000
If I move and talk to someone or someone speaks in the other room.

10
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:49,000
However, my voice pick up may range particularly when there's more people in, and the that's when the trends get transcripts up. title might become a little less accurate.

11
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:57,000
The further I get from that microphone, or the harder it is for me to hear

12
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
The University of Michigan is not requiring masking.

13
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
In the classroom. However, if you do choose to wear a mask.

14
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Know that you will wanna project even more, so that those in the room, as well as the microphone, can hear you.

15
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:23,000
So for this particular session i'm gonna invite you to unmute your microphone at any time to ask questions.

16
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You can use the chat to ask questions i'm gonna say Don't bother raising your hand.

17
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
That's really hard for me to see when i'm screen sharing so.

18
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I Won't see that and I don't wanna miss anyone so please feel free to use your microphone or chat to communicate with me.

19
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:51,000
So. just a quick question. all of the classrooms in the summer session are equipped pretty similarly to the one you're showing us now.

20
00:06:51,000 --> 00:07:07,000
They're all the same that's right so there'll be a computer projection for in the room. and this meeting owl device for audio video and speaker

21
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It was all equipped for the residential classes. we have where we're doing recording of class meetings.

22
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,000
So you should be all set there, and we will be doing some training with our instructional assistance.

23
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
This afternoon and tomorrow, to make sure that they can assist

24
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:39,000
However, faculty need if there are questions. So a couple of questions that did come in are You know how to use the owl, and the nice thing is that all is connected.

25
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And then it also sets to be the default device over zoom.

26
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:57,000
But we're, We'll talk more about that during the student assistant trainings, and then how to work through in-class data analysis examples together.

27
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:04,000
So this was one thing that was on the registration form of what's on your mind.

28
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:11,000
We will try to address those. but I wanted to give you a picture to show you what i'm looking at in front of me.

29
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
This is the meeting owl when it's turn on and activated.

30
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It has those little eyes that start blowing and it in some way kind of gives me some eye contact to look at.

31
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I don't have anyone in the room. with me right now, and so typically, when you do have someone in the room, your attention is going to be to make eye contact with them.

32
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:42,000
So I have you all, and so my attention is more drawn to my screen, and the the eyes looking at me right there.

33
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:54,000
So the little dome on top is that 3 60 camera it's picking up the full room circle that you can see really small at the top of my video, and then the bottom one.

34
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:01,000
The video tracks wherever it senses sound coming from it will also split.

35
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:14,000
So if there's 2 people talking in the room it might do a split screen here and do both, so it's a pretty neat webcam tool

36
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Click in sharing with faculty and instructional assistance is we're gonna kind of divvy. Some of these technical roles a little bit for the in-person classes instructional assistance are gonna schedule The zoom meetings in the canvas

37
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
sites. They're gonna connect, Go ahead and connect the classroom computer to that Zoom meeting.

38
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:46,000
We're gonna have them log into the classroom computer for the faculty member initiate that Zoom meeting check that the settings are working properly.

39
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
And then during the class the instructional assistant is going to.

40
00:09:50,000 --> 00:10:06,000
If waiting room is a security setting on the zoom class meeting they're gonna monitor that waiting room to make sure anyone who dropped off can get back in or at the beginning of class letting everyone in they're gonna monitor the

41
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,000
chat. If any questions come in over chat and they're gonna be able to get the faculty members attention.

42
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Oh, we have some a question coming in over the chat so that the faculty member can focus on what's in front of them and teaching, and then, any raise hands.

43
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
If someone use their reaction to maybe raise a hand to leave a comment or say something.

44
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
That instructional assistant can do the same thing up.

45
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Oh, we have someone who has something to say on the zoom.

46
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:52,000
That person can then use the chat or a mute their microphone, which we will hear here in the room to address the class our structural assistance. will be doing some remote participant management in terms of if we're hearing noise

47
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,000
from somebody's microphone they'll be able to mute that

48
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,000
And if okay, class wants to use anything like breakout rooms that can be managed by the instructional assistant.

49
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Welcome welcome in class participant, fantastic.

50
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Jumped in and i'm i'm just talking about some of the roles between what the instructional assistance will be doing, and what the faculty will be doing if you want to use any breakout rooms

51
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:35,000
the instruction assistant can manage that and then you know if there's any links that need to be shared out, so to speak, like

52
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:48,000
If maybe if you're giving a handout in with paper to the room, maybe the instructional aid can give the zoom participants a link on where they can find that online, and then we'll also be working with the

53
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
instructional assistance training them how to publish an archive.

54
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:21,000
These recordings, the class recordings for the program. as the faculty member you're here to teach, and trying to sort of clear off some of these technical details to allow you to do that

55
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:31,000
And to do in class that may need to be adjusted for the 2 audiences you're gonna have you're gonna have the group in person.

56
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:42,000
And so you know how to do that in person and Then you have the group that's going to be virtual. And so you might know how you would do that if you were teaching fully online.

57
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
But how do we do it to make it work for both groups?

58
00:12:46,000 --> 00:13:03,000
And so we're gonna talk about some of that today. and then i'll offer up any consultation you need with you and your instructional assistant to figure out how to do that action expectations for both of

59
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:13,000
these groups the in person, and the virtual and so we're gonna talk about that on a later slide, and then communicate with your assistant.

60
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:19,000
What do you need for them? What you need them to do what's your plan for the class?

61
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
And is there? Do you want to maybe use breakout rooms?

62
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Are you gonna have people group together in the room and so if letting them know we're gonna do breakout rooms.

63
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I want in groups of 3 and We'll give them about 20Â min to work on some problem sets some information like that, so they can be prepared and make sure they know how to support that

64
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Will the assistant be in the class, or on zoom?

65
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,000
The assistant will be in the class. If they are not, we will try to communicate with you specifically.

66
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,000
But what we want to do is have them in the class so that they can be a voice for anyone.

67
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Any questions that come in that's exactly right yeah

68
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:29,000
When talk about classroom setup we've covered that a little bit communication engagement, and then communication and engagement in between classes.

69
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,000
So again, I have this workstation Pc: computer that is running zoom.

70
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:42,000
The meeting out here is managing the Audio and video and i'm, doing screen share over zoom.

71
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:49,000
So that the remote participants can see my slides.

72
00:14:49,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Already the in person group. When I have the projectors on they can see anything, I pull up on this computer Additionally, we're working with student assistance.

73
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:13,000
This is afternoon, and tomorrow they're gonna have a laptop in the room with you, so that they can do that zoom management.

74
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:22,000
That's our goal. We talk about communication and setting expectations in the room.

75
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:38,000
This is going to be really easy. You can see how people spaces when they kind of wanna say something or they look confused and have a question, so it will be very natural to restore whatever comes up in the room.

76
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:45,000
But do you want to setup expectations of raise your hand or it's an open forum?

77
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Go ahead and speak up. but then you also want to consider your virtual audience.

78
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Is it an open mic is there? are people going to be talking over each other in the room and through the speaker on zoom?

79
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
But to ask your remote participants to raise the hand.

80
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:11,000
So we know you have a question, and we can make make room for you to speak without having to jump in on somebody else.

81
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Or would you like the virtual participants? to use the chat to get attention or post their question, and have that instructional assistant relay that to me? So I think you'll get a sense pretty early on of how well these

82
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:35,000
work, you know, an additional factor is going to be how many people are in the room versus how many people are online?

83
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:44,000
That's gonna be some things that those different dynamics of how chaotic or organized it ends up being.

84
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,000
But just think about how you want to handle questions and interaction.

85
00:16:49,000 --> 00:17:01,000
You know. Maybe you begin with Does anyone in the room have any questions or comments them a minute?

86
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Answer those questions and then leave space for? Are there any questions online feel free to unmute or chat?

87
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:20,000
So kind of creating a specific thing, and you can even create a slide in your presentation that says questions in room questions.

88
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Virtual. Yeah, yes. So So as an instructor. am I logging on to my canvas, or I love not my zoom

89
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Your instructional assistance gonna help unless you get there First feel free to go to canvas and launch zoom.

90
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:51,000
The Zoom meeting from the canvas site that's where they will be.

91
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Yeah.

92
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I. However, you wanna manage your classroom. let your students know that your instruction might eat none

93
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Students. This is the part The Zoom meeting is launched from the canvas site.

94
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:30,000
So this is mean that the the power point file that we're going to display has to be on the canvas site, or can we have that like the I I didn't distribute my powerpoint file to the students

95
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:38,000
to have them downloaded. So where would I? Where should I locate that file

96
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:57,000
So the canvas site will be where you can launch the Zoom meeting, and then, if you have the powerpoint, you know jump, drive, or if you've shared it with your instructional aid and they can download, it, to

97
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:07,000
this computer, the the Powerpoint, could be really anywhere. If you upload it to canvas, you could open it from there.

98
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
So so yeah, i'm not intending to provide it to the students.

99
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
So I don't want to update It to canvas unless there's a place there that is not publicly available.

100
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:23,000
But it sounds like your advice is to email this to the instructional assistant, and then she can put it on the local computer.

101
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:29,000
And I can find it there. Okay, So i'll do that thank you that is definitely one option.

102
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I will say that i'll use my practice canvas site you can also, in the files area.

103
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
You can also create folders that are not available to students.

104
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:59,000
On a save any files instructor only and you and your assistant would also would be the only ones who could see this even if it's unpublished.

105
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:13,000
So let me go back. Instructor only I can hide that folder, so that there's a lot of different ways.

106
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
But yes, if you share with your instructional aid, they can assist.

107
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:27,000
So this Zoom menu here will be the best way to launch the Zoom meeting.

108
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:42,000
So your instructional aids will schedule those and there'll be a list of meetings here in this on this page.

109
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Yeah. wanna know a little bit more about how you run your classes.

110
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
These are pretty long classes, you know how how do you use that time.

111
00:20:51,000 --> 00:21:07,000
So i'm gonna launch a poll and i'm gonna put the link in the chat

112
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:23,000
And a smartphone on you

113
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Dot com.

114
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Flash. No, not e.

115
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:53,000
U a n n a e

116
00:21:53,000 --> 00:22:04,000
It asks for a name, but you should be able to skip that

117
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:27,000
These are just some examples of things you might do in the class with a group

118
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:35,000
So with only lecture, no activities. yes, you can skip the name.

119
00:22:35,000 --> 00:23:05,000
So what activities we use in the summer session that's our things you use during your class time

120
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Also say the the tool i'm using here is pull everywhere and this is a great tool.

121
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:25,000
So if if this session, were totally virtual and everyone was on zoom, I could use the zoom polls if I had any questions for the group.

122
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:36,000
However, when i've got people that are in person and online, or I wanna do something more besides just a multiple choice poll question.

123
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Everywhere is a great option to do that, because Ananda is in the room, and he was able to put out his phone and type in the short url.

124
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,000
And for the Zoom group I was able to drop it in the chat for quick access.

125
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:01,000
And you all can take the same coal, and these results are showing up.

126
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Live. So this is one example of a poll. but open ended activities is another one.

127
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:15,000
So if there was a if you at the end of class, you know what what items are you still unclear about?

128
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:33,000
People can pull up their laptops or their smartphones, and you know, so am I not anonymously or fully anonymous kind of leave some feedback for you on things they might need to go over the next day or

129
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:40,000
during the office hours, or something like that

130
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Just sort of guide. some of the things we talk about today, so only lecture no activities.

131
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
This will be very straightforward, because you have the computer.

132
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:58,000
You have the screen share, and you've got the video and then you have your instructional aid helping you with questions that come in.

133
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,000
So you have everything that you need your way to go when you have additional activities.

134
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:12,000
That's where we want to think about Okay, how do I plan for this to include both groups full class discussion.

135
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,000
So again, this will be pretty straight. Have the in-person group.

136
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:27,000
But how do we make room for that virtual group? And one way you might do this is what, if I stop share?

137
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I switched my view to gallery go full screen so if I have so what you're with the in person group is seeing right now.

138
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Are any webcams over zoom they're displaying kind of showing them who's online where we can have more of a open discussion.

139
00:25:52,000 --> 00:26:03,000
The peek at that split screen. view maybe it's been doing that other times. so and since it's a little weird to see our camera in the room.

140
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I can actually hide that. Hi! you So now we only see the crew.

141
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:16,000
That's online, right? because we just end up watching with that that video is doing so.

142
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:40,000
This would be a nice view. We take the slides off and in the room. We have the other people, and we can talk and discuss, and then I can reinitiate my screen share when i'm ready.

143
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:49,000
This is a oh great thing to think about, And one nice thing we have in some of our Sp.

144
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Classrooms are the tablet screens, and I looked up, and I believe you are in a classroom that has a tablet screen.

145
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I don't know if you've used this room before

146
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I think that these are mostly smaller rooms

147
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,000
2615, and I did check it does have a tablet screen.

148
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:27,000
So if you do whiteboard work you'll be able to draw or write directly on the screen the room that i'm in right now, which is why I switched rooms with this one has a tablet screen and that one

149
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,000
didn't but nobody's scheduled to use that room next door, Anyway.

150
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:42,000
So I wanted to be able to use to show off the tablet screen

151
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I can. there are a couple of different types. This is a weightcom tablet.

152
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,000
The other one has the pen that plugs in that you can disconnect.

153
00:27:53,000 --> 00:28:00,000
The thing you need to plan on is what drawing tool do you want to use?

154
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Do you have anything that you typically use? I have not even a tablet screen, but not normally what I do when I teach them.

155
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
I have my ipad, and I have the regular screen.

156
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:27,000
So the regular screen. I just on the ipad I just turn off the audio and use that as my whiteboard would be an option like if you're most comfortable with that that is an option you join from here.

157
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Bring your ipad join in no audio no webcam, so that you can drop just screen share because you're in group in class group will see it on the projection right?

158
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:47,000
And the Zoom people will also see it when you're screen sharing from the Icon so that's a great option.

159
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Zoom also has a white board, and so because i'm projecting in the room.

160
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Yeah, I think I would have to do new share. Whiteboard.

161
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:16,000
So I have my draw tools

162
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:26,000
I can draw on the screen. One nice thing about these tablet screens is they do adjust so they've got a little adjustment, so I can lay it down to write a little easier.

163
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:38,000
This is an awkward angle to write at, but with with these right second to school, Hmm: yeah.

164
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:46,000
I think if I were to adjust this here so I felt that it was on that it wasn't very smooth.

165
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Okay.

166
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Well, yeah, so what are you doing now? you're you're writing on the zoom? whiteboard?

167
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Correct, And what are you writing with because i'm not able to make letters with the cursor like with the mouse external 10 I'm.

168
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Writing with an external pen, because if I was writing with a mouse, I would get this that's right.

169
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:25,000
That was that's my concern so so you can write with an external pen on the zoom whiteboard.

170
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:32,000
I didn't know you could do that. Oh, if you have a device that has a stylus.

171
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:39,000
And so the computer monitor in this classroom is actually a tablet screen.

172
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:48,000
It comes with its own pen, and i'm using this and because the zoom whiteboard has drawing features.

173
00:30:48,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I can use the pen with the tablet screen okay so that's. that's very, very interesting and potentially So you're suggesting that most of the classrooms will have this functionality half of the

174
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:11,000
classroom, so

175
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Classroom did not. my But if you are interested I could look into moving the room that you're in, so that you can have access.

176
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Yeah, I i'm just you know concerned about this issue of how I draw on the board.

177
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
You know. Someone asked a question, and then my typical response is to draw on a whiteboard.

178
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:47,000
But I can't do that, for both participants and I can't write legibly with a a mouse, so, unless I have some way to wield the pat, I I don't know what to do now another option, would be if I can turn

179
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:53,000
the camera on The classroom whiteboard is that legible to the remote participants.

180
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Well, let's see i'm gonna grab a whiteboard here.

181
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:12,000
We'll just do an experiment I don't have any dark colored pets here, so let's see hello

182
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:20,000
So. So right now you're a very tiny box on my screen, because you're sharing the zoom whiteboard.

183
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Oh, yep, that's right Yes, and so as a zoom viewer, You would almost need to adjust your view settings to see that.

184
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:44,000
So it's quite a bit of work. Oh, I am discouraging whiteboard drawing, because my in class this is very easy for my in class group, but extremely challenging for a virtual group.

185
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:58,000
So I do want to help you find some way to if you want to draw on the board that we can do this virtually, because even though i'm using the zoom whiteboard where you all can see it, because I have it up on

186
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:15,000
my computer screen, it's being projected in the classroom So my in-person group can also see it also change my pen caller So does this pen Allow me to also annotate the slides.

187
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,000
If i'm screen sharing a powerpoint presentation Can I have it?

188
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Can I draw on those slides as well? because Powerpoint Microsoft Powerpoint supports drawing

189
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:42,000
You can. So let me, demo that real quick

190
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Download this so that it doesn't work on Google slides because that does not have annotation built in

191
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Let me reinitiate my full screen share. and so, when I, when I do set up screen, share you may not be able to see it on the far zoom end, but I always do the full screen because I want to be able to pull up a

192
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
browser. I may need to show something in canvas.

193
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I want to open Powerpoint, and then I may need to open a program such as R.

194
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:31,000
And I want everyone to be able to see all of this without me having to switch what program i'm sharing in zoom

195
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:50,000
So when i'm using microsoft powerpoint and i'm in slideshow mode the menu down at the bottom here, it may be a little hard to see, but it gives me draw options. so I can do pen so

196
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:56,000
I can write or highlighter if I just want to, sort of circle things.

197
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:09,000
And then at the bottom I get to change my color in if i'd like

198
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:15,000
So now I can use the pen and write directly on the slides on the computer.

199
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Monitor that's live does that annotation go away.

200
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Yes, perfect. Okay, good. I've and what powerpoint also does is when I leave this slide, show it'll ask you.

201
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Wanna save those annotations with, or do you want to just remove them?

202
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:43,000
So say you had a really good diagram on there that you wanna save for later, or maybe share with the students.

203
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Worked on something together. You can keep that. So yeah.

204
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,000
So this this screen in 1152 is really nice.

205
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I can't see the fancy brand so this is only 4 has some annotation.

206
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:20,000
It's more like it I think it treats it more like editing

207
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:38,000
So here's that of want to keep your ink annotations keep them or discard, so I didn't do anything special, so i'll just discard that that'll be using I use something for

208
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:48,000
notability.

209
00:36:48,000 --> 00:37:07,000
So do you do typically do that on your ipad, And then I put that annotated copy of the same lecture file on campus

210
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Yes.

211
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Is that available through like an sph license.

212
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:22,000
So is not free, but it's very cheap it's like $5, or something like that.

213
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:31,000
So because I invested in my on 19 so I can't dive and then very nice.

214
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Yeah, Yeah, I did want to show one other thing. Yeah.

215
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:47,000
So I think if you have a tried and true way i'm guessing notability would have to be installed here for it to work.

216
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I don't know if it's available on a bye my own left phone ipad then .

217
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Everything will be set that's right I did want to show you

218
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Jam Board is a Google tool. So this is free through the university.

219
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:36,000
And this is another tool that we share for it's. a good brainstorming or, note taking organizing icebreaker jam board basically works similar to the Zoom whiteboard But I get to save it all in my

220
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Google drive older. I can share I can save everything we've done So maybe we're building on something every day we're working on something every day.

221
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:57,000
We can add more pages to our whiteboard

222
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:06,000
And jam board has this toolbar on the far left, which lets me draw with a pen.

223
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:12,000
It. Lets me use the eraser I can use my mouse in case i'm looking.

224
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:19,000
I want to select something and move it. and one nice thing that's been popular with Jim.

225
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Board is. it gives you sticky notes. So when we think of things that we in purse in our in-person classes, we may have done with a flip chart, you know, having groups brainstorm or visit different topics

226
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:46,000
around a room. This is one way we've learned to sort of adapt to that in a virtual environment

227
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Type right in there. I can change the color if I want hit.

228
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Save, and automatically gives me a new sticky note in case I have another note to make, or I can cancel that so it automatically stuck my sticky note right here in the top left.

229
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:17,000
But I can click on it and drag it. I can resize it

230
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:30,000
In advance. I created these text queues and some information

231
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Just a tip. I was a teaching assistant at unc and we use jam boards for polls as well like.

232
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:44,000
There'd be cause you make you make different pages so like there'd be 5 different pages with different questions, and we'd all put like sticky notes, and it'd be anonymous.

233
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:54,000
So then, like the professor, could like, save our answers and like we comment on each other's answers, and it was a good way to do polls as well.

234
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:00,000
A great that's a great use case it's a very flexible, you know, for whatever you can think about.

235
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Think of sorry. Where do you find this? Is there a like a shortcut icon computer?

236
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Or is this navigate? you can navigate to this from Google?

237
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Or where do you find this? So i'm here in my Google drive?

238
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:22,000
And when I want to create a new Google driver item here's all my basics, doc, sheets.

239
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:29,000
But under more is jam board. Okay, I see. Thank you.

240
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:43,000
So again with jam board. I can set things up in advance, you know, when you work on a zoom white board, it's blank every time, and so you have to start from scratch, which is fine for if you just need to

241
00:41:43,000 --> 00:42:01,000
diagram or white for something. but if you want to, maybe set things up in advance and then. So when we think about sharing this and post a link for the virtual group, and then we want to think about okay, how do I get a

242
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:07,000
link to my in person group. I can do that through canvas is a great way to do that.

243
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:16,000
I could send a canvas announcement so it'll go to everyone in the room and virtually, and that's something, you know.

244
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Getting those links available is something your media system can help with.

245
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:30,000
And they could set this up, or they can help you distribute it. if you set it up in advance.

246
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Like here's a Monday jam board we're gonna compile all of our Monday brainstorming and diagrams and whiteboarding

247
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:54,000
So again here. you can set the different backgrounds so here's a graphing background, and you can also insert your own image.

248
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,000
So I could upload if I had an image on this computer.

249
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:04,000
This is the classroom computer. So it's it's empty right now they've they've wiped it.

250
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:14,000
But when I have the tablet screen in the classroom.

251
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:23,000
I can

252
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Drop. a study of my hand allows me to, but the screen is pretty smooth

253
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Gam board has a laser pointer it as though the last one, so I can circle Things point to things, and it sort of disappears on its own.

254
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:05,000
When I have my pen close notice it, kind of works like a laser pointer, and the difference is it's a digital laser pointer.

255
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:18,000
It's not me on the physical screen where only the in-person students can see what I'm pointing to, but everyone in the room and virtually can see.

256
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:37,000
So this text box the t is how I set up text in advance, and then using these drag handles

257
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Either my mouse or the pen. I can make adjustments to how big for small businesses

258
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:58,000
And then again I can leave and come back to this later.

259
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:07,000
So let me go ahead and share

260
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:16,000
So I share it like any other Google Doc.

261
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Shared location like a canvas site that you and I are in for me to share this link with you.

262
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:31,000
But your class would have that shared content. Repository

263
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:50,000
So again, just just some options and things to consider I will send you my appointment calendar link, so you can take a time that works for you.

264
00:45:50,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Thank you for coming

265
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:09,000
What else did we have here? So I think we covered the items that we discussed.

266
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:22,000
What else do you have on your mind we've got minutes

267
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Share Briefly, Just so. I can see you all

268
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:58,000
So I did record this, and part of the reason was, I wanted you to be able to see what your zoom recordings might look like for the in room.
