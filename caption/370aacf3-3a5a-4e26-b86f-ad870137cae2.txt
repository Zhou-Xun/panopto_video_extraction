1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,850
Ananda Sen: it's to.

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:07,200
Ananda Sen: My plan is to just go over.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,849
Ananda Sen: Some.

4
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:17,789
Ananda Sen: Remaining stuff things from here in there, one thing I definitely want to cover is is this concept of.

5
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:25,770
Ananda Sen: A case control study that's so that's one of the things which comes up in the application of logistic regression every now and then and.

6
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:37,740
Ananda Sen: And in that context talk a little bit about matching so match case control study that's my my my real goal i'm the rest of it whatever I can do, I can do.

7
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:56,040
Ananda Sen: You have the notes and i'll have some relevant soft where codes, also for some of those so we'll we'll see how far we can go some administrative things for those of you, there are only two actually what taking it for credit, I will.

8
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:05,280
Ananda Sen: I will submit the grades, probably by Monday and I will have a chance to look at your assignments before that.

9
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,980
Ananda Sen: Also.

10
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:17,580
Ananda Sen: I think I sent out that message about evaluations I don't exactly know how the evaluations work here, but.

11
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:28,770
Ananda Sen: it's not the same as the regular class evaluations, but I was told that there are two different evaluations, when you log on to your homepage of the course.

12
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:36,840
Ananda Sen: There is a link which takes you to the both evaluations, the course evaluation, you can do anytime if you have already done it fine.

13
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:51,780
Ananda Sen: Even if you have not done it, you can do it a little later the program evaluation, you have to do after the end of the course and I guess you do it for every course you take in the program so.

14
00:01:51,780 --> 00:02:01,170
Ananda Sen: that's my that's my understand um so that's pretty much all the stuff and.

15
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:03,600
Ananda Sen: And it was.

16
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,030
Ananda Sen: It was.

17
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:11,730
Ananda Sen: actually quite quite a pleasure to have you guys all here and and talk about various things and.

18
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:18,780
Ananda Sen: You know, you know I don't think this does a justice to any of the topics, especially if you have not used it before.

19
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:40,230
Ananda Sen: But hopefully you have taken a little bit here and there, and and should be able to start using it that's that's the whole whole idea and i've given you plenty in SAS to do a pretty decent job of logistic regression or pause on regression on your normal linear regression.

20
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:49,710
Ananda Sen: There are always things which which are more complex more complicated and but, but the basic ones are are all there.

21
00:02:49,710 --> 00:03:02,490
Ananda Sen: OK, so the plan is, I will want to go over a little bit of the wrong test we do not so much because of the test the test is more academic in nature.

22
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:16,650
Ananda Sen: But because this is used as a macro and that's something which we have not used in our SAS applications before so so what i'll do is i'll go over that first.

23
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:26,760
Ananda Sen: Probably from the SAS portal which, which will help in seeing how that works out and then after that.

24
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:32,040
Ananda Sen: We can move on to the last lab and last lecture.

25
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:38,610
Ananda Sen: Any questions.

26
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:40,890
Ananda Sen: Okay.

27
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:45,330
Ananda Sen: Alright, so let's.

28
00:03:45,330 --> 00:04:41,490
Ananda Sen: Share screen from my laptop.

29
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:54,780
Ananda Sen: Alright, so.

30
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,300
Think.

31
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:22,140
Ananda Sen: I think it was a fish data okay all right, let me first connect my data.

32
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,840
Ananda Sen: This is the fish data.

33
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:34,260
Be.

34
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:44,700
Ananda Sen: Let me remind you again, there are a lot of different variables in this in this data set but really it was talking about the number of fishes caught in a resort.

35
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:56,970
Ananda Sen: And the few questions which we were interested in where things like you know persons is one of the variables, which is important to the three variables, I have.

36
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:09,900
Ananda Sen: Put in their account is the number of fishes card per family, of course, or poor interviewing The idea is that you're only interviewed one person from a family.

37
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:17,220
Ananda Sen: The number of children in the in the group and number of people in the room.

38
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,530
Ananda Sen: So that's kind of what.

39
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:38,520
Ananda Sen: What those variables are that there are some other variables there which I don't think we have ever used camper is another one which we have used a thing.

40
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:48,480
Ananda Sen: Okay, so let's go to.

41
00:06:48,480 --> 00:07:00,930
Ananda Sen: So under the code.

42
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:07,470
Ananda Sen: So we were looking at different things we looked at the count.

43
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:10,800
Ananda Sen: We looked at the count we looked at.

44
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:18,300
Ananda Sen: The count as a function of child and camper and then.

45
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,180
Ananda Sen: We also looked at.

46
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:31,770
Ananda Sen: Some different distributions we fit we fit a zero inflated person model and we fit zero and fitted negative binomial millennium and we.

47
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:45,540
Ananda Sen: We concluded that zero and negative binomial model was by far, one of the best models, we have used okay So how do we formally test whether there is a need for a zero in fitted ball.

48
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:53,730
Ananda Sen: And that's where once this comes in and, as I pointed out yesterday, it is.

49
00:07:53,730 --> 00:08:04,290
Ananda Sen: As a test of likelihood ratio, so the likelihood ratio test except it's a likelihood ratio test of two completely separate models, these do not need to be.

50
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:18,210
Ananda Sen: Based on the same model or something like that, so you can you can talk about a persona 00 inflated binomial and doing for the negative binomial and so on and so forth quite different models so it's very general.

51
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:32,400
Ananda Sen: Okay now vong is, as I mentioned before it's it's not incorporated in the main says, but there is a SAS macro For those of you who are not familiar with macro macro is like.

52
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,620
Ananda Sen: A function.

53
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:50,820
Ananda Sen: it's it's like calling that function see when you say in your calculator a log of a number or exponential of a number that you're calling a function, it is like that the the.

54
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:56,940
Ananda Sen: The macro is the macro works like in the same manner.

55
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:09,570
Ananda Sen: So there is a macro which I have downloaded here, and this, you need to download to be able to have a monster into I have no I don't have to me.

56
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:11,790
Ananda Sen: So I should.

57
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:38,640
Ananda Sen: download that macro so let me just go ahead and download that macro.

58
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,090
Oh there it is that's why I was not fine.

59
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:50,520
Ananda Sen: Okay, so.

60
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:56,520
Ananda Sen: One is the one which they want.

61
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:11,550
Ananda Sen: Typically, what will happen is, it will be on the SAS website these macros and you can download the design and downloadable format so see now we have long as one of the.

62
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:26,400
Ananda Sen: One of the files so yeah I need that all right So what do I do now, what I do now is what I was doing before so, in other words, set up the path.

63
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:31,650
Ananda Sen: And here is one thing I want to point out.

64
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:42,120
Ananda Sen: Here is one thing I want to point out is that what you need to be careful about you replace this entire thing.

65
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:49,350
Ananda Sen: But don't replace the last statement that's actually the fight, you need to call that fight.

66
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:53,550
Ananda Sen: If you don't have that file.

67
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:58,050
Ananda Sen: Then.

68
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:05,310
Ananda Sen: If you don't have that file, then, then you cannot run it so make sure that you have that file.

69
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:11,100
Ananda Sen: mentioned in that percent I nc statement.

70
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,840
Okay.

71
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,950
Ananda Sen: So.

72
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,690
run it.

73
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:33,060
Ananda Sen: Actually let's do this all at the same time and then i'll explain what this is.

74
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:43,380
Ananda Sen: Make sure that we've got something.

75
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:52,740
Ananda Sen: Something didn't drown properly so.

76
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:56,400
So it doesn't like it, so let me.

77
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:16,590
Ananda Sen: Go back and see why did not like it.

78
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:19,620
Ananda Sen: today.

79
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:41,580
school.

80
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:46,200
Ananda Sen: Maybe it's still like that we just.

81
00:12:46,200 --> 00:13:02,280
Make sure.

82
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:11,580
not sure why it is not running.

83
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:21,480
better than invocation.

84
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:25,680
Ananda Sen: I do have the.

85
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:33,060
Ananda Sen: Oh, I see it's maybe maybe it's the maybe it's the.

86
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:41,940
Ananda Sen: SAS is finicky about.

87
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:52,230
Ananda Sen: capital and small so let's see if that works.

88
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:55,560
Ananda Sen: it's taking longer.

89
00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:01,890
For sure.

90
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:09,810
Ananda Sen: Sure enough okay so, so it is indeed the.

91
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:14,250
Ananda Sen: Capital capital, where it says small so.

92
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:27,060
Ananda Sen: So you see what I did I included the file with the path and and the file name, I have to have the fire without that file, it will not know what to call what to what to invoke.

93
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:40,020
Ananda Sen: So that once I have called that that's called including assess macro and percent I nc E stands for, including inclusion.

94
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:48,420
Ananda Sen: And then he ran a problem gen mode did a call the fish or equal to data it's just a.

95
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:58,950
Ananda Sen: Good Practice, to have the order actually the order should be there, especially if you're doing things in sequence so include that that additional statement here.

96
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:09,480
Ananda Sen: glass camper and remember this, is the model for the original distribution, I mentioned the distribution should be zero inflated negative binomial.

97
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:16,530
Ananda Sen: And then there is a zero model that's the logistic regression model and that only has one covered persons.

98
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:36,600
Ananda Sen: I took everything out to a data set called out Z and Z and Z I envy product bread equal to bread Zain be P zero is a predicted probability, which is stolen P zero Why do I need that let's see.

99
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:59,610
Ananda Sen: Next time, when I run another data and other model, the second model look, I have not used original data I have used the out Zain be so I use the output from the first model and add the second model, and you have seen this before also when we were looking at our oC we were.

100
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:15,930
Ananda Sen: putting things in addition to what we had before, in the previous data, so this is the output Z and Z and Z I envy data actually contains all the original variables, as well as some of the output variables from this model I wanted there.

101
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:18,510
Ananda Sen: So I use that data.

102
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:22,350
Ananda Sen: I use this new model, this is model to.

103
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:27,990
Ananda Sen: model countable the child and camper and the distribution is a song.

104
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:34,170
Ananda Sen: See, there is no Zain be here, there is no zero infinity party just a regular person.

105
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:49,980
Ananda Sen: And this time i'm out putting all the outputs in a file called output data set called output and i'm look i'm predicting and the predictive values are in this culprit for song okay.

106
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:55,590
Ananda Sen: Up until this that is basically running gen mode a couple of times.

107
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:59,430
Ananda Sen: What about what about the warm.

108
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:04,350
Ananda Sen: What informed has a very specific structure.

109
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:16,380
Ananda Sen: And those will be pretty much preset are you have to set it, this is the lamb, this is bread zero, and so you have to specify which is what.

110
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:30,060
Ananda Sen: be one is spread xiamen evidence I predicted probability he doesn't matter which order you give it give it in, you could have person with before the end, but in this case i'm using CA me as an example.

111
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:42,390
Ananda Sen: The first distribution is the lamb, then there is something called scale one and scale to welcome to that in a moment model to pass on be to bread boy decision to person.

112
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:47,460
Ananda Sen: There are a few things I highlighted What are those.

113
00:17:47,460 --> 00:18:06,540
Ananda Sen: The US, it has to specify scales, the two scales and two parameters, what are the skills, so the skills work like this if you have a song are zero infrared posts on the scale is going to be one, no matter what.

114
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:24,090
Ananda Sen: If you have a negative binomial or a zero and for the negative binomial the scale is going to actually come from the dispersion so you really have to run it twice run the model twice What do I mean by that let's go back to the output.

115
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:32,820
Ananda Sen: So before von.

116
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:43,710
Ananda Sen: This is the negative binomial zero infinity negative binomial see there is a dispersion rule and look at that number there 2.6788.

117
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:47,940
Ananda Sen: that's exactly the number.

118
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:52,950
Ananda Sen: which went in here for does your infinite by know, maybe by noemi.

119
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:58,110
Ananda Sen: Put a pause on the scale you don't have to do anything scale is always equal to one.

120
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:04,230
Ananda Sen: In fact, if you did to go into the output.

121
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:11,250
Ananda Sen: four plus one, which actually comes a little later.

122
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:29,040
Ananda Sen: You did see scale equal to one, so I mean that, but that happens, anyway, so you know that, but so on zero infinite persona to one and and and four negative binomial or zero negative binomial is actually coming from the dispersion.

123
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,470
Okay.

124
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:38,490
Ananda Sen: Then, these and parameters and parameters for okay.

125
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:41,370
Ananda Sen: let's look at it for a moment.

126
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:43,920
Ananda Sen: Wait is what coming from.

127
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:49,980
Okay.

128
00:19:49,980 --> 00:20:00,870
Ananda Sen: In parameters, one is the number of parameters not intercept but the number of parameters in the zero incident negative binomial model.

129
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:08,310
Ananda Sen: In parameter to the number of parameters in person model.

130
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:10,380
Okay.

131
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,670
All right.

132
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:15,030
Ananda Sen: So look at the number of parameters person is easy to do.

133
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:21,240
Ananda Sen: Personally, says got to to covariance so two parameters that's there.

134
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:37,590
Ananda Sen: So under zero and negative binomial there is also the two parameters, so those two are there, what are the, what are the, what are the additional ones coming from, so there are two other parameters one parameter is the dispersion parameter which we're talking about.

135
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:57,240
Ananda Sen: That is not there in in person, so that's three, where does the fourth one coming from the fourth one comes because the two models see that it's what is the fourth one come from the fourth one is coming from here, where is that the zero model that has one.

136
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:02,550
Ananda Sen: So one plus two, plus three.

137
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:05,430
Ananda Sen: plus the dispersion parameter.

138
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,650
Ananda Sen: That makes sense.

139
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:14,010
Ananda Sen: that's the four parameters all the covariance in the original model in the zero model.

140
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:33,750
Ananda Sen: And the dispersion per person is just one model, just to governance that's why it's to.

141
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,900
Ananda Sen: Any question.

142
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,250
Okay.

143
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,380
Ananda Sen: What did I get.

144
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:48,000
Ananda Sen: that's how it worked that's how it Duran what I ended up getting.

145
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:59,850
Ananda Sen: Well, we already saw all of these things so for the gentleman, this is the zero in faded faded negative binomial for that the.

146
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:07,920
Ananda Sen: deviation the Pearson Chi square scale person there to point something so there is a little bit of non not lack of fit their skill.

147
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:23,220
Ananda Sen: But it's much better than the posts on one and the Ai sees what 877 so let's look at the same purpose on while the pearson's or like 2425 the deviance and scale Damian said really high.

148
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:41,460
Ananda Sen: And the ice is much, much higher 888 verses 2007 and so, so the person is a much worse, there is no question about that and the macro essentially.

149
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:58,050
Ananda Sen: concludes that it says that the preferred model is A and B, and it also shows the difference, the p value for the difference which is less than point or one, there are different criteria used here doesn't matter they're all the same.

150
00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:00,600
Ananda Sen: So that's how you read out.

151
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:05,940
Ananda Sen: But basically, what I did was to compare between.

152
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:17,880
Ananda Sen: Zero and 50 model versus a regular model and see how they match up.

153
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:25,230
Ananda Sen: Any questions related to this.

154
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:28,230
Ananda Sen: My.

155
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:36,780
Ananda Sen: If you go into the lab notes the very last page I put a put a common they're saying that can you compare between the zero in person.

156
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:40,350
Ananda Sen: And a regular person distribution for this.

157
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:42,120
Ananda Sen: and

158
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,640
Ananda Sen: My.

159
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:51,930
Ananda Sen: Recommendation we're not going to go go through this here, but my recommendation would be for you to just.

160
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:58,950
Ananda Sen: Take a peek at this try to mimic what you have here.

161
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:03,840
Ananda Sen: And just use the distribution.

162
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:08,340
Ananda Sen: Zero and Philip was on version Instead of this, even for a negative way, no.

163
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:39,690
Ananda Sen: and correspondingly change the scale values and what the parameter, so do a practice of this because it's a little bit more complicated than most of the other ones we have been doing it's much more involved okay.

164
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:42,030
Ananda Sen: Alright okay.

165
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:44,100
Ananda Sen: So that's a.

166
00:24:44,100 --> 00:25:22,050
Ananda Sen: chapter for our our lecture for for us we'll we'll do lecture five now but, before going into there any questions any comments about anything we did.

167
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:25,350
Ananda Sen: Okay.

168
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:52,320
Ananda Sen: So.

169
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:56,370
Ananda Sen: Let us see what are we.

170
00:25:56,370 --> 00:26:04,920
Define that is defined look.

171
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:11,340
Ananda Sen: Good so.

172
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:19,500
Ananda Sen: going to talk about case control design Okay, before I start.

173
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:29,430
Ananda Sen: What is a good idea to get a fee for how many of you have been exposed to these control design.

174
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:34,590
Ananda Sen: All right, can anybody explain to me what case control design is.

175
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:45,660
Ananda Sen: Or how do you do it basically.

176
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:55,500
Marcelo Galafassi: Divided into groups, the father is groups, and then the control is your control.

177
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,600
Ananda Sen: And then.

178
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,310
Ananda Sen: How is that design different from.

179
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:06,030
Marcelo Galafassi: Others, so you really excellent you dare to be the same on both groups but exposure.

180
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:22,380
Marcelo Galafassi: is really the difference, but like they should be fairly similar populations gender whatever you are looking at to to figure out what what's causing a problem or if a medicine isn't working or whatever else.

181
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:28,440
Ananda Sen: Right anybody else want to add anything to that or.

182
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:43,680
Geehan Suleyman: So with this one you already have the disease or whatever it is you're looking for, and then you go back to see if there were exposed to something like let's say you have someone with lung cancer you go back to see if there were.

183
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:46,770
Geehan Suleyman: exposed to smoking or not smoking.

184
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:47,520
Ananda Sen: Over a.

185
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,920
piece.

186
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:56,490
Ananda Sen: That our design also has another name I mean it's it's what type of studies are those going back in time.

187
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:57,420
Geehan Suleyman: Right trust factor.

188
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:00,600
Ananda Sen: retrospective that's the name I was looking for right.

189
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:07,320
Ananda Sen: So so yeah, so I think both Marcello and D hundred talking about.

190
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:25,770
Ananda Sen: designs which we commonly use in medicine or some of the designs were commonly used in medicine, this being one of them, so before going into case controls, per se, let me very briefly go over some of these experimental design sorry.

191
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:34,050
Ananda Sen: took their experimental designs which we commonly confront in.

192
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:39,720
Ananda Sen: In medicine so.

193
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:47,580
Ananda Sen: This is our best friend randomized control design so that's that's more like you know.

194
00:28:47,580 --> 00:29:01,590
Ananda Sen: Patients are enrolled and and at baseline you measure them and then you essentially draw a number from a hat and say that you will be assigned to.

195
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:11,190
Ananda Sen: arm and you will be assigned and the other one will be assigned to rmb if if it's almost like a coin toss right if this is done.

196
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:23,430
Ananda Sen: There is a sophos to get a name computer generated and so on and so forth nowadays actually the your fam there is a randomization tool that is commonly being used which.

197
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:31,200
Ananda Sen: Which is called tatum which uses many of these things, and then the advantage of doing it that way is that.

198
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:37,500
Ananda Sen: See previously what used to happen is that when my colleagues, especially in the in the Medical School.

199
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:46,020
Ananda Sen: They would come to do a design, I mean who would be the honest broker i'll be honest broker and a statistician so i'll be the one who will be doing the randomization and so on and so forth.

200
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:53,070
Ananda Sen: That is a clunky way of doing it just because every time there's a problem with the with the randomization.

201
00:29:53,070 --> 00:30:06,720
Ananda Sen: somebody who you wanted in groupie actually ended up being in Ruby, how do you change things they'll come back to me so it's it's it's a little bit of a clunky back and forth so nowadays it's it's more automated.

202
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:18,270
Ananda Sen: The whole thing is set up like that that you can change things on the on the computer and it will give you this assignment so um.

203
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:26,580
Ananda Sen: One thing which, which obviously goes on, with the randomized control trials, is that it's not only the assignment.

204
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:39,750
Ananda Sen: People want to make sure that you're blinded neither the person who is assigning somebody to arm knows if that's the treatment arm or a or a placebo arm.

205
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:49,080
Ananda Sen: The subjects do not know, and ultimately actually they do three three we have blinding ultimately the data analyst analysts also doesn't know.

206
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:54,810
Ananda Sen: What which armies what they just know that at two arms okay.

207
00:30:54,810 --> 00:31:08,280
Ananda Sen: So so it's a it's a nice well done controlled randomized experiment, what is the advantage of this The advantage of this is suppose you and I.

208
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,260
Ananda Sen: are different.

209
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:16,680
Ananda Sen: US by some criterion, which is not of interest you wondering whether the drug war.

210
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:21,270
Ananda Sen: But if we didn't do the randomization just.

211
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:31,050
Ananda Sen: Did the enrollment based on how the patients enrolled in the study so first 10 patients will go to control that next 10 patients will be.

212
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:42,450
Ananda Sen: will be treatment if you do it that way, then the problem is, there are some biases involved seasonal bias other types of bias and it just may happen that by some chance, who.

213
00:31:42,450 --> 00:32:03,960
Ananda Sen: You might end up getting a getting a group which is heavily biased towards some criteria and some something which is not of interest, maybe the heavier subjects that are in one group when you do randomization like that you, even if you do not specifically take care of those.

214
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:16,020
Ananda Sen: extraneous features it just has a habit of evening themselves out or evening it out over the different features so, for example.

215
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:18,780
Ananda Sen: You, you would have.

216
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:29,250
Ananda Sen: two groups which are balanced across many of the features now can you fully balanced them probably not there may be some stuff, which is still left over.

217
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:36,720
Ananda Sen: And sometimes people do even farther go even farther they call they do something called a stratified randomization.

218
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:49,200
Ananda Sen: So they want to make sure that we have even distribution within female males and females without we have even distribution within all races, then the go inside all those different.

219
00:32:49,200 --> 00:33:01,560
Ananda Sen: variables or are factors and do a randomization separate so within males they will do randomization within females, they will do randomization you can do that, but it's called stratified.

220
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:05,550
Ananda Sen: So the idea is.

221
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:15,840
Ananda Sen: randomize what you can block what you randomize or stratify what you read what you cannot randomness okay so so that's the best.

222
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:20,460
Ananda Sen: Best the best is not achievable all the time.

223
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:41,070
Ananda Sen: The the study of smoking and lung cancer, he had suggested that doesn't work, there is no randomization of smoking and for putting somebody in a smoking arm versus non smoking arm, you cannot do that so that brings us to the idea of oops.

224
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:49,320
Ananda Sen: This is an rct study design schematic that gives us bring us to the idea of observational studies, when you cannot do intervention.

225
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:55,380
Ananda Sen: right when you cannot do intervention, you still want to compare and how do you do that.

226
00:33:55,380 --> 00:34:02,280
Ananda Sen: And there are two basic designs one is called the cohort study and the other one is case control study the one we want to talk about.

227
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:14,370
Ananda Sen: So this is what is called a prospective cohort study, and this is where the terminology comes in prospective because you move or you look forward in time.

228
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:30,150
Ananda Sen: You have a target population, which consists of cases and non cases now the non cases have some exposure, some of them are exposed, some of them are not exposed and you follow them follow them on the student and see.

229
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:52,080
Ananda Sen: Who who are diseased who are non diseased, and so do the same for the non-exposed group and and then you do the comparisons and you already have the cases already lined up so for them, you just compare the deceased ones for the expose ones with the cases and see what happens.

230
00:34:52,080 --> 00:35:01,020
Ananda Sen: So one of the issues with longitudinal data is that you can lose people to follow up So these are they're all there's an entire.

231
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:13,290
Ananda Sen: Research Area online assuming the data which has all the different nuances of knowledge and there's missing data, there is all sorts of very interesting and very practical stuff.

232
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:24,240
Ananda Sen: which are being discussed in there are studied there so we're not doing that here instead we're going to talk about case control study which.

233
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,480
Ananda Sen: is also.

234
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:31,890
Ananda Sen: an observational study but it's it has a different different.

235
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:33,780
Ananda Sen: nature.

236
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:39,030
Ananda Sen: So here data has already been collected in some sense.

237
00:35:39,030 --> 00:36:00,810
Ananda Sen: You have identified that case you'll have identified the controls, who will be the matches for the cases and then you look at them with the clock going back history, what happened to them retrospectively, and he realized that off the.

238
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:13,200
Ananda Sen: off the cases, some of them, some of them were exposing some of them are not exposed So the idea is that while you you compare.

239
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:20,370
Ananda Sen: In the non exposed in the sense that they had some lifestyle, which, which was a reason.

240
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:26,790
Ananda Sen: So one study we did one case control study we did was to look at.

241
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:29,010
Ananda Sen: This was.

242
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:35,490
Ananda Sen: A few years back, I used to work with she retired actually is very.

243
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:44,040
Ananda Sen: Very prolific researcher in her area she used to work in women's health in, in particular in Aberdeen.

244
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:47,370
Ananda Sen: Okay, so.

245
00:36:47,370 --> 00:37:00,240
Ananda Sen: So she would study, what would Dini, patience and there were cases and controls, who didn't who were her.

246
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:21,030
Ananda Sen: subjects, but didn't complain about Bolivia and then she wanted to investigate the association between all see us the the contraceptive oral contraceptive views and incidence of Bible Union mango what i've gone through 2017 years happened.

247
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:24,750
Ananda Sen: Back in their life, sometimes.

248
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:28,980
Ananda Sen: Maybe when they're teenagers or something like that that's maybe that's when it started.

249
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:49,230
Ananda Sen: And there was a duration of it and things like those so the association between so that was the exposure oral contraceptive uses his exposure and then didn't have anything to do with building that's a that was that has been a hypothesis for a long time in this in the area of research.

250
00:37:49,230 --> 00:38:11,100
Ananda Sen: So so that's the nature, so of course case control study is you identify the cases identify the controls at the at this time point, and then you go back in time and look at the exposure rate in the cases in the controls okay and that's what we've been talking about.

251
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,920
Ananda Sen: Okay.

252
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:20,700
Ananda Sen: How does logistic regression come into play with all these different type of sampling designs.

253
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:25,470
Ananda Sen: Now, which ever whichever.

254
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:31,380
Ananda Sen: scenario you're looking at suppose you're looking at a.

255
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:50,400
Ananda Sen: As a dichotomous outcomes binary outcome, then, then it applies to the regular logistic regression applies to randomized control trial and cohort studies not nothing, nothing major some modifications may include incorporating information about.

256
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:56,760
Ananda Sen: Some stratification variable and interactions and so on and so forth, how ever.

257
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:03,570
Ananda Sen: The case control studies becomes different and this is part of the reason why I wanted to talk about this.

258
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:17,880
Ananda Sen: Because the case control study, the idea is that we are performing the sampling conditional on the outcome variable why because we have identified the cases and then we have identified the corresponding controls.

259
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:30,330
Ananda Sen: So outcome identification happens first and then you go to the exposure, then you try to figure out whether the covert it happened for that person i'm not.

260
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:39,450
Ananda Sen: So samples of fixed size that chosen from the case then it's not like it's not like that there are hundred people you want to see how many develop this disease versus now.

261
00:39:39,450 --> 00:40:00,060
Ananda Sen: it's not like that you know who had the disease, you know who had the WHO didn't have the disease big them in some proportion one is to one or one is to do or something like that, and then see who had the whole video or not it's an inverse sampling, so to speak.

262
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:01,680
Okay.

263
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:16,500
Ananda Sen: Is there any question on this people who have who know about the case is, I know this very well, I mean that's exactly that's exactly the point of kids come from design, but those who have not seen case control design, this is a different concept.

264
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:24,960
Ananda Sen: This is not the standard concept which is in our head about you know doing some experiment and seeing what is happening in future.

265
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:37,530
Ananda Sen: This is about I know what the outcome is, I know this is a person with cancer, I know this is the person who did not have cancer, but but had similar profile in a person.

266
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:39,870
Ananda Sen: To something happened.

267
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:49,530
Ananda Sen: I want to know that the cause of this so it's it's trying to find the etiology of the disease.

268
00:40:49,530 --> 00:41:00,510
questions.

269
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:11,640
Ananda Sen: So why is logistic regression useful for case control design because case control design is very specific.

270
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:23,550
Ananda Sen: In case control design, we can only calculate odds ratio or meaningfully odds ratio because, and I will show you the example why that is the case.

271
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:40,440
Ananda Sen: We cannot calculate risk what we mean by calculate calculate risk basically we cannot say that the prevalence of the disease in the controls is this much the prevalence of disease in the cases is why.

272
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:50,970
Ananda Sen: Because of artificially created my sample in my sample 500 cases 500 will capcom controls that's how I chose them.

273
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:58,290
Ananda Sen: So what's the prevalence of disease in mind when my sample 500 or 1,050% that's not right.

274
00:41:58,290 --> 00:42:05,190
Ananda Sen: So anything is risk ratio or anything else would have actually.

275
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:18,420
Ananda Sen: would be wrong, the estimate is wrong, however odds ratio is valid and that's, the only thing you can do for case study.

276
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:21,870
Ananda Sen: So that's roughly what is mentioned here.

277
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:35,670
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: And then, when you're interpreting these results you just mentioned something about you know you artificially created a Co worker or a group of people that you're studying this in when you interpret the results would you say something like.

278
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:50,640
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: In our study population or in our like study participants, this is what it looks like or would you generalize and say using this data, people who did this behavior have this outcome, you know.

279
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,940
Ananda Sen: yeah exactly I would.

280
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:55,740
Ananda Sen: Go and find myself.

281
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:59,550
Ananda Sen: To the language of association.

282
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:13,830
Ananda Sen: Whether the exposure is associated with the case control status, I wouldn't even go as far as talking about in this study population around this I mean it's that's that's a given right, I mean it's it's my findings are always.

283
00:43:13,830 --> 00:43:30,720
Ananda Sen: in regards to in relation to the data have at hand so that's so we'll stop there, and just talk about the association association between X one exposure the multiple exposures and and the case controlled status that's where I will go.

284
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:37,650
Ananda Sen: yeah it's good question.

285
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:44,430
Ananda Sen: So um so The bottom line is any other question, by the way.

286
00:43:44,430 --> 00:43:48,120
Ananda Sen: To the bottom line is that those two.

287
00:43:48,120 --> 00:44:06,420
Ananda Sen: Last bullets, are the ones we just mentioned cannot calculate risk from case control sampling number one and number two for a case control study typically fraction of cases from the population, a sample from into the gets control sample is way higher.

288
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:15,000
Ananda Sen: For cases them to the fractional controls happen because cases come first and you want to take all the cases, you have.

289
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,800
Ananda Sen: But then.

290
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:26,040
Ananda Sen: You say well let's match those cases with controls well how many control should I choose per case one maybe to.

291
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,680
Ananda Sen: Whatever you do.

292
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:42,510
Ananda Sen: Even if you even if you if you take five controls to one case, your proportion of faction sorry fraction of cases.

293
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:47,580
Ananda Sen: In the population in your sample is much higher.

294
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:59,400
Ananda Sen: than the fraction of control samples right because you're taking all the cases but you're taking only a part of the population are part of their control.

295
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:14,970
Ananda Sen: let's do a little bit of calculation I this class i'm trying to have tried to avoid calculation as much as possible, but this this should, this is an interesting calculation important calculation to.

296
00:45:14,970 --> 00:45:19,170
Ananda Sen: illustrate the very.

297
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:30,390
Ananda Sen: Specific nuances of case control design so, so it is the there are some artifacts of his case control design, which comes about.

298
00:45:30,390 --> 00:45:45,450
Ananda Sen: And that that is what I want to point out so here's a here's a very simple table the table has two it's a two by two table on one side, we talked about exposure one one side, we talked about disease.

299
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:52,350
Ananda Sen: And so there's disease one zero and exposure one zero.

300
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:57,060
Ananda Sen: The odds ratio for disease.

301
00:45:57,060 --> 00:46:08,430
Ananda Sen: Is is 75 over 100 by 25 over 100, why is it 75 or 100 between 500 well that's that's the odds ratio for disease.

302
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:30,720
Ananda Sen: Across the exposure and then divide you divide that by the odds ratio the the the odds of not having the disease on the on the top or the having the disease on the bottom odds of not having that is odds across water across exposure so that's 2.8.

303
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:38,820
Ananda Sen: You can think of it the other way around to odds of exposure so on the top, you would have.

304
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:58,950
Ananda Sen: Our odds of having the exposure versus odds of not having the exposure in the disease group and then in the bottom it's the in the non disease group or the export reverse order now my exposure either way you do it, you get the same answer issue.

305
00:46:58,950 --> 00:47:03,360
Ananda Sen: So if you truly this.

306
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:15,450
Ananda Sen: In the logistic regression machinery, what are we doing we're doing a very simple logistic regression well the Lord is beta not plus beta one X one.

307
00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:36,930
Ananda Sen: X one is one is exposed zero if not that's my covariance So if I calculated the odds ratio of beta one of X one rather exposure then that's the point at which we just saw it and that's actually easily for beta one according to what we did before.

308
00:47:36,930 --> 00:47:39,900
Ananda Sen: On the other hand.

309
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:51,750
Ananda Sen: If I looked at the intercept beta not remember what beta not is whether or not, is for the non expose the next one is zero then log it is beta not.

310
00:47:51,750 --> 00:48:11,190
Ananda Sen: So beta not is the odds ratio or irritable beta nine is the odds ratio of non-exposed group, what is the non-exposed group is a probability of the non-exposed or long long odds are they're not inexpensive it's 25 over 2400 so it basically 25 or 2425 and.

311
00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:16,350
Ananda Sen: It is just odds not not odds ratio.

312
00:48:16,350 --> 00:48:22,530
Ananda Sen: So that's that's the calculation all right let's move on, but.

313
00:48:22,530 --> 00:48:40,980
Ananda Sen: Suppose think of two other tables, which are very similar to the table, you had before, the only differences on the controls, you have on that well Actually, I would say that non resistance is equal to zero, you have got much fewer observations.

314
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:51,210
Ananda Sen: So, in the first table you have got 250 and 240 that's about 10% of what you had for the non disease in the in the original team.

315
00:48:51,210 --> 00:48:58,410
Ananda Sen: And for the second example he had even farther reduction so 5050 on both.

316
00:48:58,410 --> 00:49:11,670
Ananda Sen: Okay, now, if you went through this calculation for both of those The bottom line and just pointing out the bottom line, the bottom line is, if you look at the odds ratio of beta one.

317
00:49:11,670 --> 00:49:20,340
Ananda Sen: Both cases it's while they're pretty similar 2.883 so they're they're not they're not moving much.

318
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:23,910
Ananda Sen: On the other hand.

319
00:49:23,910 --> 00:49:35,520
Ananda Sen: If we calculated the beta not head they're vastly different in the first case is minus 2.26 it's The second case is minus 0.69.

320
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:51,780
Ananda Sen: and actually if you compare that with the previous one, the for the larger table the full table that's negative 4.4 Point six so beta not is a huge problem and the reason we're not as a problem is the key to why.

321
00:49:51,780 --> 00:50:01,350
Ananda Sen: You should not be using something like this, when you have sampling fraction it doesn't matter the population.

322
00:50:01,350 --> 00:50:05,640
Ananda Sen: So is the risk estimate.

323
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:10,710
Ananda Sen: And an example to it's much larger.

324
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:29,250
Ananda Sen: So what's the case control study what's the risk in a case control study, there is a case control study is probably why equal to one which is you do the beta beta not plus beta one X X one divided by one plus the beta beta not plus beta one X one okay.

325
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:31,350
All right.

326
00:50:31,350 --> 00:50:34,020
Ananda Sen: Now.

327
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:36,150
Ananda Sen: The risk.

328
00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:47,280
Ananda Sen: Is overestimated because based on case control sampling the cases of cases which overestimates better not is more.

329
00:50:47,280 --> 00:51:01,980
Ananda Sen: And if the samplings fraction is smaller than increases the better estimate now can you correct for that you could correct for that if you knew what the sampling fraction was and, again, there is a little bit of a.

330
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:17,880
Ananda Sen: math here to show that if you knew those sampling fraction that you know okay my 250 is actually from a population of size this if you knew those, then you could calculate the beta knots and then.

331
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:21,120
Ananda Sen: essentially correct that.

332
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,920
Ananda Sen: But.

333
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:31,530
Ananda Sen: People don't know them up often right because it's from an infinite population, what is the population size you normally don't know.

334
00:51:31,530 --> 00:51:35,550
Ananda Sen: But beta not.

335
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:50,940
Ananda Sen: The good thing about being an artist beta not is never used for all are in the or for I mean any any impact of it or not, is gone when you're calculating the exposure.

336
00:51:50,940 --> 00:52:02,910
Ananda Sen: association that's beta one that stays the same.

337
00:52:02,910 --> 00:52:18,450
Ananda Sen: says it, so this is what I was pointing out even direction factory is fine, but even to apply correction factor, we need to be able to assume that the selection process of the case and composed controls and independent of exposure, which may or may not be the case.

338
00:52:18,450 --> 00:52:33,030
Ananda Sen: important to remember that the risk estimate using behead odds over one plus odds does not estimate the disease risk in any subgroup so case control study do not talk about prevalence at all.

339
00:52:33,030 --> 00:52:34,890
Ananda Sen: All right.

340
00:52:34,890 --> 00:52:43,350
Ananda Sen: that's the preliminaries that's the that's the kind of like the starting of this whole thing.

341
00:52:43,350 --> 00:52:49,980
Ananda Sen: let's move to matched case control study, so what is matched these controls.

342
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:58,050
Ananda Sen: Well, if you aren't doing a case control study most often than not, you would want to do a match case control study.

343
00:52:58,050 --> 00:53:20,220
Ananda Sen: So what do I mean by matching matching means you're choosing the cases we did you're choosing controls for cases but would you choose controls, who are this similar to cases, you should not be doing, because then it doesn't make sense if you're if you're if you're looking at.

344
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:24,750
Ananda Sen: A study of.

345
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:29,760
Ananda Sen: Cancer patients who are generally.

346
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,770
Ananda Sen: Older.

347
00:53:31,770 --> 00:53:41,970
Ananda Sen: Then you should not necessarily look for K controls in the general population, because it's it's not going it's going to be.

348
00:53:41,970 --> 00:53:45,810
Ananda Sen: very weak match.

349
00:53:45,810 --> 00:53:57,450
Ananda Sen: So matching is effectively a way to get a hold of the confounders which can otherwise.

350
00:53:57,450 --> 00:54:10,800
Ananda Sen: be related to the outcome and create a difference So the question now becomes what sort of matching do we do, what is the basis of matching.

351
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:19,140
Ananda Sen: Well, the basis of matching is what you decide as a potential confounders right.

352
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:27,330
Ananda Sen: So here is one example, studying the relationship between pancreatic cancer and various lifestyle habits, including coffee drink.

353
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:34,050
Ananda Sen: So the cases are patients with pancreatic cancer identified included in the study over a five year period.

354
00:54:34,050 --> 00:54:51,120
Ananda Sen: Controls or sample from the patient populations of the same physicians who treated the selected pancreatic cancer patients, excluding patients who had any benefiting disease or who has suffered from others smoking and alcohol related conditions, what does that mean.

355
00:54:51,120 --> 00:55:05,340
Ananda Sen: That means you want to make sure that the subjects, you are getting who who are controls are as close to the cases as possible, you can never get that never get 100% accurate.

356
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:16,650
Ananda Sen: But what you can do is still look into that environment dig deeper into the environment from which the cases working collected and try to see if.

357
00:55:16,650 --> 00:55:23,100
Ananda Sen: You can get get controls from there.

358
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:28,530
Ananda Sen: So this is called matching your matching against a few things so.

359
00:55:28,530 --> 00:55:42,180
Ananda Sen: For example, this is the second example a child, with cleft lip, which is the case is matched one to one or one to em with with a child, without cleft lip.

360
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:46,410
Ananda Sen: matched on mother's age.

361
00:55:46,410 --> 00:56:01,140
Ananda Sen: So the idea is that that maybe mother's age at birth has something to do with it, if if you don't want that to play a role, then just match it on them.

362
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:13,500
Ananda Sen: whenever you match with something you cannot actually compare that or you cannot actually studied that but that's not your interest as the whole.

363
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:23,790
Ananda Sen: Why is matching done matching is done to control for the confounders achieved some balance in the numbers of cases and controls that awkward each level of demand.

364
00:56:23,790 --> 00:56:30,240
Ananda Sen: and obtain more precise estimate by not having to adjust for several potential, confounding variables.

365
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:43,110
Ananda Sen: So again, the controlling for can founder achieving balance obtaining more precise estimate, are all things which you normally want to do.

366
00:56:43,110 --> 00:56:46,980
Ananda Sen: For match.

367
00:56:46,980 --> 00:57:00,000
Ananda Sen: The thing to understand is when you do any matching match design, we can no longer evaluate the effect of matching variable gender, age, an example.

368
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,320
Ananda Sen: Okay.

369
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:03,630
Ananda Sen: So.

370
00:57:03,630 --> 00:57:05,250
Ananda Sen: That.

371
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:13,080
Ananda Sen: is mostly true, but there is a little bit of a small.

372
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:22,860
Ananda Sen: liberty, you can take so oftentimes you don't match by age you match by an age group.

373
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:29,100
Ananda Sen: If you match by an age group, you can still adjust for age.

374
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:31,410
Ananda Sen: Any other analysis.

375
00:57:31,410 --> 00:57:39,060
Ananda Sen: Where age is treated as a continuous variable.

376
00:57:39,060 --> 00:58:01,470
Ananda Sen: So at each stratification level, you can also do subgroup analysis, the point is by matching you are, you are letting go the ability for the analysis to find the association with respect to that.

377
00:58:01,470 --> 00:58:14,940
Ananda Sen: Matching can also be done in cohort studies doesn't have to be just case control study, a person who took medication matched another person who did not take medication matching on agents.

378
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:19,140
Ananda Sen: That is possible.

379
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:24,600
Ananda Sen: what's the efficiency in case control match.

380
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:54,210
Ananda Sen: And this is this is more of a mathematical thing I want is to imagine ma n plus one one control per cases 50% efficient and so on and so forth MAC so after a while, if you if you have gone to 124125 after that matching is not going to give you more efficiency, really, frankly speaking.

381
00:58:54,210 --> 00:58:58,170
Ananda Sen: alright.

382
00:58:58,170 --> 00:59:03,240
Ananda Sen: So some of this.

383
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:19,140
Ananda Sen: Basically, see what happens if you don't match don't do a match analysis based on match design, if you ignore the matching it usually results in a conservative biased estimate of association.

384
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:29,910
Ananda Sen: It removes the need to adjust for matching confounders but can but cannot estimate the effect of the matching variable So these are some of the things we have done, we have built understand.

385
00:59:29,910 --> 00:59:36,360
Ananda Sen: However, you can estimate interactions of the exposure variable with a matching variable.

386
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:51,180
Ananda Sen: And it should not reduce generalize ability OK, so the bottom line I want you to look at this as matched design that's that that's, the main thing which should be a take home here.

387
00:59:51,180 --> 00:59:59,820
Ananda Sen: match design requires a master analysis, if your design was matched you must carry out the master analysis.

388
00:59:59,820 --> 01:00:12,060
Ananda Sen: If you do not then you're you're losing something either power or lack of efficiency, or maybe even bias something like that.

389
01:00:12,060 --> 01:00:16,710
Okay.

390
01:00:16,710 --> 01:00:20,730
Ananda Sen: So, before going into a match bear example.

391
01:00:20,730 --> 01:00:29,250
Ananda Sen: I want to make sure that you're getting the gist of what we're talking about so a matched analysis is.

392
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:36,420
Ananda Sen: So case control study and I want to do a matching.

393
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:53,730
Ananda Sen: Because I want to choose the cases which are similar to controls when I said similar I also need to specify similar with respect to war, what is it ages agenda, what is it or maybe a combination of many.

394
01:00:53,730 --> 01:01:00,090
Okay.

395
01:01:00,090 --> 01:01:10,560
Ananda Sen: Any question on the matching idea.

396
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:12,390
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: Yes, I have one.

397
01:01:12,390 --> 01:01:18,720
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: Question um I definitely understand when you talk about how if you match on age you can't.

398
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:28,770
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: Look at the effect of age that totally makes sense to me and then he said something like if you match on age, you could still add age into the.

399
01:01:28,770 --> 01:01:47,220
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: equation as a continuous variable would that look at everything except for that, I guess, I was thinking, if you match on age it would match on like you'd be like ages 18 to 40 or something would include that range and the continuous variable or would it not look at that okay.

400
01:01:47,220 --> 01:02:07,530
Ananda Sen: yeah so so what you can do is that, basically, if you have straight up form by by by the age groups, essentially that's what magic is doing great so so within 18 to 25 or even within 18 to 40 you have these people matched now.

401
01:02:07,530 --> 01:02:23,430
Ananda Sen: Could you go in that stadium and actually find out what is the association with ages that's what I mean by putting in ages, a continuous variable so between 18 and 40 How does it behave with age.

402
01:02:23,430 --> 01:02:34,230
Ananda Sen: How does outcome behave with it or adjusted for each that you that you can do continuous each and a second when age amen continuously So there you.

403
01:02:34,230 --> 01:02:40,590
Ananda Sen: Open up the open up the identity of eight so it's no longer 18 to 40 it could be 1820 to.

404
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:42,510
Ananda Sen: 35 and so on and so.

405
01:02:42,510 --> 01:02:43,470
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: That makes sense.

406
01:02:43,470 --> 01:02:58,950
Ananda Sen: So you can yeah you can do that sort of thing but, in general, gender is not like that so you're in gender if you match it by gender, then, then you, you lose the ability to actually put in gender as a corporate.

407
01:02:58,950 --> 01:03:01,080
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: make sense yeah thanks.

408
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:02,130
Ananda Sen: yeah sure.

409
01:03:02,130 --> 01:03:06,330
Ananda Sen: Are the questions.

410
01:03:06,330 --> 01:03:12,990
Ananda Sen: So i'll come back to this one is there matching and stuff like that and and talk a little bit more about.

411
01:03:12,990 --> 01:03:19,230
Ananda Sen: What it means what it means to have more than one.

412
01:03:19,230 --> 01:03:29,640
Ananda Sen: Cases match due to the each of the cases but i'll do that, after we take a short break we'll be back at 245 and let's.

413
01:03:29,640 --> 01:11:26,430
Ananda Sen: regroup at that point okay.

414
01:11:26,430 --> 01:11:30,420
Ananda Sen: let's go through some examples and.

415
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:32,400
Ananda Sen: I think.

416
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:42,930
Ananda Sen: Some simple examples will help establish the ideas and then we'll talk about how to sort of like.

417
01:11:42,930 --> 01:11:52,590
Ananda Sen: counter this or or what modification would do we need to do for running logistic regression, one thing I want to point out here.

418
01:11:52,590 --> 01:12:06,120
Ananda Sen: At the very outset, we talked about logistic regression we're talking about logistic regression, we all the examples we have seen so far things like low birth weight or or something of that sort.

419
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:11,190
Ananda Sen: That is an outcome.

420
01:12:11,190 --> 01:12:14,310
Ananda Sen: Often.

421
01:12:14,310 --> 01:12:24,390
Ananda Sen: In the logistic regression, I mean what are so so so the definition of chaos and control can be can be varied in many cases.

422
01:12:24,390 --> 01:12:34,590
Ananda Sen: And the reason I say that is because sometimes people get confused people give themselves confused about what is the outcome, and what is their covariance, for example.

423
01:12:34,590 --> 01:12:37,710
Ananda Sen: If you want to look at.

424
01:12:37,710 --> 01:12:43,050
Ananda Sen: guess guests and controls in an experiment and study, whether.

425
01:12:43,050 --> 01:12:46,080
Ananda Sen: They have.

426
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:53,370
Ananda Sen: Some some form of art or they have some specific comorbidity.

427
01:12:53,370 --> 01:13:08,400
Ananda Sen: or some specific risk factor, then those case and control definition is the one which you use as the outcome, so in this case in the in the low birth weight exposure case.

428
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:22,200
Ananda Sen: The low birth weight is the outcome that's the case, and then the control is the one which does not enter the the baby, which does not have the liberty outcome, so in this table when you see this.

429
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:29,790
Ananda Sen: Is a simple two by two table with low birth weight as well as mother smoking status, there are.

430
01:13:29,790 --> 01:13:36,150
Ananda Sen: 59 low birth weight babies originally in the data set the one we have used before.

431
01:13:36,150 --> 01:13:38,280
Ananda Sen: But they were only.

432
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:45,900
Ananda Sen: 56 mothers matching mothers were found who gave birth to normal weight babies.

433
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:58,770
Ananda Sen: But, but you could not, it could not be found for three others so so this particular example has 56 in each group 56 low birth weight babies 56 normal birth with babies.

434
01:13:58,770 --> 01:14:10,980
Ananda Sen: All right, and then there is a smoking status of the mother, which is the, which is the exposure variable is that is that premise clear there any question on this.

435
01:14:10,980 --> 01:14:13,980
Okay.

436
01:14:13,980 --> 01:14:22,950
Ananda Sen: So it is a fear there is a match what does that mean that means there is a case status, there is a smoking sticky case.

437
01:14:22,950 --> 01:14:51,240
Ananda Sen: A case status and a controlled status, and then there is a smoking exposure, so there are eight mothers, so this is this this eight is basically breaking up the 56, so there are eight mothers who for of sorry eight low birth weight babies, for whom i'm the.

438
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:57,750
Ananda Sen: i'm.

439
01:14:57,750 --> 01:15:06,120
Ananda Sen: Sorry, eight bars i'm sorry I should I should these these are these are not i'm I was confusing myself, these are 56 pairs.

440
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:18,150
Ananda Sen: So there are eight pairs in which the case mother's smoke and the control mother smoked 22 pairs in which the case mother's smoke and the control mother did not smoke.

441
01:15:18,150 --> 01:15:37,350
Ananda Sen: Eight beers, in which case mother smoked a great mother did not smoking, the control mother's smoke and there were 18 in which made of smoke, it does that make sense, so on that when you see that count that's actually every count is really two boards to pair together.

442
01:15:37,350 --> 01:15:49,500
Ananda Sen: There is a there is a pairing which has already been done, one low birth is matched up with one non lohberg that's why there are 56 only not.

443
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:57,120
Ananda Sen: Not hundred and 12.

444
01:15:57,120 --> 01:16:01,740
Ananda Sen: Another way of showing the same thing again pairs.

445
01:16:01,740 --> 01:16:17,580
Ananda Sen: So those 828 18 you saw in the previous table are now laid out on the bodies of the stable table, and then you can you can total them up in two different ways exposure versus non exposure.

446
01:16:17,580 --> 01:16:19,320
Ananda Sen: For.

447
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:21,210
Ananda Sen: The cases.

448
01:16:21,210 --> 01:16:26,280
Ananda Sen: And then exposed in unexplored in the controls.

449
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:30,270
Okay.

450
01:16:30,270 --> 01:16:42,960
Ananda Sen: So what's the conditional logistic regression condition logistic regression basically says by law God is law god's for for the outcome, given the exposure.

451
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:55,860
Ananda Sen: Whatever exposure X X variable is there, or whatever covariance there is, and I yet trader so what's the streeter well that's trader is is the bear in this case.

452
01:16:55,860 --> 01:16:59,100
Ananda Sen: Each one has its own.

453
01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:03,660
Ananda Sen: parameter that's that's how it is, it is done so.

454
01:17:03,660 --> 01:17:12,270
Ananda Sen: The matching factors are the end levels okay.

455
01:17:12,270 --> 01:17:24,120
Ananda Sen: So let's first ignore the pairing and see what happens if I ignore that beer and wants to look at the and i'll show you how to do this.

456
01:17:24,120 --> 01:17:32,010
Ananda Sen: With without ignoring the pairing but ignoring the pairing means you don't care whether they're set up as a match case control study you just.

457
01:17:32,010 --> 01:17:42,660
Ananda Sen: Take them and and and just run it too late, regular logistic regression and then it would end up getting an odds ratio estimate of two point 84.

458
01:17:42,660 --> 01:17:49,290
Ananda Sen: And and and 95% confidence interval of 1.29 6.3 or six.

459
01:17:49,290 --> 01:17:52,770
Ananda Sen: A pretty high be better.

460
01:17:52,770 --> 01:17:57,360
Ananda Sen: Now, if I did, account for the penny what happened.

461
01:17:57,360 --> 01:18:01,770
Ananda Sen: What happens is you end up getting.

462
01:18:01,770 --> 01:18:05,220
Ananda Sen: On my much more conservative P value.

463
01:18:05,220 --> 01:18:27,540
Ananda Sen: Because what's happening now is everybody in the bear gets compared to the person in that pair so the case mother is compared to not everybody, not other people, but, but the bear, but the control mother, who is in heart bear.

464
01:18:27,540 --> 01:18:43,440
Ananda Sen: When you do a more like for like matching like that then it's a more honest answer so so look at the p value that's it still significant, but it reduced the p value actually increased its point 0143.

465
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:55,980
Ananda Sen: The point estimate didn't change a whole lot the point estimate of the odds ratio didn't change a whole lot it's 2.75 as opposed to 2.88, which was a little more relaxed before.

466
01:18:55,980 --> 01:19:09,840
Ananda Sen: And, and one way to interpret this is, you can think of this result is the same aged person going from not smoking to smoking increases the odds of low birth weight by 2.75 times.

467
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:18,930
Ananda Sen: very interesting way of saying this let's pause there for a moment.

468
01:19:18,930 --> 01:19:24,570
Ananda Sen: i'm all so we didn't appear, so this is now becoming within.

469
01:19:24,570 --> 01:19:28,830
Ananda Sen: Within pair comparison.

470
01:19:28,830 --> 01:19:33,390
Ananda Sen: So you want to say that well.

471
01:19:33,390 --> 01:19:38,910
Ananda Sen: If if they're the same age, the mother.

472
01:19:38,910 --> 01:19:43,380
Ananda Sen: converted from most smoking to non smoking.

473
01:19:43,380 --> 01:19:48,210
Ananda Sen: The odds of low birth weight would actually.

474
01:19:48,210 --> 01:19:57,960
Ananda Sen: In our sorry, no, no non smoking, smoking is a non smoking smoking, then the odds of low birth will increase by 2.75 times.

475
01:19:57,960 --> 01:20:02,730
Ananda Sen: The interpretation becomes a little different.

476
01:20:02,730 --> 01:20:10,410
Ananda Sen: Of course, the models are different, do I didn't tell you, yet How did the models get run but.

477
01:20:10,410 --> 01:20:16,890
Ananda Sen: But that's the interpretation one other thing I want to point out, this is very important.

478
01:20:16,890 --> 01:20:19,620
Ananda Sen: See in the previous.

479
01:20:19,620 --> 01:20:21,510
Ananda Sen: table.

480
01:20:21,510 --> 01:20:28,830
Ananda Sen: How many how many parameters of being being reported intercept and smoke to rate.

481
01:20:28,830 --> 01:20:32,580
Ananda Sen: In the next one, there is only smoke.

482
01:20:32,580 --> 01:20:36,450
Ananda Sen: Because when you run it.

483
01:20:36,450 --> 01:20:41,670
Ananda Sen: Properly accounting for the pairing intercept goes away.

484
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:47,100
Ananda Sen: It is not reported.

485
01:20:47,100 --> 01:20:57,480
Ananda Sen: it's a different it's a different model which is being used here.

486
01:20:57,480 --> 01:21:06,630
Ananda Sen: So.

487
01:21:06,630 --> 01:21:25,080
Ananda Sen: let's Actually, this will be a good time for us to move to the lab.

488
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:27,780
Ananda Sen: This is the lab five.

489
01:21:27,780 --> 01:21:31,860
Ananda Sen: For today.

490
01:21:31,860 --> 01:21:36,390
Ananda Sen: So there is a second data set in that.

491
01:21:36,390 --> 01:21:41,490
Ananda Sen: Data folder called know, part two.

492
01:21:41,490 --> 01:21:54,480
Ananda Sen: So low, but to actually contains data for the 56 case control pairs matched by age so it's not it's not that it's the same same data set as low.

493
01:21:54,480 --> 01:22:12,060
Ananda Sen: But it's slightly different in the sense that it is now this matched case control data which is, which is provided there because original data set had 189 observations, or something like that it's it's much smaller than that.

494
01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:15,750
Ananda Sen: So, if this is, this is what.

495
01:22:15,750 --> 01:22:33,780
Ananda Sen: This is what we got just just now, I was showing you that if you ran the logistic regression, the way we are used to doing, then we end up getting this parameter estimate yeah.

496
01:22:33,780 --> 01:22:50,460
Ananda Sen: So odds ratio and Mexico, like your estimate the EIC for this one is 150 1.94 and, and the reason I put in the Ai see there is because I am running two different models so I can I actually have the luxury of.

497
01:22:50,460 --> 01:22:54,750
Ananda Sen: Checking the two aisense and see which one does better.

498
01:22:54,750 --> 01:23:01,620
Ananda Sen: Alright, so what's the match been analysis and notice it very carefully.

499
01:23:01,620 --> 01:23:09,450
Ananda Sen: I have a class statement which is fear ID so that there is a variable in the in the data set.

500
01:23:09,450 --> 01:23:26,730
Ananda Sen: It is, it also gives you the end you do need that you do need that because you're not need to needed to know which are the two mothers who are who are in the same pair or labeled with a clump to them the same.

501
01:23:26,730 --> 01:23:36,450
Ananda Sen: The new statement which we have not used before straighter beer at.

502
01:23:36,450 --> 01:23:41,160
Ananda Sen: That produces this estimated.

503
01:23:41,160 --> 01:24:11,790
Ananda Sen: This is called a conditional logistic regression, I actually have not used that term before.

504
01:24:11,790 --> 01:24:15,240
Ananda Sen: and

505
01:24:15,240 --> 01:24:24,990
Ananda Sen: In this in this in this, there is no intercept the analysis map method is condition I look at the EIC wow that's a huge jump half.

506
01:24:24,990 --> 01:24:37,710
Ananda Sen: 1.1 point nine four compared to 7224.

507
01:24:37,710 --> 01:24:42,630
Ananda Sen: So.

508
01:24:42,630 --> 01:24:47,040
Ananda Sen: From the design point of view.

509
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:57,960
Ananda Sen: If you have acquired data using mashing, then you should analyze it using matching.

510
01:24:57,960 --> 01:24:59,670
Ananda Sen: um.

511
01:24:59,670 --> 01:25:19,080
Ananda Sen: And from the technical point of view, you can do the whole thing in in logistic regression the way you were doing before, but using that additional trader statement, where it is a stratified by the matching it.

512
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:23,940
Okay.

513
01:25:23,940 --> 01:25:31,980
Ananda Sen: So unreasonable.

514
01:25:31,980 --> 01:25:36,690
Ananda Sen: pause here for just one moment and make sure that you are understanding.

515
01:25:36,690 --> 01:25:57,030
What we're talking about.

516
01:25:57,030 --> 01:26:02,610
Ananda Sen: It is called conditional logistic regression I just said that.

517
01:26:02,610 --> 01:26:24,450
Ananda Sen: I obviously this class is not the class to go through the actual details of the methodology how this is different from the regular logistic regression, but you can see, the proof in the in the output, they are different, and the fact that there is not intercept is also quite.

518
01:26:24,450 --> 01:26:32,280
Ananda Sen: Telling.

519
01:26:32,280 --> 01:26:37,800
Ananda Sen: don't you can do sleep somewhere in between.

520
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:44,160
Ananda Sen: You can do take the pair ID as a stratification cool very.

521
01:26:44,160 --> 01:26:49,140
Ananda Sen: didn't worry about the matching our stratification.

522
01:26:49,140 --> 01:27:00,780
Ananda Sen: Just a cove area and and run it as a second call various along with smoke, can you do that if you did it that way that's that's a model which.

523
01:27:00,780 --> 01:27:10,860
Ananda Sen: Sometimes it's called fixed effects model and contains plenty of parameters, unfortunately, because it has got so many parameters, the EIC just jumps up like crazy.

524
01:27:10,860 --> 01:27:30,360
Ananda Sen: But sometimes people say that if you are only interested in exposure variable it can produce some decent estimates of the exposure now, in this case I don't think it does a very good job, because it it just it just over parameters is the model and it's in it's.

525
01:27:30,360 --> 01:27:49,500
Ananda Sen: Quite used by the way you don't see the beer ID over it, because you know, there are 56 of the pair ids so so there'll be 55 degrees of freedom, it will it'll just keep on writing one after the other, so I decided to cut it off so.

526
01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:54,120
Ananda Sen: So you just see the smoke and intercept which are the two ones.

527
01:27:54,120 --> 01:28:08,520
Ananda Sen: fix it fix the situation has have their use, but this may not be the right one, I would recommend using conditional logistic regression for this I just there's something which people have used before.

528
01:28:08,520 --> 01:28:19,170
Ananda Sen: And if we do other covariance we can always do that and nothing really changes the interpretation.

529
01:28:19,170 --> 01:28:23,310
Ananda Sen: So in this case.

530
01:28:23,310 --> 01:28:30,720
Ananda Sen: The the the two variables, which I have thrown in there are lwt and race.

531
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:45,270
Ananda Sen: The P value changes very little, and the other variables are the way they are so, for example, if I had to.

532
01:28:45,270 --> 01:28:55,800
Ananda Sen: explain this we we I would probably say something like mother's smoking contributes to increased odds of low birth weight.

533
01:28:55,800 --> 01:29:14,910
Ananda Sen: or odds ratio of 3.3 which you don't see here you just see the you just see the estimate, but mother's last week and race, of the mother black and other are not significant adjusting for smoking status.

534
01:29:14,910 --> 01:29:20,190
Ananda Sen: So I just throw in something interpret the parameter estimate for black.

535
01:29:20,190 --> 01:29:23,880
i'm.

536
01:29:23,880 --> 01:29:30,630
Ananda Sen: Ignoring statistical significance.

537
01:29:30,630 --> 01:29:35,970
Ananda Sen: That interpretation, should be the same, you would say something like again.

538
01:29:35,970 --> 01:29:50,100
Ananda Sen: For remember okay well let's let's let's go to this let's go to this.

539
01:29:50,100 --> 01:29:58,470
Ananda Sen: So Somebody tell me somebody interpret the parameter estimate for black now remember one thing I want to point out is that.

540
01:29:58,470 --> 01:30:05,160
Ananda Sen: In this case, white is the reference.

541
01:30:05,160 --> 01:30:24,900
Ananda Sen: You don't see that, but why does that efforts.

542
01:30:24,900 --> 01:30:32,520
Ananda Sen: So how do you interpret the parameter estimate for black and what is exponential want wanted to just.

543
01:30:32,520 --> 01:31:03,150
Just to let me know.

544
01:31:03,150 --> 01:31:39,600
Ananda Sen: Six 0.1833 who would tell me.

545
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:43,320
Ananda Sen: How much is it.

546
01:31:43,320 --> 01:31:51,330
Ananda Sen: I think it's 1.2 1.2 Okay, yes.

547
01:31:51,330 --> 01:31:53,340
Okay.

548
01:31:53,340 --> 01:31:55,980
Ananda Sen: So.

549
01:31:55,980 --> 01:32:18,240
Ananda Sen: How would you enter bread, knowing that the odds ratio for black versus white is 1.2.

550
01:32:18,240 --> 01:32:22,770
Ananda Sen: i'll start off with this for a fixed.

551
01:32:22,770 --> 01:32:26,820
Ananda Sen: smoke and.

552
01:32:26,820 --> 01:33:09,600
lwt.

553
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:20,250
Ananda Sen: Being a black mother is associated with 20% higher odds.

554
01:33:20,250 --> 01:33:26,550
Ananda Sen: Then a white mother.

555
01:33:26,550 --> 01:33:31,080
Ananda Sen: Here is something which is missing from here.

556
01:33:31,080 --> 01:33:34,470
Ananda Sen: Of same age.

557
01:33:34,470 --> 01:33:38,250
Ananda Sen: Why is that because that was the matching.

558
01:33:38,250 --> 01:33:41,700
Ananda Sen: A white mother, the same age.

559
01:33:41,700 --> 01:33:48,330
Ananda Sen: arm.

560
01:33:48,330 --> 01:33:50,640
Ananda Sen: Oh.

561
01:33:50,640 --> 01:33:52,590
Ananda Sen: No.

562
01:33:52,590 --> 01:33:56,520
But.

563
01:33:56,520 --> 01:34:03,360
Ananda Sen: of having a low barrier to entry.

564
01:34:03,360 --> 01:34:08,610
Ananda Sen: So it's the same type of interpretation that integration doesn't change much.

565
01:34:08,610 --> 01:34:22,740
Ananda Sen: But it's the comparison is within pay comparison that's the that's the thing within within fair comparison that's all i'm.

566
01:34:22,740 --> 01:34:31,290
Ananda Sen: Now, remember the comparison was made based on age that's why age is.

567
01:34:31,290 --> 01:34:37,890
Ananda Sen: Fixed already the matching already fixed age and then you.

568
01:34:37,890 --> 01:34:44,520
Ananda Sen: essentially talking about the other variables.

569
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:55,230
Ananda Sen: Any question on this.

570
01:34:55,230 --> 01:34:59,250
Ananda Sen: Okay.

571
01:34:59,250 --> 01:35:02,490
Ananda Sen: All right, being naive about it.

572
01:35:02,490 --> 01:35:08,160
Ananda Sen: suppose I wanted to adjust for age see what happens.

573
01:35:08,160 --> 01:35:14,070
Ananda Sen: What what it will do is, if you do it that way.

574
01:35:14,070 --> 01:35:24,750
Ananda Sen: It will come up with an age variable which is zero you cannot estimate because essentially what's happening is for each pair.

575
01:35:24,750 --> 01:35:43,050
Ananda Sen: What do you do stratified pair ID stratified analysis it basically looks within each beer, and if you don't have differences within each pair then it's basically 00000 so so everything else.

576
01:35:43,050 --> 01:35:48,630
Ananda Sen: Everything else on this page on this page is.

577
01:35:48,630 --> 01:36:08,910
Ananda Sen: Is there the same thing, the only thing that doesn't work or does it doesn't work is his age, so you cannot estimate age of it, I like it said before, if it's age group Max, then you can do a little bit more, but direct each for each comparison.

578
01:36:08,910 --> 01:36:37,980
Ananda Sen: That makes sense.

579
01:36:37,980 --> 01:36:42,060
Ananda Sen: So i'll go back to the.

580
01:36:42,060 --> 01:36:49,320
Ananda Sen: Regular notes now because i'm going to talk about something which.

581
01:36:49,320 --> 01:36:55,110
Ananda Sen: is quite commonly used for larger data set.

582
01:36:55,110 --> 01:37:00,420
Ananda Sen: and motivate them and explain what that does.

583
01:37:00,420 --> 01:37:03,630
Ananda Sen: And we'll work with the glow data for.

584
01:37:03,630 --> 01:37:06,390
Ananda Sen: example but.

585
01:37:06,390 --> 01:37:31,230
Ananda Sen: Before going into that is everybody comfortable with, or at least trying to somewhat absorb or we talked about until until now matched against ankles.

586
01:37:31,230 --> 01:37:41,010
Ananda Sen: So go back to the.

587
01:37:41,010 --> 01:37:48,660
Ananda Sen: One of the one of the things about.

588
01:37:48,660 --> 01:37:59,460
Ananda Sen: One of them, are some of the disadvantages of grace control studies that the comparison group controls is much larger compared to the case.

589
01:37:59,460 --> 01:38:00,990
Ananda Sen: So.

590
01:38:00,990 --> 01:38:06,420
Ananda Sen: oftentimes what happens is that it's if it's, especially if it's a rare disease.

591
01:38:06,420 --> 01:38:11,460
Ananda Sen: or a disease with condition it's much harder to find.

592
01:38:11,460 --> 01:38:24,840
Ananda Sen: People with those conditions so so so you have those cases, and then, when you look for controls, then suddenly you have a huge pool of people from which to choose from.

593
01:38:24,840 --> 01:38:46,470
Ananda Sen: But if you don't want your your study to be flooded with like a 90% of of controls and 10% of cases, then the results will be driven by controls, so you you you that's Another thing which you don't want so so one of the questions is well.

594
01:38:46,470 --> 01:39:00,540
Ananda Sen: What should be the components that the proportion what is, if it is one case to em controls, what should MB what is the what is the optimal time.

595
01:39:00,540 --> 01:39:03,960
Ananda Sen: So that is, that is not clear.

596
01:39:03,960 --> 01:39:13,860
Ananda Sen: Now, even if you use an equal to four or five your you may potentially not use much of the data.

597
01:39:13,860 --> 01:39:33,150
Ananda Sen: um and then one thing which we have not talked about yet is that I just talked about matching with mother say I just talked about matching with one variable What about five different variables, by which you want to match.

598
01:39:33,150 --> 01:39:37,170
Ananda Sen: jade age, gender.

599
01:39:37,170 --> 01:39:47,550
Ananda Sen: race raise some kind of family history if you wanted to match with all of those things is there an automated way of doing.

600
01:39:47,550 --> 01:39:51,270
Ananda Sen: An answer to all of these is yes.

601
01:39:51,270 --> 01:39:58,140
Ananda Sen: So that's where propensity score matching is coming in, by the way, there are other types of matching which are.

602
01:39:58,140 --> 01:40:04,590
Ananda Sen: which are available and and most of the software is allow you to do.

603
01:40:04,590 --> 01:40:09,390
Ananda Sen: various different types of matching but propensity score matching is.

604
01:40:09,390 --> 01:40:14,490
Ananda Sen: Pretty widely used and it's somewhat.

605
01:40:14,490 --> 01:40:28,590
Ananda Sen: easy to understand what is going on there, so that's what we plan to do next, so we talk when we want to talk about propensity score matching and first of all.

606
01:40:28,590 --> 01:40:37,590
Ananda Sen: propensity score is a is a is a probability of exposure.

607
01:40:37,590 --> 01:40:50,640
Ananda Sen: it's not the probability of being a case or a control that comes later it's you have to think about it as a two stage process, the first stage is finding out the propensity of being exposed.

608
01:40:50,640 --> 01:40:56,520
Ananda Sen: Once you find that out, then use that in a clever way.

609
01:40:56,520 --> 01:41:01,110
Ananda Sen: we'll come to that in a moment what the clever ways.

610
01:41:01,110 --> 01:41:06,720
Ananda Sen: A to to inform the.

611
01:41:06,720 --> 01:41:18,330
Ananda Sen: The main, the main objective, the main model, the case control model okay so it's a two step process, the first step is a logistic regression, where you are.

612
01:41:18,330 --> 01:41:22,950
Ananda Sen: calculating the predicted probability from a logistical.

613
01:41:22,950 --> 01:41:28,200
Okay, so.

614
01:41:28,200 --> 01:41:40,440
Ananda Sen: First of all, what is the advantage of using it is a logistic regression so so see exposure exposure is smoking, suddenly, I want to say that well.

615
01:41:40,440 --> 01:41:50,970
Ananda Sen: I want to match smoking, I want to, I want to see whether smoking is related to something else, so I can I can.

616
01:41:50,970 --> 01:41:54,510
Ananda Sen: I can have exposure.

617
01:41:54,510 --> 01:41:57,720
Ananda Sen: studied as.

618
01:41:57,720 --> 01:42:03,480
Ananda Sen: The regression model for all the other covariance which they wanted to match on.

619
01:42:03,480 --> 01:42:18,480
Ananda Sen: Okay, so once they have that then because I because I originally wanted to match on only by only by age mother's age, but, but if I wanted to mention other things, then I could I could do it that way.

620
01:42:18,480 --> 01:42:30,660
Ananda Sen: And then, once the propensity scores have been obtained, I can use it in the regression model in multiple ways I can do it for matching I can do it for stratification I can do it for regression just.

621
01:42:30,660 --> 01:42:48,780
Ananda Sen: So when you do regression adjustment, you can use it as a covariance use the inverse of the propensity score as weights and the end you can do it either way you want the advantage of this you're using all the observations you're not leaving out any any controls.

622
01:42:48,780 --> 01:42:51,570
Ananda Sen: When you do matching.

623
01:42:51,570 --> 01:43:01,530
Ananda Sen: You can do one to one or one is to him, based on propensity scores you don't have to do it on one single variable.

624
01:43:01,530 --> 01:43:11,700
Ananda Sen: And you can also do stratification you can create quintiles of propensity score and use the quantel says matching straight up in the case control regression model.

625
01:43:11,700 --> 01:43:21,720
Ananda Sen: So what is that what is the idea that ideas of subjects from the exposed in that unexposed groups have similar within straighter.

626
01:43:21,720 --> 01:43:33,210
Ananda Sen: They are similar within straighter means that you have taken out the effect of everything else that could confound the relationship.

627
01:43:33,210 --> 01:43:36,840
Ananda Sen: Once you have done that, then that.

628
01:43:36,840 --> 01:43:39,390
Ananda Sen: They have.

629
01:43:39,390 --> 01:43:45,930
Ananda Sen: adjusted exposure is what you should be comparing.

630
01:43:45,930 --> 01:43:51,870
Okay.

631
01:43:51,870 --> 01:43:59,340
All right.

632
01:43:59,340 --> 01:44:13,440
Ananda Sen: Okay, so I think that's what I intended to say in the lab in the in the main one and let's go to the lab now because lab is going to be the most instructive.

633
01:44:13,440 --> 01:44:24,570
Ananda Sen: So the procedure to use in SAS is called prop vs MAC and I will go through an example to show you exactly how this is handled.

634
01:44:24,570 --> 01:44:35,940
Ananda Sen: it conducts all propensity matching waiting and stratification that's The good thing about the bs match and let's say glow data that's us blow data to do this.

635
01:44:35,940 --> 01:44:49,020
Ananda Sen: The question we are trying to answer this weather history of pride factor fracture that's my exposure predicts imminent factual fracture So you see exposure is prior fracture.

636
01:44:49,020 --> 01:44:59,100
Ananda Sen: outcome is imminent fracture so the case is imminent fracture control is the person who did not have the fracture.

637
01:44:59,100 --> 01:45:07,980
Ananda Sen: And then you go back into history and say, well, is this person did have this person have a preference.

638
01:45:07,980 --> 01:45:23,250
Ananda Sen: It is intended to balance or match broad fracture across so many of these variables age weight arm assist height rate risk.

639
01:45:23,250 --> 01:45:26,370
Ananda Sen: So.

640
01:45:26,370 --> 01:45:34,560
Ananda Sen: You are matching the exposure here are balanced exposure here.

641
01:45:34,560 --> 01:45:50,280
Ananda Sen: And then use that balanced exposure to compare the main outcome that is the idea of propensity score matching.

642
01:45:50,280 --> 01:45:54,390
Ananda Sen: i'm gonna stop there for a moment and make sure that you're.

643
01:45:54,390 --> 01:46:09,030
Ananda Sen: You get this up so previously what we're trying to do we're trying to do a case control study, where the case control is the outcome and and then we're just taking one matching variable.

644
01:46:09,030 --> 01:46:17,250
Ananda Sen: Maybe by their stage or something like that and and matched the case control.

645
01:46:17,250 --> 01:46:23,850
Ananda Sen: Based on the mothers variable and then compared the exposure their.

646
01:46:23,850 --> 01:46:32,700
Ananda Sen: Exposure in our previous case was smoking.

647
01:46:32,700 --> 01:46:34,260
Ananda Sen: here.

648
01:46:34,260 --> 01:46:37,410
Ananda Sen: We are taking the exposure.

649
01:46:37,410 --> 01:46:49,110
Ananda Sen: And matching the explosion or balancing the exposure out by doing a regression on them.

650
01:46:49,110 --> 01:46:53,730
Ananda Sen: So when I when I use.

651
01:46:53,730 --> 01:46:56,850
Ananda Sen: The exposure.

652
01:46:56,850 --> 01:47:07,350
Ananda Sen: In the original case control model I adjust for somehow this balanced straight up.

653
01:47:07,350 --> 01:47:19,260
Ananda Sen: Remember what we did before we took a pair ID just a single ID appear and say that, within the sphere i'm going to match where i'm going to compare.

654
01:47:19,260 --> 01:47:30,450
Ananda Sen: Next, for the non exposure here i'm saying I don't have to go with a single ID i'm going to do the propensity and based on the propensity.

655
01:47:30,450 --> 01:47:32,910
Ananda Sen: I.

656
01:47:32,910 --> 01:47:37,410
Ananda Sen: Make sure that the that the.

657
01:47:37,410 --> 01:47:39,780
Ananda Sen: exposures are.

658
01:47:39,780 --> 01:47:43,020
Ananda Sen: Different between the casing and controls.

659
01:47:43,020 --> 01:47:46,080
Ananda Sen: So there's it's a slightly.

660
01:47:46,080 --> 01:47:48,900
Ananda Sen: More.

661
01:47:48,900 --> 01:47:58,500
Ananda Sen: Larger take on this i'm not losing i'm not losing any data here.

662
01:47:58,500 --> 01:48:08,400
Ananda Sen: it's not an easy concept, but once you understand the concept you'd say Oh, this makes sense.

663
01:48:08,400 --> 01:48:13,950
Ananda Sen: So i'm waiting for that hot, it makes sense stage for you.

664
01:48:13,950 --> 01:48:18,390
Ananda Sen: Know understand everything all the technical details.

665
01:48:18,390 --> 01:48:26,400
details.

666
01:48:26,400 --> 01:48:28,260
Ananda Sen: So.

667
01:48:28,260 --> 01:48:57,420
Ananda Sen: Can I get a volunteer for explaining to me how the propensity matching is working, especially in contrast to what we did before.

668
01:48:57,420 --> 01:49:44,970
Ananda Sen: Even if it's grossly wrong let's try there let's start there.

669
01:49:44,970 --> 01:49:49,320
Ananda Sen: it's a matching.

670
01:49:49,320 --> 01:50:02,610
Ananda Sen: to master analysis so so the cases that controls are more equal.

671
01:50:02,610 --> 01:50:11,280
Ananda Sen: So when we were doing the first so let's try to understand what we did, the first thing we did the first time was we said well.

672
01:50:11,280 --> 01:50:15,840
Ananda Sen: cases and controls were picked by.

673
01:50:15,840 --> 01:50:18,420
Ananda Sen: By a variable.

674
01:50:18,420 --> 01:50:33,600
Ananda Sen: And dad variable essentially matched them and then we wanted to see whether the exposure and the non exposure with different between them here we're going backwards, we take the exposure and say that.

675
01:50:33,600 --> 01:50:36,780
Ananda Sen: Well, what about.

676
01:50:36,780 --> 01:50:42,060
Ananda Sen: What about the exposure versus non exposure is that.

677
01:50:42,060 --> 01:50:49,020
Ananda Sen: Is that determiner predicted by other variables, which I can see.

678
01:50:49,020 --> 01:50:53,220
Ananda Sen: If that is the case.

679
01:50:53,220 --> 01:51:01,980
Ananda Sen: And if I, if I have my let's say agent gender and dreams are the three.

680
01:51:01,980 --> 01:51:03,930
Ananda Sen: variables.

681
01:51:03,930 --> 01:51:07,620
Ananda Sen: And I say the younger folks.

682
01:51:07,620 --> 01:51:14,130
Ananda Sen: Who are females, and who are white.

683
01:51:14,130 --> 01:51:25,290
Ananda Sen: They have a certain probability of being exposed because I so far I haven't looked at that.

684
01:51:25,290 --> 01:51:40,890
Ananda Sen: So when I say something like that I could I could go I could choose those variables, or I could say that I don't have to care about whether it's white and and and and female and.

685
01:51:40,890 --> 01:51:45,240
Ananda Sen: younger age group and it's got to go with the.

686
01:51:45,240 --> 01:52:04,050
Ananda Sen: chances of being exposed and I will arrange those chances of exposed maybe I will look for people who have the lowest 20% chance of being exposed in a group and the next 20% chance of being exposed in another group, and so on and so forth.

687
01:52:04,050 --> 01:52:06,600
Ananda Sen: And those.

688
01:52:06,600 --> 01:52:15,840
Ananda Sen: Those groups will be my matching strydom.

689
01:52:15,840 --> 01:52:22,260
Ananda Sen: and using those matching strydom, then I compare the exposure.

690
01:52:22,260 --> 01:52:24,120
Ananda Sen: versus the.

691
01:52:24,120 --> 01:52:42,390
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: So in so many words basically this model looks at things in a match sense, where you have two things you're comparing in the other version it's just a linear sense just comparing all the things right right.

692
01:52:42,390 --> 01:52:54,300
Ananda Sen: yeah matched sense means you do some pre processing to the beta make the make the people as close as possible, so what is the advantage of doing it this propensity based analysis.

693
01:52:54,300 --> 01:53:05,280
Ananda Sen: propensity of 20 let's say the lowest 20% of just mentioned, with lawyers 20% that group, how many cases and how many controls will there be you don't know.

694
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:07,740
Ananda Sen: It could be there could be.

695
01:53:07,740 --> 01:53:20,220
Ananda Sen: 20% of those could be cases and the remaining 80% of them could be controls in and other straighter there could be 40% cases and 60% controls those will vary.

696
01:53:20,220 --> 01:53:36,180
Ananda Sen: But the point is whether the very or not they have something in common, are very close to be known, they are, they have a chance of exposure, which are very, very similar.

697
01:53:36,180 --> 01:53:47,220
Ananda Sen: that's how they are matched they have not not matched by individual variables, they are matched by their chances of being exposed that's the part you have done.

698
01:53:47,220 --> 01:53:51,900
Geehan Suleyman: you're trying to minimize from founder guess with with.

699
01:53:51,900 --> 01:53:53,370
Ananda Sen: That exactly.

700
01:53:53,370 --> 01:54:01,980
Ananda Sen: The whole purpose of this is to get rid of confounders yeah.

701
01:54:01,980 --> 01:54:12,510
Ananda Sen: Actually propensity adjusted analysis is is very commonly done in observational studies it's because of this large amount of confounders.

702
01:54:12,510 --> 01:54:34,740
Ananda Sen: that's it's very popular analysis, which is, which is carried out and i'm talking in the in the context of case control matching but but it's it's really propensity just a matching has really not much to do with case control and it's it's basically a way to make.

703
01:54:34,740 --> 01:54:44,160
Ananda Sen: The subjects compatible with respect to the doctors.

704
01:54:44,160 --> 01:54:47,040
Ananda Sen: Any question.

705
01:54:47,040 --> 01:54:48,510
Ananda Sen: OK.

706
01:54:48,510 --> 01:54:50,400
Ananda Sen: So.

707
01:54:50,400 --> 01:55:11,160
Ananda Sen: The procedure goes like this well there is a region all of those are those are more cosmetic things but really the prop PS match and the class and the PS model are the two main ones, so the so the bs model tells you that this is my exposure and I want to.

708
01:55:11,160 --> 01:55:17,550
Ananda Sen: Take that exposure then and run a regression model logistic regression model using.

709
01:55:17,550 --> 01:55:37,140
Ananda Sen: Those covariance age pharmacist weight height rate risk, I want to create number of so I just say 20% so, so this is kind of like a default streeter how many straight straight out propensities do I want to use 20% 40% 60% 80% hundred percent that's that's those are the five straighter.

710
01:55:37,140 --> 01:55:55,260
Ananda Sen: And then I also wanted to know how did this vs match do, how did they did the match the variables so that's, something which I wanted to plot out and and and do this so let's see what happens, by doing that.

711
01:55:55,260 --> 01:56:04,050
Ananda Sen: So I think the first one, I want to point out, is this is, this is an overall summary, the pride frack and.

712
01:56:04,050 --> 01:56:13,860
Ananda Sen: The control and the exposure exposure and the and the non exposed ones, how do they, how does the propensity score.

713
01:56:13,860 --> 01:56:32,070
Ananda Sen: Very so the propensity score means point three six for the prior frak one and control is grabbing this is radiance is this is something which is not relevant here, but in some cases, might actually need there.

714
01:56:32,070 --> 01:56:37,170
Ananda Sen: There are five straighter the propensity score ranges of this.

715
01:56:37,170 --> 01:56:47,940
Ananda Sen: And how many three treated people have treated being what we call it treated in in SAS, but in this case treated means there is a prior.

716
01:56:47,940 --> 01:57:00,420
Ananda Sen: frack our prior fracture and you'll notice that those five straighter are pretty evenly balanced so 2520 520-525-2526 25.

717
01:57:00,420 --> 01:57:06,570
Ananda Sen: But that's supposed to happen, because when I said that I wanted five straighter that means.

718
01:57:06,570 --> 01:57:12,450
Ananda Sen: it's it's straight up, based on how many.

719
01:57:12,450 --> 01:57:17,460
Ananda Sen: exposed observations you have so.

720
01:57:17,460 --> 01:57:30,510
Ananda Sen: The last 25 are the lowest one fifth they should see lowest one fifth of the case and lowest one fifth of the exposed are in the first Rita.

721
01:57:30,510 --> 01:57:36,060
Ananda Sen: The second lowest one fifth is in the second straight them and so on and so.

722
01:57:36,060 --> 01:57:45,780
Ananda Sen: Controls are different see one of them has 203 controls the other one has 65 and so.

723
01:57:45,780 --> 01:57:50,040
Ananda Sen: there's a first information.

724
01:57:50,040 --> 01:57:57,300
Ananda Sen: The next information wanted to point out, I know how much you can see them a bullet is for being a little.

725
01:57:57,300 --> 01:58:00,570
Ananda Sen: Small.

726
01:58:00,570 --> 01:58:08,520
Ananda Sen: Ignore ignore the region bar just all is fine um so in this case.

727
01:58:08,520 --> 01:58:17,370
Ananda Sen: It gives you the description of all these variables you're using so a dharma cyst weight height raise concerns.

728
01:58:17,370 --> 01:58:21,390
Ananda Sen: One thing to notice is that when you look at.

729
01:58:21,390 --> 01:58:26,820
Ananda Sen: The age in the exposure the non-exposed group, this is before matching.

730
01:58:26,820 --> 01:58:40,650
Ananda Sen: To 73 versus 67 and then our pharmacist 53% that's actually a percent 53% versus 32% and so on and so forth okay.

731
01:58:40,650 --> 01:58:47,700
Ananda Sen: So it's quite imbalanced in that, in that sense.

732
01:58:47,700 --> 01:58:57,090
Ananda Sen: So rate risk is another one 2.199 versus 0.77 once it has been matched.

733
01:58:57,090 --> 01:59:09,120
Ananda Sen: they're pretty darn close so, for example, if you looked at age look at those values in each of the striatum.

734
01:59:09,120 --> 01:59:20,640
Ananda Sen: 62.72 verses six 2.04 69.9646926 82.2 verses in 3.6 similarly for pharmacist.

735
01:59:20,640 --> 01:59:24,720
Ananda Sen: Is it that's what you get often match.

736
01:59:24,720 --> 01:59:39,900
Ananda Sen: You matched by these five variables and after propensity matching for in each of those trade them all these distributions are very evenly distributed it's kind of like what randomization does.

737
01:59:39,900 --> 01:59:50,190
Ananda Sen: Except it's doing it in this in this matching with so now, if there is a dis if you if you use these traders.

738
01:59:50,190 --> 02:00:04,500
Ananda Sen: And if you run a model of case control as a function of the exposure, you will get a much fewer association between exposure and and and.

739
02:00:04,500 --> 02:00:22,050
Ananda Sen: And the outcome, because these things are pretty balanced in this traitor once you once you ended with this freedom or want to adjust for this trader you're actually doing it within straight analysis.

740
02:00:22,050 --> 02:00:35,370
Ananda Sen: Question on these.

741
02:00:35,370 --> 02:00:40,740
Ananda Sen: And there is some visual comparisons to I mean.

742
02:00:40,740 --> 02:00:44,490
Ananda Sen: distribution of age.

743
02:00:44,490 --> 02:00:58,920
Ananda Sen: This was before stratification and then after certification it's it looks like that so so the regional had a bunch of visual things there are you notice.

744
02:00:58,920 --> 02:01:01,770
Ananda Sen: I want to also see how the.

745
02:01:01,770 --> 02:01:08,040
Ananda Sen: propensity is looked like, and this is, this is all just thinks that you can okay.

746
02:01:08,040 --> 02:01:12,120
Ananda Sen: So what do you do with this straight up you already created the street right.

747
02:01:12,120 --> 02:01:22,650
Ananda Sen: it's actually a SAS SAS data sets so it has got those underscores before and after.

748
02:01:22,650 --> 02:01:38,580
Ananda Sen: And you run the stratified conditional logistic regression and you end up getting pride frack of Europe 6406 of the p value is point zero.

749
02:01:38,580 --> 02:01:54,810
Ananda Sen: Do you see how i'm using it instead of doing a pair ID i'm creating this propensity score straight up and he was in the conditional logistic regression and good getting out the condition logistic regression with this that propensity straighten.

750
02:01:54,810 --> 02:01:58,920
Ananda Sen: How about doing an unmatched regression model.

751
02:01:58,920 --> 02:02:08,460
Ananda Sen: So not don't worry about all of these things just doing the way we have learned to do in the last couple of days.

752
02:02:08,460 --> 02:02:13,200
Ananda Sen: I still get a significant female robots point.

753
02:02:13,200 --> 02:02:24,690
Ananda Sen: 0.1111 do but but look at how much more significant we get with this propensity based analysis.

754
02:02:24,690 --> 02:02:29,190
Ananda Sen: So the power increases hugely.

755
02:02:29,190 --> 02:02:41,340
Ananda Sen: Because what you have done what we have done is now becomes a within subject analysis always remember the within subject analysis actually lot more powerful.

756
02:02:41,340 --> 02:03:04,050
Ananda Sen: Because you're you're you're adjusting for all the other ones, not all the other but as much as you can given your data, the confounding factors.

757
02:03:04,050 --> 02:03:20,310
Ananda Sen: said one clear.

758
02:03:20,310 --> 02:03:23,970
Ananda Sen: i'll go to the other leg function later, but.

759
02:03:23,970 --> 02:03:26,310
Ananda Sen: Of course, make sure that I.

760
02:03:26,310 --> 02:03:29,610
missed this part is clear.

761
02:03:29,610 --> 02:03:43,410
for everybody.

762
02:03:43,410 --> 02:03:58,650
Ananda Sen: Okay.

763
02:03:58,650 --> 02:04:07,860
Ananda Sen: So do you have an idea of how the matching works now so it's basically when.

764
02:04:07,860 --> 02:04:16,170
Ananda Sen: Whether you do a case control study or not I mean matching is not just for case control Center for whether you do a case control study or not.

765
02:04:16,170 --> 02:04:23,790
Ananda Sen: Matching is generally a pretty good idea when you're dealing with observational study that's that's no matter true.

766
02:04:23,790 --> 02:04:35,550
Ananda Sen: So when you have observational study and you're really interested in one exposure then oftentimes it's a much better idea to do run this.

767
02:04:35,550 --> 02:04:39,150
Ananda Sen: First, so.

768
02:04:39,150 --> 02:04:43,200
Ananda Sen: One of the things which.

769
02:04:43,200 --> 02:04:47,370
Ananda Sen: Were i'm using propensity score, let me just tell you.

770
02:04:47,370 --> 02:04:53,460
Ananda Sen: So, so I, as I was mentioning yesterday I work with a lot of.

771
02:04:53,460 --> 02:04:57,810
Ananda Sen: Colleagues, our department actually has.

772
02:04:57,810 --> 02:05:08,580
Ananda Sen: Quite a few colleagues that are not the ones who are at your family, whether you know not we have an outstanding chair, who is.

773
02:05:08,580 --> 02:05:12,690
Ananda Sen: clinically deaf.

774
02:05:12,690 --> 02:05:18,240
Ananda Sen: and his his life story is one of the most inspiring others ever heard.

775
02:05:18,240 --> 02:05:23,100
Ananda Sen: And he's a very, very accomplished musician.

776
02:05:23,100 --> 02:05:25,830
Ananda Sen: But because of his own.

777
02:05:25,830 --> 02:05:36,570
Ananda Sen: Can condition he's his his research and his research, he is interested in in disability and we have recruited, a number of.

778
02:05:36,570 --> 02:05:50,040
Ananda Sen: faculty members in the department, who are interested in in disability research, I worked with a few of them, and obviously with disability research everything you get is is more like.

779
02:05:50,040 --> 02:05:59,280
Ananda Sen: observational study right you we want to compare either a hearing impaired with regular hearing person or a vision impaired with another.

780
02:05:59,280 --> 02:06:02,340
Ananda Sen: Normal vision person and.

781
02:06:02,340 --> 02:06:04,080
Ananda Sen: And then.

782
02:06:04,080 --> 02:06:08,910
Ananda Sen: compare them across many things so.

783
02:06:08,910 --> 02:06:14,850
Ananda Sen: Often, one of the issues which come to the place that.

784
02:06:14,850 --> 02:06:25,560
Ananda Sen: subjects who are physically impaired whether it's visual or or hearing or anything like that they have a they have some access issues.

785
02:06:25,560 --> 02:06:28,410
Ananda Sen: And unless you.

786
02:06:28,410 --> 02:06:31,740
Ananda Sen: Somehow adjust for this access issues.

787
02:06:31,740 --> 02:06:37,380
Ananda Sen: You are not never going to get a full.

788
02:06:37,380 --> 02:06:39,060
Ananda Sen: honest.

789
02:06:39,060 --> 02:06:41,610
Ananda Sen: association stake.

790
02:06:41,610 --> 02:06:50,310
Ananda Sen: So how do you take take into account access access issues you couldn't use them as covariance like like you like you see here, for example.

791
02:06:50,310 --> 02:07:05,220
Ananda Sen: Or you could try to make propensity score matching using those other covariance and your exposure, what is the exposure to exposure is say let's say hearing impaired so def versus normal hearing.

792
02:07:05,220 --> 02:07:08,010
Ananda Sen: That exposure.

793
02:07:08,010 --> 02:07:11,430
Ananda Sen: And then you have some controls.

794
02:07:11,430 --> 02:07:20,310
Ananda Sen: Just a bit since he has an outcomes it doesn't have to be a case control study you can do it for anything.

795
02:07:20,310 --> 02:07:35,520
Ananda Sen: So i'm going to give you examples, so that it impresses upon your that that that the the matching procedure is is a pretty widely accepted and used.

796
02:07:35,520 --> 02:07:43,950
Ananda Sen: Statistical procedure, whether you're doing matching and the design stage by actually selecting.

797
02:07:43,950 --> 02:07:50,670
Ananda Sen: cases and controls like that or whether doing it as a post.

798
02:07:50,670 --> 02:08:09,570
Ananda Sen: Data Collection stage is up to you, but and and oftentimes it's it's a matter of when you have an access to the beta but, nonetheless, you have these tools available to do it at any stage, for that matter.

799
02:08:09,570 --> 02:08:15,540
Okay.

800
02:08:15,540 --> 02:08:33,540
Ananda Sen: So something different today something something not along the usual lines, but they are these are lot more practical in some some sense and like like I said, and this is the one thing which i'm sure some of you have already been exposed to.

801
02:08:33,540 --> 02:08:41,100
Ananda Sen: I talked about this, I talked about having linked functions which are different than legit.

802
02:08:41,100 --> 02:08:43,500
Ananda Sen: This is one example.

803
02:08:43,500 --> 02:08:54,840
Ananda Sen: And i'm not going to go over this example, again, but this is an example of a data of a of a code where i'm using.

804
02:08:54,840 --> 02:09:16,890
Ananda Sen: Again, this is the low birth with data with Center age smoking in and and hypertension status i'm using link equal to log when you when I use link equal to log data petition in the scale is risk into interpretation is risk ratio not odds ratio.

805
02:09:16,890 --> 02:09:22,170
Ananda Sen: So.

806
02:09:22,170 --> 02:09:24,330
Ananda Sen: So here's an example.

807
02:09:24,330 --> 02:09:27,660
Ananda Sen: So.

808
02:09:27,660 --> 02:09:36,450
Ananda Sen: What do we have here let's say the first one smoking let's just do one one of them.

809
02:09:36,450 --> 02:09:55,350
Ananda Sen: So that's if I if I exponentially that that's one 1.4085 is 1.5 Okay, no odds here see there is no odds, I can say fixing AIDS and HIV status smokers are 1.5 times.

810
02:09:55,350 --> 02:10:09,390
Ananda Sen: as likely as non smokers to have a low birth with baby compared to the non smoking counterparts.

811
02:10:09,390 --> 02:10:12,330
Ananda Sen: make sense.

812
02:10:12,330 --> 02:10:29,430
Ananda Sen: Similarly, you would say that hypertensive mothers are 1.72 times as likely as non smokers to have a low birth to the baby completed an unspoken counterparts, this is fixing age and smoking status.

813
02:10:29,430 --> 02:10:35,070
Ananda Sen: as likely as opposed to higher odds.

814
02:10:35,070 --> 02:10:50,610
Ananda Sen: So it all changed as a single, simple change which is linked equal to log from the basic link it could indulge it.

815
02:10:50,610 --> 02:11:00,300
Okay.

816
02:11:00,300 --> 02:11:04,170
Ananda Sen: there's a question for you guys.

817
02:11:04,170 --> 02:11:13,890
Ananda Sen: When link equal to identity that means no transformation may no longer be over one minus p.

818
02:11:13,890 --> 02:11:33,570
Ananda Sen: or log be is just be so the model is something like this.

819
02:11:33,570 --> 02:11:41,160
Ananda Sen: What does that mean.

820
02:11:41,160 --> 02:11:50,580
Ananda Sen: So if I wanted a lot right put in context, if I wanted to run a low birth weight so low equals.

821
02:11:50,580 --> 02:11:53,310
Ananda Sen: beta not.

822
02:11:53,310 --> 02:11:57,060
Ananda Sen: Plus beta one smoke.

823
02:11:57,060 --> 02:12:19,650
Ananda Sen: Plus beta two hd and let's say i'm.

824
02:12:19,650 --> 02:12:36,900
Ananda Sen: What does it mean.

825
02:12:36,900 --> 02:12:41,400
Ananda Sen: Link equals identity.

826
02:12:41,400 --> 02:12:54,150
Ananda Sen: And he ran this model low smoke hd Lincoln cook identity and beta one came out to be 0.1 what does it mean.

827
02:12:54,150 --> 02:13:05,610
Ananda Sen: Anybody any guests.

828
02:13:05,610 --> 02:13:19,350
Ananda Sen: legit is odds log is risk ratio times what is identity.

829
02:13:19,350 --> 02:13:26,310
Ananda Sen: What do you think just even if you do I understand.

830
02:13:26,310 --> 02:13:30,000
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: Your scale will no longer be an odd scale.

831
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:38,700
Ananda Sen: it's not an art scale, but what is the scale, if I have to interpret this I came up with with an estimate of beta one.

832
02:13:38,700 --> 02:13:41,130
Ananda Sen: equals 0.1.

833
02:13:41,130 --> 02:13:45,660
Ananda Sen: What does it mean when I when I.

834
02:13:45,660 --> 02:13:47,040
Ananda Sen: Present that to my.

835
02:13:47,040 --> 02:14:31,590
Ananda Sen: To my collaborators.

836
02:14:31,590 --> 02:14:49,830
Ananda Sen: I could run a binary regression model like this, where my low it's not called logistic regression at that point, but just take us for legit even the one with link equal the log is not a logistic regression model it's a binary regression model with log as the link.

837
02:14:49,830 --> 02:14:56,070
Ananda Sen: Here the link is identity, which means I did not change anything.

838
02:14:56,070 --> 02:14:57,750
Ananda Sen: Here is.

839
02:14:57,750 --> 02:15:00,570
Ananda Sen: A statement.

840
02:15:00,570 --> 02:15:05,790
Ananda Sen: Anybody bold enough to mention this.

841
02:15:05,790 --> 02:15:15,750
Ananda Sen: Think about okay here's a hint think about linear regression.

842
02:15:15,750 --> 02:15:18,090
Ananda Sen: linear regression.

843
02:15:18,090 --> 02:15:22,860
Ananda Sen: The integration is in terms of difference.

844
02:15:22,860 --> 02:15:30,270
Ananda Sen: Here is the same interpretation so.

845
02:15:30,270 --> 02:15:36,270
Ananda Sen: This would say.

846
02:15:36,270 --> 02:15:45,900
Ananda Sen: For given hd status.

847
02:15:45,900 --> 02:15:54,810
Ananda Sen: Smoking mother's.

848
02:15:54,810 --> 02:15:57,240
Ananda Sen: 10%.

849
02:15:57,240 --> 02:15:59,220
Higher.

850
02:15:59,220 --> 02:16:02,130
chance.

851
02:16:02,130 --> 02:16:06,330
of having.

852
02:16:06,330 --> 02:16:08,670
No more.

853
02:16:08,670 --> 02:16:12,360
baby.

854
02:16:12,360 --> 02:16:24,570
compared.

855
02:16:24,570 --> 02:16:35,160
Ananda Sen: Suddenly, you can interpret this in the different scale, so what it's saying is that.

856
02:16:35,160 --> 02:16:51,720
Ananda Sen: A lot of smoking mother in law smoke and our non smoking mother both have a risk of a low birth weight if I use link equal to load it then I will interpret their risk as a ratio odds ratio.

857
02:16:51,720 --> 02:16:57,570
Ananda Sen: If I have linked equal to log I will interpret the.

858
02:16:57,570 --> 02:17:07,800
Ananda Sen: risks as again as a ratio, but this time I call it risk ratio How likely is one here it's risk difference.

859
02:17:07,800 --> 02:17:12,630
Ananda Sen: So if the law if the.

860
02:17:12,630 --> 02:17:17,640
Ananda Sen: If the non smoking mother's risk is 20% then.

861
02:17:17,640 --> 02:17:21,600
Ananda Sen: The smoking mother's risk is 30%.

862
02:17:21,600 --> 02:17:23,580
Ananda Sen: that's what it is.

863
02:17:23,580 --> 02:17:28,230
Ananda Sen: it's a difference in the in the tourists, not the ratio anymore.

864
02:17:28,230 --> 02:17:32,250
Ananda Sen: So that's a link.

865
02:17:32,250 --> 02:17:36,630
Ananda Sen: Okay let's take a short break let's come back at four.

866
02:17:36,630 --> 02:17:41,190
Ananda Sen: And, and then we'll we'll talk about something else.

867
02:17:41,190 --> 02:17:46,200
Ananda Sen: Okay, our last session of the.

868
02:17:46,200 --> 02:27:03,300
Ananda Sen: of our class.

869
02:27:03,300 --> 02:27:10,590
Ananda Sen: Right.

870
02:27:10,590 --> 02:27:14,820
Ananda Sen: So there is a so last thing i'm going to do.

871
02:27:14,820 --> 02:27:22,170
Ananda Sen: And then we'll we'll still have time some time and we can just discuss a few things but.

872
02:27:22,170 --> 02:27:28,080
Ananda Sen: I wanted to give you some flavor of where we can go from here.

873
02:27:28,080 --> 02:27:37,620
Ananda Sen: um without going into the detail itself of the technicalities, I have a whole bunch of stuff left on.

874
02:27:37,620 --> 02:27:41,220
Ananda Sen: On the.

875
02:27:41,220 --> 02:27:44,850
Ananda Sen: lecture set and.

876
02:27:44,850 --> 02:27:48,750
Ananda Sen: That you can keep as.

877
02:27:48,750 --> 02:27:54,360
Ananda Sen: Some references ever is needed um.

878
02:27:54,360 --> 02:27:56,310
Ananda Sen: I don't think.

879
02:27:56,310 --> 02:28:05,010
Ananda Sen: I can do justice to any of those topics in this last remaining hour, so instead what i'm going to do is to.

880
02:28:05,010 --> 02:28:11,760
Ananda Sen: give you an example of an extension of what we are talking about.

881
02:28:11,760 --> 02:28:14,610
Ananda Sen: Where.

882
02:28:14,610 --> 02:28:23,880
Ananda Sen: Where we can do, and you can you can easily see how this is, this is an extension of what we are doing so.

883
02:28:23,880 --> 02:28:30,210
Ananda Sen: A kind of like a toy example is is this this one, which has.

884
02:28:30,210 --> 02:28:41,250
Ananda Sen: got some data on some high school students who are making program choices among among three three types general program vocational program and academic group.

885
02:28:41,250 --> 02:28:52,380
Ananda Sen: And what they are choosing could be modeled as a function of many things in this case, we could take as an example.

886
02:28:52,380 --> 02:28:56,250
Ananda Sen: using their writing scoring.

887
02:28:56,250 --> 02:29:04,080
Ananda Sen: Up to this point middle school or something like that, and maybe an entrance exam or something like that, and there is yes.

888
02:29:04,080 --> 02:29:08,640
Ananda Sen: um this by just by itself is probably a.

889
02:29:08,640 --> 02:29:10,140
Ananda Sen: Very.

890
02:29:10,140 --> 02:29:12,210
Ananda Sen: Poor way of.

891
02:29:12,210 --> 02:29:19,620
Ananda Sen: Trying to predict the choice, but let us just do this for the purposes of.

892
02:29:19,620 --> 02:29:21,660
illustration.

893
02:29:21,660 --> 02:29:28,830
Ananda Sen: So I do have a new data set called a gsb DEMO which was not there before.

894
02:29:28,830 --> 02:29:37,680
Ananda Sen: And, and that is on the data sets folder and i'm just running it here.

895
02:29:37,680 --> 02:29:40,440
Ananda Sen: So.

896
02:29:40,440 --> 02:29:51,030
Ananda Sen: And, firstly, I just wanted to see what is there in the data in a sea of the whole bunch of variables type of school science score social studies score.

897
02:29:51,030 --> 02:30:06,780
Ananda Sen: math score and so on and so forth type of program and the program is the vocational versus academic versus a general program gender is there and and some other stuff okay.

898
02:30:06,780 --> 02:30:10,230
Ananda Sen: As a support system mean one.

899
02:30:10,230 --> 02:30:31,950
Ananda Sen: So I just ran some standard descriptive stuff and again as an applied epidemiologic or a statistician this is some of the things you would want to do, initially, so I just came back to this just to reiterate that this is something you should probably be looking at so and again these.

900
02:30:31,950 --> 02:30:35,040
Ananda Sen: These codes are already in the.

901
02:30:35,040 --> 02:30:37,380
Ananda Sen: lab five.

902
02:30:37,380 --> 02:30:47,430
Ananda Sen: code file, so you can run them yourself and make sure that this is something you're understanding.

903
02:30:47,430 --> 02:30:52,710
Ananda Sen: The main one is that aggression again proper logistic would be useful.

904
02:30:52,710 --> 02:31:12,810
Ananda Sen: If you ran a proper logistic on this data and what I did was I actually used some specific references now remember something Well, first of all, sex, I didn't mention that very clearly sex is it's not not here but sex said that it's a categorical variable.

905
02:31:12,810 --> 02:31:16,470
Ananda Sen: So there are three different types of a CSS and.

906
02:31:16,470 --> 02:31:23,190
Ananda Sen: three different categories of sex as those are This, of course, an audible category, but.

907
02:31:23,190 --> 02:31:28,860
Ananda Sen: But in this case, what we did was to.

908
02:31:28,860 --> 02:31:46,590
Ananda Sen: Have program as a certain reference set up to his academic actually and says and for sex it's references one and i'm using the democratization of a difference which is similar to glm basically okay.

909
02:31:46,590 --> 02:31:52,680
Ananda Sen: So a couple of things, so the model statement looks very it's very similar.

910
02:31:52,680 --> 02:31:58,800
Ananda Sen: But the link function looks something very different we haven't used this before.

911
02:31:58,800 --> 02:32:23,670
Ananda Sen: it's called G logic which is generalized logic, why do I need that look at program program is a three category variable it's no longer dichotomous no longer yes, no, no number one zero is 123 so how many comparisons are possible one versus two one verses three and two verses three.

912
02:32:23,670 --> 02:32:30,240
Ananda Sen: Okay, so there are three comparisons possible.

913
02:32:30,240 --> 02:32:36,660
Ananda Sen: Now, the way it works is it gives you.

914
02:32:36,660 --> 02:32:50,460
Ananda Sen: The comparison to comparisons based with regards to one reference, if you want the other comparison just changed the reference category and that will give you the other competitor that's that's typically the easiest trick.

915
02:32:50,460 --> 02:32:53,610
Ananda Sen: which will will let you do that.

916
02:32:53,610 --> 02:33:04,590
Ananda Sen: But the important thing to remember is that there are more than two categories, so you need something to tell logistic that i'm running a.

917
02:33:04,590 --> 02:33:13,440
Ananda Sen: multivariate logistic regression model or a month, a normal, which is the right term logistic regression model.

918
02:33:13,440 --> 02:33:22,530
Ananda Sen: And that's the way to say that word way to tell that to logistic is to through the link function goog.

919
02:33:22,530 --> 02:33:27,660
Ananda Sen: It produced all the things which you see on the right initial.

920
02:33:27,660 --> 02:33:38,580
Ananda Sen: So there is something called model fits statistics so so the left hand side of the model fits statistics is is intercept only and that's the right hand side is interception covariance so.

921
02:33:38,580 --> 02:33:56,580
Ananda Sen: If I added the covariance does the Ai see decrease of course it does does the negative to log likelihood or the or the log likelihood increases, yes, it does and negative decreases either way um so.

922
02:33:56,580 --> 02:34:02,250
Ananda Sen: Testing global null hypothesis should give you.

923
02:34:02,250 --> 02:34:22,470
Ananda Sen: I significance, but notice something here the degrees of freedom is six, why is it six because, again, think of it this way, there are two covariance that's too, but there are three programs.

924
02:34:22,470 --> 02:34:25,650
Ananda Sen: Sorry, I said that wrong.

925
02:34:25,650 --> 02:34:29,070
Ananda Sen: So one core very it for right.

926
02:34:29,070 --> 02:34:44,520
Ananda Sen: sex is dual core covariance because it's a three category variable so three two plus one is three and it's doing to comparisons so three plus three six, that is why we get six degrees of freedom.

927
02:34:44,520 --> 02:34:46,110
Ananda Sen: Okay.

928
02:34:46,110 --> 02:34:53,520
Ananda Sen: When we do type three analysis of effects which is just looking at.

929
02:34:53,520 --> 02:35:08,190
Ananda Sen: Looking at ACS and right remember again right is a single continuous variable, but we are doing to comparison that's why we get to ACS to comparisons or sorry two.

930
02:35:08,190 --> 02:35:16,710
Ananda Sen: categories or three categories so two degrees of freedom, but again we're doing to comparison so for that's how it's played out.

931
02:35:16,710 --> 02:35:18,360
Okay.

932
02:35:18,360 --> 02:35:31,710
Ananda Sen: Overall likelihood ratio test is has a P value of less than 0.0001 and there are two separate models which are tested in the Multi normal regression.

933
02:35:31,710 --> 02:35:47,250
Ananda Sen: Everything is happening in the background, the only thing which you need to do is to set it up as a generalized legit and and remember that you will only do that if there are more than two categories.

934
02:35:47,250 --> 02:36:08,550
Ananda Sen: How did the parameter and odds ratio estimates look like again look there are there are there is a clear distinction so ACS two verses one, it appears twice why because one is for program one the other one is for program three with a program to go program to the reference.

935
02:36:08,550 --> 02:36:13,620
Ananda Sen: Is it's like it's like a running do simultaneous models.

936
02:36:13,620 --> 02:36:20,640
Ananda Sen: it's like running two simultaneous models, one is one versus two one is two verses three.

937
02:36:20,640 --> 02:36:24,810
Ananda Sen: And all those odds ratios are.

938
02:36:24,810 --> 02:36:28,290
Ananda Sen: doing exactly that.

939
02:36:28,290 --> 02:36:48,690
Ananda Sen: it's like whatever we did once before we're not doing twice, and the reason we're doing twice is because there are three categories of the outcome, so we are doing two comparisons if there were four categories of the outcome we would have done three comparisons.

940
02:36:48,690 --> 02:36:52,230
Ananda Sen: And that's all the things we have.

941
02:36:52,230 --> 02:36:55,410
Ananda Sen: Written here.

942
02:36:55,410 --> 02:36:57,690
Ananda Sen: Are are.

943
02:36:57,690 --> 02:36:59,700
Ananda Sen: effectively.

944
02:36:59,700 --> 02:37:13,710
Ananda Sen: Showing within one unit increase in the variable rate associated with a point 0505 a decrease in the relative log odds of being in general program versus academic program so that is the first one, the first.

945
02:37:13,710 --> 02:37:18,030
Ananda Sen: point is to be the next one would be sorry.

946
02:37:18,030 --> 02:37:22,620
Ananda Sen: First point estimate is that.

947
02:37:22,620 --> 02:37:31,080
Wine 05 a decrease in loved ones.

948
02:37:31,080 --> 02:37:44,670
Ananda Sen: Oh sorry nevermind this is this looking here, and the next one is point one one for to decrease in relative log what's between comparing program three to program to which is.

949
02:37:44,670 --> 02:37:46,740
Ananda Sen: Essentially.

950
02:37:46,740 --> 02:37:52,020
Ananda Sen: vocation program versus academic Program.

951
02:37:52,020 --> 02:37:57,840
Ananda Sen: ACS same way, either you go from.

952
02:37:57,840 --> 02:38:07,080
Ananda Sen: ACS going from one to so so so remember.

953
02:38:07,080 --> 02:38:23,160
Ananda Sen: So, so this is, this is an interesting way of saying that the relative log odds of being in general programmers in academic program will decrease by 1.163 if you move from the lowest level of ACS to the highest level of vcs so from one to three.

954
02:38:23,160 --> 02:38:31,260
Ananda Sen: And how do we know that because, in our case ACS reference was one.

955
02:38:31,260 --> 02:38:33,630
Ananda Sen: yeah one is missing.

956
02:38:33,630 --> 02:38:45,720
Ananda Sen: So 123 there is a there is a change you change.

957
02:38:45,720 --> 02:38:49,440
yeah.

958
02:38:49,440 --> 02:39:00,090
Ananda Sen: So it is basically and i've listed all of those effects it's basically.

959
02:39:00,090 --> 02:39:03,180
Ananda Sen: Two separate.

960
02:39:03,180 --> 02:39:07,110
Ananda Sen: logistic regression.

961
02:39:07,110 --> 02:39:15,330
Ananda Sen: And the two separate logistic regression compare and think of think of this, there are three programs right it compares.

962
02:39:15,330 --> 02:39:25,080
Ananda Sen: program one to program three or vocational to academic then also general to academic.

963
02:39:25,080 --> 02:39:34,320
Ananda Sen: Vocational to general is not presented here that you can make it present by changing the reference like I said.

964
02:39:34,320 --> 02:39:44,550
Ananda Sen: But that's the story the instead of one single regression, you will have multiple regression so that's that's the reason we.

965
02:39:44,550 --> 02:39:55,320
Ananda Sen: are calling in Monterey normal now can we do it separately, yes, we can do it separately, we can just ignore the third program and just do one one compared to one computing to stew.

966
02:39:55,320 --> 02:40:06,300
Ananda Sen: Or we can ignore one and compare two to three, and so on and so forth, you can do that, but what happens that when you are you're deleting data if you're deleting data, you are actually.

967
02:40:06,300 --> 02:40:22,170
Ananda Sen: Making it lot less efficient.

968
02:40:22,170 --> 02:40:29,280
Ananda Sen: The one thing to remember is that, even if it is a multi normal regression.

969
02:40:29,280 --> 02:40:35,640
Ananda Sen: You are still doing binary comparisons.

970
02:40:35,640 --> 02:40:40,920
Ananda Sen: Generally program versus academic program and so on and so forth.

971
02:40:40,920 --> 02:40:42,930
Ananda Sen: However.

972
02:40:42,930 --> 02:40:58,530
Ananda Sen: However, you are going to do this twice, once dinner program academic program the other one is vocational program that program, so there are there are two simultaneous things going on at the same time.

973
02:40:58,530 --> 02:41:04,590
Ananda Sen: There is a significant deviation from this.

974
02:41:04,590 --> 02:41:08,760
Ananda Sen: Which is called this is called Martin o'malley radiation.

975
02:41:08,760 --> 02:41:14,520
Ananda Sen: But there is another one which is called ordinary what is ordinary regression.

976
02:41:14,520 --> 02:41:18,030
Ananda Sen: The classic example is.

977
02:41:18,030 --> 02:41:20,430
Ananda Sen: You are doing a.

978
02:41:20,430 --> 02:41:22,680
Ananda Sen: You are doing.

979
02:41:22,680 --> 02:41:34,230
Ananda Sen: wine tasting tasting or and and you're given a score sheet, where there are four categories, these are all in order.

980
02:41:34,230 --> 02:41:48,570
Ananda Sen: Like excellent poor or excellent good average for something like that now that's a categorical variable but that's that is a direct order, there is a very.

981
02:41:48,570 --> 02:42:06,180
Ananda Sen: Strict order, you know that excellent is higher in in quality, then then good or bad quality and then poor our average right.

982
02:42:06,180 --> 02:42:09,900
Ananda Sen: All of those.

983
02:42:09,900 --> 02:42:11,400
Ananda Sen: So.

984
02:42:11,400 --> 02:42:21,660
Ananda Sen: Can you use that ordering to come up with a better model for something like this, which is more than two categories.

985
02:42:21,660 --> 02:42:26,790
Ananda Sen: That is called ordinary regression and ordinary logistic regression is another type of.

986
02:42:26,790 --> 02:42:43,980
Ananda Sen: multivariate logistic regression which which are not going to talk about here, it does, I have given him some sprinkles of it in the in the lecture session but, but not a normal is easier to understand and so, so I think.

987
02:42:43,980 --> 02:42:51,120
Ananda Sen: And I also frankly speaking, if you have an automated regression scenario and You ran a multi family regression it's not wrong.

988
02:42:51,120 --> 02:42:54,570
Ananda Sen: it's probably not as efficient, but it can still run it.

989
02:42:54,570 --> 02:43:01,830
Ananda Sen: is not going to be an entirely wrong thing to do so, so I think I think.

990
02:43:01,830 --> 02:43:06,240
Ananda Sen: Modern normally regression is one additional step.

991
02:43:06,240 --> 02:43:18,210
Ananda Sen: From what you did before you see the only thing you really have to do is to change the link function and parameter parameter ization to parameter graph is more of a choice, though.

992
02:43:18,210 --> 02:43:39,630
Ananda Sen: But, but other than that it's the same proper logistical us so it's a very little change but, but making by making the change you're getting a lot more out of this out of this bro.

993
02:43:39,630 --> 02:43:43,230
Ananda Sen: So I thought I would just give you that.

994
02:43:43,230 --> 02:43:45,060
Ananda Sen: sort of like.

995
02:43:45,060 --> 02:43:56,100
Ananda Sen: idea and and, by the way this is this code is also included so so you can you can actually play with that.

996
02:43:56,100 --> 02:44:02,220
Ananda Sen: With this data set you can play with it and and try up different things.

997
02:44:02,220 --> 02:44:12,660
Ananda Sen: As I said before, anytime you have some questions about this is something which we will learn all the time, there is a specific way.

998
02:44:12,660 --> 02:44:19,980
Ananda Sen: Jen mom does things, there is a specific way proc but just take this thing.

999
02:44:19,980 --> 02:44:22,980
Ananda Sen: And sometimes there are some specific.

1000
02:44:22,980 --> 02:44:30,300
Ananda Sen: Things you want to do in proper logistic but you cannot do it fully because there are certain things you're not getting it directly.

1001
02:44:30,300 --> 02:44:49,320
Ananda Sen: I what I do in this post is yeah just Google it and find out that there are some maybe some trickier ways of doing things the same way, I want in property just that sort of thing is always there, but this would this should give you a stock.

1002
02:44:49,320 --> 02:45:07,320
Ananda Sen: Any questions.

1003
02:45:07,320 --> 02:45:11,190
Ananda Sen: So what did we learn in this five days.

1004
02:45:11,190 --> 02:45:16,710
Ananda Sen: it's all about regression.

1005
02:45:16,710 --> 02:45:19,290
Ananda Sen: And regression.

1006
02:45:19,290 --> 02:45:24,600
Ananda Sen: is basically the same for.

1007
02:45:24,600 --> 02:45:30,120
Ananda Sen: All types of models, so the idea is.

1008
02:45:30,120 --> 02:45:44,340
Ananda Sen: You have an outcome, whether it's directly observable outcome or probability of outcome or average of an outcome it doesn't doesn't matter but it's it's some kind of objective function.

1009
02:45:44,340 --> 02:45:47,070
Ananda Sen: which has.

1010
02:45:47,070 --> 02:45:51,750
Ananda Sen: which you try to predict as a function of.

1011
02:45:51,750 --> 02:45:55,020
Ananda Sen: Various concomitant.

1012
02:45:55,020 --> 02:46:07,320
Ananda Sen: observations are concrete jungle covariance and why do you do that well, you have to do that, whenever that's exactly what you're supposed to do, because otherwise there will be no research ever.

1013
02:46:07,320 --> 02:46:09,600
Ananda Sen: Unless you want to.

1014
02:46:09,600 --> 02:46:30,330
Ananda Sen: investigate if there is any reason for this particular variable to be associated or is it really a variable which is associated with the outcome, unless you cannot ask that question, then the research stops.

1015
02:46:30,330 --> 02:46:39,270
Ananda Sen: Even so many different questions had been raised during the past year about go with patients.

1016
02:46:39,270 --> 02:46:54,030
Ananda Sen: Things like when the Corbett patients predict protected if they took aspirin, for example, these are real questions work with patients.

1017
02:46:54,030 --> 02:47:00,870
Ananda Sen: Have a certain race or age more productive than the others.

1018
02:47:00,870 --> 02:47:02,670
Things like.

1019
02:47:02,670 --> 02:47:06,000
Ananda Sen: You always asked questions.

1020
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:10,440
Ananda Sen: Which are the research questions.

1021
02:47:10,440 --> 02:47:16,140
Ananda Sen: So for any such research question regression is the basic model.

1022
02:47:16,140 --> 02:47:27,660
Ananda Sen: You cannot get away from regression, for I mean unless unless you're doing a simple descriptive statistics which really people do justice.

1023
02:47:27,660 --> 02:47:29,430
Ananda Sen: So.

1024
02:47:29,430 --> 02:47:31,380
Ananda Sen: So regression.

1025
02:47:31,380 --> 02:47:35,040
Ananda Sen: We have done three types of regression.

1026
02:47:35,040 --> 02:47:41,640
Ananda Sen: One is.

1027
02:47:41,640 --> 02:47:51,780
Ananda Sen: So three types of regression one is linear regression, the other one is the dichotomous regression or.

1028
02:47:51,780 --> 02:48:01,920
Ananda Sen: Buying an integration and the third one is contribution, these are the three types of these are all part of what is called generalized linear model.

1029
02:48:01,920 --> 02:48:12,480
Ananda Sen: The first one is actually linear so that's a special case of generalizing here anyway, and the other two are extended linear so that's why we call them generalized.

1030
02:48:12,480 --> 02:48:15,030
Ananda Sen: um.

1031
02:48:15,030 --> 02:48:34,380
Ananda Sen: Again, what changed, and what are the same, one of the things that are the same, are the basic qualitative things you get out of the regression, you ask the question is it positively associated with negativity associated If so, how much.

1032
02:48:34,380 --> 02:48:41,820
Ananda Sen: I think oftentimes in a sadistic statistics course we get bogged down by the actual numbers and figures and so on and so forth.

1033
02:48:41,820 --> 02:48:53,340
Ananda Sen: I would argue, not not not in this class, because I think their main main take home from here should be how to look at an output and interpret the data.

1034
02:48:53,340 --> 02:49:06,870
Ananda Sen: or run simple models like logistic or our linear regression, or maybe a post on regression things like those don't have to be too fancy just just just run the basic ones.

1035
02:49:06,870 --> 02:49:18,450
Ananda Sen: And that that will give you a fee when you read a report, when you read the paper you see an estimate like audrey shoe you know exactly what it's talking about.

1036
02:49:18,450 --> 02:49:34,410
Ananda Sen: Things like those you know I mean I I don't I don't think if you're trying to get and i'm pretty sure that's probably not why you're here you're trying to get how this is calculated using maximum likely this, and this is not the class.

1037
02:49:34,410 --> 02:49:43,860
Ananda Sen: that's not the class for that for that we have a semester long class we have actually and you have them, we have a categorical data analysis class which is full semester class and.

1038
02:49:43,860 --> 02:49:56,700
Ananda Sen: it's it's a great class but but it's for a different audience it's for a different purpose this class I would be really happy if you get out of this class the idea.

1039
02:49:56,700 --> 02:50:03,840
Ananda Sen: The interpretation, the ability to read an output and say that this is what it means.

1040
02:50:03,840 --> 02:50:14,220
Ananda Sen: and often again, and this is something I had been talking to christy over the last few days on various things, one of the difficulties and challenges here is that.

1041
02:50:14,220 --> 02:50:23,700
Ananda Sen: Different software's have different different ways of reporting things you'll never find on a software, it says, this is exactly what it means.

1042
02:50:23,700 --> 02:50:38,730
Ananda Sen: it's it's all it's like it's like learning a language right French has a syntax German has a syntax English has a syntax my my own Indian languages have specific syntax is once you know that you know what it means.

1043
02:50:38,730 --> 02:50:50,100
Ananda Sen: So it's it's it's about that knowledge it's about understanding what that what that what is the grammar behind behind that particular way of reporting.

1044
02:50:50,100 --> 02:50:51,540
Ananda Sen: So.

1045
02:50:51,540 --> 02:51:02,340
Ananda Sen: So that's what you want that's what you want to get from this from this course, like a it's a five day course it's 15 hours and it's.

1046
02:51:02,340 --> 02:51:06,240
Ananda Sen: It is not enough for even talking about one topic.

1047
02:51:06,240 --> 02:51:10,980
Ananda Sen: let alone, three or four different topics or five different topics.

1048
02:51:10,980 --> 02:51:14,580
Ananda Sen: So from that respect, I think you you.

1049
02:51:14,580 --> 02:51:22,740
Ananda Sen: You have to take this course in that spirit in that in that flavor that this is what this is what I want them to know.

1050
02:51:22,740 --> 02:51:30,180
Ananda Sen: And again, as I said, and I, and I have had people who have sent me email later.

1051
02:51:30,180 --> 02:51:32,910
Ananda Sen: I just add your fam.

1052
02:51:32,910 --> 02:51:36,660
Ananda Sen: My dot last year.

1053
02:51:36,660 --> 02:51:42,930
Ananda Sen: Beijing for something bayesian, this is a little different audience and.

1054
02:51:42,930 --> 02:51:50,520
Ananda Sen: Students are still asking the students they're actually working full time as analysts they're still asking me questions so.

1055
02:51:50,520 --> 02:52:03,000
Ananda Sen: So learning never stops it's just it just happens as you and many times you you learn at the job you know you're doing something in a very specific way and.

1056
02:52:03,000 --> 02:52:17,190
Ananda Sen: And, and you realize you go to a pharmaceutical industry in six months you'll be completely conversant with the language there what you do for bio equivalence equivalent Stan what you do for.

1057
02:52:17,190 --> 02:52:28,650
Ananda Sen: What are the ways to handle you know certain type of protocols in a phase one clinical trial and and that sort of stuff you just get used to that you just.

1058
02:52:28,650 --> 02:52:40,050
Ananda Sen: Do it over and over and over and over again, I, I have some analysts I have worked with who are working at that there is a there is a kidney.

1059
02:52:40,050 --> 02:52:46,080
Ananda Sen: kidney epidemiologic cost Center gay kick at boasted and some of you may have heard of it.

1060
02:52:46,080 --> 02:52:54,480
Ananda Sen: They have analysts who who known wanted so fast, I have no idea, but then they but that's the trigger that that's what they learn that's what they learn they.

1061
02:52:54,480 --> 02:53:08,790
Ananda Sen: Go 2000 lines of codes and figure out that this is, this is the best way is the quickest way of managing the data in this in this falling fashion, I have never learned items I can, if I were doing a job, like that, then I would have learned it but.

1062
02:53:08,790 --> 02:53:20,940
Ananda Sen: So you know it's it's all there is it's a function of what you learn in a course and and like like I was saying before if you if you when I.

1063
02:53:20,940 --> 02:53:27,600
Ananda Sen: When I was a graduate student in Wisconsin I actually came from India directly to Wisconsin Madison.

1064
02:53:27,600 --> 02:53:43,260
Ananda Sen: My third year of my PhD so at 40 I can't remember now I had to take a course, and I was, I was done with all my coursework so I took French I always wonder, I was always liked taking a language.

1065
02:53:43,260 --> 02:53:57,210
Ananda Sen: Nice, I actually enjoyed the class a lot and I was so basic class, so it was not getting us ready to read novels or anything like that, but just getting the grammar out and some of the words and stuff.

1066
02:53:57,210 --> 02:54:00,480
Ananda Sen: i've never used it since I forgot.

1067
02:54:00,480 --> 02:54:10,440
Ananda Sen: it's like that it's you you learn this today and instead old Professor saying is a great teacher he taught us so many things.

1068
02:54:10,440 --> 02:54:15,930
Ananda Sen: Then next two years you don't use this.

1069
02:54:15,930 --> 02:54:20,430
Ananda Sen: you're not gonna you're not gonna retain this, there is no way.

1070
02:54:20,430 --> 02:54:24,990
Ananda Sen: So yeah so it all depends on any it's nothing wrong.

1071
02:54:24,990 --> 02:54:34,200
Ananda Sen: Nothing right nothing wrong it's just just happened to it's a good idea to get this knowledge, because at some point, you may need it.

1072
02:54:34,200 --> 02:54:47,190
Ananda Sen: But what is, what is more important, and this is why I tell all my students and i've been you can probably say they talk a lot and I like teaching I have been teaching from 1993.

1073
02:54:47,190 --> 02:54:53,640
Ananda Sen: The thing I tell the students to take away from this is the principal.

1074
02:54:53,640 --> 02:54:58,020
Ananda Sen: Not the actual methodology, because actually you may or may not use.

1075
02:54:58,020 --> 02:55:09,780
Ananda Sen: But the principle is the principle behind behind regression, why do you want to do a regression, if you fit a model, why did, why is it important to do a goodness of fit.

1076
02:55:09,780 --> 02:55:14,580
Ananda Sen: Because without fitting anything you have no idea validation.

1077
02:55:14,580 --> 02:55:17,100
Ananda Sen: that's true, no matter what.

1078
02:55:17,100 --> 02:55:25,350
Ananda Sen: that's any universal truth it doesn't matter what mouse model you're feeling, or what model you're you're you're using those are the principles which you should.

1079
02:55:25,350 --> 02:55:42,750
Ananda Sen: You should learn and then again we talked about some residual plots and stuff like that, but why residual I mean that's the leftover stuff right, so you need to you need to figure out what the leftover stuff is has anything left over that concept works for everything.

1080
02:55:42,750 --> 02:55:57,540
Ananda Sen: concept works for everything so so yeah I mean, I think I think I think that's the idea I mean that's that's the whole point of a short course like this, like four or five day course you get you get a flavor you get some ideas you get some.

1081
02:55:57,540 --> 02:56:02,040
Ananda Sen: pointers and that's.

1082
02:56:02,040 --> 02:56:12,270
Ananda Sen: Okay, so um yeah no I I really enjoyed having you because I I like I like courses like this, I mean I do, I obviously do teacher presented by status, can I do teach.

1083
02:56:12,270 --> 02:56:25,470
Ananda Sen: Vice versa graduate classes, but I also teach this type of course a lot, I mean I do teaching Medical School I teach here at technician or For those of you who are here who know about Michelle.

1084
02:56:25,470 --> 02:56:31,980
Ananda Sen: That that the reason I like this is because.

1085
02:56:31,980 --> 02:56:55,560
Ananda Sen: Because audience, like you, are clinicians can bring in perspective which an academic by extension would not think of and that perspective opens up some practical ways of viewing things and that's that's always I think that's that's where statistics is is at, especially now.

1086
02:56:55,560 --> 02:57:05,790
Ananda Sen: it's it's the it's it's in the Sea of beta it's a lot of data now and how to make sense, out of days, what you.

1087
02:57:05,790 --> 02:57:09,930
Ananda Sen: What we're all struggling with what what we're all.

1088
02:57:09,930 --> 02:57:13,740
finding out so.

1089
02:57:13,740 --> 02:57:17,850
Ananda Sen: So very good so comments questions.

1090
02:57:17,850 --> 02:57:38,130
Ananda Sen: Some things so one thing I wanted to ask you this so i'm going to talk with Eduardo Villa more, who is the person who is organized organized he's the Faculty who is kind of behind everything you you haven't I don't know if you haven't met my I don't know if he's teaching anything but.

1091
02:57:38,130 --> 02:57:50,100
Ananda Sen: he's the he's the he's the Faculty behind it, I mean most of the legwork is done by administrators God, you have talked to Dan Maria you have talked to.

1092
02:57:50,100 --> 02:57:54,210
Ananda Sen: josh is here, helping out um.

1093
02:57:54,210 --> 02:57:58,380
Ananda Sen: But, but I will talk to Eduardo about.

1094
02:57:58,380 --> 02:58:07,560
Ananda Sen: Generally, about the course my feeling and the feedback so tell me a few things which.

1095
02:58:07,560 --> 02:58:10,500
Ananda Sen: You think.

1096
02:58:10,500 --> 02:58:17,640
Ananda Sen: We should think of doing.

1097
02:58:17,640 --> 02:58:21,450
Ananda Sen: differently.

1098
02:58:21,450 --> 02:58:31,320
Ananda Sen: I mean, given that we are not going to be able to extend the course so so it's like five day course every day three and a half hours that that that that.

1099
02:58:31,320 --> 02:58:43,950
Ananda Sen: is probably going to be there, I don't think this this course should or need to needs to go beyond five five days, partly because, beyond five days, you have to get into stuff.

1100
02:58:43,950 --> 02:58:45,690
Where.

1101
02:58:45,690 --> 02:58:54,210
Ananda Sen: You will be stuck halfway will be stuck halfway, I mean I wouldn't be able to teach the whole thing, but I will have to start this because, otherwise, what will I do.

1102
02:58:54,210 --> 02:59:00,450
Ananda Sen: More than five years so so given that it will be a five day course in that in this structure.

1103
02:59:00,450 --> 02:59:06,930
Ananda Sen: What are the things we should do.

1104
02:59:06,930 --> 02:59:15,330
Christie Flanagan: So I would, I would just share that I think if I having all the homework assignments available at the beginning of the course would have been really helpful.

1105
02:59:15,330 --> 02:59:23,820
Christie Flanagan: Just because I think, looking at the questions and then learning the content in class that I can at least for me personally it kind of helped me put a little bit more together.

1106
02:59:23,820 --> 02:59:33,330
Christie Flanagan: and feel a little bit less like huh when I got to the homework questions of, and then the other thing is because I am not familiar with SAS.

1107
02:59:33,330 --> 02:59:46,470
Christie Flanagan: I think that the data codes that you gave us we're really wonderful, but there were a couple times, where I think I when I worked with you, I needed a lot of direction on how to actually fill out a.

1108
02:59:46,470 --> 02:59:55,950
Christie Flanagan: code and I wondered if, maybe even just some simple like definitions of what means what and like what by my estimate is there, why.

1109
02:59:55,950 --> 03:00:07,140
Christie Flanagan: What this point because initially when you went in and saying oh you do the proper logistic I was like okay well, what does that but in it, it came together pretty fast like it's to run a logistic regression.

1110
03:00:07,140 --> 03:00:12,960
Christie Flanagan: But initially I was like I don't know what that means so even just some minor definitions might be helpful.

1111
03:00:12,960 --> 03:00:14,280
Ananda Sen: So let me.

1112
03:00:14,280 --> 03:00:26,640
Ananda Sen: point out something along the lines you see Christine This is something I think I actually have wondered about so i'm.

1113
03:00:26,640 --> 03:00:28,320
Ananda Sen: In.

1114
03:00:28,320 --> 03:00:33,030
Ananda Sen: episode in our iPad Program.

1115
03:00:33,030 --> 03:00:45,570
Ananda Sen: There is a SAS class so it's just a SAS class and i'm pretty sure josh is familiar with that it's a it's a SAS course which which goes over.

1116
03:00:45,570 --> 03:00:56,520
Ananda Sen: Some of the basics of SAS like data management data stamps and little proxy and they're probably means probably Brock university problem is that sort of stuff.

1117
03:00:56,520 --> 03:00:58,650
Ananda Sen: um.

1118
03:00:58,650 --> 03:01:05,910
Ananda Sen: Would it be helpful in asking people to take a course like that.

1119
03:01:05,910 --> 03:01:19,320
Ananda Sen: yeah if it's 640 right so, is it is it something which will be helpful because that I thought, even last year, when I was, I was teaching it for the first time last year, this particular sse.

1120
03:01:19,320 --> 03:01:27,600
Ananda Sen: I was thinking that that is m surprised that that people are not asked to take a course like that, especially if SAS is being used for.

1121
03:01:27,600 --> 03:01:42,510
Christie Flanagan: me, I think that would have been very helpful to have had it wasn't a requirement to be a prerequisite, having gone through the five day course now and going through the homework assignment, I think it would have been very helpful to have that background knowledge okay.

1122
03:01:42,510 --> 03:01:43,650
Ananda Sen: So.

1123
03:01:43,650 --> 03:01:55,740
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: yeah I took that class actually episode 640 and I have my notes right next to me because I was like I need these lecture notes and I will say it definitely was super helpful because you know.

1124
03:01:55,740 --> 03:02:08,970
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: Understanding like how to get your data in changing the variables like even the basic stuff I hadn't touched it in a long time, but you'd like you said you lose it but it's kind of like riding a bike like kind of getting back into it.

1125
03:02:08,970 --> 03:02:12,390
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: Definitely helpful, I would say, for me.

1126
03:02:12,390 --> 03:02:16,200
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: kind of like piggybacking off of what Christine was saying.

1127
03:02:16,200 --> 03:02:28,710
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: I don't know how possible, it would be, but like doing more of like exercises like UK us actually going into the code like I would when you were doing and I would try to bring it up and kind of go through it as well.

1128
03:02:28,710 --> 03:02:45,810
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: And I know that virtually it's challenging and it probably will not be virtual in the future, I was thinking you know, maybe with breakout rooms with like you know me and someone I like paired coding, you know or whatever, or if we were in person and allow I don't know just.

1129
03:02:45,810 --> 03:03:02,280
Ananda Sen: Things yeah I think I think it's a great idea, in fact I I when last year, when I was asked to teach this course at that point, they were still painting, whether they would want to do it in person, but it was too risky, so we didn't do it.

1130
03:03:02,280 --> 03:03:06,180
Ananda Sen: This year, might have done that but, but still.

1131
03:03:06,180 --> 03:03:11,550
Ananda Sen: But I think you're absolutely writers, I think, doing it.

1132
03:03:11,550 --> 03:03:14,790
Ananda Sen: In a lab would be so much more helpful.

1133
03:03:14,790 --> 03:03:16,290
Ananda Sen: In this case.

1134
03:03:16,290 --> 03:03:25,410
Ananda Sen: I was not even sure whether whether everybody had access to SAS did you finally get an access to set Zara.

1135
03:03:25,410 --> 03:03:27,420
zahraa: yeah yeah at work.

1136
03:03:27,420 --> 03:03:28,350
Ananda Sen: Okay tomorrow.

1137
03:03:28,350 --> 03:03:33,210
zahraa: This is and and what they said is really important, because when I was going back.

1138
03:03:33,210 --> 03:03:40,860
zahraa: To sales and trying to like apply what I was trying to do with on daily basis, it was difficult for me because.

1139
03:03:40,860 --> 03:03:46,980
zahraa: Like the basics of the i'm not familiar with SAS I know nothing about SAS So if I knew like.

1140
03:03:46,980 --> 03:04:04,140
zahraa: That the course was given I would have definitely taken it before taking this course, because then it would have been more fruitful, for me, in terms of SAS not in terms of the like the theory behind everything but applying things into SAS was was really difficult for me.

1141
03:04:04,140 --> 03:04:15,120
Ananda Sen: No, I understand that and I appreciate that because, but let me ask you one things around what what software, do you use if you use at your place.

1142
03:04:15,120 --> 03:04:25,590
zahraa: spss so what I was trying to do, like, for example, docker I tried like to go to spss and see how it's like just try to be to be able.

1143
03:04:25,590 --> 03:04:43,980
zahraa: To to benefit from what I was taking in the course applying into spss because i'm really not familiar with that I tried, as much as possible, but like I need a basic course which has I don't know if the question was is given already or not not.

1144
03:04:43,980 --> 03:04:46,620
Ananda Sen: Maybe I don't I don't I.

1145
03:04:46,620 --> 03:04:49,020
haven't seen any like.

1146
03:04:49,020 --> 03:04:56,790
Ananda Sen: Maybe maybe that is maybe that is one of the things which we should do for sse also just having a parallel SAS course.

1147
03:04:56,790 --> 03:05:06,660
Ananda Sen: yeah one one thing I want to point out, I have used as the spss for a long time, because many of my colleagues were using.

1148
03:05:06,660 --> 03:05:12,360
Ananda Sen: spss soon became after a while became difficult to use in the sense that.

1149
03:05:12,360 --> 03:05:22,980
Ananda Sen: With the moment you go beyond basics, that there was there was problem, especially things like for them properly propensity score matching control case control study and things like those.

1150
03:05:22,980 --> 03:05:32,400
Ananda Sen: And, and so I wanted to have something which can do the basics, but can also do some of the more advanced stuff.

1151
03:05:32,400 --> 03:05:34,080
Ananda Sen: If needed.

1152
03:05:34,080 --> 03:05:44,970
Ananda Sen: But I but I completely agree with you that that that's one of the challenges I mean my previous instructor actually who taught this course use data.

1153
03:05:44,970 --> 03:05:51,150
Ananda Sen: I don't think with that would have helped in this group, would it do to do anything stater.

1154
03:05:51,150 --> 03:06:10,500
Ananda Sen: No see that's the thing my my experiences either people use SAS or our our use something else, like like you're using spss so state of if they almost always never use so but all these are all good points, other other comments are the points.

1155
03:06:10,500 --> 03:06:22,140
Yoonhee Ryder: yeah I think if we could suggest to the course directors like you were saying to have an intro to SAS class that would be available for the summer sessions, I think that'd be great because I know.

1156
03:06:22,140 --> 03:06:30,600
Yoonhee Ryder: we're all coming from like different places and different points in our careers, and so it might be hard for us to like take a full semester class in it.

1157
03:06:30,600 --> 03:06:39,450
Yoonhee Ryder: At Michigan but if there's just something like quick one week intro and then take this class the next week or something like that that'd be really cool.

1158
03:06:39,450 --> 03:06:55,980
Ananda Sen: I think a software oriented plus can be done, that that shouldn't be a problem at all, I mean you can do a lot of software in a week so um and that would, by definition, would be something in a lab because.

1159
03:06:55,980 --> 03:07:00,480
Yoonhee Ryder: Alright, other comments.

1160
03:07:00,480 --> 03:07:04,740
Ananda Sen: But I enjoy being me being here with you, I really liked.

1161
03:07:04,740 --> 03:07:07,500
Ananda Sen: Like talking to you and.

1162
03:07:07,500 --> 03:07:13,800
Ananda Sen: And this, this time with Ryan, this is, this is a really international.

1163
03:07:13,800 --> 03:07:18,720
Ananda Sen: Class I last year, I had everybody from us.

1164
03:07:18,720 --> 03:07:24,960
But this is quite nice okay.

1165
03:07:24,960 --> 03:07:44,100
Ananda Sen: Any other comments questions my co do fill out the course evaluation form that's the program evaluation for course evaluation, if you have already done it great If not you can just do that and that'll be great, and now this is this is fantastic.

1166
03:07:44,100 --> 03:07:51,990
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: you've probably answered this already, but how long do we have access to the course on campus.

1167
03:07:51,990 --> 03:07:56,970
Ananda Sen: I believe josh informed us about two months, three months.

1168
03:07:56,970 --> 03:08:02,940
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: Okay, I just wanted to download your example code super helpful.

1169
03:08:02,940 --> 03:08:14,970
Joshua Bosman: yeah I guess I don't know for sure if it's the same for everybody, or every course, but my evidence was, I can still access stuff from my previous semester that ended in April so.

1170
03:08:14,970 --> 03:08:33,570
Ananda Sen: yeah I think I think, let me, let me make sure that's the case also here because regular semester courses are very different, because those are a lot more solid, in the sense that it's it's all your film students and then yeah so I i'll just say it once were but.

1171
03:08:33,570 --> 03:08:55,380
Ananda Sen: That said, anytime if you have finding if you if you find if you know one person who you can always ask which is me so so I can I can always email you things and and if you if you want, if five to do big, then I can even put it in dropbox or something like that it's not a problem.

1172
03:08:55,380 --> 03:08:59,010
Ananda Sen: So yeah.

1173
03:08:59,010 --> 03:09:02,370
Ananda Sen: So he had how're things there now.

1174
03:09:02,370 --> 03:09:04,080
Geehan Suleyman: Oh it's jihad.

1175
03:09:04,080 --> 03:09:05,070
Ananda Sen: Jihad okay.

1176
03:09:05,070 --> 03:09:15,480
Geehan Suleyman: yeah i'm rain slow down a little and we're just trying to move on patients around and it's rough okay yeah.

1177
03:09:15,480 --> 03:09:17,460
Ananda Sen: And how about your House.

1178
03:09:17,460 --> 03:09:23,610
Geehan Suleyman: i'm hoping it's stops leaking they're trying to divert the water from that area.

1179
03:09:23,610 --> 03:09:25,860
Ananda Sen: yeah yeah yeah yeah.

1180
03:09:25,860 --> 03:09:28,710
Ananda Sen: about power power it.

1181
03:09:28,710 --> 03:09:32,370
Geehan Suleyman: hasn't been an issue it's just some water.

1182
03:09:32,370 --> 03:09:37,320
Geehan Suleyman: My husband thinks we live in a swamp now.

1183
03:09:37,320 --> 03:09:39,780
Ananda Sen: yeah we have been there from day.

Ananda Sen: Alright, well, if there is nothing else, then Thank you so much for being a part of this, I really enjoyed teaching you and and good luck with everything you do so i'm sure i'll see some of your own and i'll probably be in touch with some of you later at some point.

1187
03:10:02,280 --> 03:10:04,380
Geehan Suleyman: Thank you so much best wishes yeah.

1188

1191
03:10:08,130 --> 03:10:09,810

1196
03:10:26,340 --> 03:10:37,740
Christie Flanagan: So, doctors, then the question that I had for the homework three was just for Item number two you're requesting that we use the file long 97 data dot SAS.

1197
03:10:37,740 --> 03:10:43,020
Christie Flanagan: For them, and for you asked that we.

1198
03:10:43,020 --> 03:10:52,620
Christie Flanagan: What does it Part A, that we do them like the means and all those things, so there isn't a there isn't already a code file for this data.

1199
03:10:52,620 --> 03:10:53,820
Christie Flanagan: Okay.

1200
03:10:53,820 --> 03:10:56,400
Christie Flanagan: Do I need to create one is that what.

1201
03:10:56,400 --> 03:10:59,760
Ananda Sen: yeah yeah, so this is a new data set right.

1202
03:10:59,760 --> 03:11:05,220
Ananda Sen: yep so good, because we haven't used it in class, so we don't have, that is, that is, that the one with.

1203
03:11:05,220 --> 03:11:08,280
Ananda Sen: The m.

1204
03:11:08,280 --> 03:11:09,990

Christie Flanagan: And yep that's an.

1206
03:11:11,160 --> 03:11:19,260
Ananda Sen: Article yeah okay okay yeah yeah yeah for that you will have to do that, but I would suggest just.

1207
03:11:19,260 --> 03:11:27,570
Ananda Sen: First, do a proper contents so okay so once you read the very first statement which we do is proc contents did a call to something.

1208
03:11:27,570 --> 03:11:32,490
Ananda Sen: And then run that'll tell you what are the variables there.

1209
03:11:32,490 --> 03:11:33,180
Christie Flanagan: Okay.

1210
03:11:33,180 --> 03:11:37,710
Ananda Sen: Once you know the variables and just use those variables, I mean, I think.

1211
03:11:37,710 --> 03:11:47,670
Ananda Sen: mentor is is like me amp T and stuff like that I, you know what I think some of those data were actually described.

1212
03:11:47,670 --> 03:11:49,470
Christie Flanagan: And why did.

1213
03:11:49,470 --> 03:11:59,640
Christie Flanagan: They actually are, so the yeah so like gender is then marital status is mar so you do have the variable names, I just wanted to.

1214
03:11:59,640 --> 03:12:01,680
Ananda Sen: confirm that there will ride ride ride.

1215
03:12:01,680 --> 03:12:03,900
Christie Flanagan: And code somewhere.

1216
03:12:03,900 --> 03:12:16,770
Christie Flanagan: No okay um The other thing is, I know that tomorrow will be the weekend, but I guarantee i'm going to have questions on this assignment after after reading through it and then listening to the lecture.

1217
03:12:16,770 --> 03:12:19,350
Ananda Sen: you send me miss yeah.

03:12:59,460 --> 03:13:07,980
Christie Flanagan: yeah yeah hey I have a lot of a lot of recommendations if you do come up this actually behind me this picture is harding ice field.

Christie Flanagan: Oh was here in Alaska.

1227
03:13:10,110 --> 03:13:20,760
Ananda Sen: Well yeah we took a we took a cruise ship from Vancouver and three I went through all these Juno and every everybody stopped for like.

1228
03:13:20,760 --> 03:13:23,040
Ananda Sen: Eight hours get down just.

1229
03:13:23,040 --> 03:13:29,220
Christie Flanagan: go down and yeah that's only enough time to see a little yeah there's a lot to do a lot to do.
