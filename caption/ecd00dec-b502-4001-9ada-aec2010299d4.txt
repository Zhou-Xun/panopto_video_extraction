1
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,400
Know. Okay.

2
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:16,320
Perfect. So as you can see, my screen and some of you may already know this,

3
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:25,300
we are one of the leading peer to peer engagement solutions for classes, whether that's for individualized assignments or group work.

4
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:32,650
We're really looking to put the students at the center of the learning process and make sure they feel fully engaged throughout the entire semester.

5
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,450
So this is the agenda for today's discussion. Not too crazy for anyone here.

6
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:43,050
We're going to talk about what is Kritik and then we're going to go into a demo and then we're going to do a Q&A.

7
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:50,690
As I as I just mentioned, what is Kritik online mostly for, you know,

8
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:57,900
homework based assignments in an asynchronous setting between classes, putting the students at the center of their learning.

9
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,350
Getting to the top of Bloom's taxonomy.

10
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:09,410
Really feeling like students are getting much more engaged in learning how to give and receive critical feedback throughout the entire semester,

11
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,790
and also how to learn how to grade accurately. That's what our system is all about.

12
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:18,920
Courtney, you want to quickly go over what we talked about with Bloom's taxonomy, if you don't mind.

13
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:27,540
Sure. Hi everyone. Again, Courtney I'm the instructional designer with Kritik and I work with onboarding all the professors who are new to Kritik

14
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:33,870
So as I mentioned, we borrow from Bloom's taxonomy when we're creating Kritik activities.

15
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:40,890
So students are engaging in higher order thinking and getting a deeper concept for this course materials.

16
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,700
So in the first stage of Kritik is the create stage.

17
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:52,410
So students are putting together something new. It could be a PowerPoint presentation, it could be an essay, but they're creating something.

18
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,259
Then in the second stage they evaluate.

19
00:01:55,260 --> 00:02:03,060
So this is where they are reviewing each other's work and they are thinking critically about the set of criteria that the professor provides.

20
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:13,020
And so they're able to compare their work to that of their peers and think about a score to assign each of their peers work in the third stage.

21
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:21,809
They are getting into analyzing. So they are reflecting on the written evaluations that they received from their peers and their rating,

22
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:27,420
how critical that was and how motivational, essentially how effective that peer feedback was.

23
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:32,460
So with Kritik, they're not just giving peer feedback and receiving it.

24
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,160
They're also taking that third step to go a bit deeper and to analyze the quality of that feedback.

25
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:46,370
Exactly. Thank you. Courtney. So to go back through what you just said, essentially these are the phases within Kritik

26
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:55,460
I want to note something here. We have something called calibration and that is where we essentially test the students on their ability to provide.

27
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:04,639
Accurate feedback and accurate evaluation. So you would submit a few example assignments into Kritik one really high quality example,

28
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,400
a medium quote example, and then maybe a lower quality example.

29
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:12,530
They're going to grade that assignment based on the same rubric that the professor has already graded it on,

30
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:15,710
and then they'll be assigned what's called a grading power score,

31
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:19,640
and that can change throughout the semester, depending on how accurately they're grading.

32
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,010
We can show you what that looks like in the actual app, but to move on to it essentially,

33
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:32,209
then given the OR you would work with us to create the activity then then moved into create, which we just mentioned,

34
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:37,430
evaluate where they're automatically assigned their anonymous peers to grade and then they move into feedback

35
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:42,530
where they receive that feedback from their peer and they rank it and if it was either motivational or critical.

36
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:50,060
And of course, the professor has the opportunity at the end of the actual assignment to change the grade,

37
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:53,570
reflect on the grades and and just kind of make sure everything went well.

38
00:03:54,620 --> 00:04:01,519
And just to add to what Cole was saying about calibration, this is some feedback that we'll hear from professors often.

39
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:06,049
The hesitation to do peer grading and peer assessment is the question of whether or not

40
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:10,640
your students have enough prior knowledge to be able to accurately grade their peers.

41
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:15,860
And so the calibration activity that Cole mentioned is a great way to set that up.

42
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:22,370
So you're able to reward your stronger evaluators and identify who are your beginner level evaluators,

43
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:26,930
and that really sets an even playing field right before their first Kritik activity.

44
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:30,650
And then again, as Cole mentioned, at the end of the peer review process,

45
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:38,960
you give your students that space to be able to give peer critique, even if it wasn't great, they're still learning from that.

46
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:42,950
And then at the end, you can spotlight really great evaluations.

47
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:51,170
You can privately comment one on one with some of the weaker evaluations, and then you can adjust your scores, which we call micro calibration.

48
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:56,270
So you're essentially telling Kritiks who should be your stronger evaluators and who shouldn't.

49
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:03,830
So all of that really saves you time grading, and it's like having a digital T.A. But I'll I'll let you continue that.

50
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:09,439
Thank you. So, yeah, that's essentially the end of what our slide presentation is going to be.

51
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:16,370
We're going to jump into a product demo as per the instructions from your team.

52
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:20,120
We're going to start off with the student perspective, and then we're going to slowly move through it.

53
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,540
If there's any questions or anything that's unclear, just let me know.

54
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:30,570
I need a ratio. I'm asking you this. I wouldn't see this.

55
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,300
Yes. Fantastic. Okay.

56
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:40,220
So from the student perspective, we're logged in here as a completely made up student.

57
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:48,529
Her name is Jane Edwards. On the left hand side, Jane will be able to navigate the Kritik application starting at the top.

58
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:51,690
If she clicks the Kritik logo, she can look at her courses.

59
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:55,310
Obviously, this student only has one course in Kritik right now because it's a demonstration

60
00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:00,110
and she can move through the rest of the tabs quickly into the course.

61
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:09,780
She can see which professors of hers are actually collaborating on the course with her that could be there to the professor,

62
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,690
the code professor, or whatever it might be.

63
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:19,280
And then if they scroll down, they'll be able to see how the professor has weighted each individual phase of Kritik,

64
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:27,379
and that's for every single assignment, right? So all three phases of Kritik has a different weighting towards it.

65
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:33,980
The creation phase out of the box is 50% of the overall grade, and that's the quality of their creation.

66
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:39,139
As per their peers opinion, the evaluation score is split into two sections.

67
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:47,030
Firstly, accuracy. How accurate are they grading as per that calibration activity to make sure students are heavily incentivized to pay attention

68
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:51,860
while they're doing the pure evaluation process and make sure they're leaving good quality feedback and grading accurately.

69
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,500
And then also the written evaluation score.

70
00:06:55,100 --> 00:07:02,180
This score is sourced from the final section, which is called feedback, and that's where they receive the feedback and rank it.

71
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:08,250
On if it was helpful or not. Just doing the feedback section that counts for 10% of the rating.

72
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,319
Now moving into activities,

73
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:18,780
students are going to be able to track and see how they are doing as an overall average on each phase throughout the semester.

74
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:23,700
So the students doing quite well obviously in this demo account, 96, 95 and 100.

75
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:28,680
The feedback phase of the agent, that's just completion grade, so most of them should get 100 on that.

76
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:37,230
If they aren't, and that's probably an issue that scrolling down that this student can easily track open assignments.

77
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:44,380
Okay. So I'm going to start off by showing you. An entire the complete assignment from the student perspective.

78
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:51,280
So they would log in, they would be able to read the instructions, open up the rubric.

79
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,770
We suggest they open this into a full view so they can really get a good handle of what's expected of them.

80
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:01,450
This is totally customizable from the professor perspective and we do have a lot of templates,

81
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:06,279
so you can always create a really highly customizable rubric down here.

82
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,589
Your students are submitting their actual assignment.

83
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:13,390
It can be submitted straight to the Kritik, or you can attach any type of file type that you really want to.

84
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:19,290
Then they move on to evaluation. That's probably happens a few days later.

85
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:25,740
They receive the assignments anonymously from their peers and they're going to read them over,

86
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,880
score them based off the rubric, and also provide written evaluation.

87
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:34,589
We suggest doing that for three of their peers. That's the magic number.

88
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:40,710
That way, students don't get tired by the time they get to the last peer, and they're still excited to leave feedback.

89
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:47,410
So that's the process when it comes to evaluation. Finally, is feedback what you've been waiting for?

90
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:54,070
They receive the feedback from their peers and they're ranking that feedback on if it was either motivational or critical.

91
00:08:54,280 --> 00:09:00,460
And again, these rankings go towards the grade of the student that left the peer feedback.

92
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:06,610
Okay. So I'm going to stop here. Courtney, do you have anything to add as we move through it?

93
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:11,530
I think that's great. So that's the student view and that's the navigation menu.

94
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:18,700
Maybe we'll pause here for questions and then I'm going to jump in to showing the instructor view and how you can customize your options.

95
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,120
Any questions about what the students see, what the students can submit?

96
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:33,240
It's impossible to increase the font size. It's pretty hard to see after the first year and now it's too much.

97
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:37,160
I'm just assuming in that format. Surfing.

98
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:47,490
Any other questions? So you feel like you guys have a good sense of how that works for the students?

99
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:56,390
Could you move back to the the three stages the create the evaluation.

100
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:06,159
Yeah. So I can walk you through the example I showed you as a completed assignment.

101
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,510
But I want you also to get a good idea of what it looks like when they're actually submitting and reading the instructions.

102
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:15,159
So when they move into a creation phase, this is all they can see, right?

103
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,410
They would see the instructions. They would see that rubric.

104
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:25,270
And then when they actually want to edit their their submission, this is just a text box so they can add or remove content there quite easily.

105
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:31,630
So that's what the creation phase looks like, similar to like let's say canvas or blackboard or whatever systems you might use in the past.

106
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,570
And just to pause on that creation stage,

107
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:42,580
we see professors from all different types of subject matter so students can submit in that text box or they can attach a file.

108
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:48,040
So we have computer programing professors, they might attack our students, they might attach a zip file.

109
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:54,190
We had a music theory class where they're uploading audio files to be able to share the music they were composing.

110
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,989
If it's an essay and there's really rigorous APA formatting,

111
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:04,690
you can attach a word doc or even a YouTube video if students have recorded a presentation.

112
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:11,530
So it's quite versatile and you can set which file attachments you would like students to upload.

113
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:15,910
Awesome. I have a question.

114
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:24,730
I'm not sure this is more of a big picture question. I don't know if you want me to wait till the end asking out of my place.

115
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:34,059
So I've had experience with guiding structured peer review where the students have a specific

116
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:40,090
format that they follow and they give each other feedback on the writing without giving a grade.

117
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:50,570
So in your opinion are why? What are the advantages of having the students actually give the grade beyond giving writing feedback?

118
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:59,360
Yeah, that's a good question. I'm a fan of both. When students can give a numerical grade as well as that qualitative written feedback.

119
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:05,149
That's where you really see the learning happening, because for students who are receiving this feedback,

120
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:09,290
let's say three of their peers all scored their first draft of an essay.

121
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:15,680
They have an indication of how their peers felt about that score, especially about that submission,

122
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:24,440
especially when the rubric is really well developed with the professor so that there's very clear, explicit meanings to each level.

123
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:31,400
Students are able to see ahead of time how to get that A or what a B paper would look like.

124
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:36,889
So as close clicking through those stars, you can see that the rubric in the bottom, right?

125
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:41,150
It's our smaller version of the rubric. It highlights each criteria.

126
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:49,100
So students are they're really being guided to think criticallyly about the quality of the submission at a higher level.

127
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:54,620
And then once they do that, they get into the more qualitative feedback where they can then give that written feedback.

128
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:02,780
So I think the combination helps students to identify where they need to focus on and improving their work and where they did well on.

129
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:10,999
We've also had examples in the past where we've had a very basic rule.

130
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:17,960
But did the student follow the minimum requirements of the assignment where there are at least 250 words?

131
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:25,040
Was there bibliography, so on and so forth? Right. And you can lean heavily on the reviewing piece rather than the actual rubric grading.

132
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:33,620
That's true. And in my demo, I can show you how to customize those rubrics because we have professors who have maybe seven criteria and seven levels,

133
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:36,679
and then we work with professors who just have a more binary rubric.

134
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:44,690
As mentioned, did they meet the criteria? Or did they not? But just to be clear, you can shut off the grating feature, if that's correct.

135
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:48,830
So you actually can't shut off the grating feature within Kritiks.

136
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:56,750
Instead, you could use a rubric that is more of a pass or fail model that won't show students a numerical grade.

137
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:59,630
It will just show them the level that they achieved.

138
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:07,970
So if the student was able to complete the assignment with all, let's say, level two, then they would be able to pass that assignment.

139
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:14,950
Was that clear? Yes. Excellent.

140
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:21,670
Yeah. You've got a lot of flexibility in terms of how you use Kritik and how you use their rubrics.

141
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:25,540
We work with a lot of specifications grading and grading contract courses.

142
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:29,800
Who either the professor or the T.A. is doing all of the grading.

143
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:36,190
So really, the Kritik score is just another way for students to have an indication of the quality of their submission.

144
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:41,050
But the emphasis is then on that written feedback. So you could definitely use Kritik in that way as well.

145
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:49,210
Great, awesome, corny. You want to take over the screen and move over to the professor?

146
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:57,550
Yeah. Yeah, sure. So I'm going to walk through how to create an course and Kritik and how to create an activity.

147
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:02,410
And I'll show off some of the different features, and then I'll pause at the end for questions.

148
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,980
Can everyone see my screen? Yes.

149
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:18,700
Okay. Excellent. So when you create an instructor account, you'll see this page.

150
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:19,690
This is your home page.

151
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:28,630
So we have an example course that you can always pop into and see examples of other activities, and then you can create as many courses as you'd like.

152
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:37,510
So you click on New Course and then you would enter your course code details so it could be ESG 1 to 1.

153
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:44,110
If you have multiple sections, you can indicate that here, and then you would put the name of your course.

154
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:49,260
Lastly, select your departments. They're a little bit limited.

155
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:52,980
This is just for our own internal organization, so don't worry too much there.

156
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:57,840
The description you can copy paste from your course website or you can add a description.

157
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:06,169
You can attach your syllabus here. That's great for your students to have access, but it also helps myself and the instructional design team.

158
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:09,660
But Kritik offer you different recommendations throughout the semester.

159
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:15,750
Then you just put your start and end dates for the course so that we can help keep you on track.

160
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:21,540
And here are student permissions. So you have the option to show the class average or to hide it?

161
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:25,880
I recommend hiding it, but totally up to you.

162
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:33,570
And you can hit next and we get to the scoring breakdown so you can choose percentage or points, whatever you prefer.

163
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:40,290
And then you can also set the grading weight per activity. This is relative to all activities and Kritik.

164
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:44,790
So we typically recommend five Kritik activities in a full semester.

165
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,990
In a shorter condensed semester, you might aim for three activities.

166
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:53,969
Five is a good number because students will really be able to practice over

167
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:59,790
the span of a semester that peer review process and anything more than five.

168
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:04,500
As I mentioned earlier, they might get a little bit overwhelmed or what we call rubric fatigue.

169
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:11,249
So five is a good number to aim for and then you'll be able to set the scoring break down for each activity.

170
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:15,990
So every assignment and Kritik, we call it an activity and it comes with a grade out of 100%.

171
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:24,090
And each of the three stages that Cole mentioned, students have an opportunity to receive grades for each stage.

172
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:30,480
So you can customize these as well so you can really fit your needs.

173
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:36,580
But the creation score is essentially the weighted average of the students submission.

174
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:43,860
So if I handed in an essay and three of my peers anonymously critiqued it, the average would be my creation score.

175
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:48,690
Professors and Tas can override any score at any time.

176
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:54,500
Then the evaluation for this is assessing how well the students gave Kritik

177
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:59,480
So it's not just enough to do it. You really have to see if they're doing a good job.

178
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:03,200
So we break down the evaluation score into two SAT scores.

179
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:08,390
So the grading score, that's Kritik's algorithm kicking in, looking for accuracy.

180
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:15,890
So students are expected to score each submission as closely to that weighted average as possible.

181
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:22,190
And I'm saying weighted average, because as Paul mentioned, we set up calibration activities in the beginning,

182
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,930
so not every students score is going to have an equal weight.

183
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:31,940
Your beginner level students will have a star one, so they'll have a weight of one,

184
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:35,650
whereas your stronger evaluators can go all the way up to six stars.

185
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:42,860
So it really depends on where they're at. So that's how we ensure that your stronger evaluators have more of an impact on their peers creation score.

186
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,850
The second half of the evaluation score is more qualitative.

187
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:55,970
This is the written feedback that students will provide each other and it's going to be assessed by the recipient in the third feedback stage.

188
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:59,660
So I'll jump to the feedback stage just to come back and explain this.

189
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:06,600
So in the feedback stage, I submitted my essay, I gave peer critique on three other essays.

190
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:11,880
I've also now received my critique from those three random anonymous peers.

191
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:17,310
And now I'm going to rate how critical that feedback was and how motivational it was.

192
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,170
So students will slide a scale from 1 to 4 to do this and whatever.

193
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:30,450
I saw my peers that's going to impact their written evaluation score, whereas my feedback score is just participation based.

194
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:34,620
So students are incentivized to do the feedback on feedback.

195
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:39,090
Any questions about how the scoring breakdown works?

196
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:44,960
Before we move on. All right.

197
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:51,080
So you can also hover over these question marks and you can click on Learn More if you

198
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:56,540
want to access a blog article on even more details about how our sport breakdown works.

199
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:02,840
And your students also have access to this same course page, so you can always direct them there and they can also see that.

200
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:10,580
So once you set your scoring breakdown or something that works for you, you're going to hit create course.

201
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:19,760
And now you've got your course. So you click on your course title to access it and then to start creating content and Kritik

202
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:23,090
We create activities in the top right corner here.

203
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:29,019
So in Kritik we have three different types of activities and individual activities.

204
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:34,390
Students submit one creation and they independently evaluate other peers creations.

205
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:43,300
A collaboration activity is the one that Cole hinted at, where you, as the professor, would select three samples of prior year's work.

206
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:51,850
Maybe three essays I'll just use as an example. And then you would grade those using your rubric, and that would set up calibration.

207
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:57,430
Now your new students will come in and they'll read these three papers and they're anonymous,

208
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:03,670
and then they'll grade them with your same rubric to the best of their ability, without knowing how you graded each one.

209
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:10,270
And then Kritik will calibrate to see how closely or how far off they scored to you as the professor.

210
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:17,830
And that will set their grading power, which is that multiplier that we talked about when it comes to grading accuracy.

211
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:23,610
So that's a calibration. And then there's group activities. We have two different types of group activities and Kritik.

212
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:30,700
We have a group activity that's between groups where Group A would submit one creation.

213
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:41,440
It could be a PowerPoint presentation, for example. And then independently, individual members outside of grouping will critique group as a whole.

214
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:45,220
So it's always done independently. The evaluation stage.

215
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:54,790
The other type of group assessment would be every member of group submits a creation, and then only members within group, they evaluate each other.

216
00:21:55,420 --> 00:22:02,470
This is really excellent for team assessment. So at the end of a group of students working together on a team project,

217
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:06,940
you could set up a team assessment activity and critique just by clicking those two buttons.

218
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:10,710
And you see, we pre populate the objective, the instructions.

219
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:18,059
And your rubric for you. And this helps students to evaluate each other in terms of their contributions,

220
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:23,010
their attitude, teamwork, fulfillment and ability to communicate and things like that.

221
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:29,640
And there's submission, their creation for that. Within group assignment, it would be like a self reflection, essentially.

222
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:36,570
And when you're doing that evaluation, you would know which peer you're evaluating just specifically for that within group one.

223
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:42,450
But then when you receive the feedback, students are not going to know who who gave them that individual piece of feedback.

224
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:48,780
That is a very good point. Yeah, that within groups is the only activity and Kritik that's not double blind.

225
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:51,300
We would have to. Yeah. Got it.

226
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:58,770
So for the purposes of this, I'll show you an individual activity you would put in your title test activity number one.

227
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:03,240
And then here you can see three, populate your learning objectives.

228
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:11,639
So here you would put your overall learning objective for this specific activity and then you would add your create stage objectives.

229
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,600
So what are students submitting? Why are they submitting it?

230
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,330
What is the learning goal that you'd like to achieve?

231
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:28,290
We suggest you use measurable verbs from Bloom's taxonomy in order to guide students for that objective and then for the evaluate and feedback stages.

232
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:33,059
We populate those objectives for you. Of course, you can still customize these,

233
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:39,450
but essentially we're looking for students to assess the creations of their peers and evaluate if they met that create stage objective.

234
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:48,470
And the feedback stage, we're inviting them to express how the evaluations they received from their peers helped them or didn't help them.

235
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:55,470
Then we get to the instructions. So this first paragraph is really just explaining how a Kritik works.

236
00:23:55,500 --> 00:24:02,010
There are three stages to complete, and students would check the schedule to know the deadlines to complete each stage.

237
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:07,200
You as the professor are setting these schedules, so that's really excellent.

238
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:13,620
Again, where you're creating that structure for pure assessment and you can be really flexible with those schedules to.

239
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:19,210
Then you would populate the create stage instructions. So what are students submitting?

240
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:23,290
Is it a part one of the scaffolded lab report?

241
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:28,120
Perhaps they're just submitting their discussion and results at this point.

242
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:35,200
It could be a video that they're giving where they have to teach their peers a module from the course.

243
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:38,260
Again, you can get really creative with what students can submit.

244
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:43,010
And then in the evaluate stage and feedback stage,

245
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:50,270
we pre-populated these instructions for you as well as the students would use the rubric that you provide to score their peers and then they would

246
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:57,110
leave a constructive and motivational written evaluation as well with specific examples of what they did well and what they could improve on.

247
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,390
You can customize this and add to it.

248
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:07,730
As I mentioned before, we had a professor in music theory and she had students upload an audio file for their creation,

249
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:11,480
and then students would upload an audio file for their evaluation as well.

250
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:18,809
So really cool their. And then there's just a little disclaimer that if students need any support using Kritik,

251
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:22,230
they can always contact our live chat right here in the bottom right corner.

252
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:28,290
US professors also have access to this and we have a customer support team who are

253
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:31,860
working there to make sure that you're set up for success and that your students are to.

254
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:38,070
If you have resources that you need to attach, perhaps are getting students to do a case study analysis.

255
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:45,540
You can attach the case study itself here or if you have any, maybe there's some prior knowledge that you need access to.

256
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:49,999
You can attach those there. And I'm for STEM courses especially.

257
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:56,930
I see evaluator notes are very useful. So this is essentially an answer key whatever you put here.

258
00:25:57,230 --> 00:26:01,970
These notes will be released to students at the time when they're evaluating their peers.

259
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:08,540
So if it's a homework problem set, for example, and you need to put the right answers here,

260
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:12,980
you don't want students to have access to the correct answers when they're submitting their creations.

261
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,550
But when it comes time to evaluating their peers, they will need to have access.

262
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:21,410
So you can have that right here. You can attach a file or you can use our text box.

263
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:26,930
I've also seen it work well, though, in humanities and arts and social sciences,

264
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:34,940
just to help guide students to give better written evaluations, because they might just say, good job, you did great.

265
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:40,850
So if you have specific guiding questions that you want students to answer, you can put those here as well.

266
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:51,030
Now the fun part is our rubrics. So we have a library of rubric templates you can borrow from everything here.

267
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,550
So the best way to get in here is to click on edit rubric.

268
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:59,910
This will take you out of your activity into the rubric manager and then you can

269
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:04,680
click on manage templates in the top right corner so you can see our core templates.

270
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:11,790
So we have everything from very basic intro to perfect rubric that just looks at quality of writing, grammar, word count.

271
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:16,290
And then we have more comprehensive ones. For example, essay master.

272
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,679
We also have lab reports. Teach fears is excellent.

273
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:29,299
If you want students to either individually or in groups, learn from the course materials and reflect on them and draw from them,

274
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:33,500
and then teach a module or a section back to their classmates.

275
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:40,640
Really helps to deepen that understanding and discussion posts is probably another favorite Kritik.

276
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:44,090
If you've ever done discussion posts in your LMS,

277
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:50,720
you'll see that the tendency is one student will say something really great and then a whole bunch will reply.

278
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:55,070
I agree and it can be hard to assign an accurate grade.

279
00:27:55,310 --> 00:28:02,450
Most professors end up giving participation marks and discussion posts, whereas creating a discussion post activity and Kritik.

280
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:12,560
Every student is responsible for posting on a particular topic and then every student is prompted to give a critique using these criteria.

281
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:16,010
Clarity of thoughts, completeness, accuracy, thoughtfulness.

282
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:25,999
So you really end up having a more robust discussion and students can respond to the original post in their written evaluation.

283
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,780
TextBox.

284
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:36,880
So you can customize a rubric by clicking the word use in the top right corner to tell Kritiks that you're using this template for this activity.

285
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:45,040
And you can double click into any cell if you want to change the wording, you can double click into the headers as well.

286
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:51,520
If you prefer approaching exceeds expectations, you can do that.

287
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:59,860
Let's see here what else? You can change the order. If you want the most important criteria to be up at the top, you can drag and drop.

288
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:08,620
You can also have variations of levels. So if you have something like did they attach their sources, yes or no?

289
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:16,720
You can remove the highest level and you can make a more binary rubric and it doesn't affect the rest of the criteria.

290
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:24,020
So you can do a lot with rubrics. Once you've customize it to your liking, you can save it as a template.

291
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:34,490
So you have that in your library. As we talked earlier, there was a question about do you have to have the grading component?

292
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:39,260
You can make this rubric, like Cole said, very straightforward.

293
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:42,799
They did not meet the expectations or they met the expectations.

294
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:49,100
So it's just quite binary. And then down here you'll see you have the option to have a numeric grade or a pass fail grade.

295
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:55,850
And when you click Pass Fail, you as a professor will set the minimum criteria that students need to have.

296
00:29:56,210 --> 00:30:01,520
So students need to have at least a level one in a majority of the criteria.

297
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:08,179
You can also select all criteria or any band that will enable students to just

298
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:12,980
see whether or not they passed the assignment or did not meet the expectations.

299
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:18,080
So that's one workaround as well, just to have more emphasis on the written feedback than the scoring.

300
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:24,050
So when you hit Done, it takes you out of the rubric manager back to the activity that we were working on.

301
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:29,900
And then the last few settings here, I'll explain briefly in the questions.

302
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:35,210
Multiple topics is a feature that is super useful right now,

303
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:41,660
as I'm onboarding a lot of summer sessions where you might be with a class for only

304
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:46,430
six weeks and you have a condensed amount of time to cover a lot of material.

305
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:51,770
If you enable it, essentially the professor would choose topic A and topic B.

306
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:56,000
It can be two questions. It can be two different case scenarios.

307
00:30:56,780 --> 00:31:02,270
You can get really creative with that. And you would identify a topic, a topic E in your instructions.

308
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:07,850
Kritik will randomly assign half of your class to topic and half to topic B,

309
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:15,470
where they will submit creations for topic A or B and then in the evaluate stage Kritik will automatically swap them.

310
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:23,540
So they're now evaluating the other topic. So again, they can cover a wide range, of course, material in one activity.

311
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:28,940
Really great for learning. We've seen this work well with debates, for example.

312
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:36,050
So sleep accessible here. You can choose what file attachment options students are able to submit.

313
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:44,090
So if you are working in a career development course and you want students to upload a resume and you only want them to attach a PDF,

314
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:47,810
you can do so here or you can have all file types.

315
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:52,610
If you click disable, it guides students to use the critique textbooks.

316
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,799
So everything is in that text box. Almost through this is important.

317
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:06,720
These are the number of evaluations. So as a professor, you're setting how many peer evaluations each student will be assigned to give.

318
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:14,010
And then Kritik will do its best to make that an even distribution in terms of how many everyone receives.

319
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:19,740
That being said, if a student was sick or they missed a creation, that's obviously going to impact the breakdown.

320
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:25,230
But what you can ensure is how many evaluations each student is giving so you can manage their workload.

321
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:32,480
As Cole said, we suggest 3 to 5. It depends on the activity itself and the time of year.

322
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:38,130
So you can play with that for each activity. If it's an ice breaker activity, you're just starting off.

323
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,990
Five is a good number.

324
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:48,600
If it's around midterms and you're getting students to review five page essays, you might want to bring that down to three or even two.

325
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:52,710
Once you dip below three, you'll see this notification come up.

326
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:57,660
Three or more is really the ideal number when it comes to peer assessment,

327
00:32:57,930 --> 00:33:02,460
because from the recipient standpoint, if I have three different peer critiques to work from,

328
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:09,210
I can start to see patterns and I can start to identify areas that I might need to improve on or I might do well.

329
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:12,240
Whereas if I only received one critique or even two,

330
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:19,230
it can be harder for me to distinguish what was in particular wasn't and which I should apply and what I should leave.

331
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:23,460
So keep that in mind. And then anything over five.

332
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:27,420
You'll also want to think about the complexity of the submission itself,

333
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:32,370
because you want to give that time for students to really be thoughtful in their critiques.

334
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:36,150
So 3 to 5 is a good guideline here. You'll see the grading weights.

335
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:41,250
So you can set the grading weight for each activity by clicking custom weight.

336
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,070
This is separate from your rubric weight.

337
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:51,660
The rubric will add up to the creation score, whereas this grading weight is relative to all your activities and credits.

338
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:54,270
So if you're doing five activities in Kritik,

339
00:33:54,570 --> 00:34:02,940
you might want your major project component to be worth more than your icebreaker activity so you can adjust the weights here accordingly.

340
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,980
So your overall Kritik score reflects that.

341
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:12,870
But regardless, Kritik will give you a great book that shows every student, every score for every activity.

342
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:18,180
So you'll be able to work with that. Last step is your submission policy.

343
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:21,660
You can click, expand and see. We have three options in Kritik.

344
00:34:22,890 --> 00:34:27,510
It's important to note that this is for creations only and not for evaluations or feedback.

345
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:32,550
So you can have no late submissions or you can allow these submissions.

346
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:36,000
And then we have these two options.

347
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:40,560
Auto accept is recommended for large courses.

348
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:46,769
Less housekeeping's for you. It'll automatically accept delayed creation, but it'll time stamp it.

349
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:50,370
So if you deduct a certain amount of points or percentage each day, it's late.

350
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:55,439
You'll be able to do that in your elements or needs approval.

351
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,059
That's a case by case basis.

352
00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:04,500
So the student would have to write in textbooks and critique why it's late, and then you would either approve or reject each one case by case.

353
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:11,160
So once you do all that, you can save your activity. And it will appear here as test number one.

354
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:16,530
So you can continue to edit the activity by clicking the ellipsis down here and hitting edit.

355
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:21,240
I also want to point out the duplicate button. Hope my font is big enough.

356
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:29,380
The duplicate button is great if you're doing short answer responses or multiple case studies,

357
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:34,890
so you can duplicate exactly what you created and then you would just edit the title.

358
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:40,780
Perhaps the objective might slightly change or some resources, but everything else will be kept the same for you,

359
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:50,529
and once you create your activity, you're ready to schedule it. When you schedule the activity, you'll see four different dates to submit.

360
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:54,220
So the start date, that's when it becomes viewable to your students.

361
00:35:54,400 --> 00:36:01,090
It's the equivalent of publishing the assignment. You can set the time as well, and then you're going to set your create stage due date.

362
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:05,280
You can enable or disable a submission grace period.

363
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:09,060
This is separate from your late submission policy.

364
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:13,140
This is an extension of the create stage.

365
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:18,030
So if you say no late creations, but then you give a grace period, that might be fair.

366
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:23,129
You can also customize how long this grace period is. So if you do midnight deadlines,

367
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:28,170
then a grace period of at least 2 hours is recommended because we all know there's always that one

368
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:34,680
stressed out students at one time looking to submit and then you'll get into the evaluate stage due date.

369
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:42,809
We recommend giving 2 to 3 days depending on how many evaluations you have set and the coursework,

370
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:47,820
and also knowing your students are these masters level students with jobs and children?

371
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:55,650
Or is this an intensive course that students have an expectation that material moves pretty quickly?

372
00:36:56,010 --> 00:37:01,229
So knowing your students, knowing your target learner demographic will help you.

373
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:07,680
But 2 to 3 days is a good guideline. And then the feedback on feedback stage is the shortest amount of time.

374
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:11,580
Students spend 5 to 10 minutes on that because it's two questions,

375
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:17,070
and they slide that scale to indicate how critical and how motivational the evaluations were.

376
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:20,670
So a day or two is enough for the feedback stage.

377
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:28,160
And yeah, once that ends, it's the activity will enter what's called the grading stage.

378
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:32,010
I usually use air quotes because the students are grading each other.

379
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:40,620
What the grading stage is, is the opportunity for you as the professor to come in and now evaluate to see where those grades accurate?

380
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:45,700
Do I need to edit and overwrite any scores? Was anyone missing something?

381
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:54,810
Do I need to comment on students? Works like Spotlight some really great work so that students can see what is the the standard in the bar.

382
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:01,530
So that grading stage will basically be pending until you mark the activity as complete and marking

383
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:06,330
it as complete lets your students know that this activity is now done in the grades or finalize.

384
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:13,650
So that's a very brief high level overview of the onboarding process.

385
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,290
And I'm here to support professors.

386
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:22,110
As I said, I work with all the new professors who are onboarding to critique, just to help personalize this experience.

387
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:25,200
You'll also have access to our support team in the live chat too.

388
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:31,709
And we have a bunch of materials, we have a professor guide and some tutorial videos that will help you as well.

389
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:41,330
But yeah, at this point I'll stop sharing and then I'll open it up to questions about creating an activity or creating a course as we have.

390
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:44,219
Thanks for joining. That was very thorough. There has to be questions now.

391
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:50,670
I mean, we we went through pretty much everything there is when it comes to instructional design and the overall way the critique works.

392
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:56,940
So any questions? Feel free. Have a question.

393
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:04,860
Thank you for that very thorough tour. The program seems comprehensive and flexible.

394
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:11,290
I actually had a question about the anonymous peer review.

395
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:24,600
Is is anonymous peer review the only option or is there a way that students can provide feedback in a way that is not anonymous through the system?

396
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:33,120
Yeah. So it is designed to be anonymous in that students, when they view their peers fatigue, it'll say anonymous peer.

397
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:38,670
The professor will see the student's name. But I have had professors who, especially in grad courses,

398
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:44,099
when they're smaller courses and they want students to have that real life experience and skill

399
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:49,620
to be able to give and receive critique and know who was giving and receiving the Kritik

400
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:58,290
So in that case, the students would simply submit their name in their creation, so they might write up their short answer response or their essay.

401
00:39:58,290 --> 00:40:01,050
And then in that text box they would just indicate who they are.

402
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:06,690
And then in that sense, students now know who gave the critique and who gave the creation.

403
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:12,720
Yeah. Or you could put them in into one group and then do it within group activity.

404
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:18,989
We've done that in the past as well. Yeah, that's actually a good point though. Within group activity, that function is not double blind.

405
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:25,080
So you will see the names of the students who submitted the creations, not the evaluation.

406
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:31,200
So again, the student will give their written evaluation and then sign off with their name in order to show who they were.

407
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:38,930
Did. Did that answer your question? Thank you. Awesome.

408
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:45,470
Great. Any other questions? We're out of commission for the couple.

409
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:55,250
Hands are going up. Let's do it. How does critique integrate with a learning management system like campus as far as getting grades into a grade book?

410
00:40:56,420 --> 00:41:00,409
So right now we have two different integration options.

411
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:06,320
So it really depends on the institution we integrate with Canvas, Moodle, Blackboard, all the major elements.

412
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:11,390
I always say LMS systems and then it feels redundant because I'm pretty sure that's the systems.

413
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:21,740
But we integrate with campus depending on your school, the API integration, we have great sync, so Kritik scores are sent to your grades and campus.

414
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:30,440
If you have that integration, then in your left hand navigation menu underneath discussions, you'll see a button that says Great sync.

415
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:38,210
When the professor clicks that button, they can choose which activities to sync to candidates so you can sync them all or case by case,

416
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:47,060
and then that will sync your grades there. The other type of integration is the LTI integration that's more favorable at most universities.

417
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:54,950
And we currently have course roster sync so students could access Kritik through campus.

418
00:41:54,950 --> 00:42:01,310
So when they log in to campus on that left hand side in campus, you'll see a Kritik with a link.

419
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:07,820
They click that and now they're launched into Kritik and they can continue to submit and evaluate within Kritiks.

420
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:14,840
We are on track to also introduce grade sync and some other features that I won't mention yet.

421
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:24,200
But our development team is working really heavily on that right now, so great sync is coming for both integrations, but right now it's just with API.

422
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:31,610
Thank you. What type of integration would you hope to see out of canvas in a platform like Kritik?

423
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:38,520
Whatever is easiest for us, it's easy to set up.

424
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:44,390
We can work with the tech team on that one. No worries. Even the manual sinking.

425
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:49,070
I promise you, it's not that scary. I work with professors one on one campus.

426
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:56,870
Well, a lot of those major systems, you can just upload a CSV file and then that will sink the grades and Kritiks grade book is that same file.

427
00:42:57,050 --> 00:43:00,170
So it might just be a little bit of tweaking to make sure the formats match.

428
00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:06,470
But even if you don't have the integration at your institution yet, the manual sync is not not so scary.

429
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:17,350
I've got it working. Any other questions here in the room? What does this process look like compared to your previous peer evaluation process?

430
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:21,550
Actually, from the field, those questions, you know. Go ahead, Emily.

431
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:30,959
I can't see the screen properly. No worries. So my my question is going to emerge in a sample, of course, that we're talking about.

432
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:37,980
We've talked about having not one large assessment that has four or five kind of scaffolding pieces to it.

433
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:45,150
And I'm wondering if you see courses or instructors who use this for like all of those pieces,

434
00:43:45,570 --> 00:43:52,530
but then want to take the peer review component out of it for the final component and just want that really that final product to be greeted

435
00:43:52,530 --> 00:44:03,540
by an instructor or maybe use this peer review for process for that kind of formative feedback or a certain percentage of the course grade.

436
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:08,880
But then ultimately do what the instructor to continue to have the authority or the final grade.

437
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:16,590
Is that something that people have to people use Kritik in that way or question?

438
00:44:16,890 --> 00:44:21,420
That's a really popular use case. I'm a big fan of scaffolded assignments as well.

439
00:44:21,430 --> 00:44:26,700
So, yes, we see that happening and Kritik. And to answer your question about that final submission.

440
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:30,000
It depends on the professor. I've seen it work well in both.

441
00:44:30,330 --> 00:44:36,840
So one example, students were writing a literature review and the professor had scaffolded that.

442
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:41,430
And then she had students submit their final literature review,

443
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:49,530
but she called it the first draft and they did submit that through Kritik got some critique, and then they were able to apply that feedback.

444
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:57,330
And then they submitted the final literature review to canvas just for the professor to grade and not for another round of peer Kritik

445
00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:02,910
I've also seen it with a scaffolded team based project too.

446
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:11,310
So you might break that up into smaller chunks. And then the one big final presentation can either be done in class or through your alums.

447
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:18,930
I think it's still good to keep that guideline of five activities in Kritik in a 10 to 16 week semester.

448
00:45:19,830 --> 00:45:26,310
By the time you get to your fifth iteration of Kritik, students are going a little cross-eyed.

449
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:30,870
So I think it is important to not overload them with too much feedback.

450
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:40,410
But if your assignment breaks down into four pieces, then your fifth activity could be students submitting that final work as a whole.

451
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:49,670
Thank you for that. And to answer the question, I think many of us do not use peer feedback at all in our courses at all.

452
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:53,719
Not at all. Try and do something.

453
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:56,990
Do a lot, but some do not at all.

454
00:45:57,020 --> 00:46:00,990
So the idea of thinking that's just trying to,

455
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:07,550
I think at an individual level or as we're doing our curriculum model, trying to think about the role we want.

456
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:14,100
Your feedback to play is a question that I don't know that we really started even asking ourselves.

457
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:19,519
So this feels like a really great idea generator.

458
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:22,879
And I think maybe something would drive our conversation about kind of the

459
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:27,590
value and the role we want your feedback to play in our different assessments.

460
00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:35,160
Absolutely. It's a great conversation to start. And just to help you out, you know, I work with professors who also have never done peer review.

461
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:43,250
We also work with professors who have done a lot of peer review. And for a beginner level, I would say for student feedback,

462
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:53,110
if you allocate 5 to 10% of your final grade to the efforts associated with peer review, students do what they're graded on.

463
00:46:53,120 --> 00:47:00,770
We all have that. So 5 to 10% is low stakes enough that they're not super stressed out if it's their first time doing peer review.

464
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:04,490
But it's enough that they take it seriously and they really give it a go.

465
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:10,910
So that's a good indication. And then again, going back to five activities, if you stick with that,

466
00:47:11,210 --> 00:47:15,590
it's enough that professors who are new to peer review and students who are new,

467
00:47:15,590 --> 00:47:19,460
they get enough iterations to really see a holistic picture of how that went.

468
00:47:19,790 --> 00:47:28,610
But it's not too much where they're overwhelmed. So that's a good guideline for intro to peer review, I would say, and then get your student feedback.

469
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:36,590
It's really important to get student feedback on when you design a course and and criticallyly survey students at the end of every semester as well.

470
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:44,210
And we use that feedback to make sure that we're designing the platform in a way that benefits both professors and students of the rubric.

471
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:48,200
Actually, you answered my question, so thank you. Sorry, I was just going to. Emily,

472
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:56,060
do you not use or do people not use peer reviews because the tools are not there

473
00:47:56,390 --> 00:48:05,750
to facilitate what Kritik does or just they don't think about it as a teaching,

474
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:12,200
as a component of their teaching. I would imagine all of the above both.

475
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:21,350
But I would I would guess that for many of us, it depends on the type of assessments that we use, the extent that we want,

476
00:48:21,470 --> 00:48:27,530
how much time we want to spend with students developing that skill of peer review

477
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:34,280
and the value that we of seeing students derive from the peer reviews they view.

478
00:48:35,810 --> 00:48:38,690
So I think the tool is part of it.

479
00:48:38,690 --> 00:48:47,180
But, you know, I would imagine that some of us have assessments where the value of peer feedback would be more or less relevant.

480
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:51,980
That brings up a good question. Do you have any sense of how much?

481
00:48:53,380 --> 00:49:06,220
Time instructors have to spend sort of teaching their students how to, you know, how Kritiks is going to be used and,

482
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:14,530
you know, framing the value of it and starting to sort of like teach them about the feedback process.

483
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:21,429
Yeah, that's a good question. The short answer is we don't have a factor figure right now because it really varies.

484
00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:26,840
It really varies. So we do supply student onboarding materials to help facilitate that.

485
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:33,370
And professors who have found the most success in peer review and an implementing Kritik in particular in their classrooms,

486
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:40,329
they spend part of their first class going over the why behind peer review,

487
00:49:40,330 --> 00:49:47,020
the benefits of it, the real life skills that students will take from participating in peer review as well

488
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:51,970
as the learning outcomes they'll review or they'll receive rather and and learn.

489
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:56,890
So that happens. But in terms of the actual time,

490
00:49:57,610 --> 00:50:07,450
it could be throughout the semester that you're continuously adding feedback on feedback to the students with and then others are really great at it.

491
00:50:07,450 --> 00:50:14,439
So we see Kritik being used for intro level chemistry courses where students are coming straight from high school for the most part,

492
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:17,710
and they have a wide background. Some are chemistry major, some are not.

493
00:50:18,130 --> 00:50:25,300
Those students may take a bit more time or we see Kritik working with smaller grade level courses

494
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:30,910
where they've had a bit more practice giving peer critique throughout their academic careers.

495
00:50:31,330 --> 00:50:38,920
So it really depends on where the students are and how much time the professor has to allocate to that.

496
00:50:39,610 --> 00:50:44,650
I smile at that because professors don't have time. Busiest people in the world, I'm sure of that.

497
00:50:45,310 --> 00:50:49,810
But we do try to supply materials just to facilitate that and make that easier for you.

498
00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:57,910
One thing I'll say is that Kritik has a few features for professors to be able to give the whole class feedback in one swoop.

499
00:50:57,910 --> 00:51:00,790
So we have a spotlight feature that I've mentioned a couple of times.

500
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:11,590
So if you have a class of 200 students, let's say it can be tedious to go through every single one and try to give critical comments for each one.

501
00:51:11,890 --> 00:51:15,040
So instead you could just choose calls showing a spotlighting.

502
00:51:15,730 --> 00:51:19,300
You can take one great example of a creation or an evaluation.

503
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:22,120
I recommend doing both for each activity,

504
00:51:22,510 --> 00:51:30,459
and you would spotlight that the professor can add specific comments as to why they're spotlighting it and basically into clicks of a button.

505
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:38,170
The whole class now has access to this anonymized critique or creation and the professor's comments.

506
00:51:38,170 --> 00:51:41,590
So in that way, you're giving back constructive, timely feedback.

507
00:51:42,490 --> 00:51:43,330
In one area.

508
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:53,050
It also is the prep work designing the instructions, designing the learning outcomes, the rubric itself coming up with a really solid rubric.

509
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:57,730
All of that prep work beforehand is going to set your students up for success.

510
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:03,340
So even a student who is brand new to peer review can give really good quality feedback.

511
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:07,570
That's something that we want to really express.

512
00:52:07,570 --> 00:52:12,760
That Kritik is we believe in the value of peer feedback, even from beginner level students.

513
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:17,230
We don't want to remove professors from the feedback process.

514
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:22,420
We just want to include students in it. So give your students that space to learn from each other.

515
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:26,440
Because even if they receive poor feedback from a peer,

516
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:31,870
the student is going to use their cognitive thinking and critical thinking to realize

517
00:52:31,870 --> 00:52:35,320
what is good feedback and what isn't and what they should apply and what they shouldn't.

518
00:52:35,530 --> 00:52:37,870
So there's value in that process as well.

519
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:46,059
And then because every iteration of Kritik, they choose a new random selection of peers to evaluate after five iterations,

520
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:52,690
they're going to have a mixture of really good critique and not so great critique, and they'll be able to learn from that process as well.

521
00:52:53,080 --> 00:53:01,340
In addition to the professor commenting and spotlighting. And a peer review, if you haven't noticed yet.

522
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:06,710
This is awesome. Thank you so much, Courtney and Cole.

523
00:53:06,770 --> 00:53:13,639
And we're kind of reaching the end of our hour and need to peel off to start the rest of our work.

524
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:21,780
But I really appreciate both the program and your your time with us and I think we'll, we'll circle back.

525
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:30,110
Cole Yeah, and probably be the next week or two to kind of talk about some next steps.

526
00:53:30,530 --> 00:53:36,889
But for right now, just thank you so much. Yeah, well, thank you for having us and I hope this is very informative.

527
00:53:36,890 --> 00:53:43,220
Anyone here has any questions? Feel free to grab my my email from Sharon or whoever else is in the room I came and see.

528
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:49,910
Yeah. Just if you have any questions, just let us know when we can speak to you all individually and go into more detail if you may need it.

529
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:55,730
All right. Thank you. Thank you. Have a good one. We'll see you soon, I.
