1
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:05,920
Unconscious Bias.

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,540
Understanding why disparities
exist is critical to intervening.

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:13,630
Since the publication of
the report Unnatural Causes,

4
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:18,740
attention to discrimination within the
healthcare system has been investigated.

5
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:23,740
You can watch the documentary video
series for Unnatural Causes on YouTube.

6
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:27,490
One issue that is highlighted in
this work is the idea of unconscious

7
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:32,650
bias that contributes to who
is viewed as healthy or not.

8
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:36,310
In this segment, we examine
unconscious bias as an opportunity for

9
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:40,420
a professional's self-reflection and
growth.

10
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:47,760
Look at this picture and
decide who you think is healthy, A or B?

11
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,653
What about the next slide, A or B?

12
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:58,280
Did you change your mind after
viewing the second picture?

13
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,020
What contributed to your decision
about which man was healthy

14
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:05,210
after viewing the first picture?

15
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:08,560
What about after viewing
the second picture?

16
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,970
Sometimes we are well aware of
why we make certain decisions.

17
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:18,400
Other times, we may not be as aware
as to why we do certain things.

18
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,530
What is unconscious bias?

19
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:27,320
Often our internal belief system dictates
how we respond to external stimuli.

20
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:33,180
These beliefs color how we think and
act in specific situations.

21
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:38,600
Unconscious biases are mental
associations we make without awareness

22
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,140
intention, or control.

23
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:46,230
The psychological literature that
supports the existence of the concept

24
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:50,940
of unconscious bias indicates that
these biases can be in conflict

25
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:57,160
with our conscious attitudes,
behaviors, intentions, and beliefs.

26
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,840
This has implications for
the individuals and systems we

27
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,330
work with in our efforts to reduce health
disparities and achieve health equity.

28
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:09,130
Might our preference for
one group over another

29
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:13,830
be due to differences in
familiarity with the groups?

30
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:17,950
Research shows that most people tend
to like and be comfortable with

31
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:23,580
things they are familiar with,
based on their own lived experiences.

32
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:30,300
In general, people tend to avoid or
respond negatively to unfamiliar things.

33
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,490
However, once we recognize and

34
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:38,560
accept that we have biases,
there are ways to reduce these biases.

35
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,820
The exercise at the beginning of this
segment was to illustrate that health,

36
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:47,220
as we understand it,
is not always objective.

37
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,720
This is especially true when we
reduce the responsibility for

38
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,500
health to the individual level.

39
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:58,500
As health professionals, we must realize
that we have an inherent understanding of

40
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:04,610
what It takes to be healthy that
must be situated within historical,

41
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:09,170
economic, and sociopolitical realities.

42
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:12,520
How is unconscious bias
connected to health?

43
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,640
Several pathways are possible.

44
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,470
These include judgement
without questioning.

45
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:23,090
Relying on stereotypical beliefs,
low expectations for

46
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:28,900
positive results, preferences
leading to selective attention.

47
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,970
Unconscious bias contributes to health and

48
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:35,795
health disparities when action
is taken without awareness.

49
00:03:35,795 --> 00:03:40,557
An awareness of these pathways with
necessary corrections can reduce

50
00:03:40,557 --> 00:03:43,525
unintentional bias.

51
00:03:43,525 --> 00:03:46,516
Our goal should be inclusive
behavior in our research and

52
00:03:46,516 --> 00:03:50,000
practice working towards health equity.

53
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,164
This includes the way
recruit participants and

54
00:03:53,164 --> 00:03:57,196
outreach to the patients to
the diversity of our work team and

55
00:03:57,196 --> 00:04:04,076
our approach to interviewing and
decision making.

56
00:04:04,076 --> 00:04:08,651
We must practice inclusive health
behaviors to ensure that all groups that

57
00:04:08,651 --> 00:04:13,910
should be included have been
included in our health equity work.

58
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:17,540
What is health equity from
a practitioner's perspective?

59
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:21,140
As a practitioner,
self-reflections are also necessary,

60
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:24,560
especially about the potential for
unconscious bias for

61
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,460
yourself and
others that are part of your team.

62
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:32,090
Be sure to use a social
determinants of health lens and

63
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:38,210
practice to avoid decontextualizing the
physical, social, economic and political

64
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:43,890
environments that influence health and
mental health for diverse populations.

65
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:47,800
Engage multiple stakeholders and
sectors in identifying and

66
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,500
implementing solutions to reduce
disparities and improve health outcomes.

67
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,950
This includes relevant community partners.

68
00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:02,702
As public health professionals, we must
be part of the solution, not the problem.
