1
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:08,639
Alison Mondul: i'm going to record all of the class sessions and I mentioned this already to some of the people who are in class in person, but.

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:17,039
Alison Mondul: I have many fine qualities as a person, I like to think, but the two things that I just cannot do correctly are I.

3
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:24,480
Alison Mondul: Always will send emails without an attachment, and I will forever forget to hit record on the thing for not giving a lecture so.

4
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:37,530
Alison Mondul: It is everybody's joint responsibility to just yell at me if I forget to start the recording don't try to be polite and wait for me to get to a place where I can stop just be like if you're after the recording and i'll be back i'm sorry okay so everybody's everybody's job.

5
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,140
Alison Mondul: No politeness just yell at me.

6
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:49,590
Alison Mondul: So apologies in advance for being that person, but thank you for your help and yelling at me to start the recording.

7
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:56,160
Alison Mondul: Alright, so I just did that and so now i'm going to go ahead and just do a quick introduction i'm gonna share my screen.

8
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:16,500
Alison Mondul: i'm going to do a little bit of introduction to me and the and the instructional aids for our class and i'm also going to tell you guys a little bit about kind of the structure of the course, so I will make chat big so that we can I can see if you have you're more than welcome to just.

9
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:26,190
Alison Mondul: We don't have to be super formal you're more than welcome to just unmute and talk and ask questions as we go or you can put them in chat and yeah please just.

10
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:36,390
Alison Mondul: I hope that we can be as interactive as possible, even though some of us are two persons right, so this is fundamentals of epidemiology up at 709.

11
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:48,840
Alison Mondul: There we go so like I said, my name is allison model there's thought I would give you a little bit of background on like how I got into public health, because I know we're all coming from very different backgrounds.

12
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:53,070
Alison Mondul: Everyone has you know kind of a different reason that they're here and.

13
00:01:53,490 --> 00:02:04,950
Alison Mondul: i'm just going to tell you kind of my visa and how I got here and then we're going to do introductions in the second half of this class today and so i'll get to hear a little bit about why all of the work here, and how you got here, so I.

14
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,280
Alison Mondul: did my undergraduate degree at the University of Illinois.

15
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:19,140
Alison Mondul: I got my bs in Microbiology, which is a degree that doesn't exist anymore so that's a fun thing about science, if you stay in it long enough, they changed the name of everything and start feel real old because your degree doesn't exist any longer.

16
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:25,470
Alison Mondul: But I mean I knew I was interested in biology and you have an interest in science and they did enjoy my degree, but um.

17
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:30,660
Alison Mondul: You know I think there was a lot less awareness of public health and epidemiology is sort of an option.

18
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:41,220
Alison Mondul: At that time, and so, when I was talking to you know people who are advisors and things like that they were kinda like well, you went to MED school or you know you can get a PhD in origin lab and I was like.

19
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:48,960
Alison Mondul: It wasn't want to do either of those things, but I like science isn't there anything else, then probably not really so, is it all right.

20
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:58,230
Alison Mondul: So I worked for two years in a lab and killed a lot of rats I didn't enjoy it and I did a little poking around, and I was.

21
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:07,380
Alison Mondul: I will also am a big true crime nerd so I was thinking about like a degree in forensic science, but it turns out, the reality of that wasn't really for me it's not like on CSI actually.

22
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:12,720
Alison Mondul: And so I ended up getting my mph at rollins School of Public Health at emory.

23
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:22,650
Alison Mondul: And it was really cool I enjoyed being there part of a thought went in thinking, I was interested in infectious disease, because that was sort of everything I read about epidemiology.

24
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:31,470
Alison Mondul: And in fact I worked for the CDC as a work, study student, while I was there and I worked on rabies and rocky mountain spotted fever surveillance, so that was kind of fun and.

25
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:42,390
Alison Mondul: But while I was there I also took a cancer epidemiology class and I really fell in love with that so after I graduated I took a job at the American cancer society where I worked for a few years.

26
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:47,220
Alison Mondul: I wanted to work at the Masters level for a little bit to kind of decide if I wanted to go back to the PhD.

27
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:56,430
Alison Mondul: And after working for a few years, I decided that, yes, I really did you know I kind of wanted to be the person who came up with the research ideas, rather than the person who kind of executed someone else's vision.

28
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:07,950
Alison Mondul: So I went back and got the PhD and went to Johns Hopkins they got my PhD in cancer epidemiology and then I did my postdoctoral fellowship and the national cancer Institute in the intramural Program.

29
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:15,660
Alison Mondul: And after that in 2014 and took a faculty position here and i've been here, ever since and that's that's the.

30
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:24,960
Alison Mondul: Then we all went off into the sunset that so so that's kind of how I got here and my research which i'll tell you a little bit about on a couple of lectures.

31
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:36,360
Alison Mondul: In the course i'm if i'm really interested in modifiable risk factors for cancer risk and progression so just the causes of cancer either initiation of tumors or progression of tumors to be.

32
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:47,400
Alison Mondul: You know, towards outcomes i've done a fair bit of work with vitamins and minerals cholesterol status and other common medications and I worked on multiple different cancers.

33
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:55,950
Alison Mondul: Including prostate cancer bladder and kidney cancer, as well as more recently i've done a fair bit of work and head and neck cancer, which is not listed here.

34
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:11,370
Alison Mondul: And then also i'm a Co investigator on my cares, which is a big undertaking that we have recently launched here at university Michigan to study environmental risk factors and cancer so we're starting a new prospective cohort, which is something you guys learned about this class.

35
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:25,410
Alison Mondul: Excuse me to study environmental risk factors for cancer we're hoping to recruit 100,008 when I was little chocolate nuggets with an element of it before.

36
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:35,940
Alison Mondul: That was clearly a mistake we're going to recruit about 100,000 people in Michigan over the next six years or so, so that is and a lot of my work is using.

37
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:44,400
Alison Mondul: questionnaire data, but I also use blood samples and do I consider myself a molecular epidemiologist so I measure, a lot of biomarkers and things and blood.

38
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:50,670
Alison Mondul: and other tissues certain saliva and i've also used, you know so hypothesis driven.

39
00:05:51,420 --> 00:06:03,840
Alison Mondul: That that's where I look at something in blood specifically around a questionnaire in relation to cancer, but i've also used agnostic methods like she was was have a little mix So hopefully some of my research will come up in future pictures.

40
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:13,800
Alison Mondul: We also have two wonderful instructional aids for our course Rachel beer and alley seeley you guys wave or make some noise, so that the camera phones you.

41
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:29,220
Alison Mondul: Can they are and Rachel is a third year PhD student in epidemiology, she has research interests and psychiatric perinatal and nutritional EPI and Ali is a second year MBA student in general Evan and her research interests are also in perinatal and nutritional ideology.

42
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:36,930
Alison Mondul: So they will be in class and helping out with the group exercises and they will also be holding office hours which we'll get to in a moment.

43
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,660
Alison Mondul: guys have anything else you wanted to add.

44
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,120
Alison Mondul: Okay.

45
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:50,610
Alison Mondul: All right, so this is the course description from the syllabus i'm not going to read it to you, I will say that.

46
00:06:52,440 --> 00:07:04,110
Alison Mondul: You know there's a few of you who I noticed in your bios have had an epidemiology course before you guys want to raise your you guys raise your hand either virtually or in person, if you have had an epidemiologist course before.

47
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,250
Alison Mondul: Okay, so most of you have not, it seems like.

48
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:21,390
Alison Mondul: So this will be new and exciting, I will say um sometimes people get into an EPI methods course.

49
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:27,900
Alison Mondul: And it's not what they thought and i've been doing this for so long i'm not sure exactly what people think they're going to be getting when they get to be methods, but.

50
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,980
Alison Mondul: Sometimes it's not what they thought it was going to be so we're going to work through it together.

51
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:48,360
Alison Mondul: This is kind of a whirlwind course because it's three weeks every single day it's a lot to take in in a short period of time, but we will do our best, there are readings and in class exercises, which I think will also help you know kind of solidify things that are in the lectures.

52
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:58,290
Alison Mondul: It is fairly quantitative so there will be a fair bit of math so if that's you know something you need to brace yourself for brace brace now for math.

53
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,070
Alison Mondul: Okay we're ready alright.

54
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,130
Alison Mondul: So.

55
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,850
Alison Mondul: The course materials are all on campus except for the book.

56
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:17,400
Alison Mondul: So I will post the lecture slides prior to class time on canvas the readings are from the gorgeous textbook which you will need for this class.

57
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:24,270
Alison Mondul: And then the additional readings will because posted on campus so just to kind of show you what the campus like looks like and how it is set up.

58
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:34,260
Alison Mondul: we've now posted the zoom link and password up here for those who want to remember it I feel like 391 looks like EPI with the in the p backwards.

59
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:35,790
Alison Mondul: What.

60
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:38,790
Alison Mondul: you're right you're right.

61
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:42,840
Alison Mondul: You share you share new share.

62
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:57,270
Alison Mondul: it's this right, yes, is that better, can you guys see it on zoom now okay great Thank you and so here you go we've now posted, this is the homepage for the canvas site.

63
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:08,130
Alison Mondul: we've got the zoom link and the password up here my password is EPI seven or nine I feel like the three of the nine look at look like an EP backwards, so if you need to remember it gets EPI seven or nine.

64
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:16,980
Alison Mondul: So this is the schedule each day has its own page so, for example, if we go to tomorrow's page you'll see.

65
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:32,340
Alison Mondul: It lists what the readings are for that day you're meant to complete that before class on that day, so before class tomorrow, you should read Chapter two, you will also complete quiz one before you come to class, this is on the readings.

66
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:39,480
Alison Mondul: And then, this is the in class exercise that will have tomorrow you guys can't see the key yet you'll be able to see it after class tomorrow.

67
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:54,060
Alison Mondul: Okay, and these are the PowerPoint slides that will be available to you shortly before the lecture starts and then after the lecture we will post, the link to the recording here so each day of class has its own little page does that make sense to everybody.

68
00:09:58,410 --> 00:09:59,550
Alison Mondul: let's go back to.

69
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:12,540
Alison Mondul: Alright, so.

70
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,330
Alison Mondul: Class requirements.

71
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:21,750
Alison Mondul: Of the final grade will be based on the following things in this proportion.

72
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:31,590
Alison Mondul: And if you are taking the course for credit, you must meet the attendance participation requirements and complete the quizzes and exams, so if you're taking it for credit you'll be doing all of this.

73
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:39,510
Alison Mondul: The only thing not required if you're not taking it for credit or the exams, although I think it's still a good idea to take them just to kind of see where you're at.

74
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:45,720
Alison Mondul: So if you're not taking it for credit I do recommend you still take the exam just to kind of as a self check.

75
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:52,320
Alison Mondul: But it's not required, but even if you're not taking it for credit you still have to attend and do the quizzes and.

76
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,030
Alison Mondul: make sense.

77
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,570
Alison Mondul: This is the grading scale, this is all in the syllabus on canvas as well.

78
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:10,680
Alison Mondul: So classes again Monday through Friday 130 to five i'll try to give you wanted to short breaks during class we're going to take attendance.

79
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:19,140
Alison Mondul: You can miss one class without penalty, and after that, please do notify me if you're going to be absent, we can you know work out a way for you to make up the work.

80
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,140
Alison Mondul: But attendance is important.

81
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:35,190
Alison Mondul: Sorry attendance is important because of the group exercises so joshua was letting us know that it's available through that online to michigan's library, those of you who do have a unique name.

82
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:41,700
Alison Mondul: Through University of Michigan can access that but people who are not affiliated with university of Michigan probably cannot, I think.

83
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:46,770
Alison Mondul: So those of you who only have a friend account for the summer won't be able to get it through the library.

84
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:53,880
Alison Mondul: Alright, so the format is there's going to be lectures and enhanced group exercises so basically each day.

85
00:11:55,230 --> 00:12:06,840
Alison Mondul: You will have read the reading for you come to class, I will end, give a lecture on that same kind of topic so you'll start to have it twice, once by reading it, and once by hearing it, which I think is kind of a good way to solidify the concepts, especially in sort of a short time frame.

86
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:18,540
Alison Mondul: And then we will do an in class group exercise where you do some of the calculation and like working with the data kinds of things that will need to do, and then we'll we'll go through and discuss it okay.

87
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:25,860
Alison Mondul: And we have assigned groups for in class work i'm planning to switch up the groups each week they're currently.

88
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:33,600
Alison Mondul: assigned as such way, so the people who are, who said that they would be attending in person can be in a group together in person and people who are virtual can be virtual.

89
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:41,160
Alison Mondul: I think we also try to keep I know, for example, there's a group of people who are all from akron children's hospital, we tried to kind of keep you guys in a group together.

90
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:54,270
Alison Mondul: so that you could work together if you're like actually physically in person, together, so we can talk a little bit as we go about how you would like to have the groups in the subsequent weeks if you'd like to kind of keep it that way, or if you'd like to switch it up a bit more.

91
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,850
Alison Mondul: But that was that was the goal.

92
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:08,700
Alison Mondul: But if there's a problem with the group or you know, for some reason it's not working, you need to move into a different group, let me know Okay, but today is a good we're going to have a little bit of a group exercise.

93
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:13,710
Alison Mondul: which will kind of help us to get into our groups and figure all that out okay.

94
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:24,810
Alison Mondul: let's see quizzes like I said, our do before class on the day it's listed, it will cover the readings assigned for that day and they're going to be completed on canvas and they're open book.

95
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,170
Alison Mondul: So pretty simple.

96
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:39,330
Alison Mondul: exams are going to be also conducted on campus and we will be given during the dates and times listed there's going to be review sessions, the day before the exams, and that will mostly be a forum for you to ask questions.

97
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:52,860
Alison Mondul: And you will also be able to ask questions and get help in the in office hours office hours I don't think I actually mentioned, they are from 1215 to 115 every day.

98
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:57,360
Alison Mondul: Did we get a room for that is that on the syllabus.

99
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:01,080
Alison Mondul: let's see let's share my screen.

100
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,450
Alison Mondul: Go here.

101
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:08,160
Alison Mondul: So if we go to the homepage and then go to the syllabus.

102
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:16,290
Alison Mondul: The Office hours are listed here so it's between 1215 and 115 Monday through Friday and in this room.

103
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:29,820
Alison Mondul: or on zoom so the teachers will be sitting in that room, they will also be logged into the zoom link, so that you can access, you know you can you can contact them via zoom or in person, the zoom link will be the class zoom it's the same one.

104
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:32,460
Alison Mondul: Okay.

105
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:36,510
Alison Mondul: alright.

106
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,120
Alison Mondul: Any questions.

107
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:47,580
Alison Mondul: You think of something as we go, we can certainly.

108
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:52,920
answer questions as needed.

109
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:01,560
Alison Mondul: Alright, so what I wanted to do that is just gives her a quick introduction.

110
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,050
Alison Mondul: To epidemiology.

111
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,180
Alison Mondul: You know I didn't.

112
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:15,630
Alison Mondul: I always just go into presenter mode without sharing the screen and then i'm like why can't I see any of the zoom things because I did it wrong that's why turns out.

113
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:22,290
Alison Mondul: Again, you can interrupt me on chat ask questions on chatter you can just unmute and ask questions as you need to.

114
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:30,840
Alison Mondul: So I thought i'm just give a little overview of epidemiology today, and this will lead us into our introduction exercise at the end.

115
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,880
Alison Mondul: So you need to be smaller your topic.

116
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:47,310
Alison Mondul: Alright, so what is epidemiology it's actually not about skin that's the joke that you know, whenever you tell somebody you're definitely now just like like a skin doctor you like, no.

117
00:15:47,940 --> 00:16:01,980
Alison Mondul: Not epidemiology that's not what it is, so the root word of course it's epidemic and so simply it's the study of health and disease and human populations and more comprehensively it's the study of the distribution and determinants of disease frequency and the populations.

118
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:14,490
Alison Mondul: So we can we can define disease kind of broadly though right So if you think about it what's kind of the first thing you guys think of when you think of a disease that you would study with epidemiology.

119
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,690
Alison Mondul: and ease diabetes that's a good one.

120
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:27,150
Alison Mondul: So we can certainly study chronic conditions like diabetes and cancer and heart disease.

121
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:31,830
Nolaundron Harris: I would say, HIV is to.

122
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:33,720
Nolaundron Harris: Help see.

123
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:41,880
Alison Mondul: yep so your listing a bunch of infectious diseases Denise says coven yes well that's all that's definitely on everybody's mind.

124
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:50,760
Alison Mondul: So we can certainly think and those are all kind of diseases right but there's other things we can study in epidemiology two people have said, can start eating mental health, we can study.

125
00:16:51,990 --> 00:17:03,240
Alison Mondul: genetics and things like that right, so there are all kinds of outcomes that we can study with epidemiologic methods that aren't necessarily diseases, per se, the way we think about it.

126
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,830
Alison Mondul: And so you can kind of.

127
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:18,330
Alison Mondul: Think of epidemiology as a toolbox a bunch of tools that we're going to use that you can apply to lots of different problems and those problems can be sort of traditional diseases, the way we think of infectious or chronic diseases, but it can also be lots of other things.

128
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:29,970
Alison Mondul: So how is it different from other health to discipline so it's the only scientific discipline that is concerned with the occurrence of disease and human populations and how that changes over time.

129
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:36,240
Alison Mondul: And epidemiology his role in public health is to develop and apply these methods for assessing health and disease.

130
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:39,630
Alison Mondul: So.

131
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:43,530
Alison Mondul: I always like to give a little short history of epidemiology.

132
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:46,710
Alison Mondul: who's heard of Jon snow anybody.

133
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:53,340
Alison Mondul: Any big nerds move into the Jon snow pub in.

134
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,170
Alison Mondul: In London.

135
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:00,660
Alison Mondul: With stuff that says that he has heard of it, of him josh joshua has.

136
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:16,020
Alison Mondul: What else Ian Okay, so a few of you have heard of johnstown so he lived in the 1800s in England and he is considered the father of epidemiology.

137
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:23,490
Alison Mondul: In addition to what i'm going to tell you about his work on color he also introduced chloroform for Labor and delivery of to queen victoria's children.

138
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:29,160
Alison Mondul: And he discovered the real culprit of the cholera epidemic was water contaminated by fecal waste.

139
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:39,990
Alison Mondul: So there were a lot of you know kind of theories about what was collard causing cholera, at the time there's this miasmic theory of disease right that it was my asthma, those are like that smells or bad air.

140
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:53,610
Alison Mondul: which can cause some things we've all heard recently was why we're all wearing our masks right but not cholera, thankfully, so basically there was opened dumping of sewage and the Thames river.

141
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:58,440
Alison Mondul: The three different water companies, the South work the box on the land with water companies.

142
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:08,190
Alison Mondul: And the South and box will companies were down river, so you know they dumped the the sewage way up here and then flow down and then these two companies out there, water from down here.

143
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:10,860
Alison Mondul: The land with water company was up river of where.

144
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:20,310
Alison Mondul: The sewage was dumped and so it was cleaner and people who bought their what he figured out that people who bought their water from the lemon water company have lower color rates than people who are getting their water from these other two companies.

145
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:29,520
Alison Mondul: So color is caused by bacteria give you a cholera, it is transmitted by fecal oral transmission.

146
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:36,000
Alison Mondul: So if you drink contaminated water or eat raw or under seafood from contaminated water, you can get it.

147
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:45,330
Alison Mondul: The incubation period is usually two to three days, but it can be anywhere from hours to five days and we're going to talk more tomorrow about what the incubation period is.

148
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:53,610
Alison Mondul: And the symptoms are basically sudden onset of profuse painless water is tools and basically what happens is people rapidly dehydrates.

149
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:57,330
Alison Mondul: This can progress to acidophilus and circulatory collapse.

150
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:09,570
Alison Mondul: And it can happen within hours and if it's untreated the case fatality rate is 50% so we're also going to talk about what the case fatality rate means and how to calculate that essentially is the proportion of people with the disease, who died of it.

151
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:15,240
Alison Mondul: Right, so if you get cholera if you're not treated 50% of people who get it will die.

152
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,910
Alison Mondul: If it's treated as less than 1%.

153
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:28,080
Alison Mondul: So there have been lots and lots of epidemics and pandemics, a cholera throughout history in the 1800s about 90,000 deaths occurred in Paris in three months, which is.

154
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:36,060
Alison Mondul: bonkers and it kind of kept going all through the 1800s basically every 10 years you'd have more more of these.

155
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:52,770
Alison Mondul: epidemics and pandemics in 1961 as recently as 1961 there was the seventh pandemic and parts of Asia Asia Bangladesh, India West Africa, and then in Latin America, also in like 291, so this is continues to be a public health problem in more developing areas of the world.

156
00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:07,920
Alison Mondul: So these are terms that we have all unfortunately heard a lot lately, so we should probably define these so epidemic is the occurrence in a population of an illness that is clearly in excess of normal expectancy.

157
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,480
Alison Mondul: How do we know if there's an epidemic going on.

158
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,560
Alison Mondul: of something, how would you know.

159
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:36,960
Alison Mondul: He say something like you're with everyone something yes flu everyone's suffering but there's some amount of flu that's endemic right that's usual or constant right so there's some amount that's normal So how can you tell if you have an epidemic.

160
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,410
Alison Mondul: Death that's a good one right.

161
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:46,710
Alison Mondul: But you have to be counting these things right.

162
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:55,560
Alison Mondul: You have to have some way of knowing what's normal so that you can then tell what's not normal right.

163
00:21:56,040 --> 00:22:13,770
Alison Mondul: So that's where all of these disease surveillance systems come in right there's lots of epidemiology, that is around counting and understanding what normal levels of disease are in a population, because you have to know that, in order to be able to tell when something is not mobile right.

164
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:21,510
Alison Mondul: You can't know if something's higher than normal if you don't know what normal is right, so you have to know kind of what the academic level is.

165
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:32,940
Alison Mondul: And then, of course, a pandemic is an epidemic which affects a large proportion of the population, usually involving several companies influenza pandemics and, of course, we have the coke epidemic more recently.

166
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:39,750
Alison Mondul: So let's go back to talking about the cholera outbreak of.

167
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:51,510
Alison Mondul: That may Jon snow famous as the father of that ideology, so he first determine the color desperate clustered around this particular popular source of drinking water, the broad street punk.

168
00:22:52,590 --> 00:23:04,410
Alison Mondul: He collected information or 300,000 people in the population, and he looked at cholera mortalities in areas of London, where water suppliers could be identified you walk door to door inquiring about water source where cholera fatalities occurred.

169
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:11,370
Alison Mondul: So this is some pretty shoe leather epidemiology we call it right actually going door to door interviewing people.

170
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:21,810
Alison Mondul: trying to get people to talk to him I bet he got a lot of doors slammed his face, you have to you have to you know recruit people, for your study and get people to be in your study right it's can be hard.

171
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:30,420
Alison Mondul: and his research determined or demonstrated that fatality rates were higher among households receiving contaminated water from those two companies that I mentioned before.

172
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:38,640
Alison Mondul: This was actually an acceptable to the medical community, because the contract contradicted the miasmic theory which was popular at the time right.

173
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:46,110
Alison Mondul: So a lot of times, people are right and people don't like it, so these are his his tables we're going to see a lot of these kind of.

174
00:23:46,560 --> 00:24:01,290
Alison Mondul: Two by two tables or to buy something tables right it's an epidemiologist favorite thing to do is drop tables like this, so these are the three water companies sauce telework and southwark inbox so both companies in Lambeth right, so this is.

175
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,040
Alison Mondul: People who.

176
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:19,440
Alison Mondul: This is the death rates right and so he's got the population at 51, this is the color adapts and the deaths per 100,000 right, so you can see there's basically no depth for Lambda but a bunch for the other ones.

177
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:21,330
Alison Mondul: Okay.

178
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:29,970
Alison Mondul: This is, according to you know, this is, according to the sub districts London, this is, according to the actual house.

179
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:36,990
Alison Mondul: it's probably not exactly perfect you can still see that South working box are much higher than Lambeth.

180
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:44,790
Alison Mondul: Probably it's not perfect, because people could have gotten drink of water at somebody else's house or really worked or whatever right.

181
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,280
Alison Mondul: So these are the kinds of data that we're going to learn how to calculate and to to use.

182
00:24:52,260 --> 00:25:02,130
Alison Mondul: Alright, so he had this generalized observation, he undertook a systematic collection and analysis of data and then he undertook a public health intervention does anybody know what this public health intervention was.

183
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,860
Alison Mondul: For the who's heard the lower.

184
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:15,120
Alison Mondul: story of the lower of Jon snow he took the handle off of the broad street folks so the nobody could get water out of it anymore.

185
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:27,720
Alison Mondul: Now, if you go to snopes it turns out that he actually did not stop the cholera epidemic, because the epidemic was already waiting at that point, but once he had figured it out to the top off so.

186
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:37,260
Alison Mondul: He probably taking the handle off the pump probably did not actually stopped the epidemic, but he was correct that that that that pump was a source of contaminated water.

187
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:45,690
Alison Mondul: But anyway, it's a better story if we say that he took the handle off the pump and it stopped the.

188
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:51,360
Alison Mondul: epidemic, but I think that is just correlation not causation, unfortunately.

189
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:53,820
Alison Mondul: All right.

190
00:25:56,070 --> 00:26:12,870
Alison Mondul: here's another famous name in the history of epidemiology Bernardino her Nazi and he loved even earlier, the 16th and 1700s so he actually was interested in occupational epidemiology, which is sort of a subset of epidemiology, that we will talk about a bit.

191
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:20,280
Alison Mondul: He had an encounter with a cesspool worker I don't know what exactly, that is, it does not sound great I have to say.

192
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:31,650
Alison Mondul: And this led to his interest in the relation between work and health so he's not that there could be two causes of disease in workers one was in blocks inhalation of noxious papers and particles.

193
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:39,210
Alison Mondul: Certainly, is a thing in some occupations and i'm not a natural postures imposed on a body, while doing work.

194
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:48,840
Alison Mondul: And i'm sure he meant something much more extreme but you know we all have the ergonomic people who come in and teach us how not to like get carpal tunnel now right so.

195
00:26:49,290 --> 00:27:08,910
Alison Mondul: That is certainly something that has survived into into the modern era, so he identified the dangers of mercury of lead, which are very bad and he identified the link between varicose veins and lots of standing and sciatica among Potters a hernia and lifting heavy loads.

196
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:21,120
Alison Mondul: So I do, I always think it's very interesting that, like these things that we kind of know about now and still know are true we're kind of found out about so early I always think that's kind of cool.

197
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:33,600
Alison Mondul: So how about in the US in 1850 we have let me will shattuck he had the he turned up to the first report of sanitation and public health in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

198
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:41,460
Alison Mondul: And this kind of establish the importance of the state and local boards of health, he organized an effort to collect and analyze vital statistics.

199
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:51,060
Alison Mondul: And he taught, sanitation and prevention in medical schools and this became standard because of his work, so one of the very like you know very first.

200
00:27:51,420 --> 00:28:00,360
Alison Mondul: kind of accomplishments of public health really was sanitation and hygiene right kind of separating the color thing is a very good example of very separating the sewage water sources.

201
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:07,170
Alison Mondul: What do we mean by Vital statistics does anybody know what vital statistics are.

202
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:10,560
Alison Mondul: Specifically.

203
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:26,670
Alison Mondul: lake city or county dolly's mortality for sure so vital statistics really are births and deaths right so it's like birth counts and death counts that's right nice good job.

204
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:33,600
Alison Mondul: yep and there are other things that we collected part of vital statistics but mostly that's that's mostly it.

205
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:43,140
Alison Mondul: Right in the 1850s we started with quarantine conventions to prevent type this color yellow fever, we have portland immigrant immigrant quarantine.

206
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:50,520
Alison Mondul: In 1902 the US public health service was established in 1913 the first School of Public Health the Harvard School of Public Health has established.

207
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:54,570
Alison Mondul: other kind of major.

208
00:28:56,790 --> 00:29:08,730
Alison Mondul: waypoints important in time points in US public health for us epidemiology history is anyone heard of the framingham heart study, this is a really major cohort study of.

209
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:26,760
Alison Mondul: cardiovascular disease and it's one of the oldest it was established in 1948 in framingham Massachusetts they recruited, a large proportion of the city of framing and essentially it was a prospective cover study where they followed that over time and they were able to study.

210
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:39,720
Alison Mondul: coronary heart disease that's what chg is coronary heart disease and stroke gallbladder disease and death they had 5100 participants who were followed for 30 years so that's very impressive.

211
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:51,090
Alison Mondul: We also have in 1947 the doll and hill study, so this is one of the very first case control study is that established a link between smoking and lung cancer.

212
00:29:52,560 --> 00:30:04,500
Alison Mondul: And there was also the British physicians health, say, which confirms the association with they found a tenfold increase in risk of lung cancer among smokers it's actually quite a bit higher than that, if you take into account, you know dose response and that kind of thing.

213
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:15,900
Alison Mondul: But these are some of the first studies to establish the link between cigarette smoking and lung cancer and led the 1964 surgeon general's report of smoking and health which basically said yes.

214
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,450
Alison Mondul: Smoking causes lung cancer.

215
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:30,510
Alison Mondul: We also have some missteps in our history of epidemiology and public health in the United States, how many people have heard of the ski syphilis study.

216
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:41,580
Alison Mondul: You have you have a lot of you have good, because this is something we all need to know about, so that it never gets repeated.

217
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:51,120
Alison Mondul: This was conducted from 1932 1972 I want you to look at that last date there, which is kind of Horrifyingly recent.

218
00:30:52,200 --> 00:31:03,690
Alison Mondul: It was began in 1932 and black men in the southern us they recruited 399 men with syphilis and 200 million without disease and the goal was to justify treatment programs for syphilis for for blacks.

219
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:13,110
Alison Mondul: The study was conducted with out the patient's informed consent them were told they were being treated for bad blood which was sort of this colloquial term for a lot of different things, including syphilis.

220
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:20,310
Alison Mondul: them and receive free medical exams free meals and free burial insurance, but they were denied treatment and investment to the military.

221
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:31,140
Alison Mondul: And this became important when penicillin became available in 1945 so prior to 1945 there really wasn't an effective treatment for syphilis but beginning in 1945 there was.

222
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:36,960
Alison Mondul: and went on for almost 20 years after that, where these men were being denied appropriate treatment through this disease.

223
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:43,980
Alison Mondul: So they were you know, there was a lack of informed consent, they didn't really they weren't really told what they were being treated for.

224
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:54,870
Alison Mondul: They were not offered treatment once it became available and the other thing that was important here, there was really unethical, is that they were really being offered kind of.

225
00:31:56,430 --> 00:32:12,300
Alison Mondul: course of incentives right these incentives freedom medical exams free meals free burial insurance all of that was enough to really incentivize people to participate when they to kind of override informed consent right so you're offering coercive Lee.

226
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,150
Alison Mondul: Good incentives to these people.

227
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:24,450
Alison Mondul: So the story broken 1972 the study was stopped in the class action lawsuit was settled the US Government paid $10 million to untreated survivors and their heirs.

228
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:36,540
Alison Mondul: And this led to the 1974 national research Act, which began the process of require an IRB review and informed consent requirements for studies using human subjects.

229
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:40,500
Alison Mondul: And you can read more about this study here at the CDC website.

230
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:51,180
Alison Mondul: So some you know good things, and some bad things that have happened in our history.

231
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:59,280
Alison Mondul: um so the history and development of epidemiology and epidemiologic methods focus mostly on infectious diseases so.

232
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,060
Alison Mondul: You know, when I said what are some of the things you guys think most of a lot of.

233
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:12,960
Alison Mondul: A lot of chronic diseases came up, but I think epidemiology was kind of a originally applied to the study of infectious disease, because these were the big public health problems right hygiene and infectious disease.

234
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:16,950
Alison Mondul: So, since then, though we.

235
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:30,150
Alison Mondul: Are our population here in the US has really undergone the epidemic what we call the epidemiologic transition right, and so this is kind of a transition from infectious to non infectious disease as the most important public health problems are the most important causes of death.

236
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:38,670
Alison Mondul: And this is really occurred in the US and in other developed nations right, so there are developing countries that are currently undergoing this transition.

237
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:48,330
Alison Mondul: it ends up so that the, the population is aging so younger people are dying less of infectious diseases.

238
00:33:48,900 --> 00:34:05,670
Alison Mondul: People live longer and therefore non infectious diseases, become the age structure of the population becomes more talk heavy meaning there's it's an older population and non infectious diseases, become an important more important public health problem and source of morbidity and mortality.

239
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:10,380
Alison Mondul: So this is kind of what has been happening in developed countries.

240
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:30,690
Alison Mondul: So here are death rates per 100,000 people in the US in 1900 and what you can see, is we've got pneumonia tuberculosis diarrhea heart disease, chronic arthritis unintentional injuries stroke diseases of early infancy, cancer and diphtheria, so we've got 123.

241
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:42,900
Alison Mondul: Probably four or five infectious pauses here so half of them are infectious right and definitely the top top you are infectious diseases right.

242
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:46,500
Alison Mondul: Compare that to the year 2000.

243
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:52,560
Alison Mondul: We got almost all of these are not infectious.

244
00:34:53,610 --> 00:35:04,560
Alison Mondul: Right you got heart disease, cancer stroke lung disease, which is mostly like COPD and emphysema that kind of thing unintentional injuries still bear pneumonia influenza.

245
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:15,120
Alison Mondul: Diabetes alzheimer's kidney disease and septa cydia so a real transition right to the top causes of death being chronic.

246
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,940
Alison Mondul: Non infectious diseases.

247
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,760
Alison Mondul: Non communicable diseases.

248
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:26,490
Alison Mondul: Anything surprised anybody there any questions about that comments.

249
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:34,290
Okay.

250
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:43,800
Alison Mondul: So in epidemiology, we really kind of have five main objectives number one is to identify the cause of disease and its risk factors.

251
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:48,450
Alison Mondul: to determine determine the extent of disease found in the Community.

252
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:52,650
Alison Mondul: to study the natural history and prognosis of disease.

253
00:35:53,910 --> 00:36:00,540
Alison Mondul: To evaluate new preventive and therapeutic measures and to provide a foundation for developing public policy.

254
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:09,690
Alison Mondul: So i'm going to kind of go through each of these and give examples, so the first objective was to identify the cause of disease and it's a risk factors.

255
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:21,150
Alison Mondul: So this includes field work, for example, maybe to identify the cause that have agents here, for example, as can be Carter the yellow fever expert of the public health service in 1898 so he's out in the field, presumably collecting.

256
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,280
Alison Mondul: speedos.

257
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:33,930
Alison Mondul: One assumes, although they're not visible on the picture we don't have that that the film's little grainy can't see the mosquitoes but I bet you there there, it looks like a place that has mosquitoes to say.

258
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:44,700
Alison Mondul: um you know it often balls field worker bench work, for example here at CDC disease defensive midfield taking samples of a toxic spill so.

259
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:50,640
Alison Mondul: These are people who were pretty epidemiological intelligence service doing outbreak investigations and they're actually taking sort of.

260
00:36:51,030 --> 00:37:06,540
Alison Mondul: Environmental samples to look at toxins in the environment, so you might take samples of that you can also do you know questionnaire kind of work right to find out to kind of assess exposures to things.

261
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:21,000
Alison Mondul: here's a slightly older article now i'm trying to figure out what the cause of the book is right, I think people have now decided that probably BATs are the source of the virus or the.

262
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:33,450
Alison Mondul: What am I trying to say the not the source, but the reservoir the reservoir for the virus, like the natural reservoir and then it spills over into humans, on occasion, right, but they were really trying to figure this out.

263
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:46,320
Alison Mondul: You know, it also includes studying the conditions under which people live and work, so we talked about maybe taking samples in the vectors of mosquitoes we've talked about environmental samples.

264
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:54,990
Alison Mondul: But here we have investigations of the garment industries and 1910 so looking at unsanitary conditions child Labor these were tuberculosis hotspots.

265
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:03,120
Alison Mondul: You know, so that kind of thing can be an exposure that you want to understand as a potential cause of disease.

266
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:10,680
Alison Mondul: here's another one that I think is sort of fun, this is an occupational exposure so in 1775.

267
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:21,120
Alison Mondul: Personal pot, maybe observation that exposure to sit might explain the high incidence of screwed in cancer and chimney sweeps Has anybody ever heard of scrotum cancer.

268
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:34,710
Alison Mondul: No cuz it like well says yes it's basically impossibly rare right like it just, it is even a cancer that we see anymore.

269
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:40,740
Alison Mondul: Like if you look at the top 20 cancers you're not going to see scrotum cancer in there it's just.

270
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,350
Alison Mondul: not something that happens.

271
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:53,640
Alison Mondul: But chimney sweeps in 1775 you might imagine got real dirty and they didn't you know.

272
00:38:54,450 --> 00:39:02,550
Alison Mondul: be a lot and so essentially if you're crawling around in a chimney and getting all of that product of combustion the ashes, so it all over you.

273
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:09,930
Alison Mondul: And it gets on the skin of the scrotum that's within skin and those kinds of carcinogens can really cause a problem there.

274
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:22,740
Alison Mondul: And this is actually something that you see a lot in occupational epidemiology it's it's almost like canary in the coal mine kind of stuff right it's like people who are exposed to something in really high concentrations in an odd ways.

275
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:37,320
Alison Mondul: Get sort of this very strange disease or strange outcome but really raises red flags right you're like whoa that's weird that's a very weird thing that's happening in this very specific population that's exposed in high amounts to this one thing right.

276
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:47,310
Alison Mondul: And we know now that the products of combustion can cause cancer in lots of different ways right, we know that there's lots of different potentially carcinogenic chemicals in them that's why smoking is bad for you in part.

277
00:39:47,760 --> 00:40:07,350
Alison Mondul: Right so um we now can like extend this to other kinds of exposures at lower levels other kinds of exposures of other ways right eating chart meat, for example, has been associated with colon cancer risk and some of those same chemicals are at play.

278
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:17,430
Alison Mondul: But yeah, so this is some of the ways in which occupational that is obviously understanding occupational risks, so that we can protect workers is important but also.

279
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:29,130
Alison Mondul: It gives us clues as to what kinds of chemicals and things might be a problem for people who are being exposed even lower levels and you may not have noticed like this big red flag waving flag right.

280
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:35,700
Alison Mondul: In the general population, because they're exposed at lower levels and in different ways, but it still could be a problem that makes sense.

281
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:40,020
alright.

282
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:56,910
Alison Mondul: So that's the first objective, the second objective is really to determine the extent of disease found in the Community, so this involves going to the people right, for example, there were real cemetery service connected in 1900 1920 which led to bill establishment of local health departments.

283
00:40:58,050 --> 00:41:01,620
Alison Mondul: It still involves went to the people, how many people have heard of and heinous.

284
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:04,710
Alison Mondul: Maybe different of enhance.

285
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:09,090
Alison Mondul: joshua loves them haynes.

286
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:18,660
Alison Mondul: So enhances the national health and nutrition examination survey, it is an ongoing survey of.

287
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:28,470
Alison Mondul: The US population so essentially every year they get a sample of people from the different place in the US, and it is ongoing happens every single year.

288
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:34,590
Alison Mondul: And it is meant to be nationally representative, so the oversample certain populations, so that you can then use math to essentially.

289
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:43,800
Alison Mondul: weight things and get nationally representative estimates of things, and so they do a lot of work on nutrition, but also like kind of anything you can imagine right they actually.

290
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:52,230
Alison Mondul: take these mobile examination centers so it's like the role of these big like semi truck trailers that have little labs and like.

291
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:57,300
Alison Mondul: Doctors offices and then essentially and they just sort of like roll up in the Community.

292
00:41:57,630 --> 00:42:05,730
Alison Mondul: And they go to a household interview, and then they have these people come to the MAC the mobile examination Center and they'll do like a Texas scandal do a dental exam they do.

293
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:17,250
Alison Mondul: BMI measurements they do all I mean just unbelievable amounts of like they take blood samples they take toenail samples they they do everything and it's just kind of an amazing.

294
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:30,780
Alison Mondul: enterprise that they think basically roll up this entire like doctor's office in the lab in a parking lot somewhere and do this study every year it's pretty cool it's a great source of data.

295
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:37,260
Alison Mondul: And so it's also about establishing surveillance systems right.

296
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:46,110
Alison Mondul: So you when you're establishing a surveillance system, you have to know what your goal Is your goal to understand you know how much disease there and we're going to talk about this in more detail tomorrow.

297
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:54,000
Alison Mondul: You have also have to develop case definitions you're going to you're going to develop a case definition and work with some real data to try to develop the case definition.

298
00:42:55,170 --> 00:43:03,450
Alison Mondul: You have to select appropriate personnel, you have to acquire tools and clearances for collection, analysis and dissemination of your data, you have to implement your surveillance.

299
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:07,950
Alison Mondul: And then you actually have to evaluate your activities and estimate your disease frequencies.

300
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:17,430
Alison Mondul: And a surveillance system involves not only collecting the information but also disseminating the information right you actually have to provide the information to the public and to to people who need it.

301
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:23,160
Alison Mondul: So this isn't a summary of notifiable diseases this isn't everything.

302
00:43:24,330 --> 00:43:29,490
Alison Mondul: But it is some of the notifiable diseases for the CDC so Does that mean what does the notifiable disease.

303
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:53,070
Alison Mondul: So notifiable disease is a disease that is obviously these lists and essentially you are it's yes that's right Chelsea here, you have to report it to the health state or local health department which then reports that to the CDC right and.

304
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,430
Alison Mondul: For most of these there's not actually.

305
00:43:57,810 --> 00:44:09,810
Alison Mondul: it's all carrots and no sticks if that makes any sense so there's no like punishment if somebody doesn't report, one of these things for some of them there's like money if if a state or.

306
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:19,590
Alison Mondul: State or locality has like perfect reporting a really high high quality reporting of these things so HIV is a good example right like HIV infection.

307
00:44:20,610 --> 00:44:27,000
Alison Mondul: or a's reporting if you if you have like really complete reporting there's money and your state can get money to do stuff with it.

308
00:44:28,530 --> 00:44:39,960
Alison Mondul: Some of these other things like when I was there at CDC I told you that you know we rabies and rocky mountain spotted fever were to have the notifiable diseases that I was collecting data on.

309
00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:51,840
Alison Mondul: And I it was like 2001 or something like that, and I was calling all of the State health departments have like a list that actually called them on the phone hey hi is the CDC it's.

310
00:44:54,360 --> 00:45:03,510
Alison Mondul: rabies numbers from you that would be so great, because nobody has money for rabies like nobody's giving state health departments, a bunch of money and they have a million other things that they're doing.

311
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:14,490
Alison Mondul: But I was my job to try to like get the so it was this really interesting balance right, I couldn't be like you have to report, you know Bible seizes it's really it's on the list, like you, can't be a jerk about it like that, because.

312
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:19,170
Alison Mondul: there's really no consequence to them if they don't do it, and they have 900 other things that they're doing.

313
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,110
Alison Mondul: But yeah so that was an interesting.

314
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:29,550
Alison Mondul: boots on the ground kind of experience for me and trying to get notifiable diseases reported to CDC.

315
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:43,350
Alison Mondul: Yes, hospitals can get penalized if they don't report these diseases when they're out in the truth but animal rabies, for example, I was getting a lot of animal most of the rabies reports or animal reports right.

316
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:54,930
Alison Mondul: So I was getting like three rabid recruits in central park from the New York City health department, there are rabid recruits in central park I learned this from my stint at CDC so just be careful.

317
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:58,380
Alison Mondul: But yeah, that is true.

318
00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:10,470
Alison Mondul: All right, another notifiable disease is cancer, so we have a robust cancer surveillance system in the United States.

319
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:27,330
Alison Mondul: In 1971 the national cancer Act was signed by Richard Nixon the strengthen the national cancer Institute and began the seer registry the surveillance epidemiology and results was started in 1973 and it is ongoing so that's another example of disease surveillance.

320
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:34,260
Alison Mondul: So our third objective in epidemiology is to study the natural history and prognosis of disease.

321
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:45,180
Alison Mondul: So you know it involves trying to understand disease biology, for example, here is a smallpox case and the prognosis is not good.

322
00:46:51,570 --> 00:47:03,990
Alison Mondul: You know, we want to understand the understanding ins and outs of diseases helps it snow what diseases we have communities to what to these as we harbor and share with each other and what diseases we develop as a normal part of aging, for example.

323
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:16,890
Alison Mondul: So our fourth objective is to evaluate new preventative and therapeutic measures, and so one of the things I think when we think about this, we often think about drug.

324
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:25,080
Alison Mondul: trials for maybe the vaccine trials to get the COPA vaccine out really quickly right so preventive measure, it would be a vaccine.

325
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:34,830
Alison Mondul: Therapeutic measure would be you know, a drug, for example, to treat something, but there are other preventive measures or therapeutic measures that we might be interested in, for example.

326
00:47:35,550 --> 00:47:51,300
Alison Mondul: Examining the effects of the health education campaign right So this was a health education campaign from quite a long time ago, obviously, saying sanitary products are cheaper than coffins so you should work on your sanitation, because otherwise you might get something awful and die.

327
00:47:53,730 --> 00:47:56,760
Alison Mondul: Not a very soft touch here right but.

328
00:47:58,230 --> 00:48:00,390
Alison Mondul: This was a public health campaign.

329
00:48:01,470 --> 00:48:13,830
Alison Mondul: help ensure education campaign so you might look at whether you know before and after this campaign behavior head was different right, for example, did more people invest in a cemetery pretty after this campaign was rolled out.

330
00:48:16,290 --> 00:48:23,670
Alison Mondul: You might also track the effects of vaccination and other clinical interventions, this is an example, these are type receiver and occupations in the south of the 1930s.

331
00:48:27,870 --> 00:48:45,630
Alison Mondul: So you know we define the problem we collect our data we do surveillance, we identify causes so we're doing risk factor identification we develop and test our inner about our interventions and then we try to implement these interventions and measure their effectiveness right so.

332
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:49,170
Alison Mondul: Public awareness training all of that kind of stuff.

333
00:48:50,400 --> 00:49:01,530
Alison Mondul: This is another kind of way of thinking about those five goals, so at this point, our fifth objective is to provide a foundation for developing public policy and regulatory decisions.

334
00:49:02,310 --> 00:49:12,540
Alison Mondul: And epidemiologists are all a little bit different in terms of how much they actually become involved in trying to shape policy but I mean, I think.

335
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:19,560
Alison Mondul: At the end of the day, we're all in public health and epidemiology, because we want to be able to tell people.

336
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:35,190
Alison Mondul: or tell policymakers, something that they can do either to change their individual behavior or to change policies in order to really change health right, we want to come up with answers that are actionable right at a population level that's kind of the ultimate goal.

337
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:48,660
Alison Mondul: So you know, the idea is that we might be doing research, we talked about a bunch of different types of research laboratory and field observations of adverse health effects of exposure particular agents.

338
00:49:49,230 --> 00:49:56,550
Alison Mondul: Maybe information on extrapolation methods for high to low dose and animal to human maybe field measurements estimating exposures.

339
00:49:57,450 --> 00:50:05,790
Alison Mondul: And then we would do some sort of risk assessment right, this is kind of the analysis phase analyzing the data and then you will try to develop regulatory actions.

340
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:21,420
Alison Mondul: And maybe evaluate the consequences of those regulatory actions, a good example of some of this is people have done a lot of work, looking at health outcomes and various things before and after the implementation of the affordable care act.

341
00:50:22,650 --> 00:50:24,960
Alison Mondul: Right, so this was a policy that was put into place.

342
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:36,810
Alison Mondul: To provide health insurance to more people and people are sort of looking at some of this population level data before and after that was implemented and trying to understand if anything has changed as a result of that.

343
00:50:37,530 --> 00:50:42,660
Alison Mondul: that's an example of you know, contrary to evaluate a regulatory action.

344
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:48,390
Alison Mondul: we've also seen, for example, can anybody else think of another policy.

345
00:50:49,410 --> 00:50:56,010
Alison Mondul: That might have been implemented, as a result of public health findings were epidemiologic findings.

346
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:12,900
Nolaundron Harris: i'm not sure, but I would say that sometimes I guess like certain.

347
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:26,220
Nolaundron Harris: Health diseases house criminals criminalization laws behind them back can kind of determine whether somebody addresses a health issue or if they engage or not.

348
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:29,790
Alison Mondul: What do you can you give me an example of what you're thinking of.

349
00:51:30,570 --> 00:51:31,260
So.

350
00:51:32,370 --> 00:51:42,570
Nolaundron Harris: What let's talk about Kobe people do not want to get tested, they did not want to go to the hospital they didn't want to hear other family members of friends talk about Coleman yeah.

351
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:44,310
Nolaundron Harris: I mean.

352
00:51:45,570 --> 00:51:57,120
Nolaundron Harris: So when that vaccines were available, some people have the option to choose to take or not, some people felt that taking a backseat will put them at more risk some film that taking a backseat with.

353
00:51:58,020 --> 00:52:02,610
Nolaundron Harris: protect them, so people have to take that information and decide what they wanted to do with it, I mean.

354
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:18,180
Alison Mondul: And I think there will be a lot of studies, looking at sort of the policies and how vaccines were presented to people and how they were rolled out and all of that kind of stuff and how that affected the effectiveness and the uptake I think that'll be definitely true.

355
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:22,740
Alison Mondul: um.

356
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,950
Alison Mondul: Maybe Another example is.

357
00:52:26,730 --> 00:52:27,540
Abby Sossen (she/her): flat one.

358
00:52:28,410 --> 00:52:28,950
Alison Mondul: Go ahead.

359
00:52:29,190 --> 00:52:46,200
Abby Sossen (she/her): I was just thinking like a food service industry like I waiters a lot and I think like probably a lot of I mean laws and regulations that employees have to follow as far as not just obviously washing your hands but changing gloves or.

360
00:52:47,250 --> 00:52:59,190
Abby Sossen (she/her): sanitizing or things there's very particular laws in the food service industry, and I think most of them are probably based on like epic genealogy or trying to prevent foodborne diseases from.

361
00:52:59,190 --> 00:53:08,490
Alison Mondul: Spreading her absolutely yes and i'm sure that people have studied like the the occurrence of food borne disease like before and after these things were implemented absolutely.

362
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,240
Alison Mondul: anybody else have when they were thinking of.

363
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:27,420
Alison Mondul: So I was thinking about fully fortification in the food supply anybody know about that what that was for.

364
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:38,280
Alison Mondul: So fully is a vitamin that prevents neural tube defects in pregnancy, so, for example, spina bifida is, it is a neural tube defects.

365
00:53:39,270 --> 00:53:43,980
Alison Mondul: And the trouble is that you know so fully is in.

366
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:54,000
Alison Mondul: prenatal vitamins right, so if you're planning to become pregnant, you can be taking these prenatal vitamins, while you're trying to become pregnant and it can prevent neural tube defects The trouble is a lot of pregnancies are unplanned right.

367
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:57,240
Alison Mondul: And you have to be taking full late during the first.

368
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:09,750
Alison Mondul: 668 weeks or something like that a pregnancy in order to prevent the neural tube defects from happening it's very early in a time when women may not realize that they're pregnant right so.

369
00:54:10,590 --> 00:54:20,130
Alison Mondul: One of some kind of public health measure that the US and a lot of countries have undertaken, is to fortify the grain supply with fully so you can actually look at neural tube defects.

370
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:26,820
Alison Mondul: incidence rates kind of before and after the fully implementation and see that they just come way way down.

371
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:31,740
Alison Mondul: So that's a that's kind of a cool example.

372
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:35,580
Alison Mondul: Alright well.

373
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:48,000
Alison Mondul: I think now what we want to do is, we want to work on getting into our groups what i'd like you guys to do is to oh sorry joshua since when was michigan's indoor smoking ban active I don't know when Michigan did it.

374
00:54:49,230 --> 00:54:56,550
Alison Mondul: Particularly it was all happening kind of in the early 2000s, but that is another good example indoor smoking bans.

375
00:54:57,630 --> 00:55:11,880
Alison Mondul: I do know that when I was at Johns Hopkins in 2005 ish 2006 they had just enacted and or smoking bans and like bars in baltimore, and so there were people who were doing work looking at.

376
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:18,690
Alison Mondul: sort of more immediate biomarkers or test results of.

377
00:55:19,770 --> 00:55:28,170
Alison Mondul: servers bartenders and waitresses in thinking again 2010 for Michigan I suspected, it was a couple years later.

378
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:37,620
Alison Mondul: than one where I wasn't baltimore but yeah so essentially they were looking at like blood pressure and respiratory function and putting it in the blood and things like that.

379
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:44,520
Alison Mondul: To show that there was sort of these immediate health benefits to people who are working in in these in these places.

380
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:47,070
Alison Mondul: cool.

381
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:55,890
Alison Mondul: Alright, so let's go ahead and take like a what time is it let's take a 10 minute break it's 230 now so let's come back at 240 and then we'll get into our groups.

382
00:55:56,370 --> 00:56:01,740
Alison Mondul: And when you get into your groups what i'd like to do is have you kind of introduce yourself to one another, I would like YouTube.

383
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:09,210
Alison Mondul: And you're going to introduce yourselves eventually to the to the group as well, so kind of talked about this in your group and then.

384
00:56:09,870 --> 00:56:16,410
Alison Mondul: And then present your own thing to the class, but essentially I want you to think about kind of these these objectives right these objectives one through five.

385
00:56:17,790 --> 00:56:22,650
Alison Mondul: And kind of where your work falls on this list.

386
00:56:23,730 --> 00:56:38,280
Alison Mondul: Like I would say that i'm kind of in one and three, is really where i'm at in terms of most of my work i'm trying to understand the causes of cancer or the causes of cancer progression so that's sort of where my work, mostly falls.

387
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:47,190
Alison Mondul: But you know with depending upon you know what kind of work, you guys are engaged in you might be falling somewhere in one of these other.

388
00:56:47,310 --> 00:56:55,560
Alison Mondul: One of these other groups, so I want you to think about that, I want you also to you know be prepared to introduce yourself to your small group and also the larger group just kind of briefly.

389
00:56:56,160 --> 00:57:07,380
Alison Mondul: And i'm also interested in hearing kind of what you hope to get out of this class like why why you're here what you hope to learn um you know what what what's your YouTube and i'd be methods class.

390
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:11,550
Alison Mondul: Any questions.

391
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:19,350
Alison Mondul: Alright 10 minute break and when we get back.

392
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:22,170
Alison Mondul: let's go ahead and open.

393
00:57:24,330 --> 00:57:31,680
Alison Mondul: Okay at 240 i'm going to talk with the with Ts and then we'll we'll come back at 240 will be the breakout rooms and figure out how to get everybody into their groups okay.

394
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:35,250
Alison Mondul: Alright, see you guys in 10 minutes.

395
00:57:52,350 --> 00:58:07,380
Alison Mondul: Alright, welcome back everybody so um now I think we'll just go through and give everybody an opportunity to introduce themselves so remember just kind of a quick introduction, if you are where you're from i'm like kind of were on that.

396
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:20,460
Alison Mondul: list of things you think your work, fits and what you hope to get out of this class so i'll go ahead and start with the folks who are in person and then i'll call on people kind of an order in my list does that sound good.

397
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:24,630
Alison Mondul: All right, um.

398
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:26,520
Alison Mondul: Zoe.

399
00:58:29,370 --> 00:58:31,260
Alison Mondul: Zoe hear her.

400
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:33,600
From the air area.

401
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:40,470
Alison Mondul: is still an undergrad at comes in college so.

402
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:47,730
Alison Mondul: i'm majoring the cons right These are big long ones have healthy comments more.

403
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:52,140
Alison Mondul: number five and development policy.

404
00:58:52,650 --> 00:59:01,530
Sarah Ferri: On but I misunderstood by a staff member to consider using the school methods to analyze data regarding population.

405
00:59:01,590 --> 00:59:02,730
Alison Mondul: yeah and it's actually by a.

406
00:59:02,730 --> 00:59:03,030
Sarah Ferri: staff.

407
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:03,840
Alison Mondul: Can kind of beat.

408
00:59:03,990 --> 00:59:10,620
Alison Mondul: support any of those pieces right so it's just sort of like the developing and implementing the math part to kind of.

409
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:12,060
Do any of that really.

410
00:59:14,310 --> 00:59:14,550
yeah.

411
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:17,280
Alison Mondul: and

412
00:59:17,610 --> 00:59:18,960
What do you hope to get out of the class.

413
00:59:21,030 --> 00:59:27,390
Sarah Ferri: relatively strong basis and happy for my incentives intended feature graduate studies.

414
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:28,170
Alison Mondul: yeah great.

415
00:59:30,510 --> 00:59:35,520
Alison Mondul: divya and please if I say your name wrong, please correct me or, if you have a nickname you'd prefer, let me know.

416
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:40,560
Alison Mondul: hi i'm the diamond off the monitors from India.

417
00:59:40,890 --> 00:59:41,970
Alison Mondul: i'm part of an NIH.

418
00:59:41,970 --> 00:59:42,900
Alison Mondul: Funded grant.

419
00:59:43,890 --> 00:59:47,460
Alison Mondul: I will be spending my time in our apple for your.

420
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:50,700
Alison Mondul: Great with the School of Public Health so i'm here to get myself.

421
00:59:50,730 --> 00:59:52,560
Sarah Ferri: tree it's a micro master's Program.

422
00:59:53,400 --> 01:00:09,240
Alison Mondul: Basically, getting massive trained in research, so I practice Banja the tractor surgery cycle and API and I am from other like a system which is one of the largest I guess the letters in the word and you will associated to the cable guy Center principal.

423
01:00:10,410 --> 01:00:21,360
Alison Mondul: From the schools, I hope to learn much more about epidemiology, how to conduct good research and get back with me a lot of things that I learned you start doing research back home great.

424
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:23,940
Alison Mondul: and

425
01:00:25,290 --> 01:00:26,640
Alison Mondul: leticia yes, thank you.

426
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:30,270
Sarah Ferri: Hello everyone, my name is leticia i'm from Brazil, but personally.

427
01:00:30,390 --> 01:00:40,170
Alison Mondul: And pharmacies, but I also am a master in biochemistry I said that protein related to several these.

428
01:00:41,490 --> 01:00:46,890
Alison Mondul: Are all solution, and he has it and then I see fit.

429
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:55,650
Alison Mondul: The Item number one which I calls or relate, something I will split into a call these.

430
01:00:57,300 --> 01:00:57,690
Alison Mondul: Great.

431
01:00:58,770 --> 01:01:09,240
Alison Mondul: Then, what do you what are you hoping to get out of the class exporting the waters, because I started studying it our programming languages that I can more interesting.

432
01:01:10,830 --> 01:01:15,000
Alison Mondul: Is that to citrix yeah so it's all related.

433
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:27,120
Alison Mondul: story yeah it's I mean this our session is a great time to explore right to kind of get a sense of you know, and some people take it and be like well no nevermind just getting that wasn't what I thought.

434
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:36,750
Alison Mondul: So it's it's a great a lot of people will be in the summer session, you know thinking about maybe the agree and EPI and they're like let's try out and see if I like it a lot of people will.

435
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:43,890
Alison Mondul: You know, be physicians or apologists and and you know, have a lot of clinical training and wants to get a little bit more research, training.

436
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:54,330
Alison Mondul: You know, and then there are people who, during PhDs and stuff like that so it's actually kind of a cool I like teaching in the summer session because all of you are coming from such different backgrounds and I always learned interesting things too.

437
01:01:55,650 --> 01:02:05,910
Alison Mondul: Because you all have a very different perspective and it's I think a broader range of perspectives in the summer session, then you often get in in in like a graduate classes in the residential program, for example.

438
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:08,010
Alison Mondul: alrighty.

439
01:02:09,510 --> 01:02:12,150
Alison Mondul: let's i'm going to go down my list, which I think is.

440
01:02:13,470 --> 01:02:18,840
Alison Mondul: I think it is alphabetical by first name so abby sawsan is first.

441
01:02:24,450 --> 01:02:27,720
Abby Sossen (she/her): hi i'm abby so i'm i'm.

442
01:02:28,860 --> 01:02:39,240
Abby Sossen (she/her): Chemistry PhD student well I sort of was now i'm a master's student so i'm taking this class and biostatistics also to finish up my master's degree the chemistry department.

443
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:46,470
Abby Sossen (she/her): is letting me take these classes and i'm really excited because it's stuff I like it's all new information to me.

444
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:57,240
Abby Sossen (she/her): The math is sort of what I guess identify what so I was trying to answer the question and i've never worked in public health or really in healthcare at all, so I don't have too much.

445
01:02:58,050 --> 01:03:14,250
Abby Sossen (she/her): To relate to as far as like my work experience my research with you know the statistics and the math i've done a lot of quantitative analysis and chemistry and stuff like that, so I definitely identify or like I have experienced there with just not with people.

446
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:16,260
Alison Mondul: Great.

447
01:03:17,850 --> 01:03:19,650
Alison Mondul: awesome um.

448
01:03:20,730 --> 01:03:21,390
Alison Mondul: Chelsea.

449
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:37,440
Chelsey Kaasa (she/her): hi everyone, my name is Chelsea Casa, and I am joining from Olympia Washington I currently work at the Washington State Department of Health in the office of infectious disease.

450
01:03:37,830 --> 01:03:53,880
Chelsey Kaasa (she/her): And I work in HIV surveillance so i've been working in public health and with the Agency for about eight years but i've only worked on more of the programmatic and data collection side of things.

451
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:59,130
Chelsey Kaasa (she/her): So I work I work with epidemiologist every day.

452
01:04:00,330 --> 01:04:14,280
Chelsey Kaasa (she/her): And so i've been able to pick some things up along the way, but I thought it was time to have a little more formal training and epidemiology so i'm excited excited for the course and hoping that.

453
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:26,520
Chelsey Kaasa (she/her): You know, taking this course, and also trying to learn fast i'm hoping that i'll be able to do some more simple analytic work.

454
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:29,370
Alison Mondul: great to have you.

455
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:33,930
Alison Mondul: Ashley Ashley oaks.

456
01:04:36,060 --> 01:04:37,920
Ashlee Oaks: Hello i'm Ashley.

457
01:04:39,210 --> 01:04:44,280
Ashlee Oaks: And i'm so sorry what were the what were you were supposed to describe again.

458
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:51,300
Alison Mondul: Just introduce yourself, briefly, and then they kind of were on those five goals of Theology you think your workflows and.

459
01:04:51,330 --> 01:04:52,710
Alison Mondul: Okay class.

460
01:04:53,280 --> 01:05:09,660
Ashlee Oaks: Okay, so i'm i'm Ashley actually i'm going to be starting at U of m in the fall on the general epidemiology track for a master's degree I currently work at Henry Ford, I worked in the public health sciences department as a research coordinator.

461
01:05:10,770 --> 01:05:19,800
Ashlee Oaks: So I feel like the five main objectives of epidemiology kind of fit into what I do on an everyday basis so.

462
01:05:21,180 --> 01:05:26,070
Ashlee Oaks: Because I work as a coordinator currently so great yeah most of these fit into what I do.

463
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:32,820
Alison Mondul: And are you just trying to kind of get a leg up and get ready for the fall.

464
01:05:33,180 --> 01:05:44,670
Ashlee Oaks: Yes, yes, and I work with epidemiologist all the time, and it would you know and it's helpful, since I don't have that too too much experience outside work in epidemiology.

465
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:46,860
Great.

466
01:05:48,660 --> 01:05:51,630
Alison Mondul: All right, Denise Denise Perkins.

467
01:05:52,620 --> 01:06:00,150
Denise White Perkins (She/Her): hi everyone i'm Denise like Perkins i'm a family physician at Henry Ford health, a lot of these.

468
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:10,800
Denise White Perkins (She/Her): Objectives relate to my daily work and caring for patients, but i'm also very passionate about urban underserved care and health disparities.

469
01:06:11,220 --> 01:06:20,790
Denise White Perkins (She/Her): And that is where my research focuses and so out of this course i'd really like to gain deeper knowledge and skills.

470
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:30,360
Denise White Perkins (She/Her): On conducting research to understand some of the disparities that we're seeing on the clinical side i'm especially interested in hypertension and diabetes.

471
01:06:30,990 --> 01:06:44,640
Denise White Perkins (She/Her): So I think number for evaluating preventive and therapeutic measures really relates, because I want to understand how we can do a better job of providing care that will close those disparity gaps.

472
01:06:45,900 --> 01:06:47,370
Alison Mondul: Great Thank you.

473
01:06:49,020 --> 01:06:52,230
Alison Mondul: yeah a lot of physicians at the kind of in the in the four area.

474
01:06:54,450 --> 01:06:56,670
Alison Mondul: You got the people to try things on right.

475
01:06:57,780 --> 01:07:01,260
Alison Mondul: The patients who you're actually in intervening with so.

476
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:05,970
Alison Mondul: All right, divya Oh, we already did you put your in person.

477
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:08,580
Alison Mondul: All right, can.

478
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:10,500
Alison Mondul: there's going to correctly.

479
01:07:11,940 --> 01:07:12,990
Geehan Suleyman: it's on.

480
01:07:13,470 --> 01:07:14,370
Alison Mondul: The comments sorry.

481
01:07:14,670 --> 01:07:30,990
Geehan Suleyman: No that's okay heights Jihad silliman i'm an infectious disease physician that Henry Ford hospital downtown and i'm also the medical director of infection Prevention and Control, so all the five objectives.

482
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:32,820
Geehan Suleyman: I.

483
01:07:34,170 --> 01:07:40,980
Geehan Suleyman: I I guess they're relevant to my job and i'm taking this course as part of a grant requirement.

484
01:07:42,330 --> 01:07:43,410
Geehan Suleyman: So here I am.

485
01:07:44,580 --> 01:07:46,410
Alison Mondul: Great welcome Thank you.

486
01:07:48,270 --> 01:07:48,900
Alison Mondul: Jordan.

487
01:07:51,570 --> 01:07:57,000
Jordan Ferguson: I am Jordan i'm a pediatric emergency medicine and fellow at akron children's and so part of that group.

488
01:07:58,230 --> 01:08:06,510
Jordan Ferguson: Just started my second year of fellowship so i'm probably also in that like number four like you just mentioned, being an emergency room.

489
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:21,990
Jordan Ferguson: We take this part we take this class as like a required part of our fellowship hopefully it will help me with my like research project which i'm doing on a coven related topic so yeah great.

490
01:08:24,450 --> 01:08:36,720
Alison Mondul: yeah For those of you who are you know, not from the acronym group we always get like a handful three four of you guys every year, who were in the fellowship program and are taking this as a requirement so that's why we kind of group them together but.

491
01:08:37,740 --> 01:08:38,370
Alison Mondul: Welcome

492
01:08:39,390 --> 01:08:40,050
Alison Mondul: joshua.

493
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:50,070
Joshua Tucker: hey i'm josh one I work with the Martin group at the Michigan Center for respiratory virus research and response, which is in the department of fb at Michigan.

494
01:08:51,000 --> 01:09:06,540
Joshua Tucker: And I am taking this course, I guess, for a couple reasons, one is it's like a refresher i'm starting my PhD two balls from now and deferred and then I guess the other one is you know looking to boost my stats.

495
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:12,960
Joshua Tucker: With the your GPA see if I can get it to Michigan this time around, so we'll see.

496
01:09:15,870 --> 01:09:17,310
Alison Mondul: Thank you for your honesty joshua.

497
01:09:20,010 --> 01:09:23,250
Alison Mondul: I know joshua from previous classes, he did his mph here so.

498
01:09:23,790 --> 01:09:24,060
Alison Mondul: I made.

499
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:25,020
Joshua Tucker: A lot of sense here.

500
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:26,130
Joshua Tucker: let's let's be real.

501
01:09:26,610 --> 01:09:27,900
Joshua Tucker: World Michigan.

502
01:09:31,290 --> 01:09:34,410
Alison Mondul: that's why i'm teasing him alright Mustapha.

503
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:37,920
Mostafa Fakhruldin: hello, my name is Mustafa.

504
01:09:39,150 --> 01:09:41,130
Mostafa Fakhruldin: A message of health informatics student.

505
01:09:42,540 --> 01:09:44,730
Mostafa Fakhruldin: Have a background in public health.

506
01:09:45,900 --> 01:09:49,320
Mostafa Fakhruldin: I got my bachelor's at the University of Michigan dearborn and public health.

507
01:09:50,940 --> 01:10:00,480
Mostafa Fakhruldin: i'm currently taking this class I needed to fill fulfill requirements and we never really touch too much on epidemiology in undergrad so I wanted to expand.

508
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:17,130
Mostafa Fakhruldin: My knowledge on this specific area in relation to informatics so how did it can be collected and not implemented in appropriate ways so once that's completed, it should be all set, I do have.

509
01:10:19,110 --> 01:10:26,460
Mostafa Fakhruldin: Experience within veterinary medicine and epidemiology when it comes to rabies as well just by reporting the data collect the data.

510
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:33,270
Mostafa Fakhruldin: But that's as far as epidemiology experience I have from there.

511
01:10:35,190 --> 01:10:35,730
Alison Mondul: Great.

512
01:10:37,530 --> 01:10:38,250
Alison Mondul: Thank you.

513
01:10:39,750 --> 01:10:43,260
Alison Mondul: A laundry, and I say that correctly.

514
01:10:43,470 --> 01:10:48,390
Nolaundron Harris: You are wonderful human being people you just have to sound it out.

515
01:10:48,420 --> 01:10:49,290
it's not hard.

516
01:10:53,280 --> 01:11:02,040
Nolaundron Harris: But my name i'm i'm usually go by Ray so Chelsea Costa knows me of re airs raise actually my middle name, so not too far off.

517
01:11:02,940 --> 01:11:09,510
Nolaundron Harris: I currently live in Vancouver Washington, but I do also work at the Washington State Department of Health.

518
01:11:09,930 --> 01:11:26,220
Nolaundron Harris: In the same office of infectious disease with Chelsea Costa and I do stigma reduction in the office across all of our infectious diseases that are I guess be monitored in the office, so that would go across HIV viral hepatitis.

519
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:38,160
Nolaundron Harris: substance use in any of just the workings in that office I kind of just work on stigma reduction across all of the areas in an office.

520
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:52,530
Nolaundron Harris: I was reached out to by the section manager of Assessment Unit to see if I would be interested in doing epidemiology and so i'm kind of where I would say i'm at now is number three.

521
01:11:53,190 --> 01:12:01,380
Nolaundron Harris: But I kind of want to replace history and prognosis because i'm trying to figure out how to do stigma reduction and.

522
01:12:02,700 --> 01:12:04,590
Nolaundron Harris: Whatever health issues are.

523
01:12:05,910 --> 01:12:11,130
Nolaundron Harris: In the Office will just try to figure out how to blend both of those from a lance of epidemiology so.

524
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:11,940
Alison Mondul: And I think.

525
01:12:12,270 --> 01:12:17,880
Alison Mondul: Maybe yeah and I think you could you could say stigma reduction as part of the quality of life and living.

526
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:24,450
Alison Mondul: With gnosis in terms of like not a hard outcome like are you going to die if your disease or not, but more of like living with your disease.

527
01:12:24,510 --> 01:12:25,890
Alison Mondul: Is that a good quality of life.

528
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:26,790
Alison Mondul: Right, so we.

529
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:28,260
Nolaundron Harris: talked about that route.

530
01:12:28,590 --> 01:12:32,790
Alison Mondul: yeah for sure you know, we talked about that in cancer research as well right so.

531
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:41,880
Alison Mondul: You know people who, who have had you know cancer treatment there's there can be financial toxicity and things like that that they deal with or.

532
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:50,310
Alison Mondul: You know, changes to their body women who've had mastectomies and things like that you know, there could be all kinds of stuff with quality of life, so I think that's really great.

533
01:12:51,330 --> 01:12:55,320
Alison Mondul: And I definitely think it's a falls within three if you broadly defined middle.

534
01:12:57,900 --> 01:12:58,980
Alison Mondul: Great welcome.

535
01:13:00,630 --> 01:13:01,290
Alison Mondul: Sarah.

536
01:13:07,710 --> 01:13:22,170
Sarah Ferri: hi i'm Sarah fairy I am one of the second year fellows at akron children's hospital and hematology and oncology so again another one of those physicians that's fallen in the number four category.

537
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:28,020
Sarah Ferri: And so, really, what I hope to kind of get out of the courses to.

538
01:13:29,730 --> 01:13:31,020
Sarah Ferri: Try to help evaluate.

539
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:41,010
Sarah Ferri: Various research aspects doing a lot of kind of retrospective chart reviews and ways to help, not just with my current topic of.

540
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:48,660
Sarah Ferri: Helping with socio economic status and how it affects our diagnoses but kind of any research down the road so.

541
01:14:06,780 --> 01:14:08,790
Sarah Ferri: Oh i'm sorry I think allison you're muted.

542
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:14,820
Alison Mondul: Oh you're right, I am I was talking to nobody Thank you well.

543
01:14:17,250 --> 01:14:23,880
Will Brodwater: yeah my name is well broadwater on the hematology oncology fellow akron children's hospital also I just started my second year.

544
01:14:24,540 --> 01:14:31,980
Will Brodwater: Like Jordan and Sarah kind of alluded to this is a required course as part of our fellowship program but looking forward to strengthening the.

545
01:14:32,550 --> 01:14:39,960
Will Brodwater: limited knowledge, I have in terms of epidemiology and specifically and kind of the study design and interpretation of.

546
01:14:40,470 --> 01:14:48,150
Will Brodwater: Studies for taking care of patients moving forward, I certainly fall mostly into that category for with new therapeutic measures but.

547
01:14:48,540 --> 01:14:55,470
Will Brodwater: also have some interest in kind of the number three category with natural history and pregnancies of disease, obviously, something we talked about a lot with our cancer patients.

548
01:14:56,610 --> 01:14:56,940
Alison Mondul: Great.

549
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:00,150
Alison Mondul: awesome very miss anybody.

550
01:15:04,860 --> 01:15:05,130
Okay.

551
01:15:06,420 --> 01:15:16,380
Alison Mondul: Well, I think it's obvious we have kind of a range of interests, you know across the one through five categories we've got I think we have people who hit on all of them, so that's pretty great.

552
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:24,450
Alison Mondul: And you know people with a range of reasons for being here and like I said that's one of the things I really enjoy about teaching this summer class is.

553
01:15:24,750 --> 01:15:32,490
Alison Mondul: That you know it's it's a very it's a diverse group, and so you know, for example, when we get into examples you know we already had a little bit of that here, but I hope you guys will share.

554
01:15:33,330 --> 01:15:43,560
Alison Mondul: Things from your own work and and where you're at because I think it's really interesting to hear all of your different perspectives and it really it really does bring something to the class to hear what everybody's perspectives are because.

555
01:15:43,890 --> 01:15:55,500
Alison Mondul: You know, everybody has you know most most of you have work experience and have you know kind of worked in different areas I have not worked for health department i'm not a physician, so you guys will definitely have things to add to this class.

556
01:15:56,940 --> 01:16:04,050
Alison Mondul: I think, and I look forward to hearing hearing those thoughts and I do want to see real quick so just so I understand um.

557
01:16:04,620 --> 01:16:18,690
Alison Mondul: I don't have the roster up right now, but we have fewer people in person that I had thought we would so are there folks were virtual today who are planning to be generally in person, or is this kind of what we're dealing with moving forward.

558
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:21,720
Alison Mondul: Anybody want to.

559
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:28,170
Alison Mondul: Is anybody like virtual today but planning generally to be in person, or vice versa.

560
01:16:29,790 --> 01:16:37,170
Abby Sossen (she/her): um I had checked I think in person box when I registered but i'm going to be in person.

561
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:42,870
Abby Sossen (she/her): I sent an email to somebody Jody I think.

562
01:16:42,900 --> 01:16:44,700
Alison Mondul: But I don't know it's not a big deal.

563
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:58,050
Alison Mondul: it's not a big deal I just was thinking about like for making groups and things like that going forward honestly it's it's either way is fine, like if you guys want to be virtual it's no big deal, I just wanted to kind of understand what the plan was so that's great.

564
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:01,890
Alison Mondul: Alright, so it seems like this is kind of the plan that.

565
01:17:04,290 --> 01:17:06,870
Alison Mondul: All right does anybody have any questions.

566
01:17:08,010 --> 01:17:16,050
Alison Mondul: about the structure of the class anything else so for tomorrow you guys are going to read.

567
01:17:20,010 --> 01:17:21,150
Alison Mondul: Something hang on.

568
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:22,770
Alison Mondul: I got it.

569
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:26,760
Alison Mondul: yep that's right.

570
01:17:28,170 --> 01:17:36,060
Alison Mondul: Because that's tomorrow so we're going to read Chapter two you guys are going to do the quiz on the night before class which will cover the reading is from Chapter two, but no.

571
01:17:38,490 --> 01:17:39,810
Alison Mondul: No, I know i'm not sure that's fine.

572
01:17:42,270 --> 01:17:47,160
Alison Mondul: yep and that, and then we will do our infectious disease and outbreak investigation.

573
01:17:48,390 --> 01:17:51,870
Alison Mondul: Exercise tomorrow in our groups so i'm good.

574
01:17:53,640 --> 01:18:01,620
Alison Mondul: All right, one thing I will suggest, and this is a little bit silly but like because we're going to be doing some hand calculations, this means hand calculations, just so you know.

575
01:18:02,730 --> 01:18:14,790
Alison Mondul: I have, like my old school scientific calculator but I like to use, you can use the calculator in your computer, you can use the calculator on your phone I hate the one on my phone because I always like.

576
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:18,840
Alison Mondul: Somehow tapped the wrong thing and the fear about never quite works and I don't know.

577
01:18:19,650 --> 01:18:30,120
Alison Mondul: I think, having an actual handheld calculator will be very helpful as we go through so if anybody, you know, wants to dig that out or steal it from your child or whatever you need to do.

578
01:18:31,050 --> 01:18:34,230
Alison Mondul: You know just for a couple weeks because they're in on summer vacation they don't care so.

579
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:43,200
Alison Mondul: If you want to try to dig one of those up, it might be really helpful for you, you can, if you don't want to like spend if you have to buy one you can try it with you know you can try starting off with.

580
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:53,970
Alison Mondul: Your phone or whatever, but like I when I started teaching this class I was like no I can't deal with it and I actually like went out and bought like a ti whatever like little handheld.

581
01:18:55,980 --> 01:18:56,310
Alison Mondul: it's blue.

582
01:18:58,530 --> 01:19:03,810
Alison Mondul: So that is my not required, but you know suggested.

583
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:07,110
Alison Mondul: Pack for the class.

584
01:19:08,130 --> 01:19:08,730
Alison Mondul: All right.

585
01:19:10,650 --> 01:19:15,720
Alison Mondul: All right, any other questions to end a little early today going once going twice any last things.

586
01:19:16,950 --> 01:19:18,720
Mostafa Fakhruldin: refresh I have a question about to close.

587
01:19:19,260 --> 01:19:28,500
Mostafa Fakhruldin: yeah so you said they're open, like all right, we have to complete it before the next class so they open right after the initial cost is.

588
01:19:28,530 --> 01:19:38,430
Alison Mondul: Open now like it'll essentially open at five to the quiz one will open at five today okay will read Chapter two, and this one is about Chapter two it's basically like making you do the reading before you come to class.

589
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:39,540
Mostafa Fakhruldin: Okay.

590
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:45,720
Alison Mondul: Does that make sense i'm kind of forcing you to you have to do a thing, based on the readings so i'm making you do the reading.

591
01:19:46,230 --> 01:19:46,830
Mostafa Fakhruldin: sounds good.

592
01:19:48,030 --> 01:19:53,940
Alison Mondul: So, Professor are those times when will they love us I don't think they're tying it.

593
01:19:55,770 --> 01:20:09,270
Alison Mondul: I think it's unlimited attempts and unlimited time it's not it's not meant to be like punitive grading wise it's meant to like make you do the reading because you have to read this stuff to answer the questions right.

594
01:20:10,380 --> 01:20:17,310
Alison Mondul: Thank you, no problem I did that, because I know myself, and I was the student who would be like i'm totally going to do the reading and then like.

595
01:20:18,210 --> 01:20:32,070
Alison Mondul: I get busy, and I wouldn't do the reading and I think especially with this kind of class words so compressed and condensed I do think that having reading it hearing it doing it is going to be really helpful for retaining it.

596
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:44,070
Alison Mondul: That is what I have found so i'm just kind of making you do the quiz so that I make you at least craft the book and skim it to answer questions does that make sense.

597
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:48,240
Alison Mondul: it's not sneaky trick.

598
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:51,720
Alison Mondul: sneaky Professor trick okay.

599
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:54,270
Alison Mondul: Any other questions.

600
01:20:57,030 --> 01:21:03,960
Alison Mondul: All right, I look forward to seeing you guys or seeing you guys tomorrow and have a great rest of your day.

601
01:21:05,010 --> 01:21:08,190
Nolaundron Harris: Thank you so much, and thank you for not being a boring instructor.

602
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:10,110
Nolaundron Harris: Oh awesome.

603
01:21:10,620 --> 01:21:16,110
Alison Mondul: Thank you, I will try, I will endeavor to continue to not be boring we'll see when we get to the math i'll do my best.

604
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:19,200
Nolaundron Harris: bye.

605
01:21:19,410 --> 01:21:21,060
