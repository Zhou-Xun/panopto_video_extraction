1
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:11,714
After watching this video,

2
00:00:11,714 --> 00:00:16,990
you will be able to use PROC GENMOD to
run a log-binomial regression model.

3
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:20,545
To illustrate the use of PROC GENMOD
in the context of a cohort study,

4
00:00:20,545 --> 00:00:23,780
we're going to use the following example.

5
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:28,269
We will use data from the cohort
study of 295 adults from Samoa,

6
00:00:28,269 --> 00:00:33,160
who were recruited at baseline and
followed up for two years.

7
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:36,891
Triglycerides were measured at
the two year follow up, and

8
00:00:36,891 --> 00:00:42,390
we will use this of 150 to define
having hypertriglyceridemia.

9
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:46,696
This is the kind of using
the metabolic syndrome definition, so

10
00:00:46,696 --> 00:00:49,400
outcome is binary, yes or no?

11
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:53,912
We will use a special a binary
variable that measures compliance with

12
00:00:53,912 --> 00:00:55,712
a modern dietary pattern.

13
00:00:55,712 --> 00:01:00,948
If the variable is one, it means high
compliance with a modern dietary pattern,

14
00:01:00,948 --> 00:01:06,260
and the other way around, a zero in
the variable means low compliance.

15
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:10,626
And modern dietary pattern,
also called a western dietary pattern,

16
00:01:10,626 --> 00:01:15,290
is a pattern breaching red meat,
refined flowers, and supers.

17
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:17,088
Not very healthy stuff, so

18
00:01:17,088 --> 00:01:21,547
the hypothesis will be that higher
compliance with a modern dietary

19
00:01:21,547 --> 00:01:27,580
pattern will result in a high risk
of developing hypertriglyceridemia.

20
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:29,920
So let's look briefly to are there.

21
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,640
Here, you can see printed the first
10 observations of the data set.

22
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,551
We have our ID number, as usual,
we have age, and baseline, and sex.

23
00:01:38,551 --> 00:01:42,613
We have our outcome,
which is hypertriglyceridemia, yes or no,

24
00:01:42,613 --> 00:01:46,684
based on the 150 metabolic syndrome
cut off, and I had it here.

25
00:01:46,684 --> 00:01:51,281
The triglyceride variable that were
used to create this outcome, so

26
00:01:51,281 --> 00:01:56,514
you can see the [INAUDIBLE], you can see
in the first 10 observations that only

27
00:01:56,514 --> 00:02:02,890
one savvy it has hypertriglyceridemia,
without regulation size value of 181.

28
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:05,485
And finally, we have an exposure variable.

29
00:02:05,485 --> 00:02:09,945
A variable factor one is represents
compliance with the modern dietary

30
00:02:09,945 --> 00:02:11,310
pattern.

31
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:15,810
[INAUDIBLE] low compliance and
one high compliance.

32
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:19,954
Now, let's be clear about the difference
between a nurse ratio, and

33
00:02:19,954 --> 00:02:22,704
average ratio,
just using a two by two table.

34
00:02:22,704 --> 00:02:26,065
So we run at two by two table
with our exposure factor,

35
00:02:26,065 --> 00:02:28,991
one is representing low and
high compliance.

36
00:02:28,991 --> 00:02:34,220
On our outcome, tgms represented
hypertriglyceridemia, yes or no?

37
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:37,931
If we use low compliance's the reference,
the ratio and

38
00:02:37,931 --> 00:02:41,080
the ratios are calculated there.

39
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,482
All ratio is 2.18, and
there is ratio is 1.99.

40
00:02:44,482 --> 00:02:49,395
Obviously, they have are not the same
because they represent different measures

41
00:02:49,395 --> 00:02:51,660
of association.

42
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:56,126
Now, remember, I told you that you can
use PROC GENMOD to run regression.

43
00:02:56,126 --> 00:02:57,590
So let's do that first.

44
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:00,992
So you can see, we can use
the same PROC GENMOD template, and

45
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:05,800
just make sure that you choose
the distribution and the link accordingly.

46
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:10,446
For logistic regression, the distribution
is binomial, and the link is the logit.

47
00:03:10,446 --> 00:03:14,030
Note that you still need to use
the descending option here to model

48
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:16,909
the probability of having
hypertriglyceridemia.

49
00:03:16,909 --> 00:03:20,240
Yeah, that's the same issue as.

50
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,280
Otherwise, when model
the probability of being 0.

51
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:29,697
And finally, because this is PROC GENMOD,
that will not give us ratios by default.

52
00:03:29,697 --> 00:03:34,183
We will use the estimate statement,
using that combination of 1-1,

53
00:03:34,183 --> 00:03:36,546
we will be using low as the reference.

54
00:03:36,546 --> 00:03:39,330
If we change it,
highway with the reference.

55
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:42,740
Again, more on this statement later.

56
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:47,530
And we get a suddenly the same as
ratio that we got before in to table.

57
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:50,350
And remember to interpret this as.

58
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:54,158
The odds of having hypertriglyceridemia
is 2.18 times higher

59
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:58,102
among people with high compliance
with the modern dietary pattern,

60
00:03:58,102 --> 00:04:01,530
compared with people with low compliance.

61
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:06,172
Also know that I'm not encouraging you
to use PROC GENMOD for running logistic

62
00:04:06,172 --> 00:04:10,481
models when you can use PROC LOGISTIC,
which is more convenient to you.

63
00:04:10,481 --> 00:04:14,901
We are just doing this to compare it with
the low binomial model, and see how it

64
00:04:14,901 --> 00:04:20,430
just changing the link function,
we get a different measure of association.

65
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:24,342
So now, let's run our log-binomial
model using PROC GENMOD,

66
00:04:24,342 --> 00:04:27,530
know that the code is exactly
the same as before, but

67
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:31,840
the only thing to change here
is the link that now is the log.

68
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:37,600
Just that small change will give you
a risk ratio instead of a nose ratio.

69
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,418
Note that for log-binomial models,
because you have a binary outcome,

70
00:04:41,418 --> 00:04:46,900
you also need to specify the distant
same as with logistic regression.

71
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:51,046
And we get exactly the same
we got with our toy to table.

72
00:04:51,046 --> 00:04:55,998
Not surprisingly, and you have to this
is a risk ratio, not only because

73
00:04:55,998 --> 00:05:00,985
it's a log-binomial model, but because
you are in the context of a cohort study.

74
00:05:00,985 --> 00:05:03,003
It is was across study,

75
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:07,425
this measure of association
would be interpreted as a ratio.

76
00:05:07,425 --> 00:05:10,190
We will see that in another video.

77
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:14,852
So the risk of having hypertriglyceridemia
is 1.99 times higher among

78
00:05:14,852 --> 00:05:18,626
people with high compliance
with a modern dietary pattern,

79
00:05:18,626 --> 00:05:21,364
compared with people with low compliance.

80
00:05:21,364 --> 00:05:26,496
In summary, in this video, we use PROC
GENMOD to run a log-binomial regression

81
00:05:26,496 --> 00:05:31,790
model, and we compare it with logistic
regression, so we could see differences.

82
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:35,865
In the next video, we will continue
with low binomial models and

83
00:05:35,865 --> 00:05:39,392
talk abut convergence problems.
