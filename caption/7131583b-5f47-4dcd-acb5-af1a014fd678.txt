1
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:14,350
And then. Your medical.

2
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:19,960
It's always going to be medical supply chains. That's going to be grocery store.

3
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:24,549
If you have a grocery store to put food in, but your supply chains are down because there's no roads to get anything right.

4
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:30,340
There's no roads to bring things in. And if you only use a credit card rather than cash, who has cash on them right now?

5
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:35,139
Okay. About 30% of you. Yeah. So your credit card machines go down.

6
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:39,070
What are you going to do? How are you going to barter? Right. So these are all really interesting things.

7
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:47,169
Complex emergencies versus natural disasters. They're they're they're two different animals approach similar ways.

8
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:51,080
But but you have to take a gun pistol into account for both of them.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,380
A complex emergency is a natural disaster that happens in a politically unstable environment.

10
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:59,470
Okay. The damage is more chronic and less focused.

11
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:06,200
For example, West Africa, Ebola, civil war. For like the last four years, people haven't been in school.

12
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:12,100
There's a lack of medical students. No, doctors don't have a lot of education.

13
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:18,340
And so you have to deal with how do you how do you recover from a disaster such as Ebola without international help?

14
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:27,110
Complex emergencies are also more prone to outbreaks because you don't have those supply chains already in place to vaccinate people against measles.

15
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:32,950
Right. Against everything else. Natural disasters are a little bit more.

16
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:40,419
Things like hurricanes, typhoons. They're usually focused to damage the fuel in a humanitarian disaster.

17
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,549
Relief is a little bit different.

18
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:48,270
It's very different than a complex emergency because it's usually everybody is kind of behind your team helping everybody else.

19
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:53,499
And there's no you know, there's no rebel factions or anybody else that you're dealing with which which can cause problems.

20
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:57,180
And this graph below, basically just the point of this graph is that, you know,

21
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:02,920
we don't see a lot of complex emergencies in America, in the United States, relatively stable politically.

22
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,409
Africa, you do. Right. The natural disasters happen mostly in Asia.

23
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:14,290
It probably has to do with the Ring of fire, which is a lot of tectonic activity, lots of volcanoes, volcanic activity.

24
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:19,540
Right. So a port is a pumpkin coming time, but ten.

25
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:25,270
It's beautiful. All right. So it's always good to know what it really looks like, right?

26
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:29,410
To know what a good response looks like. You have to have good you have to be very poor.

27
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:36,490
Responses delayed. Things don't get there in time. You know, maybe you're you have a bunch of know you have people in rubble.

28
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,889
You have about five days to get them out.

29
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:45,640
If you have a disorganized response after about five days, you might as well forget it because people don't think there's been a documented case.

30
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:53,230
I think Richard May 21, about one that lasted longer days, but for the most part, you need a quick response to get search and rescue teams out there.

31
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:59,409
And again, you're sitting in your house and you're that sun going down and you have no communications and you have no way of getting clean water.

32
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:04,479
So there are people out there that need help. So rapid responses waiting for a poor response.

33
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,370
You have resources arriving to the wrong place. You have unwanted and unusable medical resources.

34
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:15,040
An example is you are working in Sri Lanka and you get a bunch of antibiotics

35
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,220
that are in different languages that the physicians in that country don't use.

36
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:23,830
Every country has a national drug formulary. It's on the W.H.O. website.

37
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:27,309
The World Health Organization website has a drug formulary for each country.

38
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:31,810
If you're ever going to bring drugs into a country, look at that list and take those drugs.

39
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:35,260
Don't take anything else, okay? Because they're just going to be wasted.

40
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:39,640
No one knows how to use like a claw, you know? Anyway,

41
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:45,760
so many infectious disease training gathering volunteers in real time versus actually having an

42
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,860
emergency response team that's been vetted and prepared and ready to go out on a 24 hour notice.

43
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:55,200
You need the response teams that are ready to go in 24 hours notice.

44
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:03,249
Okay. Rather than being just kind of saying, oh, it's like a disaster just happened in Haiti, let's get our volunteers up now.

45
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:06,520
You know, and you don't have you don't know who's what skill sets people have.

46
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:10,899
You haven't done it previously. You don't want to do inappropriate services.

47
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:16,959
You want to have good services, appropriate services, and then you want to be self-sufficient as a team, if you're a good response.

48
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,720
Has teams that have food, they have medicines,

49
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:26,590
they don't they don't need supplies from the surrounding beneficiaries to be ineffective, too much of that.

50
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,969
So it's very difficult to standardize any given response.

51
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:34,690
These aren't cookie cutters. They're not there's no cookie cutter response.

52
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:38,950
The same disaster in two different areas can have completely different effects.

53
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:41,979
Right on the left, you see Typhoon Haiyan or Typhoon Yolanda.

54
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:46,390
That happened in the Philippines in 2013. And on the right is Katrina, 2000 fire,

55
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:53,409
same type of storm just happens that later goes on an island right cone shaped for for all intents and purposes,

56
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:59,020
the water comes up, surge comes up, destroys everything in its path of the water leaves goes back at the ocean.

57
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:04,959
Right now, Katrina is different because New Orleans was built in under sea level, much like much like the Dutch.

58
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:10,870
Right. So the levees were built to handle the worst storm in 100 years.

59
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:16,329
So there was obviously going to be a problem, you know, in one lifetime.

60
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:19,480
So basically what happened is those levees were not maintained properly.

61
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:24,940
The water came in, lifted up and then dropped right on to right on to New Orleans.

62
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:34,720
And that's so so again, the point of this is when you talk about disaster response and disaster mitigation, there's always the planning component.

63
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:39,400
Okay. Planning is important because the planning starts at a local level.

64
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:45,460
Right. Came to hand on people outside of your local community to help you because you know your weaknesses.

65
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:52,179
The leadership of New Orleans knows that there are orders to level, that they know that the levees need to be strengthened.

66
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:57,060
They know that they can apply to the federal government to an act of war.

67
00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:03,670
Your agency called FEMA to help you with strength and that strength and their weaknesses to mitigate any potential disasters, that kind of thing.

68
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:07,740
So again, how many more minutes we got?

69
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:13,530
So our national. Disaster preparedness.

70
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:18,100
Agency has called the call to call the National Disaster Management System.

71
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:23,580
And there's this is a very this is a behemoth of organizations vocabulary.

72
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:27,970
So I'm giving you the 30,000 foot view of this. You just need to know that this exists.

73
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:33,700
And you need to understand that only 30% of countries in the world have an

74
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:38,950
organization that is a practiced and in place disaster management operations.

75
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:44,889
So the National Disaster Management System guides all levels of government and NGOs in private,

76
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:51,550
as well as the private sector to work together to protect, prevent and mitigate against and to respond and recover.

77
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:59,350
So not only are we just kind of waiting for disaster, waiting for disaster to happen, we're we're we're not just responding to a disaster.

78
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:02,380
We are looking for it. We're preparing for it.

79
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:05,990
And it starts on a local level. You see the billboards.

80
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:10,120
Billboards are ready.gov. You've seen those? Yeah. This is exactly what they're doing.

81
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:14,280
It's in it's hard for us who live in. The lights are all on here.

82
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:17,760
We all got our water bottles, clean water. We got our food. We can go and get a coffee.

83
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:23,900
It was very difficult for us to get the mindset that preparedness is critical because you just don't we don't know.

84
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,489
I mean, Michigan, we're not we're not in hurricane belts or anything here.

85
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:31,000
But but still, it's it's it's important to have that mindset to be prepared.

86
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:37,629
At least remember that person that had the hurricane with the family that lost everything.

87
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:45,670
Right. And as we started in in 1984, it operates under the Department of Health and Human Services and has 15 deployment teams.

88
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:50,799
These deployment teams range from anywhere between transportation to medicine to public health and all that stuff.

89
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,260
So and I want you to look, when Suzanne gets her lecture, you're going to see the similarities when she talks about the cluster system.

90
00:07:56,260 --> 00:08:01,150
Okay. These are these are teams that are ready to go to be deployed any at a moment's notice on the ground,

91
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:06,850
the DMS overseas, the Department of Defense, the Department of Veteran Affairs and FEMA.

92
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:10,350
And this is a little snapshot from the FEMA dot gov website.

93
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:17,739
There are about 40 courses. You can take each about 1 to 3 hours long, get certified, understand the response system.

94
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:23,320
I recommend you take 100, 700. Just get an idea of what the incident command system is.

95
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,800
So here's the model of what our national disaster system is.

96
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:33,660
We have the Health and Human Services leads, the National Disaster Management System.

97
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,649
Again, we have the Department of Defense, which basically takes care of communications,

98
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:41,640
security, medical capabilities, logistics and aircraft, air and ground transport.

99
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:47,309
And then the Department of Veterans Affairs deals with physical facilities.

100
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:51,299
And they are the people that community hospitals, university hospitals,

101
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:57,300
you know them hospital I work out with volunteer with if there's a disaster and we needed more capacity per patient.

102
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:01,590
That's interestingly enough. Well, I'll talk about that when we talk about the ICRC.

103
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:08,280
But you have the FEMA, which is the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is basically more of like a paper pushing.

104
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:15,300
It's more personnel training and budget. So we're not like the EMS is actually the player here and these are all support agencies.

105
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:22,320
So what's it and what's an emergency? I can't really spell the and say it's actually emergency.

106
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:26,189
There's 15 emergency support teams that can be deployed.

107
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:29,489
Okay. In your transportation, communication, public works, all the pests,

108
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:37,620
all kinds of things that I mentioned right at ESF eight is public health that has your DEMAT teams, which are teams.

109
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:41,400
There's one in Pennsylvania, there's one at Toledo. They're kind of all over the country.

110
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:47,360
But these are teams of public health people, physicians that get together every month, have training.

111
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,400
They're paid by the U.S. government to have these positions.

112
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:56,219
I was on team at three for a while here on call, about two weeks every six months.

113
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:01,260
And if a disaster happens in the U.S., you're out and your employment and employer can't say anything about it.

114
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:04,560
So it's pretty cool. So. So because.

115
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:08,250
Because it's a governmental agency, right? So. So that's what's fine.

116
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:16,260
So and under the ESF, you have pediatric surgical teams, you have triage because those are the ones that are going to be deployed immediately.

117
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:20,340
Right. Again, the golden hour of trauma is the first hour of people getting hurt right after.

118
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:26,850
And then you also you have the search and rescue teams, which are going to be immediate. The E.R. docs can probably go a day or two afterwards.

119
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:31,259
Right, because they can also go immediately.

120
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:35,339
But we don't do surgery. We don't do like trainings. We don't do lifesaving surgeries or amputations.

121
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:38,640
We we do more of the primary care procurement.

122
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:45,660
OC Incident Command System is a concept that lies within the structural framework of DMS.

123
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:53,370
Basically it is. We just create these hierarchies of command where the rule is, is I answer to one person, only five people,

124
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:58,739
no more answer to me, because once get more than five people answer to me, it's been deemed that it's too complicated.

125
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:02,730
I'm overwhelmed. I create a lateral leader to take on that load.

126
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:07,259
Common terminology. Everyone speaks the same language, integrated communication.

127
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:10,120
Everybody speaks on the same modality, right?

128
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:15,700
You can speak on ham radios like if your cell phones are down, you have no cell phone towers unless they put one out.

129
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,980
Great. But you felt you had you have a uniform wavelength that you're all speaking on.

130
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:23,910
So there's no miscommunication. This is an incident command structure.

131
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:27,360
Again, this is a whole course in and of itself. I want you to know that this exists.

132
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:36,520
This is a potential incident command structure for the Hurricane Fiona that just hit Puerto Rico on Monday.

133
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,680
You can see you have the operations section, planning, logistics, finance.

134
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,460
Who's going to who's going to cover the cost of it for the people who take shelter?

135
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:49,500
How are the medical teams usually under logistics section?

136
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:57,060
I don't want to take too much time. This is your communications tactical radios handling, right.

137
00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:01,530
So again, when Suze, we'll talk about the international cluster system,

138
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:05,700
you can see that they're very different structures, but they follow the same principles.

139
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:13,620
Local and local preparedness is critical. And not only is it not only, and that helps to mitigate the response rate.

140
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:21,270
So and then keep this in mind when Puerto Rico incident command system is overwhelmed by Fiona.

141
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,920
Okay, they're all wrong. They have nothing else to do.

142
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:31,320
Who they call, they can call FEMA, they can call the DMS, which then automatically brings in funding from the national government to help them.

143
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:35,370
And those DEMAT teams and communications teams that are ready to go are all deployed.

144
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,740
Okay, that's what's cool about it.

145
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:45,360
Under the Robert T Stafford Disaster Relief Emergency Act, also the Stafford Act, that is what makes them able to do that.

146
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:50,370
And that's going to be just like UN Resolution 43, 182,

147
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:56,400
which is what makes a national government be able to call on to the cluster system for international relief.

148
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,940
And you'll hear that now from Suits. All right. So.

149
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:08,200
I can just and we will leave all the questions for the end of this country as soon as next or Richard Sousa's next.

150
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:16,870
As I'm sure you can share her.

151
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:21,040
I think she was having issues. Genghis Khan. So we will do the slides for her.

152
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:29,640
So. Excuse me for your slides.

153
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:33,420
Lovely. Thank you. You should just let me know when to discuss.

154
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:37,860
William, just to give you a brief background of who I am.

155
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:46,829
Really. For the last ten years, I've been working with International Medical Cause, which is an American NGO working,

156
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:54,420
really responding to multiple disasters within the Philippines, Sudan, South Sudan, Jordan, Lebanon, etc.

157
00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:06,600
And one of the roles that I had in particular was to be seconded out, to be a expert as a health cluster coordinator for W.H.O. during my time there.

158
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,080
And this is really something that's quite key to what we're going to talk about.

159
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,650
So just Tim really talked a little bit about the national system.

160
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:20,550
And the reason why it's important to understand the national system is that if you are going to respond to a global disaster,

161
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,840
you need to know who you're going to contact when you arrive.

162
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:30,809
And often what we say with people who are arriving on the field, if they don't know where to start, they don't know who to speak to.

163
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:37,469
And therefore what we see is the government starts to get sidelined and the international community starts to lead the response.

164
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:39,420
And this is something we don't want to happen.

165
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:45,780
It's really important that the government leads the response and where there is a supporting mechanism to that response.

166
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:52,740
Otherwise we're reducing that capacity when actually we should be increasing that capacity within that country.

167
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:57,690
Next slide, please. So I'm going to talk a little bit about torture.

168
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:05,820
And torture really is a body, a part of the UN, which stands for Office of Coordinating Humanitarian Assistance.

169
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:10,590
And it's a body that is there to ensure that those who've been affected by the crisis is

170
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:14,930
going to reach the assistance and the protection that they need within those circumstances.

171
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:22,410
It's there to overcome any obstacles that are going to impede any humanitarian response.

172
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:29,610
And it's also there is a leadership mechanism to mobilize assistance, but it is not operational.

173
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:33,479
It's all of the other bodies that are coming together that are operational.

174
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,690
They just coordinate the response. Next slide, please.

175
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:44,610
I think it's really important to note that Arches humanitarian principles are what's listed in front of you.

176
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:48,360
And actually it sounds quite obvious, but they're really challenging.

177
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:57,690
Neutrality is a huge issue. Often we have people who are recruited into very senior positions who have very strong political views.

178
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:09,930
And I've certainly worked in that particular in the Syria crisis where somebody who was allocated within the in the Jordan U.N. capacity actually was

179
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:19,220
on Assad's side and therefore was blocking any cross-border work because he didn't approve of kind of the assistance we wanted to provide and say,

180
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,850
you know, it's really important that we're recruiting the right people in place.

181
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:28,589
You can be neutral. The other key point of this is the independence aspect.

182
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:39,360
And if you look at how NGOs and U.N. systems are financed, the majority of funding is taken from governments the US,

183
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,610
the UK, Germany, France, etc. A huge players in providing funds.

184
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:47,760
But with this naturally comes political agendas.

185
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:52,920
And so the donors will give money to provide certain services to certain countries,

186
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:57,630
which actually takes away our independence and our ability to be impartial.

187
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:01,830
So it's just worth remembering those things. Whereas with the UN agencies,

188
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:11,670
obviously the funding goes into a different pool and they can kind of take a step back and be abide hopefully a bit more by those principles.

189
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:24,770
Next slide, please. So watch his mandate with its partners really is about contributing to, you know, ensuring that we coordinate the world.

190
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:32,930
So the global responses that we're involved and to make sure that we advocate where there are gaps in services,

191
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:37,760
where we're seeing certain populations that are potentially being forgotten,

192
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:44,180
that we're making sure that policies are brought into place and that the humanitarian financing

193
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:50,840
is brought together with a huge bid for the total funding that's required for that emergency,

194
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:55,100
and also that the information management systems are in place.

195
00:17:55,100 --> 00:18:00,200
So we can gather all of the data that we need in order to report the work that's been done.

196
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:08,840
Next slide, please. Now, this slide really is for you to be able to see kind of the key relationships within a humanitarian response.

197
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:15,499
And when we leave, hopefully you'll be able to go back to some of the PowerPoints and just have a bit more of a detailed look, really.

198
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:22,610
But it's just looking at the key lines of reporting within this leadership and international kind of roles,

199
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:28,669
just looking at the global and the national level and looking at the humanitarian coordinator and how they kind

200
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:35,510
of lead the humanitarian country team within an emergency and they then go on to lead and guide the clusters.

201
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:45,640
Next slide, please. So this program site is really quite key within a humanitarian response.

202
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:52,030
So the program cycle really is a coordinated series of actions that are undertaken

203
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:56,469
to help us prepare for to manage and deliver any humanitarian response.

204
00:18:56,470 --> 00:19:02,980
And it is consistent of these five key elements that you see on the on the PowerPoint.

205
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:11,920
And these really need to be kind of streamlined and seamless in order to ensure that each step leads to the next step.

206
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:17,560
A successful humanitarian response really follows the cycle that we say.

207
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:26,620
So if we look at the needs assessment, this is a coordinated approach where we can look at the priorities of those on the ground to make

208
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:33,480
sure that those who've been affected by the crises are receiving the right humanitarian response.

209
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:36,970
And within that response, there is a coherence and efficient response.

210
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:44,559
As we move to the strategic planning, the UN all comes together to provide humanitarian response plans,

211
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,620
which really takes over a lot of people's lives.

212
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:52,389
In the initial response we're putting forward to governments, to funding bodies,

213
00:19:52,390 --> 00:20:00,910
really what is actually required for that emergency so that all of the agencies can be funded to respond to the disaster.

214
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:07,600
And then we obviously will try and get that the resources mobilized through using this AHP.

215
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:15,549
And then we need to really seriously focus on the implementation and the monitoring of that emergency response.

216
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:18,700
So this is a continuous process really.

217
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:26,290
And you know, we need to make sure that we're tracking the humanitarian assistance it's been delivered to the populations that were meeting,

218
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:28,059
the targets that we're looking at.

219
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:36,070
And as we're tracking them, the inputs and outputs and the interventions that we're providing to the populations are actually what the needs are.

220
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:47,139
And if not, we need to be looking to really step the response up and change the response to meet the needs of those population is a key step, really.

221
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:54,280
This is in the program cycle as we're really committing to the HRP plan that we were talking about.

222
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:57,820
And then lastly, we would be looking at the operational peer review,

223
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:03,760
which is really a tool that we used that was introduced as part of the inter-agency

224
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:08,560
transformative sorry steering committee for the transformative agenda.

225
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:16,149
And this really is serving to allow us to correct some of the responses to make sure

226
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:19,510
that where there are adjustments that are needed or where there's improvements,

227
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:21,310
that we really focus on changing that.

228
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:28,990
This is really where we bring in the leadership, the coordination and the accountability aspect to those who are in effective populations.

229
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:32,209
Next slide, please. Here.

230
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:40,100
It really is. Just to kind of show you those who are involved within the cluster approach, who are coordinating them,

231
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:47,550
looking at the emergency relief coordinator and that they are actually responsible for the oversight of that emergency.

232
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:53,930
The Inter-Agency Standing Committee is really the forum where the coordination

233
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:59,030
and the policy development and the decision making takes place and ought

234
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:04,849
to really work very closely with a lot of the cluster lead agencies and the

235
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:08,720
NGOs as they develop the policies and they coordinate a lot of the clusters.

236
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:15,229
The humanitarian coordinator is the one who is responsible for assessing that international

237
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:22,070
response and to make sure the assets that are being provided are well needed and well organized.

238
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,469
And then the country team really is the strategic body in the operational decision

239
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:34,010
making body that will take the oversight that is led by the humanitarian coordinator.

240
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:41,650
Next slide, please. So what is the cluster approach?

241
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:54,640
Well, this really was a it was a kind of change that took place following a major reform within the cluster system in about 2005.

242
00:22:55,450 --> 00:23:02,499
And when the Pakistan disaster took place, this is when they kind of rolled this out initially.

243
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:07,180
And at this point, they established nine clusters within 24 hours.

244
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:14,290
And following that emergency, there were two further reforms that took place in 2007 and 2010,

245
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:23,530
where they focused on implementation and on the outcome of any response that was taking place.

246
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:32,970
And it really is about just making sure that we enhance the predictability, the accountability and the partnerships within an emergency response.

247
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:41,140
And this is K three. And good coordination and ensuring that the right clusters are initiated at the beginning of a response.

248
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:47,310
Other aspects of the cluster approach really is ensuring that we support the

249
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:53,040
service delivery and we make sure that we're informing and strategic decision

250
00:23:53,040 --> 00:24:03,060
making that we're planning with strategic we're advocating and really looking at contingency planning and preparedness within each of the emergencies.

251
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:12,330
Next slide, please. Say really here we just looked at the cluster approach again.

252
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:20,030
Really? Why do we need it? Well, it's really, again, about a good coordination mechanism.

253
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:27,940
This will stop us from having gaps within an emergency if we're coordinating effectively and also will stop the duplication.

254
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:33,080
This is something that was really seen and is what really started.

255
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:41,480
The cluster system from being rolled out really was because of these gaps and because of the duplication that was taking place.

256
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:46,400
So it's about just making sure that a response is coherent and it's complementary.

257
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:54,200
We need to really make sure that what we're doing is transparent, especially with resources and leadership and performance.

258
00:24:54,650 --> 00:25:01,340
We need to make sure that we are enhancing our predictability, making sure that the sectors responsibilities are very clear.

259
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:06,200
We need to be engaging with national and local authorities, and this is where it's crucial.

260
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:12,350
We understand what the local authorities are and what the national authorities are within the country that we're working in.

261
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:22,010
And also something that we have really failed with doing in the past is making sure, including those communities that have been affected.

262
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:31,970
Often we we go in with the mentality that we know best and where we're not bringing in the communities to understand what it is that they need.

263
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:37,610
So it's just really crucial that we're engaging with them. Again, we need to look at advocating.

264
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:42,680
And then with regards to our planning, we need to make sure that we have a formal process of coordination.

265
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:47,950
Next slide, please. So this is a cluster system.

266
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:53,470
This is a very common image that you will see if you're working in humanitarian work.

267
00:25:53,950 --> 00:26:01,690
This really just shows you all of the clusters that are available at the moment, and we really want to focus on the health system.

268
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:14,860
But each of these clusters are led by a U.N. agency, except for camp management, which is led by IOM and for health, it's led by W.H.O.

269
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:19,450
And this is one of the people that you would partner with very seriously.

270
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:26,620
And really, it's about taking each of the clusters, taking responsibility for the needs within that cluster.

271
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:34,509
So for health, taking responsibility for the medical needs that are needed and ensuring that you have enough technical capacity available.

272
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:46,510
You've got the trained experts in place to ensure you look at stockpiling specific drugs and consumable items that, you know you wouldn't use,

273
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:53,799
making sure you're standardizing any technical tools that you would use in a response and agreeing on many of the methods that

274
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:59,620
you're going to use within an emergency and the types of needs assessments that you would use for monitoring and benchmarking.

275
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:06,490
And in addition as well, these clusters develop the best practices and lessons learned from the field

276
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:10,810
and a lot of the policies and guidance for emergencies as we move forward.

277
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:14,320
Next slide, please. So really,

278
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:19,809
it's just I think the biggest reason we need this cluster approach is because there have

279
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:25,330
been major gaps that were noted that needed to be addressed within humanitarian responses.

280
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:32,380
So it's crucial that we improve the efficiency and effectiveness of each of the responses and also ensured that

281
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:41,080
we were more predictable and accountable within our time as we're kind of working within these countries.

282
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:50,889
Next slide, please say the cluster cluster health cluster really added this slide in so that you

283
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:57,850
can kind of revisit it to have a bit more detail really about the cluster itself.

284
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:01,990
But basically it's about making sure that we are able to.

285
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:12,810
Kind of partner with each of the organizations they offered with initially with

286
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:18,719
the U.N. They were going in solely with U.N. agencies and picking specific NGOs.

287
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:23,100
And it was really about bringing together all of the NGOs and international and

288
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:27,840
national NGOs and making sure that they represent the whole of the cluster system.

289
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:34,379
And you were all them brought into the Strategic Advisory Group and on the board and making sure

290
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:38,730
that you're all kind of coming together with the agreement of the type of work that you were doing.

291
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:46,349
This work was then mapped out, and the response then was very clear to everybody who was doing what,

292
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:49,620
where and what type of kind of services that they were providing.

293
00:28:50,310 --> 00:29:01,560
Currently at the moment there are 29 health clusters and we have 700 partners in globally who are assigned

294
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:08,940
to be a partner within the health cluster with 56 partners who are strategically engaged at a global level.

295
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:13,230
So, you know, it's quite a major response.

296
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:15,120
And this is just the health cluster.

297
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:23,070
There were 11 clusters in total and each of them have their own kind of cluster teams that are working together to partner in the work.

298
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:31,030
Next slide, please. So I think this is quite self-explanatory,

299
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:37,810
but really it's just to ensure that you've got the information about kind of the strategic vision for the health cluster,

300
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:48,250
about saving lives and making sure we're doing it in a dignified way, way for those who we're responding to with regards to our health emergencies.

301
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:57,010
And it's just making sure that we are improving the health outcomes in a timely and predictable, an appropriate and effective, effective way.

302
00:29:57,850 --> 00:30:01,780
It's very crucial that we keep people at the center of the response.

303
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:04,340
And again, it is something we often fail at.

304
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:12,190
It's crucial that we coordinate effectively and that we empower the leadership within each of the countries that

305
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:19,960
are responding and and also look at building that national capacity so that we can leave in an appropriate manner.

306
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:31,460
Next slide, please. So we have talked a little bit about the cluster system as a whole that will go into a country.

307
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:41,419
But what happens sometimes is and I will talk about this in the next meeting, but you'll have a country where the disaster hits multiple areas.

308
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:45,110
So the Philippines is an easy example where there are lots of islands.

309
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:49,520
And having someone sitting in Manila, for example. Right.

310
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,710
Heads often house cluster.

311
00:30:52,070 --> 00:31:01,340
But then you need people who are going out to each of the islands where the disasters hit to be a subnational kind of coordinator and cluster and say

312
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:10,999
you need to make sure that that whole subnational coordination that has been decentralized from the national level is feeding into the national level,

313
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:18,320
but also providing a whole a holistic cluster response within each of those areas that they're working with.

314
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:24,470
So often in large countries, if disasters hit large areas, you'll have not just the health cluster in place,

315
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:28,640
but you'll also have the clusters who are working in those places.

316
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:38,560
Next slide, please. And I think really it's just crucial that we are able to make sure that we're managing clusters effectively.

317
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:47,240
We're looking at the performance of clusters we're establishing and maintaining appropriate coordination mechanisms that as a cluster,

318
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:50,270
we're keeping ourselves flexible as time goes forward,

319
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:56,270
but also as we are changing in our disasters, going from, you know,

320
00:31:56,370 --> 00:32:05,330
single country disasters to multi regional disasters such as Syria and and potentially now with Ukraine, etc.

321
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:09,919
I mean, we need to make sure that we're also interacting with other clusters.

322
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:16,850
So with nutrition, with wash, so that we can have a holistic approach to the affected populations.

323
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,180
And we continue to be accountable to those who are affected.

324
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:27,000
Next slide, please. And lastly, and this is something we really fail at.

325
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:37,530
We're very good at activating. So the criteria for activating a cluster is really when a government is saying, look, we can't cope.

326
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:40,170
So we need international assistance.

327
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:46,410
And as we look at kind of responding in an international way and we come into that country, that there are major gaps,

328
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:53,780
there is major deterioration within the situation for the population who actually need to step up that support into that country.

329
00:32:53,790 --> 00:33:05,160
And so at the U.N. with the government will initiate the need for a cluster to be brought into place and activates the cluster system.

330
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:09,600
Next slide. What we fail at is the deactivating.

331
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:18,060
So if you look at many countries for a system that is there to respond to an emergency to build capacity of that country,

332
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:22,470
what we're actually doing is we're in some countries now for 60 years.

333
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:27,390
And if we had done our job, the question is, should we still be there?

334
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:36,120
Because we should have built the national capacity, we should have empowered that that country for us to be able to deactivate the system and leave.

335
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:43,890
What happens often is we stay in countries because it's funding or we leave a country because the money's run out.

336
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:47,970
But it doesn't mean the needs have gone or the capacity has been developed.

337
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:54,630
And so the formal deactivation of a cluster is that the situation is improved,

338
00:33:54,630 --> 00:34:04,530
that the government is able to now go back to its national systems and be able to provide sufficient capacity to meet the needs of the country.

339
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:08,940
But this is something that we don't see happen very well.

340
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:14,160
And again, this is something I'll talk a little bit more on next week as we look at the Philippines response.

341
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:18,440
Thank you. Let's turn over to Richard.

342
00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:29,220
I think it's wonderful. Thank you, Susan. Richard, are you able to share your screen or do you want me to present the slides for you?

343
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:41,250
I'm. I'm just sharing them now. Ron, I just wondering know you're not seeing them way you do.

344
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:46,610
You might need to authorize me to share. Yeah. Yeah.

345
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:50,400
We have a try now. Okay.

346
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:59,170
Wonderful. Right.

347
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:06,010
Well, I'm I'm the sort of the the light hearted end to this this first session.

348
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:11,800
And I'm conscious that you've covered a lot of ground, and we've hit you with a huge number of abbreviations.

349
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:18,390
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to just send it in a context of you now deploying to a country.

350
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:23,799
So I want you just for a moment to imagine that you represent a variety of roles.

351
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,740
And I know all of you are coming with a health background,

352
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:32,500
but I want to I want you to imagine as well that you maybe some of you are actually going with

353
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:38,110
security backgrounds and you want to make sure that people are able to be secure in their camps.

354
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:42,610
Others of you may be communications expert setting up mobile phone networks.

355
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:50,229
Some of you might be thinking about water and sanitation. How quickly can we make sure we got access to fresh water or or digging latrines?

356
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:52,570
And so some of you may be shelter expert,

357
00:35:52,580 --> 00:36:00,040
some of you may be search and rescue experts going in right at the start and still looking for people who've been affected by the rubble.

358
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:08,050
And one of my first points is very simply this when you and I go into an international humanitarian operation,

359
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:13,750
we are going into a place where people already are there from other countries.

360
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:21,370
And as Americans, you should be proud of the fact that your your fellow countrymen are probably already there,

361
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:30,310
have been working there for many years, have established systems, have established projects and have established communities within the country.

362
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:34,870
So you're not coming in as a complete single entity.

363
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:42,760
There will be plenty of people flying their flags already and will have been flying their flags for many years prior to you to arriving.

364
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:51,820
And second to that point is not only are there many countries there, but the United Nations and its international organizations are there as well.

365
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:55,620
So very quickly, a bit of interaction here. If I could just ask you one.

366
00:36:55,630 --> 00:37:00,640
One of these just shout out. Can anybody tell me what does UNHCR stand for?

367
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:11,290
Somebody. Does anybody know? Well done.

368
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:21,030
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. And indeed, Suzanne mentioned an organization as well when she was going through.

369
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:25,450
She mentioned the IOM. What? What is IOM stand for?

370
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:33,670
Anybody know that one? I am.

371
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:42,360
The International Office of Migration is an office that looks to see people who are leaving their home and they're crossing a border.

372
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:49,350
So the UNHCR looks after people who have now left their country and are refugees.

373
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:55,920
But there's another category of people who are affected. And these we call deportees displaced people.

374
00:37:56,130 --> 00:38:00,930
So you will sometimes hear about refugees and sometimes you'll hear about displaced people.

375
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:07,200
Displaced people are still in their country. They've just lost their home in their communities, and they just got nowhere to live.

376
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:13,830
But they're within their country. A refugee is someone who's actually physically left across an international border and left their country.

377
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:19,740
Now, here's a really hard well, it always catches out. Ask you this. Can anybody tell me what UNICEF stands for?

378
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:30,060
UNICEF. Well, actually, I'll be very honest with you.

379
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:38,240
I looked it up again because I think it's one of these things I very quickly forget today they say simply call the United Nations Children's Fund.

380
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:45,470
The reason why it's called UNICEF is originally called the United Nations International Children's Emergency Funds.

381
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:50,300
And you can see from the diagram, it's something to do with a child being held by its mother.

382
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:55,010
And so it is very much about looking not just about children, but also mothers.

383
00:38:55,520 --> 00:39:00,290
Hopefully on easier ground. WFP Anybody want to tell me what WFP stands for?

384
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:05,990
The World Food Program. Absolutely. Good. And what's Fayose's stand for?

385
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:14,840
FAA standards for the Food and Agricultural Organization.

386
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:21,830
So that begs the question, what's the difference between the WFP, the World Food Program and the FAO,

387
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:24,950
the Food and Agriculture Organization, everyone to have a go at?

388
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:28,160
Tell me, what's the difference between WFP and FAO?

389
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:43,030
In a nutshell, the WFP deliver food to you in bulk, in boxes, in great big aircraft and logistical chains.

390
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:52,060
They will bring food to people who need it. The FAO is there to help countries increase their ability to grow their own food.

391
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:58,480
And I'm not I'm not going to embarrass you. We all know it stands for the World Health Organization.

392
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:01,990
So these people are in place even before you arrive.

393
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:09,220
And then the United Nations Development Project, to have those I should say the United Nations Development Program,

394
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:16,750
who have this mandate not only to eliminate poverty and also achieve sustainable economic growth,

395
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:25,270
but also to to improve democratic governance and peacebuilding, including disaster resilience.

396
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:35,200
In other words, in most countries, the UNDP, the office of the UNDP in these countries have a responsibility to help that country develop its national

397
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:41,350
disaster management plan and how it will respond to disasters at the regional level and at the local level.

398
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:43,569
And then, of course,

399
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:52,300
we have big players like the International Committee of the Red Cross or Red Crescent Societies and the International Federation of the Red Cross.

400
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:59,559
And the International Federation of the Red Cross is literally a club of National Red Cross Red Cross associations.

401
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:04,270
So, for example, you have American Red Cross that is a member of the IFC.

402
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,850
So all of these people are already in place.

403
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:16,900
And if I add on to that, there are community groups who already have among themselves different ways of handling crises.

404
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:21,760
And different communities will handle crises differently. Different communities will have different leaders,

405
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:30,160
big businesses and industries in country often integrated into national disaster management in some of the countries where we work.

406
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:37,420
Big, big industries provide something of the software support.

407
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:42,940
They actually provide the the data bases upon which governments base their national data.

408
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:47,740
Other other industries provide heavy moving and heavy lifting equipment.

409
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:57,610
So big trucks and so on. So big industries are involved at the national level unions because they decide what people can and can't do.

410
00:41:58,270 --> 00:42:04,959
The government itself, with its plans, commercial organizations, all kinds of clubs,

411
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:10,420
trades and associations of their faith groups, the media and of course, social media.

412
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:18,040
All of these people are not only responding to the crisis that you've now coming in, but they're commenting on the crisis.

413
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:22,420
So you're coming into a noise of activity.

414
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:28,210
And when I add on to that, all the organizations of which you are now part.

415
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:33,760
Potentially you may be coming in under medicines or Frontieres or media or medicine demands.

416
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:37,420
You may be coming in under Tearfund or Care or Save the Children.

417
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:45,010
You could be coming in in all kinds of different organizations. And each of these organizations may also already be in place.

418
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:47,410
And that leads me to a very simple point.

419
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:57,460
There is a conflict of objectives between the people who are coming in after a disaster, starts to provide humanitarian assistance,

420
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:05,080
and the people who have been in there for many years who now believe that they they are what they're doing is international development.

421
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:13,239
So you may have an NGO, a health a public health NGO that's going in initially to provide humanitarian

422
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:17,230
assistance for a disaster that happened five years ago or ten years ago.

423
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:24,610
And because they could see not only that their work was really having an impact, but that they were loved by the people they stay on.

424
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:32,710
So they cease to be humanitarian assistance because the the humanitarian disaster has ended and they've stayed on for the next few years,

425
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:36,250
basically under the guise of international development.

426
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:43,150
And now you come in and you're a competitor. You come in and they regard you as someone who doesn't know what they know.

427
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:47,950
You are now drawing upon the resources that they feel they should have.

428
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:54,310
So the international humanitarian workplace is complex.

429
00:43:54,370 --> 00:43:57,560
That's the key point I'm trying to put across now.

430
00:43:57,580 --> 00:44:02,830
So who are the key players? The World's Disaster Management Agency is this one.

431
00:44:02,830 --> 00:44:04,960
Ochoa and Suse mentioned this in her talk.

432
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:13,180
The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the work of Ochoa basically is to turn to America and say,

433
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:18,700
we're having a disaster in this country. What can you provide to turn to the United Kingdom and say the same thing?

434
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:25,270
We're having a disaster in this country. What can you provide? And they turned to all their members and ask what could they can provide?

435
00:44:25,870 --> 00:44:30,980
And based upon what is provided, they coordinate that provision into the country.

436
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,210
That's what you do. But so do the European Union.

437
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:40,930
They have their own version of Ochoa, which they call echo the European Commission Humanitarian Aid Office.

438
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:46,959
Now, they are doing exactly the same as Ochoa. They're coming to Britain and saying, What can you provide?

439
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:52,260
They're coming to France and Holland and Germany and Italy and so on.

440
00:44:52,270 --> 00:44:55,300
They go, what all the European Union say, what can you provide?

441
00:44:55,720 --> 00:45:00,310
And so at the same time, this Ochoa is asking us in the UK, What can you provide?

442
00:45:00,850 --> 00:45:03,040
So might European Union?

443
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:10,270
And of course we've only got one lot of aid, so we might allow the aid to come under the UN batch or we might let it come under the EU batch.

444
00:45:11,290 --> 00:45:19,029
But the European Commission has one other change and they tend to prefer to work through international partners,

445
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:29,830
international humanitarian agencies that you can see that the EU have a list of around about 150, 151 trusted partners.

446
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:34,480
And when you go onto their website, they will they will tell you who those partners are.

447
00:45:35,230 --> 00:45:42,730
And this is a really powerful tool for host countries to partner with the EU through these trusted partners.

448
00:45:44,530 --> 00:45:51,670
There's another name I can mention to you, and that's the Euro Atlantic Disaster Response Coordination Center, part of Nito.

449
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:57,940
A simple rule of thumb. The longer the name, the smaller the organization is.

450
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:08,410
The UN has to two words to it and is just one is hundreds and hundreds and thousands and thousands of people.

451
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:15,130
The Euro Atlantic Disaster Response Coordination Coordination Center has two full time staff.

452
00:46:15,310 --> 00:46:24,790
And actually, when I was last there, one of them was part time job is to try and coordinate non-NATO allies to provide disaster relief.

453
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:32,960
So here's a little exercise with which we're going to finish, and hopefully this will lead to a little bit discussion at the end.

454
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:38,230
I want you to imagine, please, that we are all deploying to this country.

455
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:42,549
And I'm going to say, for sake of argument, this country is out of Mongolia.

456
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:50,380
We worked it out to Bulgaria for about six years. So you're going to deploy to Outer Mongolia and it's November clue.

457
00:46:50,770 --> 00:46:59,900
Very cold. And you're going to deploy because there have been earthquakes in the eastern area of Mongolia in three cities.

458
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:08,310
You can see the cities are marked by these black boxes here. So it is major earthquakes in these three cities in the eastern area of outer Mongolia.

459
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:15,389
We are now going to fly into this country and when we arrive, some of us are going to be going to City A,

460
00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:18,810
some of us are going to be going to City B and some of us are going to be going to city.

461
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:26,340
See. So what I want you to do and Ryan, can I ask you just a little bit of stage management here?

462
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:37,229
Can I ask you please individually to taking no more than about a 2 minutes write down as many questions that

463
00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:45,780
you will want to ask before you get into that plane to arrive in outer Mongolia in about 15 hours time.

464
00:47:46,050 --> 00:47:56,490
Probably more more like my 18 hours time from America, probably at 3:00 in the morning or some ungodly hour in the cold.

465
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:02,940
I want you to write down about eight or ten questions that you possibly can that

466
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:07,080
you would want to ask on behalf of your team before you get in the aircraft.

467
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:12,090
So if your health for, you know, pretend you are a health professional and you're in charge of the health professionals,

468
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:18,360
or maybe you are in charge of water, sanitation or shelter or search and rescue, decide what your role is.

469
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:25,500
What questions do you want to ask somebody before you get in the aircraft and travel to outer Mongolia?

470
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:30,480
We'll give you 2 minutes to do that. And at this stage, just working individually.

471
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:32,730
And then after 2 minutes, Ryan,

472
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:41,670
could you let people work in pairs and compare their lists so that they can see which one person's got and they can add to their own list?

473
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:42,510
Is that okay?

474
00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:50,040
So about 2 minutes on the road, then 2 minutes in pairs, and then I'm just going to go around the room and ask people to say what they think.

475
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:50,780
Of all. If.

476
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:08,220
Okay. We're just coming up to the end of the second minute now, working on your own.

477
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:19,180
And now if you'd like to pair off and compare notes and build up a maybe a slightly bigger list.

478
00:50:22,350 --> 00:50:33,100
And while you're doing that, Ryan. And Justin, what's the best way that people can share their ideas and actually be heard?

479
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:41,410
I suppose we could probably just share them because they get a shot in the mouth.

480
00:50:46,870 --> 00:51:05,770
I knew that the best way for me to do it because I actually said, Can you see me, Richard?

481
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:10,870
Yes, I can. Yeah. Yeah. No. And so it looks like there's like a very tight.

482
00:51:11,530 --> 00:51:18,249
So I'm not sure we have a plan, but it may be they maybe just call out on people in the group.

483
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:21,370
I don't think it's going to be a competition. Okay.

484
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:32,250
So I just want to pick your brain.

485
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:40,180
What's that, Richard, again? I was just saying that if when people are calling out, you could do is just repeat it.

486
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:43,420
Yeah. To repeat it to you. Sure. Absolutely.

487
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:54,040
So do you want me to let me know when you want me to start and we can pick it up in just about 80 seconds or 80 seconds?

488
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:59,680
So precise. Yes. Oh, oh, yes. All right.

489
00:51:59,770 --> 00:52:05,170
After which, my wine goes chilled, so. Right. I remember the proper temperature.

490
00:52:05,710 --> 00:52:09,870
Absolutely. I guess that's you.

491
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:25,240
I don't think it's any of that kind of stuff.

492
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:42,640
I don't know that.

493
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:45,790
I think that's.

494
00:52:45,850 --> 00:52:49,680
That's for 2 minutes. All right. We're done, guys. Thank you.

495
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:56,260
Wow. I tell you what, in your university, right? When you say, can we now be quiet?

496
00:52:56,410 --> 00:53:04,480
I've never known people for quiet so quickly. There's actually no way I can get people at Bournemouth University to go quiet that quickly.

497
00:53:04,510 --> 00:53:08,440
Absolutely not. All right, guys.

498
00:53:08,530 --> 00:53:14,530
So let's let's see how we go. And I didn't I don't care who goes first, Ron.

499
00:53:14,530 --> 00:53:19,090
You might want to sort of choreograph this. So can we just go round the room?

500
00:53:19,690 --> 00:53:20,950
You've been talking in pairs,

501
00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:28,150
so maybe one person from each pair as we go around the room and let's see what we can build up in terms of questions that you want to ask.

502
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:32,710
And if somebody mentions a question that's not on your list and added to your list.

503
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:38,200
Okay. Who wants to go first? Yeah.

504
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:42,350
So we kind of went with the basics of first just like, what's the heating situation?

505
00:53:42,710 --> 00:53:46,250
So it was cold and like, what's the power situation? What's the water source?

506
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:48,020
And like, what's the immediate medical needs?

507
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:54,650
Okay, I only get because otherwise you're going to make other people quite distressed that you're taking all their good ones away from them.

508
00:53:56,350 --> 00:54:00,200
Well done. Okay, let's start with heating, because I did say it's cold heating.

509
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:05,719
So that means you're going to need to bring in heaters yourselves, which and you're right,

510
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:10,910
you just beg the question, well, if we're bringing in heaters, what power are we going to use?

511
00:54:11,150 --> 00:54:16,340
Is the electricity working? If it isn't working, we can bring in generators.

512
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:22,280
But if we bring in generators, what sort of fuel should we bring with us to to power this generators?

513
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:26,450
If we run out of the fuel. Well, you have additional fuel that we can use.

514
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:31,460
Well, you don't want to you don't want to use their resources. You want to come in self-sufficient.

515
00:54:31,610 --> 00:54:35,690
So you've already got us thinking exactly the right way. Okay, next one, please.

516
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:46,450
Yup. So I think one of the most important pieces of this puzzle is knowing the magnitude of the earthquake and the epicenter

517
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:54,160
so that we can go ahead and figure out the extent of the destruction and how many people were affected by it.

518
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:56,890
Well done. Really good question.

519
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:05,950
The point the point that you're going to ask and this is the hardest thing after an earthquake, you're asking the nation, how badly have you been hit?

520
00:55:06,190 --> 00:55:09,340
How many people have died? How many buildings have collapsed?

521
00:55:09,910 --> 00:55:11,530
You know, what do you need?

522
00:55:11,890 --> 00:55:20,980
And if you want to to think about it from the point of view of the president of the country, look at Haiti after the 2010 earthquake.

523
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:25,360
The president has lost his palace. He's walking the streets of Port au Prince.

524
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:33,160
And he is he's you can see he's dazed. And the CNN reporter comes up and says to him, hi, you know, how bad is the earthquake?

525
00:55:33,310 --> 00:55:43,330
How many people have died? He hasn't a clue. He guesses you can see him guessing, say, well, 20, 25,000, maybe 30,000.

526
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:46,690
It was 220,000. How could you know?

527
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:53,260
Days or minutes after the earthquake? How do you know? But these are exactly the right questions you're trying to ask.

528
00:55:53,410 --> 00:55:58,090
What's the magnitude? What are we dealing with? And therefore, what sort of needs are people going to have?

529
00:55:58,100 --> 00:56:03,520
Well done. Next question, please. Yes.

530
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:08,859
So one of the main questions is, what are the mobile devices that are currently in place?

531
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:11,910
And do the main part of that? Oh, I love it.

532
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:16,809
Well done, you. Fantastic question. What's already out there?

533
00:56:16,810 --> 00:56:20,980
What's happening? But then you said three major. Really important was who's in charge?

534
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:26,530
Who's in charge at the local level? In other words, if we come. Who do we report to?

535
00:56:27,670 --> 00:56:35,950
Who's the person so that we get coordinated so we don't just come and start doing things, but we get coordinated by a local coordinator.

536
00:56:35,950 --> 00:56:42,220
Well done. Really good question. Next one. Do we speak the language and it's not.

537
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:46,180
Is there a translation service available? Yeah.

538
00:56:46,530 --> 00:56:50,390
So I'm guessing. I'm guessing none of you actually speak Mongolian.

539
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:56,540
Put a hand up if you can speak Mongolian. I can say one word in Mongolian, which is good morning.

540
00:56:57,450 --> 00:57:02,120
Which which as an interest part of this lecture at no extra cost to you.

541
00:57:02,270 --> 00:57:06,410
If you can learn to say a gloomy end, you've just said good morning in Mongolia.

542
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:12,230
But you're right, we need interpreters. And there's a big difference between an interpreter and a guide.

543
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:18,350
You don't know your way around Mongolia. You need a guide. You don't know how to speak the language.

544
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:22,160
You need an interpreter. But do not use an interpreter as a guide.

545
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:26,000
And do not use a guide as an interpreter. Okay, next question.

546
00:57:28,290 --> 00:57:28,500
Yeah.

547
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:39,570
I guess along those lines, they're interested in knowing whether or not we as individuals are culturally competent to work in the area, are competent.

548
00:57:39,570 --> 00:57:46,840
And what would you say culturally competent? Could you just repeat that question again?

549
00:57:48,070 --> 00:57:51,170
We want to know whether or not we were trained to be culturally competent.

550
00:57:51,370 --> 00:57:54,730
Yes. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Excellent question.

551
00:57:54,780 --> 00:58:06,700
Yes, there there are horrible examples. If I go back to the earthquake in Pakistan, the Kashmir earthquake in Pakistan, 2004,

552
00:58:06,730 --> 00:58:14,470
five, I think it was the the earthquake brought many NGOs to come in and to give aid.

553
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:21,970
And one particular NGO, the ladies who are part of the NGO, when they went on duty,

554
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:29,260
put on bikinis and sunbathed in the courtyard of the buildings in which they were housed.

555
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:39,760
But that building was right next to an Islamic ladies finishing school, and it nearly caused a major, major incident.

556
00:58:39,910 --> 00:58:46,510
And fortunately, the police and the military calmed everything down. But being culturally sensitive to what we say,

557
00:58:46,510 --> 00:58:57,070
what we do and actually probably the most important part of the cultural sensitivity is to include the local community in discussing what they need.

558
00:58:57,850 --> 00:59:02,250
That's a really important part. Okay. Right.

559
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:06,450
How long until we need to stop? About 10 minutes left.

560
00:59:07,570 --> 00:59:15,310
Okay, enough about the questions. Okay. So I'll do I'll do two more questions and then we'll turn it over to wider discussion.

561
00:59:15,550 --> 00:59:25,420
So two more questions, please. We were talking about whether the local hospitals were at capacity or if triaging centers have been established yet.

562
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:32,379
Very good. So if you're coming in as a public health representative, somebody is going to come in to provide medical aid.

563
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:38,020
You want to know, are the hospitals working? What sorts of or maybe what sort of needs may the hospitals have?

564
00:59:38,650 --> 00:59:43,720
And can we use the hospitals? Very good question. Last question and then I'll hand back to Ron.

565
00:59:45,450 --> 00:59:48,780
I think everyone has gone actually anybody else.

566
00:59:50,490 --> 00:59:55,050
But we're trying to figure out which is that pretty similar to ours, I suppose.

567
00:59:55,710 --> 01:00:00,570
I guess we have quite a lot of the international. What other countries are there.

568
01:00:00,630 --> 01:00:04,410
Well, thank you. That's yeah. Thank you for asking that question.

569
01:00:05,130 --> 01:00:08,610
And Ron will give you 30 points as a result of asking that question.

570
01:00:08,610 --> 01:00:11,790
In other words, who else is there?

571
01:00:11,790 --> 01:00:14,810
Who else is there, and how do we coordinate with them?

572
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:21,600
Go back to Susanne. Where are the coordinating mechanisms? And that's what we will look at the next time I speak to us in a week's time.

573
01:00:21,810 --> 01:00:27,870
But if I just put up these little points at the bottom of the slide here, what some very simple things.

574
01:00:27,870 --> 01:00:32,700
Water. Can we drink the water or do we need to bring water purification tablets?

575
01:00:32,850 --> 01:00:36,059
We you mentioned Paul, you mentioned fuel. You mentioned ten participants.

576
01:00:36,060 --> 01:00:41,640
Guides a map. Now you may say, well, of course we'll get a map when we get out there.

577
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:49,979
I defy you. The thing is, I've been I've worked in so many countries during and after disasters, and I say, can I have a map?

578
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:55,920
And they say, we don't have any. And then they tell me in one particular country say, we don't need maps, we know the area.

579
01:00:55,930 --> 01:01:02,760
I say, you do because you live there. I don't. And by the way, are we all using the same map so we refer to the same place.

580
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:07,380
We talked about points of contact radios. Can we bring our own radios in?

581
01:01:07,470 --> 01:01:14,220
And I don't mean radio. So you could listen to pop music. I mean, communication tele is how you can bring walkie talkies in.

582
01:01:14,370 --> 01:01:18,540
Are you allowed to transmit on those various wavelengths?

583
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:22,950
Are dogs. If you're doing search and rescue, you may bring in dogs as well.

584
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:27,810
So are they going to be allowed to cross the border or specialist equipment?

585
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:32,400
During the Pakistan earthquake, many people brought in very,

586
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:39,720
very sensitive heat and sound sensing equipment to try and listen for people who might have survived under the rubble.

587
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:45,750
It was confiscated at the airport by the Pakistan Air Force, who said, what is this specialized equipment?

588
01:01:45,750 --> 01:01:53,340
Why are you bringing in where the weather permits? Are you trying to smuggle expensive Western equipment in so you can sell it?

589
01:01:53,940 --> 01:01:59,999
Accommodation where we know you've just arrived from a a 15 hour or 18 hour flight to America.

590
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,360
You're very tired. You want to get your head down, has some sleep.

591
01:02:03,990 --> 01:02:10,990
Where are you going to stay? Do you need to be in tents or are there homes that you're going to be use and the most in?

592
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:18,060
Well, I'll just do the last two customs, immigration visas and transport hire rule one.

593
01:02:19,590 --> 01:02:26,250
As soon as you arrive in any country for any humanitarian operation, hire every vehicle you can possibly find.

594
01:02:26,930 --> 01:02:34,139
But but a secondary rule. Look to see what people are driving in the area that you're going to don't automatically

595
01:02:34,140 --> 01:02:38,610
go for the biggest fall by fall if you're going to an area with narrow roads,

596
01:02:38,790 --> 01:02:42,330
look to see what transport people have driving in the biggest area.

597
01:02:42,870 --> 01:02:46,530
But here's the most important question none of us have asked. But it's very important.

598
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:54,460
Have we been invited? You can't come in unless the country has invited you.

599
01:02:56,300 --> 01:03:00,740
If you go into a country without an invitation, we tend to call it an invasion.

600
01:03:01,370 --> 01:03:07,730
So has the country asked you to come in and then your visas, of course, will follow from that?

601
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:11,830
That's enough for me. Thank you very much. I look forward to being with you next week.

602
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:21,139
Back to you, Ryan. Well, thank you, Richard. So we will turn over for questions and in a minute or so.

603
01:03:21,140 --> 01:03:25,940
But just to give you a preview of next week, on Tuesday, we'll just be asked to go over nutrition.

604
01:03:26,390 --> 01:03:30,010
And on Thursday, next week, Justin seems to be back.

605
01:03:30,020 --> 01:03:39,919
We will do a case study on the Philippines. And then we will do a interactive exercise where everyone will take the role of responder.

606
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:44,270
And you'll respond to a nutritional crisis in Cox's Bazar in Bangladesh.

607
01:03:45,230 --> 01:03:52,280
But for now, in the last five, 10 minutes of class, any questions for food, Richard, or just.

608
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:04,450
My question for. Great.

609
01:04:05,390 --> 01:04:09,140
Any closing comments from any of you?

610
01:04:11,510 --> 01:04:17,810
Ryan We had two candidates coming this week. Okay, I'll I'll ask your question.

611
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:21,380
So, I mean, I want to I think it's useful.

612
01:04:21,990 --> 01:04:28,970
Okay. Richardson, can you guys hear me? Yup. Yup. So I think it's important because I think maybe, you know,

613
01:04:30,110 --> 01:04:35,370
how do you guys when the Haitian earthquake happens, we guys are old enough to remember that.

614
01:04:37,730 --> 01:04:41,059
I think it's getting to the point where this can happen to you guys, too.

615
01:04:41,060 --> 01:04:46,760
But you're going to you're going to suddenly be like, I'm in my mind, I'm in the air.

616
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:55,190
And I have residents that are about 27. And also the Whitney Houston is and they'll be like all of them because you like your culture.

617
01:04:57,590 --> 01:05:03,770
So here's the thing. So, hey, so I'm Suze was talking about gas.

618
01:05:03,770 --> 01:05:09,330
And I think I want to just make it clear because the cluster system is a very it's it's

619
01:05:09,390 --> 01:05:13,400
it's it's an improvement on what we had because something like so when Haiti happened,

620
01:05:14,270 --> 01:05:16,579
it was a it was a it was the earthquake that happened.

621
01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:21,020
And it was so close to the United States that one of the problems we had was that a lot of NGOs,

622
01:05:22,730 --> 01:05:26,720
a lot of different NGO would go down there and they would go and they would want to help.

623
01:05:27,050 --> 01:05:35,120
Right. But they didn't have knowledge of of the questions that you just said, the knowledge that we don't really connect with.

624
01:05:35,540 --> 01:05:39,109
They didn't understand that there was a structure already in place like the cluster system.

625
01:05:39,110 --> 01:05:45,320
And so what happened is you would have a lot of these independent NGOs around kind of doing their own thing.

626
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:52,129
And they wouldn't be. And it causes gaps in so much.

627
01:05:52,130 --> 01:05:57,720
Is that you you could have. I was in Sri Lanka once and a similar thing.

628
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:03,450
It was one of these mobile clinics was running mobile clinics and you're not part of a cluster system.

629
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:08,760
There is going to be and this especially is in places that have political instability.

630
01:06:08,970 --> 01:06:13,980
In Sri Lanka, you had the Tamils in the north of this in the south, and there was a civil war going on.

631
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:21,330
The the the so what we're switching now to this tsunami in Sri Lanka now, but it's a similar story.

632
01:06:22,140 --> 01:06:30,210
The typhoon the tsunami comes it basically wipes out into the shoreline and all the hospitals are overwhelmed.

633
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:40,920
So what happens is the minister of health is telling us that the is telling us kind of where to go in terms of where where the clinics are.

634
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:48,719
But there were some gaps in that that he wasn't telling us necessarily where he was

635
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:53,250
forgetting the Tamil areas and that telling us that there were these the Tamil areas.

636
01:06:53,250 --> 01:07:02,030
And so the cluster system can kind of be this objective, subjective view that has the whole view of the whole scenario.

637
01:07:02,070 --> 01:07:09,650
You can kind of understand where the needs are so that NGOs aren't concentrating in the easy areas to get to it and don't

638
01:07:09,660 --> 01:07:16,290
understand that there's places out in more desolate regions that need to be cared for so that mobile phones go out there.

639
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:21,900
So do you understand kind of like all the NGOs, if you don't know that there's a cluster system going to go to the areas that are all easy,

640
01:07:22,230 --> 01:07:31,380
findable and all that where there's growth, but it's not uncommon where you have the everybody's kind of understanding where the problems are.

641
01:07:31,700 --> 01:07:34,760
You know, if there's a bridge out, it's going to be more difficult to go.

642
01:07:34,770 --> 01:07:38,700
But you need. You need to get NGO to go to those clinics and help those people as well.

643
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:43,529
So see, as I'm tired, I don't think I'm explaining it appropriate.

644
01:07:43,530 --> 01:07:50,250
Can you. Do you have any thing to add on that, on how the cluster system kind of avoiding any gaps if everybody.

645
01:07:51,170 --> 01:08:00,719
I think the one point just to flip it around the other way to make it clear is that if the NGOs, the non-government organizations,

646
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:08,550
national and international, do not go and talk to the cluster system, then we don't know where the gaps and duplication is.

647
01:08:08,850 --> 01:08:13,320
So it's not about the cluster system doing the work as such.

648
01:08:13,350 --> 01:08:18,180
They're pulling all the work together, they're mapping what what happens and why people come in.

649
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:21,719
What we found to take a Syrian crisis is a good example.

650
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:25,050
I don't mean to come away from Haiti, but I wasn't involved in Haiti.

651
01:08:26,220 --> 01:08:31,470
What happened was because it was such a secretive mission, if you like,

652
01:08:31,830 --> 01:08:36,600
and nobody wanted to coordinate with anybody because the risks were so high that if

653
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:43,110
anybody found out who was inside Syria that teams would be killed by people inside.

654
01:08:43,650 --> 01:08:48,270
So because of that lack of communication, nobody knew where anybody was working.

655
01:08:48,270 --> 01:08:51,750
We didn't know if we were duplicating. We didn't know where the gaps were.

656
01:08:52,050 --> 01:08:58,110
And that's the point. And I think to have a really good coordination body in the cluster system,

657
01:08:58,160 --> 01:09:01,950
it has to be trustworthy, which is one of the issues they were concerned about.

658
01:09:01,950 --> 01:09:06,510
It didn't know if it would get leaked and B, everybody had to send their information.

659
01:09:06,540 --> 01:09:10,590
And if that if there's any blockage in that, it doesn't work.

660
01:09:11,670 --> 01:09:18,899
And there are multiple situations where it doesn't work, where the people aren't able to find the cluster system because they don't know it's there.

661
01:09:18,900 --> 01:09:26,520
They're not attending meetings. MSF, for example, were dreadful coordinating and didn't want to kind of tell people what they were doing.

662
01:09:26,970 --> 01:09:31,260
So I think that's the kind of key with the cluster system and making sure it functions.

663
01:09:31,650 --> 01:09:36,920
I hope that kind of complements what you said. It's just a question.

664
01:09:36,930 --> 01:09:46,649
I think. I think the we use when it was actually helps a lot with understanding how because with Richard's explanation I think

665
01:09:46,650 --> 01:09:54,870
you brought up the expedition in Mongolia and our kind of migration into Mongolia to help with the earthquakes.

666
01:09:55,200 --> 01:10:04,379
And in your list of like all the questions you mentioned radios in and when you list and I think we use actually

667
01:10:04,380 --> 01:10:13,320
stuck out too because I think in our view and asks actually has radios and the communication for radios.

668
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:18,120
And I think without the cluster system, I think Mongolia actually falls within the UN.

669
01:10:18,570 --> 01:10:25,080
So it should have a cluster system. I don't know what the cluster system is for nuclear, is that correct?

670
01:10:26,430 --> 01:10:28,889
And about whether a country sits in the UN,

671
01:10:28,890 --> 01:10:37,800
it's about whether a government activated the cluster system because they're in the middle of an emergency and they don't have capacity to respond.

672
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:42,240
So for example, the US sits in the UN, but it doesn't have a cluster system.

673
01:10:42,930 --> 01:10:48,660
Now if they had a major disaster where they couldn't cope because it maybe took out too much of America,

674
01:10:49,020 --> 01:10:52,530
then the government might say, we want that cluster system to be activated.

675
01:10:52,850 --> 01:10:57,110
I know, certainly. It was the NGO response for COVID.

676
01:10:57,110 --> 01:11:05,600
And the states say, you know, it's about whether the countries asked for it to be activated or not.

677
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:13,280
Okay. So it like it must have seemed like fully word to say we'd.

678
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:21,540
I have a need for this position or any country where the need and the existence of,

679
01:11:21,810 --> 01:11:28,710
say, something like a radio where dependable via this poster system.

680
01:11:29,370 --> 01:11:33,300
Oh, it would be like more like you would be dependable.

681
01:11:33,870 --> 01:11:38,130
Similar to how you mentioned the way that that that works.

682
01:11:38,220 --> 01:11:44,490
So there's a telecommunication cluster that is a part of I what I think that's what you're asking.

683
01:11:44,490 --> 01:11:50,100
So part of there is a telecommunications cluster just like the health cluster of cluster.

684
01:11:50,580 --> 01:11:52,979
But there is and they are the ones like in the Philippines,

685
01:11:52,980 --> 01:12:00,240
they were the ones that were setting up the cell phone towers and wiring our our headquarters with Internet that kind of way.

686
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:04,140
Yeah. But so that and that would also be a more idea.

687
01:12:04,380 --> 01:12:07,690
That was just with our stuff, with our HBO that that would be going on. Yes.

688
01:12:08,070 --> 01:12:11,990
It accepts you feel like it grounds you in a way you have to have communication.

689
01:12:12,650 --> 01:12:16,170
Yes, absolutely. Can I just add something to that?

690
01:12:16,170 --> 01:12:20,639
And that is remember that the cluster system and all the things we've been talking

691
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:26,340
about are international coordination systems that we're bringing into the host country.

692
01:12:27,090 --> 01:12:31,580
But the host country has its own national systems.

693
01:12:31,590 --> 01:12:35,280
I mean, Justin, you were talking about the incident command system. That's how America works.

694
01:12:35,490 --> 01:12:43,469
But every country has its own system. In some countries, their systems are more advanced than others and indeed, the military.

695
01:12:43,470 --> 01:12:55,110
In many countries, if you think of Pakistan and the the military control of the response to the earthquake in Pakistan was was very, very strong.

696
01:12:55,110 --> 01:12:56,790
It was particularly tight.

697
01:12:57,420 --> 01:13:06,990
And so the humanitarian sector, with their cluster systems, had to coordinate with the military in Pakistan in order to get anything done.

698
01:13:07,260 --> 01:13:14,700
And incidentally, Suzanne mentioned rightly that it was in Pakistan, that the cluster system was first used.

699
01:13:14,940 --> 01:13:19,679
And one of my colleagues, Larry Hollingworth, was the person who first used it.

700
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:26,760
He was sat in the operations room in Pakistan when the United Nations phoned him up and said,

701
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:31,560
We've invented this new system called the cluster system and we want you to implement it.

702
01:13:31,890 --> 01:13:38,160
And Larry said, Yes, sir, we will put the phone down. Turned to his partner, said, What on earth is the cluster system?

703
01:13:38,490 --> 01:13:45,120
And so they mentioned sort of trying to build their way forward in the next few weeks and months to see how it would work.

704
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:55,500
And it's developed over many years since that time. But the cluster system is, if you like, an it's a foreign import into a into a into a country.

705
01:13:55,590 --> 01:14:00,780
And the country itself has its own systems and needs to integrate alongside.

706
01:14:01,620 --> 01:14:07,050
The whole idea of cluster system is not to weigh down the government, the afflicted government,

707
01:14:07,290 --> 01:14:12,780
with the coordination of lots of lots of international humanitarian operators.

708
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:18,050
Just real quick. I know we had time. If you need to leave, feel free to.

709
01:14:18,060 --> 01:14:20,490
But if you can stay for a few minutes, that'll be fantastic.

710
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:28,560
Is there ever a moment where you already have a cluster activated for a specific crisis so that a similar crisis occurs

711
01:14:28,650 --> 01:14:39,780
and may require similar or whatever respective international groups within the cluster could provide that support.

712
01:14:41,490 --> 01:14:45,000
In that case, how good is that? How would you manage that?

713
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:50,440
Brian, can you just say the question again into the mike? All right.

714
01:14:51,280 --> 01:15:00,700
So when there's a cluster system already in place, but there's another disaster, how do you manage that when two systems are needed, essentially?

715
01:15:01,060 --> 01:15:05,260
Can I can I can I start with that and then I'll hand over the series?

716
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:08,950
It's a really good question. And just to give you an example of where that happened,

717
01:15:09,970 --> 01:15:17,710
we've been talking about the Pakistan earthquake in 2004 and the the the cluster system was established.

718
01:15:17,860 --> 01:15:23,739
And they also established something else we'll talk about called an Onsite Operation Coordination Center known as a no.

719
01:15:23,740 --> 01:15:29,620
So now that coordination center was set up and they worked well around Pakistan.

720
01:15:30,010 --> 01:15:36,159
What should happen at the end of the crisis, as you said, is we should then decommission that.

721
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:39,850
We should all go home. We should shut them down. But they didn't they they left them there.

722
01:15:40,300 --> 01:15:45,220
So when the floods took place in 2015, a new woosox were created.

723
01:15:45,430 --> 01:15:49,839
The new woosox conflicted with the old remaining Ozarks.

724
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:54,250
And so it actually caused a problem. So it's a useful question that you've asked that suits over to you.

725
01:15:54,610 --> 01:15:56,559
Yeah. I just want to add, I mean,

726
01:15:56,560 --> 01:16:03,250
we see this all the time in countries where we've got ongoing conflict and the conflict dies down and the cluster system remains.

727
01:16:03,250 --> 01:16:09,100
And look, we should be leaving. Let's be honest, money is what keeps us in countries.

728
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:13,630
If there's money available, people are going to take it. It's a salary. It's an income into their business.

729
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:21,520
But what actually the cluster system should be ready to respond and adapt to each changing situation and reality.

730
01:16:22,330 --> 01:16:25,460
But, you know, as Richard said, it varies.

731
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:33,770
Yes. And the other questions. Good.

732
01:16:33,830 --> 01:16:37,210
So firstly, thank you, Richard. Susan, Justin.

733
01:16:37,340 --> 01:16:40,530
Guys. Thank you for having us.

734
01:16:40,890 --> 01:16:45,719
Yeah. Usual of the class for a few minutes.

735
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:50,560
And Richard Foos, do you stick around for a few minutes as well in case people want to check.

736
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:54,840
I just want guys everybody's attention to.

737
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:03,420
This event, which is happening tomorrow on the Bus Research Center.

738
01:17:03,930 --> 01:17:08,000
There's a bus to go from here to there. It's the refugee health care system in Canada.

739
01:17:08,340 --> 01:17:11,160
If you've got the clock at 4:00, should be quite interesting.

740
01:17:11,190 --> 01:17:18,120
I'll be that interested in refugee health, but more on the resettlement countryside in the high income country.

741
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:23,460
This should definitely be on your radar. And this is on canvas as well, if you want to get some more details.

742
01:17:24,660 --> 01:17:28,380
But that is all. And I will see you all on Tuesday, next week.

743
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:43,920
From. Absolutely.

744
01:17:45,340 --> 01:17:54,300
And you ask the question before you decide is really come here.

745
01:17:56,550 --> 01:18:12,770
I was just wondering about that because I know we have opportunities and want to know if this is for us.

746
01:18:12,780 --> 01:18:16,319
I can't hear you. Maybe. Yes.

747
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:24,360
Sorry, I'm not hear about a couple of other places that I decided I wanted to stay in the States for the in-state tuition.

748
01:18:25,170 --> 01:18:30,730
Yeah. I'm sorry. I was trying to hear you, but then I thought I've missed too much.

749
01:18:31,650 --> 01:18:39,730
No, thank you. I'm just wondering if the pandemic has impacted the ability to provide international aid.

750
01:18:40,300 --> 01:18:45,459
Because I know, for example, when the volcano eruption happened and all of those issues,

751
01:18:45,460 --> 01:18:50,260
they were reluctant to let countries in because they had such a low COVID 19 rate.

752
01:18:50,260 --> 01:18:53,350
So that had an impact. No, no.

753
01:18:53,350 --> 01:19:00,160
I think the biggest impact has been there's been financial fatigue because countries have gotten poorer as a result of COVID.

754
01:19:00,190 --> 01:19:06,610
I think Ukraine really showed us the a perfect example that there isn't fatigue, because as soon as Ukraine,

755
01:19:07,180 --> 01:19:13,900
you know, there was an obscene amount of money that's been kind of placed into Ukraine and that we can't use.

756
01:19:14,710 --> 01:19:22,720
I think at the moment there it's countries that have got ongoing problems like Yemen, you know, these Syria,

757
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:30,720
etc. They're really struggling with funding Iraq, losing a lot of money in Iraq, and can't really keep a lot of that work going.

758
01:19:30,730 --> 01:19:35,380
So I don't think there's a concern about COVID as much.

759
01:19:35,770 --> 01:19:37,089
And what we found is, well,

760
01:19:37,090 --> 01:19:45,790
a lot of these countries that we expected to have dreadful death rates of COVID didn't actually have such a high transmission either.

761
01:19:47,260 --> 01:19:52,299
So, no, I think those days are over. I think people are happy to go wherever.

762
01:19:52,300 --> 01:19:57,430
But the money's changed. Yeah, there were.

763
01:19:57,520 --> 01:20:01,980
Thank you and thank you to all of you.

764
01:20:02,700 --> 01:20:07,180
But you're next week. I'll be Richard about next. But it's been quite long.

765
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:14,970
Do you want me to hear you talking to me or I'm turning around because it screams behind me?

766
01:20:14,990 --> 01:20:22,750
Okay. Sorry. I'm looking at you. You can see what I'm just saying.

767
01:20:23,710 --> 01:20:28,030
Well, I think. You happy? Absolutely. And they seem quite interested.

768
01:20:28,030 --> 01:20:31,870
So I'll call Richard about MEST.

769
01:20:32,830 --> 01:20:36,390
I have told him so he knows. And they did send you the email.

770
01:20:37,720 --> 01:20:45,070
And I think next week will be there'll be a lot more interest because you've kind of we've laid the foundation stage.
