1
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:13,560
So. It's a pleasure to see the.

2
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:20,880
Yeah. To.

3
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:36,690
6%. So today we're going to talk about celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity.

4
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,590
How many of you have gluten sensitivity or.

5
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,770
Okay. Should I get you? One or two things at this.

6
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:55,460
So for today's class, this is just some of the concepts will be on the not this quiz.

7
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:07,360
Well, it could be. Could be. So there's quite a bit of there is quite a bit of discussion of an adaptive immune response with this.

8
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:13,210
So. One question on the quiz for tomorrow might appear might appear.

9
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:17,440
So the quiz just a reminder. A quiz, the same kind of format.

10
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:24,560
Open book, open note, multiple choice, fill in the blank, that sort of thing.

11
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:31,340
Okay. So celiac disease, not celiac disease, include sensitivity.

12
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:37,310
First, let's talk about celiac disease in terms of its definition.

13
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:45,560
So this is a chronic condition and it's an autoimmune response that occurs in the small intestine.

14
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:57,649
It's inter apathy and it occurs in response to dietary gluten and goodness everywhere,

15
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:03,260
as we'll see in a slide that describes where you might find gluten in all kinds of different food products.

16
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:08,810
If you're never exposed to gluten, you won't develop this condition.

17
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,520
So how is it characterized?

18
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:24,000
Well, clinically, you would have to have the presence of an antibody against a number of things, and here are three of them listed.

19
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:31,320
So you would have antibodies against this tissue trans glutathione enzyme.

20
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:38,840
And this enzyme is involved with the digestion of the protein within the gluten.

21
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,490
You can have antibodies directed against the ENDEMISM.

22
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:54,060
So if this is the host tissue and then you can have an antibody directed against the disseminated gliding peptide.

23
00:02:54,630 --> 00:03:00,930
This is a portion of the gluten molecule which I'll show you and describe in a little bit more detail here in a bit.

24
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:08,210
So technically, this is a mixed type of response.

25
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,269
You'll it's characterized here as an autoimmune disease,

26
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:19,770
but there are aspects of an allergic response that you might see in that you have antibody directed against a food.

27
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,370
So kind of like a food allergy, but not really.

28
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:30,270
You have activation of the innate immune response and then you have an adaptive immune response against this type of condition.

29
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:37,800
So this is something that activates many different branches of the immune system.

30
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:51,120
So what do we have for markers in terms of who might be more susceptible to these based on their genetic background?

31
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:57,480
Well, there's markers here for the human lymphocyte antigen, HLA antigen.

32
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:03,600
This is the dq2 or D Q8.

33
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:13,920
So 2 to 3% of people who have this particular phenotype will go on to develop celiac disease.

34
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,690
And there are subclasses of this VQ two that make you more or less sensitive.

35
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:25,590
So it's a very defined, specific marker for this condition.

36
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:39,270
So how do you diagnose celiac disease? So with celiac disease, you would actually measure antibodies against some of the targets that I talked about.

37
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:48,300
So you can take a blood sample and you can measure the level of trans glutamate antibody.

38
00:04:48,750 --> 00:05:00,340
And the antibody here is the IGP molecule. The the molecule that form forms that the two molecules of HGH stuck together.

39
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:08,850
Or it can be against IGG gene and it can also happen in patients with an iron deficiency.

40
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:25,360
So and some of the diagnostic procedures use this determination of the HLA antigen, the DK2 and the due date.

41
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:34,360
But this is very technical. It can be done, but it's an expensive test.

42
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,740
The antibody test is a lot simpler.

43
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:49,090
And another way that it's diagnosed, if there's a suspicion of celiac disease to rule out other types of conditions,

44
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:52,480
is to actually take a biopsy of the small bowel.

45
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:55,799
And as you can imagine, this is complex.

46
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:02,860
So you'd have to put an end of scope into someone or usually a child and put it all the way down to their esophagus,

47
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:07,570
to their stomach and to the duodenum, and then to take a biopsy.

48
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:17,020
And you're looking here for the morphology of the line that are responsible for absorbing nutrients.

49
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:26,800
And you're also going to look for after you take a section and you put it in a slide and you process it,

50
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:33,190
stain it, you're also going to look for the number of immune cells, lymphocytes in that particular biopsy.

51
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:39,670
And if you have a high concentration of these, it's usually indicative of of having this condition.

52
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:46,600
So that's gluten sensitive celiac disease.

53
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:52,390
Um, there are a lot of, uh, tests that you can do.

54
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:57,070
Um, it's well characterized clinically.

55
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:01,960
Um, it affects a small percentage of the population.

56
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:06,670
Um, and then there is this non-celiac gluten sensitivity.

57
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:09,940
How many people do you know who have a celiac?

58
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:18,640
I'm sorry, a gluten sensitivity, but people who avoid gluten for because it makes them feel ill.

59
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:35,080
No, nobody usually. Should I get somebody. So this particular type of condition, um, it's going to, in fact, affect the intestinal and intestinal.

60
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:39,910
And there may be signs and symptoms associated with the ingestion of gluten.

61
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:46,420
And it's usually in things containing grains, but it can be in other products as well.

62
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,390
So gluten is a great binding agent.

63
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:58,480
So you might see it as a food additive in all kinds of different food products that you wouldn't suspect to find wheat or gluten in.

64
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:11,740
And with people who have non-celiac gluten sensitivity, they if they avoid gluten in their diet,

65
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:15,380
you might see an improvement in their condition within hours or days.

66
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:20,950
So it's a very rapid remission of these symptoms in people with celiac disease.

67
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,030
They improve when they abstain from gluten consumption.

68
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:28,780
But there may be some persistent symptoms.

69
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:38,850
So how prevalent is Non-Celiac gluten sensitivity?

70
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:43,430
Because I know a lot of people have it. That's that's kind of what we know.

71
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:49,200
A lot of people describe the symptoms associated with a consumption of products containing gluten.

72
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:53,400
And we really don't know how common this condition is.

73
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:58,200
But from hearing people describe their symptoms, it's fairly common.

74
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:04,620
And the availability of gluten free products suggests that it might be very common.

75
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:19,260
However, there has been a trend in low carb diets and gluten free diets, and some people feel this is a magic bullet for improved health.

76
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:23,730
So perhaps it's fairly common. We really don't know.

77
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,530
And the other thing that she should know about this,

78
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:38,469
if you're looking to tell whether or not somebody has a sensitivity versus celiac disease, celiac disease, there's lots of biomarkers.

79
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:41,500
Thank you. Measure antibody, you can measure the HLA antigen.

80
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:50,860
With gluten sensitivity, there's no biomarkers. You just can tell whether or not how someone feels after they consumed a certain amount of gluten.

81
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,110
So what's gluten, first of all?

82
00:09:55,590 --> 00:10:08,640
So it's a protein that is present in many different grain products, particularly wheat and gluten, as actually developed during the kneading process.

83
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:14,610
So you have two principal proteins that are responsible for the structure of gluten.

84
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:25,110
You have widen, which are globules represented here as the gold circles, and you have gluten in which are longer chain molecules.

85
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:29,910
When you mix wheat flour, I should say, with water,

86
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:38,129
the gluten starts to develop and you have interactions between the gluten and gliding

87
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:48,270
molecules through these side chain side chains on the amino acids that are rich in sulfur,

88
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:51,360
containing amino acids that can interact with one another.

89
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:57,930
And certain types of flowers are treated with oxidizing agents.

90
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:06,360
Or you can take the flour and let it age if you want to not have brominated fermentation done to the flour,

91
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:18,510
which is a food additive that increases oxidation of the of the gluten molecules and that improves the ability to form these types of structures.

92
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,620
So you add water to flour that has these proteins.

93
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:29,100
You form these disulfide form containing bonds, and it forms this structure here.

94
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:38,640
It's like a gluten mesh structure. So breads that have a hard crust and a lot of structure to them will have a lot of gluten in them.

95
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:43,050
Pizza dough will probably have the highest amount of gluten.

96
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:51,690
So if somebody has a gluten sensitivity or has celiac disease, they should avoid consuming those types of foods.

97
00:11:55,780 --> 00:12:01,150
So I just kind of I should have shown these pictures why we're doing this.

98
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:04,120
So Brad clearly has a lot of gluten in it.

99
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:13,510
And when you take that product and you let it rise and you're able to track hair within these different structures,

100
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:20,470
and it gives the products a certain texture that we find desirable.

101
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:28,630
And that's why it's important to have gluten in different types of bag products.

102
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:34,480
And you can actually see the gluten forming when you're kneading dough.

103
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:39,370
And the example here is pizza dough where you need it and need it needed to track some of the gas.

104
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:47,920
Have like a you may have a leavening agent. In this case, it would be fermentation of the sugar in the dough.

105
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:58,840
When you add yeast and you get these nice pockets of air that form and the thing that holds them together is the glue.

106
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:10,150
If you were to try gluten free pizza dough, it's a real challenge to get the same kind of texture.

107
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:22,810
There are much better things in the market nowadays, but they'll they could be unrecognizable to somebody who's used to this kind of a pizza dough.

108
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:31,010
So that's wheat products and baked goods.

109
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:36,500
We find lots of luminaire. Where else might you find? And we, for that matter.

110
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:40,010
Well, you could find it in all kinds of different food products.

111
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:48,950
So you might find gluten in things like blue cheese, cottage cheese, gorgonzola cheese and Roquefort.

112
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:52,459
I'm not exactly sure why it might be in there,

113
00:13:52,460 --> 00:14:03,860
but I would suspect that those types of cheeses are their structure is such that they need some kind of a support to keep them from falling apart.

114
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:10,920
So in the final preparation, you want a little bit of structure, so you might add some gluten to it to give it a little bit of firmness.

115
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:18,320
Different kinds of, of, of canned meat, imitation types, products.

116
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:29,000
So if you have vegan bacon or you're substituting animal protein with vegetable protein,

117
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:33,980
you need some kind of structure to keep those things together so you can add gluten in them.

118
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:38,000
So there's a lot of gluten in these types of products.

119
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:49,970
As for structure and then the gluten can add some thickness to soups, sauces, you might even see it in seasoning mixes.

120
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:56,270
I'm not exactly sure it might be serve as a carrier there for the different ground up seasonings.

121
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:03,260
You'll see it in all kinds of snack foods and sweeteners, perhaps as a pairing agent,

122
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:12,440
and then in coloring and fillers and different kinds of beverages, flavored coffee, for example.

123
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:22,190
So Abby had a question since we in this part of the top nine allergens don't all.

124
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:28,180
You have to have a disclaimer as an analogy in food.

125
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:35,830
Yeah. So I guess something has to demonstrate that it wouldn't interfere.

126
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:45,340
It's hard to not take action. So as a food allergen, that's a food allergy.

127
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:55,270
I don't know the statute for for good.

128
00:15:56,050 --> 00:16:04,690
I know some other things. Peanuts, definitely. But I don't know the statute for gluten, whether whether the there's a threshold for it, for example.

129
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:16,330
So with food law, there are often thresholds for things because oftentimes food not only contains the big ingredients and seasonings,

130
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:18,070
but other things that could creep into it.

131
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:30,100
So I don't know if you have to put that on the label warning this product contains peanuts and so on and gluten might be one of them.

132
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:34,900
I don't know that I'm not familiar with the statute there, but there's probably a threshold.

133
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:40,480
If it contains a certain percentage, then you should always put it on the label, but often it doesn't.

134
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:46,750
So small companies that produce different kinds of goods, they might not.

135
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:55,090
The numbers of things that they produce might not rise to the threshold that's covered by the food law

136
00:16:55,420 --> 00:17:02,260
so that there's a possibility of having a reaction to food that's produced from a small business.

137
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:04,989
The other thing you should be aware of,

138
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:14,950
there are certain types of alcoholic beverages that will contain an awful lot of gluten because where there's the there's fermentation of the grains,

139
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:19,750
but some gluten still might be present to this high enough level to cause a reaction.

140
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:23,020
So I put here distilled spirits whiskey.

141
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:36,559
Several years ago, I had a student who had celiac disease and he described a terrible reaction he had to a distilled spirit in the form of whiskey.

142
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:40,870
And you think, oh, my gosh, whiskey is you know, it's fermented.

143
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:47,050
It's aged for years and years. There couldn't possibly be any gluten in whiskey.

144
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:51,940
Well, there is enough. There was enough to cause for him to have a very bad reaction.

145
00:17:54,280 --> 00:18:05,850
So those are food items. There's a lot in other types of items as well that are consumable or you wouldn't think of them having gluten in them.

146
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:12,970
So envelope glue. So if you lift the envelope to close it, that could be enough to trigger a reaction.

147
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:21,970
Stamps the same thing lip gloss, lipstick, prescription, and over-the-counter medication and nutritional supplements.

148
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:31,300
So all of these things can contain a high enough concentration of gluten to cause a reaction.

149
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:36,400
So people who have celiac disease have to be very, very careful.

150
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:46,300
People with gluten sensitivity. Is this the the concentration of gluten in some of these things might not be enough to trigger a reaction,

151
00:18:46,930 --> 00:19:00,430
but it depends on the level of sensitivity of the individual. So the prevalence of celiac disease is about 1% globally.

152
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:12,520
And if you look at the general population in at risk groups, you'll find that there are certain countries where the prevalence is a bit higher.

153
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:18,370
So 1% prevalence globally. But Algeria, it's almost 6% of the population.

154
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:24,850
Finland it's a bit higher and in Sweden it's a bit higher as well.

155
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:33,910
So people with this ancestry might have a greater risk of having a celiac disease.

156
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:37,629
In the United States, the prevalence is fairly low.

157
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:40,990
It's a 0.3 2.9% of the general population.

158
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:56,080
But if you are a dietitian and your job is to evaluate the diets of children with celiac disease,

159
00:19:56,410 --> 00:20:00,310
you're going to get a high number, a fair, high number of clients.

160
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:10,060
So what are the risk factors for celiac disease? Well, a risk factor might include an autoimmune disease.

161
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:23,110
And here's a bunch of conditions in which there are some crossovers to celiac disease.

162
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:29,290
So type one diabetes is an autoimmune disease, as is thyroid disease and liver disease.

163
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:42,430
So in those cases where you have autoimmune disease, not only could you have any particular disease type one, diabetes, thyroid disease,

164
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:55,160
liver disease and so on, you may have a condition in which you are had other types of sensitivities, including celiac disease.

165
00:20:55,180 --> 00:21:02,320
So it's common to see people who have these conditions to also have celiac disease.

166
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:09,879
So Ida is an important mediator of the manifestations of this disease as well.

167
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:13,270
People who have IGG deficiency can develop that disease.

168
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:22,900
So some conditions such as Down's syndrome, Turner Syndrome, Wills will be young syndrome.

169
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:31,420
These individuals can also have the disease and so can people with juvenile idiopathic arthritis.

170
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,500
So in terms of clinical manifestations, when somebody shows symptoms,

171
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:50,430
it's very different between celiac disease, celiac disease and then having a gluten sensitivity.

172
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:59,110
So the disease only appears with ingestion.

173
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:04,540
So if you never see gluten in your diet, for whatever reason, you might not show any symptoms.

174
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:17,920
So you ingest gluten, and the timing of symptoms can vary according to the intensity of how strongly you respond.

175
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:25,630
But the symptoms are always going to be gastrointestinal because that's the site of exposure.

176
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:31,420
So in children, it can occur in childhood or later.

177
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:41,170
You can have people develop the disease later in life, but it usually shows up early in the symptoms would be.

178
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,890
When I say early, I mean to the tune of 1 to 2 years of age.

179
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:57,579
So when a child gets off some types of infant formula or breast milk and they start to transition into Whole Foods,

180
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:07,959
we might start to see some symptoms develop then. So with children, they might have diarrhea and appetite,

181
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:18,100
loss and abdominal distension and poor growth and iron deficiency, iron deficiency, anemia and lots of other things.

182
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:26,980
And the response comes, you remember that eating makes your stomach feel bad.

183
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:34,110
So there's avoidance of calories in some instances as a consequence of having celiac disease.

184
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:39,850
So children may not want to eat because they associate eating with gastrointestinal distress.

185
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:50,980
And this can cause poor growth in older children and adults that the symptoms are similar but a little bit different in that.

186
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:53,080
Yeah, you see diarrhea. Yeah.

187
00:23:53,080 --> 00:24:03,790
You see gastrointestinal issues, but you see people describe the feeling of bloating or abdominal pain or even weight loss as a consequence.

188
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:10,990
And the weight loss comes from avoidance and it can also come from chronic having chronic diarrhea as well.

189
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:25,970
So with non gluten non-celiac gluten sensitivity, that reaction occurs only after the ingestion of gluten containing foods.

190
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:34,100
And once you eliminate gluten containing things from your diet, the symptoms disappear.

191
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:41,090
And they can reappear when you introduce gluten back into your diet.

192
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:44,450
And in this case, it's usually things that are very high and loose.

193
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:50,150
Anything that contains wheat usually can elicit this type of response.

194
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:57,620
So the presentations again, abdominal pain, bloating, bowel regularity.

195
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,970
The symptoms can appear within hours or days after ingestion.

196
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,770
But there are also extra intestinal manifestations.

197
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:16,610
And the way people describe these are in regard to having a foggy brain or having brain fog or just not thinking clearly.

198
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:29,240
This can also contribute to your ability to remember things, and it can reduce your a level of being aware of things or level of alertness.

199
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:34,480
So you feel like you're in a haze after you consume something that has lots of.

200
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,710
So all we have to go by. What?

201
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:50,120
To determine whether or not someone is non-celiac gluten sensitive or having celiac disease as well with gluten sensitivity.

202
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:57,440
It's all based on symptoms, so it's really difficult to determine who has and who doesn't.

203
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:02,300
If you've been watching a lot of television or, you know,

204
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:10,639
you've looked online and you're spending a lot of time in this gluten free space that could make

205
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:15,140
someone believe that they have these symptoms after they've contained gluten consumed gluten,

206
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:20,030
and they may think they're gluten sensitive when they're really not.

207
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:26,090
So it's difficult to tell. You just have to go by what people say.

208
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:36,920
So there's another group of symptoms associated with a non gluten non-celiac sensitivity and it has to do with headaches,

209
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:47,990
muscle pain, fatigue, depression and in some cases even neurological signs and symptoms like numbness in your legs or your arms.

210
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:53,780
And other times, people will develop some skin abnormality.

211
00:26:53,790 --> 00:27:00,110
So dermatitis, eczema can occur as a response to a gluten sensitivity.

212
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:09,910
So I've taken this table from the paper from today,

213
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:21,070
and I've broken this down into gastrointestinal and extra intestinal manifestations and to show you differences.

214
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:28,240
So they both so this is gastro intestinal expert intestinal manifestations.

215
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:33,100
Here's celiac disease. Here's Non-Celiac gluten sensitivity.

216
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:37,060
They both have a high prevalence of abdominal pain.

217
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:46,360
But in terms of anorexia, avoidance of food only occurs in celiac disease, not in non-celiac sensitivity.

218
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:53,710
There's bloating, both constant gastrointestinal constipation, diarrhea and flatulence.

219
00:27:54,640 --> 00:28:02,290
But there can also be some other manifestations in celiac that you don't see in not just gluten sensitivity.

220
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:11,020
Lactose intolerance, nausea due to gastroesophageal reflux, weight loss, vomiting, so on.

221
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:22,100
So there are other other types of serious extra intestinal manifestations that you have to be careful of to watch.

222
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:30,560
And that has to do with malabsorption that occurs, the changes in the structure, the delay in the gut.

223
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:35,840
And one of the things that is most common is anemia.

224
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:46,100
And anemia arises from iron deficiency. And you can see that in both types of celiac disease and gluten sensitivity.

225
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:49,430
You can see anxiety.

226
00:28:49,730 --> 00:29:00,300
You can see other types of conditions that are neurological or immunologic, such as in arthritis with kids who have celiac disease.

227
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:04,610
You might see abnormalities in their teeth.

228
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:11,870
So this is another symptom that you have to be paying attention to with kids who have severe instances.

229
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:17,389
And this is this problems with the enamel in their teeth.

230
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:25,610
They don't develop to the same degree that the enamel of their teeth, which may make them more susceptible to dental caries later in life.

231
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:33,860
Other types of manifestations in celiac that distinguish it from a non-celiac gluten sensitivity.

232
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:45,770
And I mentioned that clouded consciousness manifestations of irritability, infertility, headache, iron deficiency, anemia,

233
00:29:46,700 --> 00:30:00,500
osteoporosis, more prominent people who have celiac disease and some other types of extra intestinal manifestations.

234
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:18,400
So this is basically an easy way to visualize this, how celiac disease can it can cause or is associated with other types of autoimmune diseases.

235
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:26,379
So, um, you see on the left side the different structures, the affected individuals,

236
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:33,040
the different organ systems, the co-occurring phenotypes and the genetic overlap.

237
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:37,180
And this is just a way to visualize the data that I already showed you.

238
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:54,080
So what causes the issues with micronutrient deficiencies and the poor growth in children?

239
00:30:55,460 --> 00:31:01,160
It has to do with changes in the morphology of the small intestine.

240
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:10,460
So I have for you an image taken from the biology textbook normal genome in a selected unit.

241
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:23,630
And all of you have had physiology and you know that in the gut you have these, uh, cell types that line the small intestine.

242
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:27,380
And this is, this was from a biopsy in the journal.

243
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:32,330
And this is the line. These are long finger like projections now.

244
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:43,010
And they are present in the epithelium and they maximize the surface area for micronutrient absorption.

245
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:53,400
Okay. And then you shed these tissues and you replace them with new be alive.

246
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:59,000
And you have this huge surface area to observe micronutrients.

247
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:09,500
So if you have a chronic inflammatory response occurring in your gut, you have the turnover of tissue,

248
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:17,540
but you have an abnormal morphology that occurs because of this chronic inflammatory response, this autoimmune disease.

249
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:28,219
And as a consequence, the finger like projections now lose the surface area so you don't get finger like projections.

250
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:31,709
So you get this this more effect type of features.

251
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:43,460
So instead of having these finger like projections, you have a blunted type of epithelium here where there's not the same level of surface area.

252
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:52,640
And then you also have a higher number of darkly staining nuclei here in that region in the selected genome.

253
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:56,370
And that would indicate lots of immune cells. Okay.

254
00:32:56,870 --> 00:33:05,330
So this is a chronically inflamed tissue. And because of that chronic inflammation, you form these abnormal structures.

255
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:18,060
So you have a gluten sensitive interop thing and it develops in sensitive individuals

256
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:27,870
after exposure to different types of products containing gluten and why wheat,

257
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:38,910
barley and rye? Well, gluten has a lot of protein in it, and the protein is resistant to enzymatic digestion in the small intestine.

258
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:48,090
And it also has a certain charge on it that makes it bind to the HLA molecule

259
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:54,810
and it can elicit this type of immune response and give you this morphology.

260
00:33:55,890 --> 00:34:01,500
And if you avoid gluten, you can see remission and recovery of the thallium.

261
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:08,790
Now it depends on the level of sensitivity and time after which you withdraw from the diet.

262
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:14,580
This can recover. You're constantly shedding the epithelial cells in your gut.

263
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:18,840
You can get some recovery to get more structures like this.

264
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:23,100
But in some people, you know, it's a persistent problem.

265
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:33,580
So here's some more detail and a description of how this develops.

266
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:42,580
So over on the left side, you have the structural changes in the intestinal mucosa and celiac disease.

267
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:54,940
That's the normal circumstance. You've got a lot of the villi and you have the crypts within the belie and they maximize surface area for absorption.

268
00:34:55,630 --> 00:35:06,310
Celiac disease, cancer, apathy. You have these structures that are blunted and you have this atrophy that occurs.

269
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:15,910
You have fewer crypts. The crypts are there, but you don't have as much surface area.

270
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:24,100
But the marked difference is not only that the blunted bely, but you have lots and lots of inflammatory cells.

271
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:40,660
So when you zoom in on the epithelial cells, you'll see that the epithelial cells in the normal duodenum, you saw this.

272
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:50,049
This time in the duodenum, we have the gluten fragments that interact with the epithelial surface and you

273
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:57,820
have enzymatic digestion and there's some impartial or incomplete digestion,

274
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,440
and that usually doesn't cause a problem.

275
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:14,170
You have this intra epithelial lymphocyte that is on the basal lateral side, not the apical side, and you have a molecule, a receptor, CB 71.

276
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:20,630
It's in the basal position here. So they never interact with the microbiota.

277
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:24,970
They never interact with the Glyde and the gluten fragments.

278
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:36,970
So they're separated. And in celiac disease, a number of changes occur that have been characterized and documented.

279
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:47,350
So for some reason, the gluten fragment can activate both the innate and adaptive immune system.

280
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:55,210
And I describe some things that you see that affect the adaptive immune system, but the innate immune system is involved as well.

281
00:36:56,860 --> 00:37:06,120
So here's a chemokine receptor six, uh, cr3.

282
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:17,680
This is a chemokine receptor. And for some reason it also reacts with a group fragment and that activates this cell, the epithelial cell.

283
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:22,690
So this shouldn't happen. For some reason, this occurs.

284
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:30,280
I'm not I'm not sure why you see this in terms of the innate immune system being activated.

285
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:40,660
So the next thing that happens is it triggers the release of Zombieland and Zombieland that can activate the epithelial cells.

286
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:44,860
And you can also get activation of the, um,

287
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:57,729
this EGFR EGFR receptor and what this occurs so zonder and binds to this receptor after it's released e.g. fbr this receptor.

288
00:37:57,730 --> 00:38:05,470
And this causes the type junctions between these epithelial cells to loosen and that makes it more permeable.

289
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:18,400
So your gut as a whole becomes more permeable and it allows these fragments of gluten to get inside the intestinal barrier into your bloodstream.

290
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:27,330
And in this particular area, you've got a lot of immune cells that are kind of monitoring things.

291
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:34,800
You've got the energy presenting cells that are hanging out there and they're taking things up all the time and processing them.

292
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:46,950
In the case of celiac disease, as this condition progresses, you have a recruitment of lots of these immune cells.

293
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:52,470
So the inter epithelial lymphocytes proliferate in response to this condition.

294
00:38:53,250 --> 00:39:07,330
That's because they're being presented with lots of antigen and you have the production of antibody now that binds to gluten fragments and that

295
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:20,790
the antibody can bind to the C 71 and that's now in the apical position and this continues to progress and make things worse for the host.

296
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:27,870
And then here's some more activation of the innate immune response.

297
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:37,950
So in this one, you've got gluten fragments, you have the release of other kinds of things going on,

298
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:46,590
not just in gluten, but into the because of the microbiota now can get into this space between these epithelial cells.

299
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:48,930
So your gut becomes leaky.

300
00:39:49,350 --> 00:40:00,630
Your, your, your being exposed to these gluten fragments and the microbiota which are really potent stimuli to cause inflammation.

301
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:06,030
And you have a lot more immune cell recruitment in response to this.

302
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:12,270
And you have these dendritic cells here that bind to the group fragments.

303
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:16,649
And normally that's a good thing that they bind to some bacteria, right?

304
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:20,370
Because that's how you'll listen. Our immune response. In this case,

305
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:27,660
they're responding to gluten and they're released cytokines I o 15 by interleukin

306
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:31,860
eight and these recruit more immune cells to the site of inflammation.

307
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,500
So that that's the innate immune response, triggering the adaptive immune response.

308
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:43,560
And here's what happens here. It's just a mess.

309
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:46,670
You had this huge influx of inflammatory cells.

310
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:53,270
You have some damage to this tissue.

311
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:58,770
You have the release of trans contaminates. You have dominated food.

312
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:06,200
You have more gluten fragments. These antigens are being taken up by these entering cells.

313
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:14,290
And I mentioned that a risk factor was having these human lymphocyte antigens due to a.q.

314
00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:19,730
They recognize this is foreign and it elicits an immune response.

315
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:32,900
So they're at that dendritic cells. They're recruiting and activating T cells and they're producing antibodies against all of these things.

316
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:47,930
Which can contribute to the continuous inflammation of the mucosa and you have the release of lots of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

317
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:55,730
So it's just a very, very complex inflammatory response that occurs.

318
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:04,220
So what about genetic susceptibility?

319
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:10,340
Well, it's strongly associated with the MHC class two molecule, the human leukocyte antigen,

320
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:19,969
HLA decay and to this is 40% of the population carries these MHC class two molecules,

321
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:26,570
but only a small percentage of people who actually have this go on to develop celiac disease.

322
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:34,690
That HLA receptors are recognized by T cells and activate the adaptive immune system.

323
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:42,010
And we talked a bit about MHC class one animistic class to the big difference between these molecules

324
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:50,350
is that all cells can express class one only the antigen presenting cells express class two.

325
00:42:53,570 --> 00:43:00,740
And then when you look at these subtypes and you look at what's going on in terms of the interaction,

326
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:13,400
so here's a 3D reconstruction of the cleft in which the antigen binds to that HLA human leukocyte antigen receptor.

327
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:23,630
So because of this structure of the peptide from gluten, it fits very nicely in this class and it's very immuno reactive.

328
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:34,820
So here's the DMD peptide here and the the structure here fits very nicely into this cleft and it activates the receptor.

329
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:42,540
I've shown you this particular diagram before where it shows you the progression

330
00:43:43,170 --> 00:43:51,030
of MHC Class one activation and the presentation of things that are processed.

331
00:43:52,320 --> 00:44:01,680
In this case, it's a virus and how the cytotoxic T cells are activated to kill virus infected cells.

332
00:44:02,850 --> 00:44:09,330
I show you this just to suggest that your body thinks that it's being invaded with a pathogen,

333
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:18,209
and as a consequence, you're activating a response that is supposed to defend you against infection.

334
00:44:18,210 --> 00:44:23,700
But it also it's going to result in the pathology that is described in the intestine.

335
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:32,110
So here's a T-cell killing, a cell that's presenting an antigen to the Class one receptor.

336
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:35,650
In this case, it's an infected cell.

337
00:44:36,790 --> 00:44:47,890
And here you have two different kinds of T cells that are responding to the antigen presented in the Class two receptor macrophage and a B cell.

338
00:44:48,970 --> 00:44:57,700
And that T cell becomes activated to produce lots of cytokines that help the macrophage kill and ingested pathogens.

339
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:02,320
In the case of the B cell, you have a different kind of T cell described here,

340
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:10,360
the follicular t cell there t, but the molecular helper cell, it's recognized as being antigen.

341
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:17,260
You have a B cell presenting the antigen this time and that B cell is going to produce lots of antibody response to the interaction.

342
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:31,370
So in this diagram it describes to you that what is going on after the initial presentation.

343
00:45:32,810 --> 00:45:36,200
So up in the top eight panel,

344
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:43,639
you have antigen presenting cells and then presenting native gluten peptide and you have

345
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:50,940
activation of this trans glutamate enzyme that gives you disseminated gluten peptides.

346
00:45:50,940 --> 00:46:03,470
So these are the two molecules that your antigen presenting cells are responding to and you have two different kinds of CD4+ T cells.

347
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:11,210
And in response to an interaction, they proliferate and you get a T cell response.

348
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:17,750
When this activation reaches a certain threshold, how does that happen?

349
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:23,330
Well, it's the protein in the mouth that comes from the gluten peptide.

350
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:41,420
So here's the receptor here, the HLA two and HLA BQ eight, they have binding group that fits very nicely that recognizes these molecules.

351
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:47,900
Here are several different kinds of molecules from gluten after it's been.

352
00:46:51,590 --> 00:46:54,980
Process activating and binding to this group.

353
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:58,580
Here's some activation that you can make as well.

354
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:15,080
So here's antigen presenting, cells presenting this peptide, you have the peptide and here's just the Q8 and this HLA dq2 is very,

355
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:22,910
very strong and producing T cells because it reaches a threshold very quickly, not so much with the decay.

356
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:37,190
So if you have the D. Q two in particular the 2.5 antigen, that's a really strong stimulus for this type of response.

357
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:47,020
So here's the different varieties of the HLA two molecule.

358
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:59,559
It's the 2.51 that has this really strong, potent ability to activate T cells that proliferate not so much with a degree.

359
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:14,260
2.2. And this perhaps explains why only 2 to 3% of people who have these HLA antigens actually develop this gluten or the celiac disease.

360
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:19,300
Now, does the same thing happen with wheat sensitivity?

361
00:48:19,330 --> 00:48:28,780
I don't know. It's based those types of interactions or those types of conditions, that type of conditions.

362
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:34,540
And I should say just based on symptoms. We don't have a biomarker for that.

363
00:48:38,410 --> 00:48:47,739
This slide shows you how gluten sensitive, a gluten specific T-cell remember clonal selection theory.

364
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:50,980
You have all of these different amino lymphocytes that are immature.

365
00:48:51,610 --> 00:48:55,540
If they don't find their antigen that they bind to, they go out, they die.

366
00:48:56,890 --> 00:49:05,580
This particular one has the ability to recognize gluten and here's a B-cell presenting gluten to it.

367
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:15,040
And in response to that, that B cells making lots of antibody, the antibodies directed against this trans contaminated gluten complex.

368
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:33,200
So how was it diagnosed? So either a child or an adult shows up in a clinic and they say, I have gastrointestinal symptoms.

369
00:49:33,590 --> 00:49:39,620
It's not from an infection. The disease is that the presentation symptoms are chronic.

370
00:49:41,870 --> 00:49:46,040
And so there's some questioning and screening going on.

371
00:49:46,790 --> 00:49:51,560
And they're trying to figure out, you know, what are the symptoms associated with?

372
00:49:52,430 --> 00:49:56,510
Are they consistent with signs and symptoms that you would see with celiac disease?

373
00:49:57,140 --> 00:50:03,050
Do you have a family history of celiac disease or some other kind of autoimmune disease?

374
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:10,730
So these are the kinds of questions that are asked to people who show up in the clinic with GI illness associated with the condition.

375
00:50:12,110 --> 00:50:19,760
So they take a blood sample and the blood sample can be a good indicator of whether or not you have celiac.

376
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:28,340
So the antibody test is for tissue trends, contaminants, and you might be positive or negative.

377
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:36,650
And then if you have a positive result, they might do a biopsy.

378
00:50:37,490 --> 00:50:41,840
And if it's positive, you can get this diagnosis.

379
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:45,350
Celiac disease, getting the diagnosis is important.

380
00:50:46,490 --> 00:50:57,770
So when you have a diagnosis, you can show when you your health care bills come in and you say,

381
00:50:57,770 --> 00:51:01,850
I have a diagnosed with celiac disease and your insurance company says, okay,

382
00:51:01,970 --> 00:51:08,450
we will reimburse you for the costs of your care if you don't have the diagnosis.

383
00:51:09,110 --> 00:51:15,500
You might not get reimbursed for that care depending on what the policies are.

384
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:18,620
So having a diagnosis is really important.

385
00:51:20,910 --> 00:51:26,970
So if you have a negative result and they look at the history of histology,

386
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:33,630
they might go on to do some more antibody testing and they may do some genetic

387
00:51:33,630 --> 00:51:39,600
testing and then you might have a diagnosis of potential celiac disease.

388
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:43,440
Let's just take you off gluten. In both cases, you would take people off of group.

389
00:51:43,470 --> 00:51:54,170
Let's see what happens. Okay. If you had the same kind of symptoms and you show up negative for that initial antibody test,

390
00:51:55,370 --> 00:52:06,620
the look at the level of the antibody and if your celiac disease is it's at a higher threshold, it's celiac disease, probably unlikely.

391
00:52:09,110 --> 00:52:15,230
Are the symptoms persistent? If they are, you might want to do a biopsy.

392
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:21,290
Esophageal stop, gastro duodenum, scope.

393
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:28,280
So this is a condition, a procedure in which they put an end to scope into your gut.

394
00:52:29,150 --> 00:52:38,480
And the pathologist is looking for signs of inflammation in your gut to see if there really something there.

395
00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:45,920
If the symptoms are not persistent, they might do it.

396
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:49,760
But you can type in test. Now.

397
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:56,900
I am not sure why this past isn't done up here with the antibody testing.

398
00:52:56,900 --> 00:53:00,049
Right. And that kind of tells me it might be expensive.

399
00:53:00,050 --> 00:53:04,700
That's probably why it's at the end of the progression or the logistic chart.

400
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:11,420
But if you have a condition where CLX is unlikely, the treatment is a boy group.

401
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:15,709
That's the only treatment we have right now for both conditions.

402
00:53:15,710 --> 00:53:27,310
Just avoid that. So here's treatment available for select disease or non-celiac gluten sensitivity.

403
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:31,330
Avoiding gluten in the diet is the only treatment.

404
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:37,089
It's easy if you are sensitive.

405
00:53:37,090 --> 00:53:44,470
Your sensitivity is at a higher threshold. Oh, just avoid things with wheat in them and I should get better.

406
00:53:44,830 --> 00:53:51,310
And a lot of times people do get better. But people who are very sensitive, they have to be more careful.

407
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:58,180
So in addition to avoiding this gluten,

408
00:53:58,180 --> 00:54:07,570
you also have to evaluate children who are below the normal trajectories for their growth, for their weight and their height.

409
00:54:07,930 --> 00:54:12,160
Okay. Because there can be some stunting of their growth as a consequence of this.

410
00:54:14,130 --> 00:54:18,600
And you want to look for potential nutritional deficiencies,

411
00:54:19,050 --> 00:54:29,010
could be diet related and kids could have a blood test to look for deficiencies that are more common in these individuals.

412
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:44,810
Iron. Folic acid, B-12 and zinc. You're going to want to monitor the trends contaminates IGA levels.

413
00:54:45,830 --> 00:54:53,780
And this is kind of a way to determine whether or not how compliant people are to this gluten free diet.

414
00:54:54,470 --> 00:54:57,800
If they're not compliant, you might see higher levels of the antibody.

415
00:54:57,950 --> 00:55:02,060
And you have to remind people, hey, you need to avoid these kinds of foods.

416
00:55:02,630 --> 00:55:07,370
I see that your trans contaminated antibodies are kind of high.

417
00:55:08,090 --> 00:55:12,950
Tells me that, you know, you're of being exposed to these things in your diet.

418
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:18,770
You might want to be more careful. It can. It really works if you avoid this to reduce symptoms.

419
00:55:19,730 --> 00:55:24,290
But there are also some social cultural issues along with that.

420
00:55:25,550 --> 00:55:33,890
So if you're the only kid in your class at school who has this condition and it's somebody's birthday and somebody brings in cupcakes,

421
00:55:34,250 --> 00:55:37,730
you can't eat right? So you feel left out.

422
00:55:38,250 --> 00:55:43,400
Not only does this occur in large settings, it occurs within families, too.

423
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:50,660
So within the family, if you have one child that has a high gluten sensitivity and the others,

424
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:54,260
don't other kids in your family get to do things that you can't?

425
00:55:55,550 --> 00:56:01,460
So if you go to Chucky Cheese's and everybody's eating pizza, you can't eat that pizza because it's going to cause a reaction.

426
00:56:02,090 --> 00:56:08,570
So there's some social, cultural issues associated with having this celiac disease that are significant as well.

427
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:19,420
And then there's an intestinal biopsy to monitor that mucosa to see if there's a recovery.

428
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:25,540
These types of procedures are expensive. They're kind of the last line of things that you do.

429
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:37,180
But your insurance company might require this kind of testing to maintain your level of observation every time

430
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:45,700
you go into the to see your your primary care physician to maintain this continued assessment of IGG levels.

431
00:56:49,410 --> 00:56:57,060
And it can also tell you how well you're doing in terms of avoiding gluten.

432
00:56:57,180 --> 00:57:03,450
It's hidden in places. If you're still having problems, if your item levels are high,

433
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:07,440
it could mean that you're being exposed to gluten through things that you're not aware of.

434
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:09,390
And it could be some of the things that I've already mentioned.

435
00:57:10,350 --> 00:57:19,650
So this is a really complex and interesting condition and it's fairly rare in terms of celiac disease,

436
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:28,890
but you're going to see it if you work with a pediatric population and non gluten sensitive non-celiac gluten sensitivity is more common.

437
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:36,210
Exactly how many people have it? We don't know. For both conditions, the treatment is the same.

438
00:57:36,470 --> 00:57:41,970
Avoid gluten. Any comments or questions about today?

439
00:57:43,290 --> 00:57:53,969
So this you might see an example on the quiz that kind of serves as an example

440
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:58,770
of a condition of in which you're looking at an adaptive immune response,

441
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:04,320
something that can elicit adaptive immune response or put it in a form of a multiple choice question.

442
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:12,990
Okay. There's a lot of detail here, so I'll ask you to identify something that's one of their choices within a multiple choice question.

443
00:58:17,890 --> 00:58:30,360
Yeah. Actually, I have a question about the Chrysler subsidiary and say what's the mechanism of those uses are also similar to it uses or just like.

444
00:58:31,710 --> 00:58:36,780
Transit information. Yeah, transit information is a good thing.

445
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:44,490
So only when the gluten is present, when you see the response and if you are monitoring your diet, you won't see it.

446
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:56,399
So it'll come and go depending on your exposure. So parents of kids who have celiac disease might want to keep up to a diary or at

447
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:02,610
least some kind of a history of what the food environment was over a period of time.

448
00:59:03,330 --> 00:59:12,720
And that might sound really difficult and detailed in OCD, but if you have a child with this condition, it's a serious condition.

449
00:59:13,170 --> 00:59:20,220
You don't see you know, very rarely do you see mortality associated with select disease, but it can happen.

450
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:24,150
Usually you see a lot of these manifestations that I've mentioned.

451
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:32,580
So if you monitor things, you can determine, Oh, I have intermittent inflammatory disease.

452
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:42,150
Why did that happen? Well, if it's associated with exposure to some gluten you contact with food or something else,

453
00:59:42,570 --> 00:59:45,900
you'll be able to spot it and reduce the frequency which that occurs.

454
00:59:49,390 --> 00:59:54,880
Okay. So any other questions or comments?

455
00:59:56,110 --> 01:00:22,080
All right. So. How would you go about figuring out just based on symptoms whether or not somebody had celiac or non of celiac gluten sensitivity?

456
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:33,700
Let's say the child. Music said not just.

457
01:00:37,570 --> 01:00:40,970
You can look at how they are growing in terms of stunted growth.

458
01:00:40,990 --> 01:00:43,570
Yeah, that's one of the first thing that people look at.

459
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:47,320
They look at their height and their weight in terms of their what do they look like in their peers?

460
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:52,570
And one of the first thing, the most common thing that'll show up is their stunted growth.

461
01:00:53,170 --> 01:00:56,210
That's really important to the pediatric population.

462
01:00:57,080 --> 01:01:01,130
Okay. How about an adult?

463
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:08,400
Sometimes. Rarely do you see this celiac disease appear in adulthood.

464
01:01:09,030 --> 01:01:14,310
How would you tell if it were celiac or gluten sensitivity in an adult?

465
01:01:24,530 --> 01:01:30,980
And then the testing. Yeah. So what do you mean exactly by gas issues?

466
01:01:31,130 --> 01:01:38,460
Um, like if they had consistent diarrhea or constipation or considering things.

467
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:44,580
Or so. Yeah.

468
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:47,850
So both might have those symptoms. Right.

469
01:01:48,510 --> 01:01:52,070
How would you distinguish between the two? Yeah.

470
01:01:52,720 --> 01:02:00,110
Um, check with everybody so that, again, checking their ratings with their weight could be different.

471
01:02:00,290 --> 01:02:07,550
Yeah. So one of the things that's different between the two, even in adults, is avoidance and which could result in weight loss.

472
01:02:08,450 --> 01:02:10,610
So their weight might change in response to that.

473
01:02:11,420 --> 01:02:21,110
So if you work in a clinic and you are, you know, every time somebody goes in the clinic, they weigh them and you see there's a sudden drop in weight.

474
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:27,800
You need to question people about what's changed since the last time and say, was this intentional or unintentional?

475
01:02:28,070 --> 01:02:33,740
And unintentional weight loss is usually associated with some type of reaction to foods like this.

476
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:38,660
Okay. So that's something you have to look for very carefully.

477
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:46,400
Right. And the treatment is the same gluten avoidance and it's hard to avoid doing.

478
01:02:47,060 --> 01:02:53,360
And there's also a whole industry built around gluten free foods.

479
01:02:53,900 --> 01:03:02,120
And then people might describe having a gluten sensitivity when they really do this, that complicates things.

480
01:03:05,150 --> 01:03:08,900
Okay. So we're getting done a little early today.

481
01:03:10,970 --> 01:03:15,020
Any questions about the quiz tomorrow? No.

482
01:03:15,310 --> 01:03:21,730
Okay. How are you coming along with finding? So we're about a month away from the graphical illustration.

483
01:03:22,690 --> 01:03:28,330
How are you? Are you finding papers that you'd like to put in the form of a graphical illustration?

484
01:03:28,780 --> 01:03:35,739
Kind of. I said I would post examples and I actually put a bullet in the canvas site and put some papers up today.

485
01:03:35,740 --> 01:03:39,340
So you can see that the kind of hard to find.

486
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:43,750
But I'll add that in later.

487
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:56,860
The graphical abstract helps you visualize things, and what you're trying to do there is to tell a story, to tell a story that you can see visually,

488
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:03,610
and you're only going to include the most pertinent information in that graphical illustration,

489
01:04:03,910 --> 01:04:07,060
and I'll bring an example and describe how that's done.

490
01:04:08,230 --> 01:04:11,250
But next time and next couple of times that we meet. Okay.

491
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:16,630
All right. So I think you will be back with us next week.

492
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:25,330
She's at a conference. And I think that's what we want to talk about today in the recording.
