the market. must must be in a month. I work for from the American Public

9
00:00:45,623 --> 00:00:51,503
Health Association for outstanding contributions policy

10
00:00:51,503 --> 00:00:56,543
the big. she want them to go with cos I wanted put like the two six and has

11
00:00:56,543 --> 00:01:02,183
received several times and work for best paper published in the message.

12
00:01:02,183 --> 00:01:07,183
she does a_lot_of service for the profession two six and she's involved in set up in several

13
00:01:07,183 --> 00:01:12,317
efforts to promote the use this is a sign in the Public Health Science and

14
00:01:12,317 --> 00:01:17,597
Science and Jenna. she served on several committees including the fast

15
00:01:17,597 --> 00:01:22,677
food and drug administration bonus with that in the garage it's of committee.

16
00:01:22,677 --> 00:01:28,057
the National Academy Media on a flight in front of us. please take the East Madison

17
00:01:28,057 --> 00:01:33,197
committee. on that would be to be a busy dress. I should

18
00:01:33,197 --> 00:01:39,237
be in the presence of E Matthews the largest by of this profession.

19
00:01:39,237 --> 00:01:45,757
then the evening of the night. she has a very wide with this agenda. have been just from

20
00:01:45,757 --> 00:01:50,837
my masters in by. eight hundred two six and when you can have it and this is. she also

21
00:01:50,837 --> 00:01:55,977
has a very active club of your business agenda. she works in environmental health

22
00:01:55,977 --> 00:02:01,217
sciences environment in the position of exposure. if you give me to GMAC

23
00:02:01,217 --> 00:02:06,257
and I'm trying to help some lessons development nutrition obesity and more

24
00:02:06,257 --> 00:02:15,415
I just got sort to you otherwise number from Amy.

25
00:02:15,415 --> 00:02:20,475
thank you for having me. it's really an honor to be here on environment specific day and also

26
00:02:20,475 --> 00:02:26,255
just to be in the department which would tell people is my second favorite. that department.

27
00:02:26,255 --> 00:02:31,495
you guys you had absolutely wonderful people and the school of Public Health has been really nice

28
00:02:31,495 --> 00:02:36,715
work and environmental abilene allergy and so it's really nice to be here. I have a local

29
00:02:36,715 --> 00:02:41,875
operator on this work. so I'm gonna talk fast. many people here and I just

30
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:47,215
wanna be sure that I acknowledge them before I start talking I answered and forget to do that. so

31
00:02:47,215 --> 00:02:53,115
a_lot_of this work was done on my job. Lauren is now available with the men's dock at UNC

32
00:02:53,115 --> 00:02:58,269
Chapel Hill so just because it is environmental. it's in thanks day.

33
00:02:58,269 --> 00:03:03,509
I couldn't refrain from saying a little something about the environment we're in and I think a_lot_of people

34
00:03:03,509 --> 00:03:08,809
are nervous about where things maybe going. but you know in Michigan

35
00:03:08,809 --> 00:03:15,269
in particular he have a message from Group in environmental science. I'm sure things will be fine.

36
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:20,629
it never hurts to had your bat. and and you know have good political connections.

37
00:03:20,629 --> 00:03:26,249
you know that I'm really not worried yet been the connection.

38
00:03:26,249 --> 00:03:34,309
I did you have politically go here and of course I brought

39
00:03:34,309 --> 00:03:39,669
to Ron. I'm sorry I didn't realize it was all being.

40
00:03:39,669 --> 00:03:44,689
I was totally I haven't started that be great. I'm not you get

41
00:03:44,689 --> 00:03:49,709
this message. I was on sorry. I really realize the question is

42
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:55,690
your chance world ride with me being recorded but anyway you have all your bases covered

43
00:03:55,690 --> 00:04:00,810
the service again will come through just fine. today I wanted to be sure it was

44
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:06,090
accessible on a variety different levels and I'm happy to call more people about details in a variety of areas

45
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:11,670
and. I wanted to touch on some challenges based in standing air and water exposure.

46
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:16,970
particularly with respect to board .com and that's an area I've worked in my whole career.

47
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:22,030
and so couple things I wanna touch on our things about susceptible time period and I know the people

48
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:27,230
here that have some really interesting work looking at. I'm susceptible time periods of development pregnancy

49
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:32,250
but of a nice time because it's confined period to study as opposed to mortality when you might need to

50
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:37,470
worry about exposing the cost for life span. I'm giving the ability and in particular

51
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:42,530
how we fine exposure. when people move around the outside of your is

52
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:47,590
ever space and time and have exposure that might very every space and time. I'll talk a little

53
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:52,850
bit about correlated exposures and exposure next year. I was I was thinking to be a_lot_of

54
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:58,030
people working on those or died but it sounds like some point we don't have Michigan competition for the big birthday that

55
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:03,208
was yesterday certainly this is really nice work done on exposure Mister and here

56
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:08,448
in Michigan. I need to see if you think about that he design as well. and so

57
00:05:08,448 --> 00:05:13,608
Linebarger outcome in respect to with your second and final exposure. so has

58
00:05:13,608 --> 00:05:19,428
been a_lot_of work with the air pollution in particular looking at mortality and cardiovascular

59
00:05:19,428 --> 00:05:24,448
diseases. the interesting thing about birth outcomes is that there were in gonna fax between between

60
00:05:24,448 --> 00:05:29,528
exposures air pollution or water pollution a bird .com. people case so that really go

61
00:05:29,528 --> 00:05:34,968
across the whole life spans and be start looking at the quality of life measures

62
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:41,268
and things that hurt you as a baby carrier through your entire life and need have a profound impact

63
00:05:41,268 --> 00:05:46,268
name of air pollution number that comes up in from all over the point that literature has been a little

64
00:05:46,268 --> 00:05:51,268
mixed on some challenges. you know include how to define

65
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:56,288
exposure windows. and also how we as a one thing is

66
00:05:56,288 --> 00:06:02,018
really not to make that a birth outcome. is that well we do have a nine month pregnancy and when we might populate

67
00:06:02,018 --> 00:06:08,058
there's some attacks that happened pre- conception. you know that does sort of get us a nice anger.

68
00:06:08,058 --> 00:06:13,158
in addition we thought you were the outcome. one thing that we worry about with the second of our middle

69
00:06:13,158 --> 00:06:18,458
exposure is where people are. and one thing I wanna point out is that it's very common

70
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:23,698
to move in pregnancy that people don't tend to move all that far and said during that time

71
00:06:23,698 --> 00:06:28,798
period a_lot_of people might wanna be your apartment ready by the first home and maybe that has other

72
00:06:28,798 --> 00:06:34,258
exposure issues affecting the baby room and things like that. but even then leaving is common in pregnancy

73
00:06:34,258 --> 00:06:39,478
there been a number of studies that have with the residential ability and premises and people tend not to move

74
00:06:39,478 --> 00:06:44,558
very far and so that helps with exposure back looking at things like air water and

75
00:06:44,558 --> 00:06:49,698
trying to estimate exposures and the time period. I wanna move in a little bit. return number

76
00:06:49,698 --> 00:06:54,798
for my extension. you might not be used to looking at the outcome. return Burton's

77
00:06:54,798 --> 00:07:00,018
delivery. I have a baby before thirty seven completed weeks just station and I had for Fountain

78
00:07:00,018 --> 00:07:05,104
Pack. the leading calls even more quality and we're very drivers

79
00:07:05,104 --> 00:07:10,144
are at higher risk for your logical to the billing including things like the leave and all

80
00:07:10,144 --> 00:07:15,744
more. not touch ground disability delays in social with the electoral development.

81
00:07:15,744 --> 00:07:21,624
first your medical calls are extremely high. so you know two thousand seven Island report.

82
00:07:21,624 --> 00:07:26,764
estimated about fifty thousand dollars in the first year for pre- term. the incident about ten percent

83
00:07:26,764 --> 00:07:31,864
nationally and it's almost fifty percent higher and African American women compared to other women and so there's

84
00:07:31,864 --> 00:07:36,964
a racial disparity there is not very well understood. in most cases the preacher number.

85
00:07:36,964 --> 00:07:42,104
have a noon call. a_lot_of very ability to try to explain there.

86
00:07:42,104 --> 00:07:47,484
other than that paper that just came out on environmental health perspective and use some estimates from

87
00:07:47,484 --> 00:07:52,824
analysis of air pollution on a particular PM two. five and pre- term part. and

88
00:07:52,824 --> 00:07:57,864
they tried to attribute the pre- term. how much he knows where

89
00:07:57,864 --> 00:08:03,104
to be able to to preach number. your believe later in particular PNC two point five.

90
00:08:03,104 --> 00:08:08,146
I tried to estimate to call approved particular matter exposure with respect to

91
00:08:08,146 --> 00:08:13,186
pre- term bird and the cost are really large what they did is they factor do not medical cost but

92
00:08:13,186 --> 00:08:18,406
also cost to you. I do recommend IDs that he has shown up to attend the art work

93
00:08:18,406 --> 00:08:23,546
or pre- term birth is noon about ten IQ point return versus non- pre- term. and

94
00:08:23,546 --> 00:08:28,666
so they tried to give you that back and it looks pretty bad you can see the places where this

95
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:34,106
is Sunday if you're available. fractions really large. I believe in large part with where there's a_lot_of your pollution

96
00:08:34,106 --> 00:08:39,846
in the US. I need for work in this area.

97
00:08:39,846 --> 00:08:44,986
the doors not really close it's not well understood the role different place to put in LA it's not

98
00:08:44,986 --> 00:08:50,006
that well understand which pregnancy period to run for marble to in inside

99
00:08:50,006 --> 00:08:55,066
the EPA. he and you having a great advice if you get that that's recommended a_lot_of

100
00:08:55,066 --> 00:09:00,486
work in the area. all of the mother birth outcomes and I wanna made to make those briefly one

101
00:09:00,486 --> 00:09:06,434
and birth weight. and particularly birth is a common metric you wanted twenty five hundred grand

102
00:09:06,434 --> 00:09:11,534
delivery. that measure is really closely related to just facial light. if you're born earlier

103
00:09:11,534 --> 00:09:16,754
he's in the way left that often to get around that people will either look at. we're waiting

104
00:09:16,754 --> 00:09:22,354
on term delivery portal to find small for just National age. you know calculate that as

105
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:27,374
a part way below the tenth percentile for gender and just additional age and delivery.

106
00:09:27,374 --> 00:09:32,512
if not perfect measure right as always. you know my parents will have small baby not bad

107
00:09:32,512 --> 00:09:37,752
but it's one product need to try to get the aspect of feel gross separated from the aspect

108
00:09:37,752 --> 00:09:42,772
of early delivery. the long term ability is that unit with my birth weight and fall bridge and

109
00:09:42,772 --> 00:09:48,892
facial and independent about a free hamburger is not it. well I'm here to write

110
00:09:48,892 --> 00:09:54,112
a thing if I have time and I'll talk a little bit about his birthday back and so bring the pictures.

111
00:09:54,112 --> 00:09:59,872
I'm gonna be getting home at the end mortality in a different called of premature mentality in the US.

112
00:09:59,872 --> 00:10:04,912
leading calls of death among toddlers and the promise is fairly high. so many

113
00:10:04,912 --> 00:10:10,452
people are surprised the problem with the board if I can so high. but the majority of the bag. Paul

114
00:10:10,452 --> 00:10:15,592
is on them. so there happens in studies. we recently market back

115
00:10:15,592 --> 00:10:21,232
and your families and friends are very a_lot. with respect to the quality of

116
00:10:21,232 --> 00:10:26,252
outcome assessment and the exposure assessment and so this is one of the areas where it's a little more open

117
00:10:26,252 --> 00:10:31,983
there was a recent bill. maybe not quite any more that analysis and the HP

118
00:10:31,983 --> 00:10:37,043
I found a_lot_of patterns and eighty across different story. but they found some association with

119
00:10:37,043 --> 00:10:42,423
PM ten and a child that will be back these are whole holes in the heart. and they're relatively

120
00:10:42,423 --> 00:10:48,383
common and some other design. one that will come back to you. bye. howdy.

121
00:10:48,383 --> 00:10:53,403
probably you. how about one hell of any e-mail announcement was that the exposure

122
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:58,483
windows are really all over the place some people only looked at certain periods of development other people across

123
00:10:58,483 --> 00:11:03,583
the whole pregnancy. how well the outcomes are measured very greatly across the study. so that

124
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:08,683
was sort of a hard hard exercise for them. so I thought that now and talk a little

125
00:11:08,683 --> 00:11:13,783
bit about your mission exposure in pregnancy and what people tend to do and I'll

126
00:11:13,783 --> 00:11:19,023
talk to you through a few different strategies. so have any collision exposure as often. I'm writing

127
00:11:19,023 --> 00:11:24,083
a variety different ways. so when I consider whole pregnancy average and that's all been

128
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:29,383
done. more commonly maybe people look at advertising for the trimester. so the plan be broken

129
00:11:29,383 --> 00:11:34,415
down into you know third and so you look at the exposures in the first third the second third and then

130
00:11:34,415 --> 00:11:39,515
the last third pregnancy on some type people that monthly average and sometimes people get things

131
00:11:39,515 --> 00:11:44,815
done. even fire time scale and so then usually what they do with the

132
00:11:44,815 --> 00:11:50,155
photo series of model. you know maybe they that one model that has just the whole pregnancy average exposure.

133
00:11:50,155 --> 00:11:55,955
another model that was the first trimester exposure and another model that like the second trimester exposure

134
00:11:55,955 --> 00:12:01,035
for Thursday where I'm going here first to get a_lot_of comparisons of people are doing and so

135
00:12:01,035 --> 00:12:06,595
we start to worry about comparisons a little bit. even though those measures are often very highly correlated

136
00:12:06,595 --> 00:12:12,155
and then another thing is that we're sort of losing the ability to more information across different time periods

137
00:12:12,155 --> 00:12:18,055
and maybe we could do things in a single model. and again a little more.

138
00:12:18,055 --> 00:12:23,135
you know power. we look at the thing. that's it the reason why.

139
00:12:23,135 --> 00:12:28,435
many studies just match women to the closest active monitor. sometimes more sophisticated

140
00:12:28,435 --> 00:12:33,969
methods or use and also talk about method that work. the work office strategy

141
00:12:33,969 --> 00:12:39,429
there's a_lot. there's had been a_lot_of concern about how to handle one thirty in the exposure assessment.

142
00:12:39,429 --> 00:12:44,689
in particular because people at the main exposure in the one in the home. there's always never

143
00:12:44,689 --> 00:12:49,809
a monitor sitting right at her house and is treated as if it work out and measure without air that

144
00:12:49,809 --> 00:12:56,029
I can affect your variances. so all you might see

145
00:12:56,029 --> 00:13:01,369
me all of your account. we're booking a course for pre- term birthday she would hate to just make sure your delivery

146
00:13:01,369 --> 00:13:06,389
in creating a condiments random variable. I'm in any model the probability of pre- term part

147
00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:11,429
of the function of a group of them could be re thinking founder of Michigan. many of them very most apples

148
00:13:11,429 --> 00:13:16,669
in the literature and for aggregate exposure estimate. so something to measure pollution.

149
00:13:16,669 --> 00:13:21,749
the pregnancy. so often you might as match the woman the closest active. PM

150
00:13:21,749 --> 00:13:26,869
two. five monitor for example and saying that her exposure in those because

151
00:13:26,869 --> 00:13:32,189
not even one thing that they tend to do is restrict winning. possibly within a certain just

152
00:13:32,189 --> 00:13:37,361
the monitor. they're doing. so if you're living in a rural area that my closer National Park

153
00:13:37,361 --> 00:13:42,501
you maybe out a_lot. gimme a minute. love you. so what we

154
00:13:42,501 --> 00:13:48,161
did with Josh we wanted to incorporate a special aspect into the model. we wanted to look at

155
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:53,181
how the exposure affects changed. geographically and so particular with

156
00:13:53,181 --> 00:13:58,781
PM two. five. this is this is particular and it's a mixture of exposure. so

157
00:13:58,781 --> 00:14:04,081
p.m. two. five that you had here in Ann_Arbor could be different from the PM two point five. I have in Chapel

158
00:14:04,081 --> 00:14:09,181
Hill versus the answer point five in West Texas. and so the meeting about

159
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:14,181
expanding the composition of the particular matter changes in space and so it makes sense that the

160
00:14:14,181 --> 00:14:19,241
effect of the exposure may change the space. in addition we're interested

161
00:14:19,241 --> 00:14:24,401
in exposures over the whole time period of pregnancy. and we'd like to look and see what maybe

162
00:14:24,401 --> 00:14:29,501
there certain weeks for the pregnancy timing of the development where do you this is more than that the booth

163
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:34,521
and both and others of course you never exposed to just one thing. so we like to think

164
00:14:34,521 --> 00:14:39,601
about handling multiple pollutants and would like to do something about uncertainty in our exposure investment to try

165
00:14:39,601 --> 00:14:44,701
to take into account. I don't know exactly what the woman was exposed to Mason is

166
00:14:44,701 --> 00:14:50,481
Thompson. I think I have a good model but really what I have in the prediction of her exposure

167
00:14:50,481 --> 00:14:56,321
at a point locate a single point location typically and I wanna count that area. when I do my mission

168
00:14:56,321 --> 00:15:01,641
of help with.. we have this really nice collaboration

169
00:15:01,641 --> 00:15:06,721
with the Texas Department_of_Health of Caroline live there and we were able to get folder

170
00:15:06,721 --> 00:15:11,781
for records from Texas for a period of three years. these are your code into

171
00:15:11,781 --> 00:15:17,601
the residence for delivery. okay. we'll be just looking at different substance of the data today.

172
00:15:17,601 --> 00:15:23,141
also have David Dave daily weather data from the National Medical_Center Data Center.

173
00:15:23,141 --> 00:15:28,361
to put your view point file cover on Wednesday. depending on look at the different method of assigning exposure

174
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:33,591
in for somebody will be doing a remodeling trying to predict exposure measures

175
00:15:33,591 --> 00:15:38,871
air quality managers will get from the air quality system. okay. so your calling system stayed on

176
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:44,071
down in PM two. five and then we'll use them to data product. so that we have Veronica

177
00:15:44,071 --> 00:15:49,271
here. a_lot_of work in that area. these are basically generally work with

178
00:15:49,271 --> 00:15:54,511
Tina. which is a private message Gail made it. I had a typo

179
00:15:54,511 --> 00:15:59,611
and I change it but I guess it didn't change it right. bye. this is Maxie. this

180
00:15:59,611 --> 00:16:04,851
is a prediction this is a model that takes into account analytical chemistry sources of the mission.

181
00:16:04,851 --> 00:16:10,137
as well as other data and protect your position on the grid okay I'll show you

182
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:15,497
on the eighth you left the some data with your point data depending on where monitors are placed.

183
00:16:15,497 --> 00:16:20,537
I was down and p.m. two. five. birth locations on the last in Texas.

184
00:16:20,537 --> 00:16:26,037
this is over slightly longer time period of interest. you can see major metropolitan area

185
00:16:26,037 --> 00:16:31,037
on the line today and so

186
00:16:31,037 --> 00:16:36,437
they can see where the birth are also contacted

187
00:16:36,437 --> 00:16:41,657
because even the monitors are the rest the little restaurants or the other monitor and the blue dots for the PNC point

188
00:16:41,657 --> 00:16:46,777
five monitors. you can see the large portions of the state it may not have any for monitoring data at

189
00:16:46,777 --> 00:16:53,117
all. okay. in any in the house and trash and the major metropolitan area. so

190
00:16:53,117 --> 00:16:58,417
out_of our records data. I don't know how many people have worked with Vital Records. if you guys

191
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:03,597
done done much with final records that on student or not sanitizing at that

192
00:17:03,597 --> 00:17:08,684
like would be in specific classes and online so you can just get receipt and see

193
00:17:08,684 --> 00:17:16,004
relates to the row and the facial ages of twelve week which is not viable

194
00:17:16,004 --> 00:17:21,224
people. you know the process but when you get a recent State to State. and we're having

195
00:17:21,224 --> 00:17:26,824
your baby. and sometimes people for personal or religious reasons really one birth certificate

196
00:17:26,824 --> 00:17:33,124
and so basically it doesn't seem like to much fun.

197
00:17:33,124 --> 00:17:38,424
I think about how valid credit union I do believe late. he will be the next month in the low record

198
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:43,525
maybe. bye. but if you do have claim date and be really careful. missing

199
00:17:43,525 --> 00:17:48,684
data. there were some questionable days of pregnancy for simple to forty eight weeks pregnancy.

200
00:17:48,684 --> 00:17:54,104
probably not accurate. I am the mother complete data and said home are

201
00:17:54,104 --> 00:18:00,824
the one from the data that we're excluded from the data that.

202
00:18:00,824 --> 00:18:06,045
I guess Ethan found a little information about the pollution levels. this is every every

203
00:18:06,045 --> 00:18:11,147
time period you can see the Bible and I was on the way and then he answered

204
00:18:11,147 --> 00:18:16,246
my phone. right because she's on the idea of the range the exposures tech this is fine because they

205
00:18:16,246 --> 00:18:21,347
do have you had some dirty air in places that you get some exposure very ability there

206
00:18:21,347 --> 00:18:26,347
that we might not have in North_Carolina. so the challenge

207
00:18:26,347 --> 00:18:31,726
is that we don't know the position level in every woman's location. and and even the tenant

208
00:18:31,726 --> 00:18:36,966
at each women's location is sort of vague and that we don't know where she is all the time right. so

209
00:18:36,966 --> 00:18:42,026
she might be in the car meeting on the interstate in to Detroit everyday

210
00:18:42,026 --> 00:18:47,107
and we don't necessarily know that and so the way we're measuring exposure in this study. we're

211
00:18:47,107 --> 00:18:52,687
looking at a_lot. wanted to have her home. okay. I today the baby was born.

212
00:18:52,687 --> 00:18:57,706
so we don't know if she can use in a car or two and half hours a day. we don't

213
00:18:57,706 --> 00:19:02,806
know if she works in a restaurant and does what's the cooking well we don't know about

214
00:19:02,806 --> 00:19:07,873
that type of exposure so we're making a judgment call about

215
00:19:07,873 --> 00:19:13,353
about her exposure and we're just smiling in the I'm trying be in the concentration. okay.

216
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:18,493
so we've done some studies smaller studies. might put a monitor on women and then you would have really nice

217
00:19:18,493 --> 00:19:24,373
exposure data and know that that's not what we have with the vital records of one trail

218
00:19:24,373 --> 00:19:29,672
there and so a_lot_of papers are just the fine women. women to the closest market.

219
00:19:29,672 --> 00:19:34,853
so my not be so bad in Houston Texas we have lots of monsters. it's probably not the guide

220
00:19:34,853 --> 00:19:39,892
in the middle. you know where we don't we don't have a_lot_of monitors in the nice thing

221
00:19:39,892 --> 00:19:44,932
is that there's a_lot_of work to develop these products to create new solution services

222
00:19:44,932 --> 00:19:50,513
across the US. based on monitor readings based on the weather base let me know about commissions

223
00:19:50,513 --> 00:19:55,533
and the paid particles in here. and so we have different sources of exposure information

224
00:19:55,533 --> 00:20:00,672
that we can try to bring to bear in areas where we may don't have great monitoring data. so

225
00:20:00,672 --> 00:20:05,996
just a little bit about that. that issue so what a product

226
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:11,516
that people use a_lot_of feedback and that based on your home auto and.

227
00:20:11,516 --> 00:20:17,556
and this thing about the a_lot_of people noted that these measures are bias McKay.

228
00:20:17,556 --> 00:20:22,976
and so we think about maybe being the translation process that we're really interested

229
00:20:22,976 --> 00:20:28,056
in. okay. and we're interested in measuring police leaving Jay in location at

230
00:20:28,056 --> 00:20:33,857
at trying to eat. then we have an observation from the Maxie Star

231
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:39,097
which is the output on the grid cell from an e-mail tomorrow. okay. we're really interested

232
00:20:39,097 --> 00:20:44,097
in not really how not how we start back on probably a preacher number. but I'll be back

233
00:20:44,097 --> 00:20:49,097
there probably remember we don't have any remeasure measure and so we can try

234
00:20:49,097 --> 00:20:54,696
to back that out based on based on modeling and so that's what we're doing here.

235
00:20:54,696 --> 00:21:00,236
we have just a simple measurement remodel now.

236
00:21:00,236 --> 00:21:05,869
wanna give you a call right event sometimes people calculate them. so if you do this generally what happens

237
00:21:05,869 --> 00:21:11,008
this is a test message from all over whether you do whether to get water protection

238
00:21:11,008 --> 00:21:16,028
everywhere. whether monitors are not really aligned right with that particular model or

239
00:21:16,028 --> 00:21:21,169
not or monitors. there's also not a weather monitor sitting on top of your health and telling people with the wind speed

240
00:21:21,169 --> 00:21:26,208
then if it's raining and so we'll predict the weather service. the weather

241
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:31,268
service. then two per day. I believe in service across the area similar to that service we

242
00:21:31,268 --> 00:21:36,308
might be nice for some other use data product and so

243
00:21:36,308 --> 00:21:41,488
on so that's the kinda general down the potted models work and so. so here we go got

244
00:21:41,488 --> 00:21:46,768
a model now whether we'll have our our skill training weather information

245
00:21:46,768 --> 00:21:52,389
hotline and they will pass on the structure around it. okay. we'll take the weather variable

246
00:21:52,389 --> 00:21:57,848
and then we'll plug in in down the road. hoping hoping pretty

247
00:21:57,848 --> 00:22:02,909
late. it's now Wednesday. we can do it. he's just we

248
00:22:02,909 --> 00:22:08,553
can also work directly for work in reference to whether hey we might also be interested in

249
00:22:08,553 --> 00:22:13,612
using the monitoring data. we have monitoring data. this is the lady from

250
00:22:13,612 --> 00:22:19,533
alliance United. we're working on data from the monitors in the.

251
00:22:19,533 --> 00:22:24,712
okay. we're happy reasonable. model we you have the measurement

252
00:22:24,712 --> 00:22:30,172
there but we don't we're gonna have about five three zero nine and this measures

253
00:22:30,172 --> 00:22:35,493
and so that's the that's model of the handle the measurement error that we got from the monitor

254
00:22:35,493 --> 00:22:40,740
and then the tribulation is going to be a function of whether so

255
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:45,840
we happened to the multiple major remodeling weather. we're taking out what your predictions

256
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:51,021
the whether variable we're plugging in to a model for pollution. to try to see what's happening

257
00:22:51,021 --> 00:22:56,381
to. two p.m. to point five across the State of Texas. and we don't wanna treat our pre- to whether

258
00:22:56,381 --> 00:23:01,801
or certain site. as the truth. we don't wanna protect their predicted

259
00:23:01,801 --> 00:23:06,841
level at the truth because we don't have for side measures of that. so we wanna do something to

260
00:23:06,841 --> 00:23:11,861
knowledge and certainty and found one thing that John Dominic been called a variety of different things in the

261
00:23:11,861 --> 00:23:17,341
literature about modular razors and he will talk about it encouraging feedback.

262
00:23:17,341 --> 00:23:22,381
did you take the output from Wednesday to the mall. but is definitely the next day you plug it into

263
00:23:22,381 --> 00:23:27,401
the next day. can you do it multiple multiple invitations like procedures to try to take

264
00:23:27,401 --> 00:23:32,521
into account that we get you know exactly what the solution was. when that baby was mother mother was

265
00:23:32,521 --> 00:23:37,821
living with the baby was born. we think we have a decent estimate. but it was on there

266
00:23:37,821 --> 00:23:43,201
and so we'll stimulate late late in the event that we don't know what the true solution level lead

267
00:23:43,201 --> 00:23:48,454
pollution levels and our occupational algorithm and plug those then different outcome

268
00:23:48,454 --> 00:23:53,454
all taking into account. very ability. so to the phone

269
00:23:53,454 --> 00:23:58,734
like any other kind of model you might that we're interested in for pre- term birthdays were interested

270
00:23:58,734 --> 00:24:04,334
in the next year and two point five and each week of pregnancy. okay.

271
00:24:04,334 --> 00:24:09,474
and so always down to doing something over to pollutants team two point five and his own and then

272
00:24:09,474 --> 00:24:14,694
I'm estimating the facts for each pregnancy week. okay.

273
00:24:14,694 --> 00:24:19,834
so now I got two time scales I got the data position with matter but every woman didn't get pregnant on January

274
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:25,114
first. and so we're having a translate back. the second from the pregnancy weeks

275
00:24:25,114 --> 00:24:30,594
not in terms of the first to the bottom. okay. so we do a little matching there.

276
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:37,054
so here. I'm estimating for thirty six weeks of pregnancy.

277
00:24:37,054 --> 00:24:42,254
remember this is gone and so Jay references my solution

278
00:24:42,254 --> 00:24:47,266
is of you in the week of pregnancy and you that. bye. bye. okay so how

279
00:24:47,266 --> 00:24:53,226
I get estimates in the small whole lot of parameters. so

280
00:24:53,226 --> 00:24:58,366
like that. so I have no any status within the parameters that

281
00:24:58,366 --> 00:25:04,246
are specific to each police. I have two solutions I have thirty six weeks of pregnancy. and I have.

282
00:25:04,246 --> 00:25:09,386
okay. and so. so how I go about falling in the

283
00:25:09,386 --> 00:25:14,486
right you know seventy two times or many spaces. I have model.

284
00:25:14,486 --> 00:25:19,646
I mean areas in the parameters and the model. I need a parking information. maybe not a_lot depending

285
00:25:19,646 --> 00:25:24,986
on what my outcome is and how big the spaces are. so we're going to

286
00:25:24,986 --> 00:25:32,426
specify a prior process for these parameters and we're going to bar information across.

287
00:25:32,426 --> 00:25:37,606
I can point okay. okay. Cos we can

288
00:25:37,606 --> 00:25:42,686
allow to your information promptly. okay. so I need to complete that lease

289
00:25:42,686 --> 00:25:47,906
back. you know between twelve and thirteen dollars

290
00:25:47,906 --> 00:25:53,128
of each other there back any exposure that week one and week

291
00:25:53,128 --> 00:25:58,348
twenty. okay. so exposure that happen. closer together in pregnancy time.

292
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:03,808
you may have or similar fact on the feed. the exposure that happened for the report.

293
00:26:03,808 --> 00:26:08,968
so that's all. this meeting there by the information.

294
00:26:08,968 --> 00:26:13,988
so this is Jessica from Beaumont North Bay. so we play around in Harris County which is where

295
00:26:13,988 --> 00:26:19,048
he been and he didn't seem to be in the case that the exposure affect the

296
00:26:19,048 --> 00:26:24,148
rate a_lot over space and so we are just because because entering the one County. the third largest

297
00:26:24,148 --> 00:26:29,208
County in the US and the huge sample five. relatively low percentage. return

298
00:26:29,208 --> 00:26:34,428
number to make it bring. one model that got all her fancy meeting every space and time.

299
00:26:34,428 --> 00:26:39,648
a very traditional trimester average model where we just looked at exposures in the first trimester and the second

300
00:26:39,648 --> 00:26:45,128
trimester pregnancy average together and in the multiple regression model what we didn't do any meeting.

301
00:26:45,128 --> 00:26:50,130
but if you really Daniel Rich. we got pre- term birds which is non- externally rare outcome

302
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:55,450
thirty two thousand. and so we couldn't really nail the parameters.

303
00:26:55,450 --> 00:27:00,730
you know it's not the mall not gonna crash. so mobile got some model out with that as well.

304
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:05,770
all the all are fitting event in studying with relatively similar prior structure and we can try to reprint look at

305
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:11,210
the rate that we could based on the final record. I think they looked out trolling for age

306
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:16,390
rate that's in the City Education the baby gender and then temperatures. I didn't know what actually interesting

307
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:22,970
work. we recently done on heat and so we did look at temperature on the date of birth.

308
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:28,850
so if it any. I don't think we had to get into too many details I believe in the mall we're trying to averages.

309
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:34,590
we're going to have one term for each pollutants for each trimester. so we'll have four parameters

310
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:39,850
that on and we're just taking a couple trimester average

311
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:45,150
level this week's involved in the time. so we'll talk at that

312
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:50,652
briefly. Reese trimester. the probability appraiser

313
00:27:50,652 --> 00:27:56,252
Annie call me back with the private regression model occupational reasons.

314
00:27:56,252 --> 00:28:01,852
the private corporations or haven't signed or not and I got ratios. there a little less than terminal

315
00:28:01,852 --> 00:28:07,152
that the consultation is a_lot easier. was a private weight in a bit of the privately functions really

316
00:28:07,152 --> 00:28:12,252
take a_lot_of data to distinguish between private and legend links. and and I

317
00:28:12,252 --> 00:28:17,332
would just again I find your name address and model. so that. so

318
00:28:17,332 --> 00:28:23,512
that's what we it in the small where we're where we look it weekly.

319
00:28:23,512 --> 00:28:28,532
but we don't borrow information over time in Spain. we are

320
00:28:28,532 --> 00:28:34,112
using a shrink it's prior to our verbal work barring information across the week that we

321
00:28:34,112 --> 00:28:39,392
seen any change ability. so we're not saying that exposures and we went into to staff more than we're back.

322
00:28:39,392 --> 00:28:44,832
thanks for choosing which one and you know thirty or something like that. so

323
00:28:44,832 --> 00:28:50,038
just a little more done think about how we do that I will use the daily look at the current results

324
00:28:50,038 --> 00:28:55,218
to make sure things things are going in the right direction or not trends that we are being

325
00:28:55,218 --> 00:29:00,458
able to explain. things seems pretty similar

326
00:29:00,458 --> 00:29:05,678
to what we would expect from the literature. I don't have your you seem to have stronger effect and paternal cubby

327
00:29:05,678 --> 00:29:10,938
area. they said it was very very difficult. he's out maternal and paternal a fact because

328
00:29:10,938 --> 00:29:16,058
the partner selection. so there were a_lot_of cases where you had you know

329
00:29:16,058 --> 00:29:21,118
a forty year old mom and a twenty year old that for example people tend to Mary people that

330
00:29:21,118 --> 00:29:27,156
were close in age and husband of your economic status. that was really hard. he's out some of those of that

331
00:29:27,156 --> 00:29:33,076
we do see an increase rent that we make in literature or not. anyway brother.

332
00:29:33,076 --> 00:29:38,516
I'll decrease risk for fathers or Asian American or American Indian

333
00:29:38,516 --> 00:29:43,636
and then we saw eight like we would expect because you situations. so

334
00:29:43,636 --> 00:29:48,876
the mother in early twenty eleven. and mothers but you got to be thirty five

335
00:29:48,876 --> 00:29:54,276
and you have a higher and teenagers are likely to be one prematurely.

336
00:29:54,276 --> 00:29:59,476
I did not work in that area very nice. the majority of birth the US. they're fifty

337
00:29:59,476 --> 00:30:04,996
one and a half percent. actually barely on balance and then they proceeded to tell them no

338
00:30:04,996 --> 00:30:10,556
more rapidly until the eighth. enjoy your early thirties. when the other evening.

339
00:30:10,556 --> 00:30:15,736
I guess if you're on the market. and so there a_lot_of interesting

340
00:30:15,736 --> 00:30:21,256
I can't believe about how. they're more somehow other week or something.

341
00:30:21,256 --> 00:30:26,556
I don't know. but anyway that that's an interesting letter. the people they get the mail will extend

342
00:30:26,556 --> 00:30:32,577
everything you possibly can in order. you know I just arrived and women are more eager to compromise

343
00:30:32,577 --> 00:30:37,837
and you know make it through. but anyway. hey this is Archie baby mama said you're gonna try Mister

344
00:30:37,837 --> 00:30:43,957
Robert. this is Gail at the things that are part of our increase from

345
00:30:43,957 --> 00:30:49,437
the. this is four p.m. two point five and the first and second trimester

346
00:30:49,437 --> 00:30:54,537
first trimester and on the right you got have_to match what we haven't really

347
00:30:54,537 --> 00:30:59,777
mean that strongly over time. we're just using for every single meeting

348
00:30:59,777 --> 00:31:05,357
translation. but anyhow I'll be really wanting information on that

349
00:31:05,357 --> 00:31:10,377
your birthday and we'll transfer you be something like it might be going on in

350
00:31:10,377 --> 00:31:19,337
the first trimester being little

351
00:31:19,337 --> 00:31:24,617
house and third trimester exposure is there from PNM for anytime. if we look at what happens with maybe

352
00:31:24,617 --> 00:31:29,637
really get a_lot_of information from this meeting and so we can really get around rid

353
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:34,675
of a_lot_of new ways looks like there's something going on for PM two. five it's a little

354
00:31:34,675 --> 00:31:39,715
less clear. now this is really what might be going on.

355
00:31:39,715 --> 00:31:45,315
so this is a nice example that I think we did. we look at Malcolm.

356
00:31:45,315 --> 00:31:51,175
I don't just look at pictures and figure model. we we did the deed in the information my carry on with that favor.

357
00:31:51,175 --> 00:31:56,415
the model where we did meeting you know meeting every time.

358
00:31:56,415 --> 00:32:01,735
so we did look at a larger area. probably have the study we had so much data.

359
00:32:01,735 --> 00:32:06,935
was hard to do the computation answers and I in interesting data a potential problem. an appointment

360
00:32:06,935 --> 00:32:12,295
on data from three counties in particular. County. Montgomery

361
00:32:12,295 --> 00:32:18,495
County and Walnut County. they're around here in Downey. I'm in the same general area.

362
00:32:18,495 --> 00:32:23,655
now he expands with a special model and the comparison I wanna get done here is what happens when

363
00:32:23,655 --> 00:32:28,795
I fit data from each County independently versus when I special meeting. okay.

364
00:32:28,795 --> 00:32:35,293
you can say for example Brad Gloria County in particular. you would have her on the phone right

365
00:32:35,293 --> 00:32:40,393
I'm just a little before three.. another thing out. the black

366
00:32:40,393 --> 00:32:45,533
of the plot. so in order to do special meeting. we're

367
00:32:45,533 --> 00:32:50,533
gonna send it to a different model. one one nine. this is never State Finance leading to

368
00:32:50,533 --> 00:32:55,753
money just doesn't need every space and so here the results I think pretty

369
00:32:55,753 --> 00:33:00,953
County. smaller County. so we can see without the specialist that. Gloria

370
00:33:00,953 --> 00:33:06,133
Waller in Montgomery County in the lobby your utility.

371
00:33:06,133 --> 00:33:12,113
you know maybe less. it's a little hard to do. if you would get area

372
00:33:12,113 --> 00:33:17,633
for me. we getting a_lot_of revisions here. so again

373
00:33:17,633 --> 00:33:23,273
these the smaller counties in the county we start with period. so we're a hundred and eighty

374
00:33:23,273 --> 00:33:28,393
one five one five. seeing this is the end result will be exactly

375
00:33:28,393 --> 00:33:33,833
the same trend across the county. but it's not radically different either.

376
00:33:33,833 --> 00:33:39,221
there down. I just wanna summarize

377
00:33:39,221 --> 00:33:45,101
the study. we look at multiple police. we wanted to look at

378
00:33:45,101 --> 00:33:50,181
that specific to certain weeks of development. particularly like to do this we're looking at

379
00:33:50,181 --> 00:33:55,521
Bertha fax. so I'm not gonna have time to talk a_lot about the birth now.

380
00:33:55,521 --> 00:34:00,841
have working and I wanna share with you. text me know in particular. we look at cardiovascular

381
00:34:00,841 --> 00:34:05,981
the fact we know that the certain parts of the heart will be for my given week of pregnancy. so we can take that

382
00:34:05,981 --> 00:34:11,021
nine month pregnancy and we can bring that down to maybe you know conception from the date pregnancy

383
00:34:11,021 --> 00:34:16,121
or something. I really start looking at sort of finally keen on special exposure so we've been playing around

384
00:34:16,121 --> 00:34:21,661
with the air pollution model that we you know policies and evidence

385
00:34:21,661 --> 00:34:26,661
and they're study a critical time period. you know maybe like later pregnancy exposures might

386
00:34:26,661 --> 00:34:31,681
not have much impact on rent. yesterday earlier exposure. and

387
00:34:31,681 --> 00:34:36,941
so this work will be evident a little more now. we look outside of Texas.

388
00:34:36,941 --> 00:34:41,941
just doing a little bit different. so we focus on the pre- term bird in the

389
00:34:41,941 --> 00:34:47,001
spending and taxes. so you see that I can call and hear the results and the taxes

390
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:52,081
study and the study we did not see you back in a particular matter on birthday.

391
00:34:52,081 --> 00:34:58,361
bye. North_Carolina. so if you did that. I can't work we had on her dissertation.

392
00:34:58,361 --> 00:35:03,541
please call us back on birthday but not on remember. okay I didn't read

393
00:35:03,541 --> 00:35:08,601
them all and I know it's not an hour. you wouldn't necessarily call in a matter in our office but I'd little

394
00:35:08,601 --> 00:35:13,841
study from you. so we're just gonna be the things against

395
00:35:13,841 --> 00:35:19,921
me being work late but not really across the world. my father the

396
00:35:19,921 --> 00:35:25,561
time in there. so we have white why don't been to replicate any better.

397
00:35:25,561 --> 00:35:30,649
you know if it just that p.m. two. five and different from safe place to play in that that

398
00:35:30,649 --> 00:35:35,729
the populations are different from place to place and I wanna see that we always worry about

399
00:35:35,729 --> 00:35:40,949
a compounding and where you're needing vital records and we don't really have the best data for Vital Records.

400
00:35:40,949 --> 00:35:46,769
so remember when I was giving birth to my son no_one never asked me if I right.

401
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:51,829
so I guess you know they yesterday soon now but knowing and. so but

402
00:35:51,829 --> 00:35:57,389
that information is recorded in the Vital Records and you know what the quality of data.

403
00:35:57,389 --> 00:36:02,409
and so nothing about vital records especially for pregnancy outcome. is that you

404
00:36:02,409 --> 00:36:07,525
wanna pursue certificate so in the US. you get great population coverage

405
00:36:07,525 --> 00:36:12,705
because people want have you know at least until now. what happened. and so

406
00:36:12,705 --> 00:36:18,005
you got everybody. this is Vantage and vital records and that you don't have a great ability

407
00:36:18,005 --> 00:36:23,005
to control from founders. you don't have a full residential history that is why you're giving up in order the house the

408
00:36:23,005 --> 00:36:28,185
basically the full population. so it's not the having to restart your account or study

409
00:36:28,185 --> 00:36:33,245
in the event that I can get really detailed data. I can follow and then before they're even trying to get pregnant

410
00:36:33,245 --> 00:36:38,265
I can ask them about the die and I can ask and you know with her husband does real living and with

411
00:36:38,265 --> 00:36:43,265
the offices of an exposure. I can confirm diagnoses and things like that. but

412
00:36:43,265 --> 00:36:48,385
the manage and enter your homework study is that they're extremely expensive. there's

413
00:36:48,385 --> 00:36:53,825
participation by. so in my study he be really happy to have sixty percent of the people you're approaching

414
00:36:53,825 --> 00:36:58,865
agreed to participate in the study and then to decline may have your specific reason for

415
00:36:58,865 --> 00:37:04,072
declining to participate they can introduce the bias and so so I wanna talk just briefly

416
00:37:04,072 --> 00:37:09,152
about another ten before we were able to forward you back. they have the best of both worlds. and

417
00:37:09,152 --> 00:37:14,212
this is the study right from the start. we do this study in response

418
00:37:14,212 --> 00:37:19,212
to some work at Shannon's wanted done out in California and it was originally fertility in

419
00:37:19,212 --> 00:37:24,212
early pregnancy loss study. but the focus is on this infection by product and the drinking

420
00:37:24,212 --> 00:37:29,232
water. was regulated by EPA to limit your rent the bladder cancer and Shana had done some work

421
00:37:29,232 --> 00:37:34,832
to so it maybe related to early pregnancy loss and so we started to study.

422
00:37:34,832 --> 00:37:40,052
it was funded by a war. I was sort of I had some funding

423
00:37:40,052 --> 00:37:45,752
from industry which was nice. if it work. and and

424
00:37:45,752 --> 00:37:50,912
so this is this is the idea. wondering this is really interesting I think sometimes people ask

425
00:37:50,912 --> 00:37:56,552
and maybe left in Michigan drinking water just infection but product called cancer.

426
00:37:56,552 --> 00:38:01,612
why don't we drop them several at American countries try that. they had car out Craig's and

427
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:06,634
places like through and said I really you'd rather and then we

428
00:38:06,634 --> 00:38:11,734
don't wanna drop the claim from our drinking water. if you received any you ask for the

429
00:38:11,734 --> 00:38:17,354
recruiting women and they went in the water system and took weekly measurements estimate expires.

430
00:38:17,354 --> 00:38:22,354
the water system. based on how they disinfected the water these coronation. to try to get around having

431
00:38:22,354 --> 00:38:27,454
to deal with modeling the special distribution of the buy product to the system so they were

432
00:38:27,454 --> 00:38:32,714
very systematic and how they picked on the water district that we're asked to participate. so

433
00:38:32,714 --> 00:38:37,894
this is my product. they responded to them. there are few that are regulated

434
00:38:37,894 --> 00:38:43,234
by the EPA. so we'll try how things of the some of the board compounds and H A eight five

435
00:38:43,234 --> 00:38:48,754
and some of five Taylor. the guy said that he considered those compound as well as individual

436
00:38:48,754 --> 00:38:53,914
I went to go into the phone. the other advocate measure. again it's came total against

437
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:58,974
the line. the mother availability happens in the from nine set time of five.

438
00:38:58,974 --> 00:39:04,384
of different exposures they were interested in in the study Rob I know the model

439
00:39:04,384 --> 00:39:09,484
to get relative risk and what they found in the study. in the Indian in

440
00:39:09,484 --> 00:39:14,944
the recruited recruitment. I did perfect the study. I have an thing

441
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:20,124
about the regulatory when it went like the rest of Monford and facial

442
00:39:20,124 --> 00:39:25,404
labor and then I saw some suggested Association

443
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:32,324
here at the top print file. again it's a license just basically

444
00:39:32,324 --> 00:39:37,424
where it is Heidi. hey Rick this is Jenny with reduce

445
00:39:37,424 --> 00:39:42,504
risk or pre- term. there was an issue in the study end of the flight. thanks. bye. on

446
00:39:42,504 --> 00:39:47,944
the composition of the water. I have one final on the ocean. they have when's a debt

447
00:39:47,944 --> 00:39:53,664
that you surface water and when the water was treated a_lot_of disinfect bright product and broom and a compound.

448
00:39:53,664 --> 00:39:59,044
they have Wi-Fi put where where I live. that has also used to surface water

449
00:39:59,044 --> 00:40:04,264
but has mostly coordinated the convention by product anyhow bye.

450
00:40:04,264 --> 00:40:10,184
get this part number. I got the water from under the ground I really don't. it's really not thirty.

451
00:40:10,184 --> 00:40:15,324
but you happen to read it. I guess and I to know why we're getting matter in the wires so you have have a great matter

452
00:40:15,324 --> 00:40:20,584
to have the connection by Friday and said that water was very pristine. unfortunately got home with another

453
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:25,824
tendency and living in that town house available demographic to the back up remember

454
00:40:25,824 --> 00:40:30,964
any more hiring population. and that we think that might be driving. use risk

455
00:40:30,964 --> 00:40:37,364
of having a marker for not being permitted. even that week. so

456
00:40:37,364 --> 00:40:42,444
you know if you would give me the results as I have long for you know about any regulatory

457
00:40:42,444 --> 00:40:47,524
one at Caplin tile. and so anybody nothing we worry about a little bit. how

458
00:40:47,524 --> 00:40:52,944
people grandma try to exposure in multiple computers. there was a_lot_of different exposure methods that mattress

459
00:40:52,944 --> 00:40:58,084
that were of interest and how we studied. I got the results of the study were really concerned about

460
00:40:58,084 --> 00:41:03,696
your lies ability. this is an example one folder well more likely be how you educated

461
00:41:03,696 --> 00:41:08,796
with more white than the people in the community. and so what we were able to do. if we were able

462
00:41:08,796 --> 00:41:13,816
to take a really nice exposure measures we got in for the study to go back and get vital records in

463
00:41:13,816 --> 00:41:19,676
his area. so we are able to determine whether when in lives in any area that will serve our water system in the area.

464
00:41:19,676 --> 00:41:25,136
just trying to replicate the study findings and I went around address because the water is perfect anyway

465
00:41:25,136 --> 00:41:30,236
and we just focused in two separate studies in each site. probably and then the other is

466
00:41:30,236 --> 00:41:35,476
the bottom of water with Galveston Texas. I mean we didn't replicate anything

467
00:41:35,476 --> 00:41:40,756
with the vital records. so. so it was highly done absolutely nothing. everything was all

468
00:41:40,756 --> 00:41:45,896
in Raleigh and another fight. we found we didn't replicate what we saw before but we found some different

469
00:41:45,896 --> 00:41:51,236
medication. I came particular with some very prayer out. very prepare for something to wear

470
00:41:51,236 --> 00:41:56,236
study sample for two thousand eleven.

471
00:41:56,236 --> 00:42:01,974
for your all together and so need to ask you know what happened

472
00:42:01,974 --> 00:42:07,154
so we have three sides. we tried to pick them. they have different type of exposure. but maybe the fights

473
00:42:07,154 --> 00:42:12,574
are really different in two different. so we had one site with Bright Water.

474
00:42:12,574 --> 00:42:17,614
I was gonna grab another bike had a different family. you know for a

475
00:42:17,614 --> 00:42:22,954
different room today to disconnection micron at the stable signs any by me.

476
00:42:22,954 --> 00:42:28,554
bye. you can now see. we can really bring things down separately. in addition.

477
00:42:28,554 --> 00:42:34,034
okay. call this contacting my product a little different.

478
00:42:34,034 --> 00:42:39,294
same values to the regulatory variable. okay. thank. right away

479
00:42:39,294 --> 00:42:44,394
at eight eight five for example. they're really similar in Raleigh in Dallas then the overall summary

480
00:42:44,394 --> 00:42:49,674
measures that Mister Wood was just Tom. I'm gonna leave town at the

481
00:42:49,674 --> 00:42:55,034
end of the month for the come home. have your different values of property site.

482
00:42:55,034 --> 00:43:02,334
so it looks the same based on the aggregate but you know the way.

483
00:43:02,334 --> 00:43:07,974
that's an important issue we're thinking about how we handle exposure next years or the data or

484
00:43:07,974 --> 00:43:13,034
or how we do the mission reduction. you know this is an urgent

485
00:43:13,034 --> 00:43:18,534
message to use me in thanking into different population. you know. so in this case.

486
00:43:18,534 --> 00:43:24,074
we really the together along with right

487
00:43:24,074 --> 00:43:29,394
was really similar. and if you missed any individual which was quite different. so we're happy

488
00:43:29,394 --> 00:43:35,094
about that. we're trying to lighter work and I need to different population. so.

489
00:43:35,094 --> 00:43:40,154
so I did wanna talk a little bit about hopefully. bye. I don't think I have time and I rather take questions

490
00:43:40,154 --> 00:43:45,309
that people have questions I can talk to you about it I have pretty figured but

491
00:43:45,309 --> 00:43:50,689
I just wanted to get to the end with some questions on it. also they are putting a

492
00:43:50,689 --> 00:43:55,989
new PPC. again it's for Marcy and the EPA and

493
00:43:55,989 --> 00:44:01,049
the American Water Works Research Foundation all bandages research they're very generous and I'll

494
00:44:01,049 --> 00:44:53,269
take questions if you got them

495
00:44:53,269 --> 00:44:58,549
yeah will be dead in the Texas study if we could we control for temperature

496
00:44:58,549 --> 00:45:03,769
on the day of birth their average temperature on the birthday. to try to get out

497
00:45:03,769 --> 00:45:09,009
to figure out what the questions are really good one. you know it says that the way we went

498
00:45:09,009 --> 00:45:14,289
about it. just to have a sample control there for temperature. but that's and that's really important

499
00:45:14,289 --> 00:45:19,449
actually a_lot_of people now trying to study and to be careful when you're sending heat. he doesn't handle

500
00:45:19,449 --> 00:45:24,689
all the exposures together I think is a really interesting problem. I'll be back in the exposure

501
00:45:24,689 --> 00:45:29,849
window. that's a really interesting question. you know and it came up a little bit. I think

502
00:45:29,849 --> 00:45:35,049
some critique. the earlier work better link to the exposures the water is with the pregnancy

503
00:45:35,049 --> 00:45:40,469
the pregnancy loss would be it. you know the baby is pretty isolated at the very beginning and

504
00:45:40,469 --> 00:45:46,007
on and you know the plantation. looks like the person has not fully connected you know the believable

505
00:45:46,007 --> 00:45:51,067
they're just moving out. we came home more blood from the mom with the baby and very early on the thought

506
00:45:51,067 --> 00:45:56,107
is that you know the baby kinda violated that's a good thing if I go and you know have a glass of wine I'm not gonna

507
00:45:56,107 --> 00:46:01,207
have my baby. if you had or what you know whatever. I'm not really bad or probably got one is just fine

508
00:46:01,207 --> 00:46:06,287
whenever you have it. but but you know major exposures might not get to the baby but then maybe I can't

509
00:46:06,287 --> 00:46:11,547
believe that well maybe I have these exposure even the board section the ten matter by setting up an environment

510
00:46:11,547 --> 00:46:16,587
that is not conducive to you to the baby in side of the fact I think we know

511
00:46:16,587 --> 00:46:21,847
a little bit more about the windows in the sense that you know it's not gonna call the hole in the heart

512
00:46:21,847 --> 00:46:26,907
after that part was formed and so I can really have a firm cut off. you know for example at eight weeks

513
00:46:26,907 --> 00:46:32,127
of pregnancy and not look at the later pregnancy exposure. but I think for Peter birthday thinking from

514
00:46:32,127 --> 00:46:37,607
all over the map where people are even with the things like your pollution being a trigger. return number. I'm looking at

515
00:46:37,607 --> 00:46:43,027
an exposure is you know the week of the delivery and doing for the cable cross over now. please do try to see if that's related.

516
00:46:43,027 --> 00:46:48,223
so I think is an interesting thing to look at and I don't know you know how how much guidance

517
00:46:48,223 --> 00:46:53,383
we really have about mechanism. if this is an interesting word more recently about

518
00:46:53,383 --> 00:47:08,203
maybe looking at making a sick studies and looking at. this is Elizabeth in the cell.

519
00:47:08,203 --> 00:47:13,283
bye.

520
00:47:13,283 --> 00:47:19,003
yeah. so this is something that you really can't get out from a birth certificate.

521
00:47:19,003 --> 00:47:24,383
so for the idea. you know a pre- term but just one thing if I you know done a model

522
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:29,383
and I don't wanna have stretch marks and I went in you know thirty six and a half weeks birthday

523
00:47:29,383 --> 00:47:35,203
as you know I have pre- clancy and my wife is going to be rest and I'm Indian he's the baby

524
00:47:35,203 --> 00:47:40,623
birthday is. I had a spontaneous pre- term for it. so I just went into labor early.

525
00:47:40,623 --> 00:47:45,683
and so that's my experience with that evening. we're sending that can be if you're not planning

526
00:47:45,683 --> 00:47:51,229
for that at the beginning that can be a little difficult to back out. but I do think that's very important I can is sickly

527
00:47:51,229 --> 00:47:56,229
try to separate what we call spontaneous pre- term deliveries from those that are medically indicated where we intervened

528
00:47:56,229 --> 00:48:07,469
and took the baby other time.

529
00:48:07,469 --> 00:48:12,549
yeah. yeah. so actually a fun day of start to get people I think

530
00:48:12,549 --> 00:48:17,549
and masters level by start classes because you look at the distribution just facial and this is

531
00:48:17,549 --> 00:48:22,549
really neat. it's a really great distribution for not her bedroom on like that. it's

532
00:48:22,549 --> 00:48:27,549
got a left tail. okay. so the baby's born at twenty six weeks twenty seven

533
00:48:27,549 --> 00:48:32,789
weeks. you know any start getting more more and then on Friday when you get the forty one weeks

534
00:48:32,789 --> 00:48:37,849
or gonna be would be section. you know maybe like forty two and you got that distribution it's not often

535
00:48:37,849 --> 00:48:43,049
Patrick. got a long left tail is essentially truncated on the right. so we can

536
00:48:43,049 --> 00:48:48,109
look at. we can look at. I just facial AG the reason for time to that type model.

537
00:48:48,109 --> 00:48:53,155
we have_to be careful it's very difficult to transport it to make it looks the mattress that you could

538
00:48:53,155 --> 00:48:58,315
do something simple like linear regression. so wanting people you know people about about using the extra

539
00:48:58,315 --> 00:49:03,715
models tomorrow mom what are other things trying to model that statement. it's always a fun one.

540
00:49:03,715 --> 00:49:08,735
you said pretty modeling because the statement there interesting relative to Ms. .com. but yeah

541
00:49:08,735 --> 00:49:13,735
there's a_lot_of work to so you know the difference in terms not all the pain is better to be going to

542
00:49:13,735 --> 00:49:19,025
thirty nine forty one and thirty eight break in your logical development reasons and things

543
00:49:19,025 --> 00:49:24,681
like that and so to be able to look at the provide timing and Josh a little bit of that visitation

544
00:49:24,681 --> 00:49:45,241
as well. like pretty much all day. yeah.

545
00:49:45,241 --> 00:49:50,321
so I don't I don't think we have. I mean I think that's still really hard game to

546
00:49:50,321 --> 00:49:55,421
play. yeah for something like recover. so I know I know people were gone. I did

547
00:49:55,421 --> 00:50:00,621
a little work in North_Carolina where he work for the health department to try to figure out how to intervene with

548
00:50:00,621 --> 00:50:05,881
low income women to try to help them avoid return bird and it was really hard to predict

549
00:50:05,881 --> 00:50:11,281
very accurately at all. yeah I did and in really big sub groups that are too expensive

550
00:50:11,281 --> 00:50:36,535
to intervene in the home. if you.

551
00:50:36,535 --> 00:50:43,734
anyway yeah right.

552
00:50:43,734 --> 00:50:52,374
yeah. regards to

553
00:50:52,374 --> 00:50:58,254
your main

554
00:50:58,254 --> 00:51:07,834
application file.

555
00:51:07,834 --> 00:51:16,594
so when you

556
00:51:16,594 --> 00:51:30,055
so that one. bye

557
00:51:30,055 --> 00:51:36,414
yeah it's Tom. I need to get a hard question I think we don't have a good.

558
00:51:36,414 --> 00:51:41,914
thing there couple things that play I think that the vital records are better and better

559
00:51:41,914 --> 00:51:46,954
and more. you know now the pregnancy the date and mileage is down I think we got a_lot better information on things like

560
00:51:46,954 --> 00:51:52,014
return number and we use the house. so I think more recent that he will be better and then that there's

561
00:51:52,014 --> 00:51:57,035
an alter sound data pregnancy and we really have clean data on the pregnancy duration.

562
00:51:57,035 --> 00:52:04,234
but I think. yeah I'm not really sure you know it's it's hard to say. why.

563
00:52:04,234 --> 00:52:09,254
why it really hasn't been replicate or fewer studies for sure. and.

564
00:52:09,254 --> 00:52:14,514
so but you know a_lot_of the ecological study for cardiovascular disease. certainly replicate

565
00:52:14,514 --> 00:52:20,654
it better than some of the. so thought you'd that you need to get the vital records information Geo coded

566
00:52:20,654 --> 00:52:25,854
from state to state. so I think that part of it. I don't know of any

567
00:52:25,854 --> 00:52:30,974
in our season of tried to look for example across the can you know the country with the scope of some of the cardiovascular

568
00:52:30,974 --> 00:52:36,134
disease study but it been out there. I don't have a good answer today. I think

569
00:52:36,134 --> 00:52:41,214
the exposure. yeah. yeah all the answers I have that I can pick up up the top of my head. I

570
00:52:41,214 --> 00:52:46,514
can prove them wrong with the credit vascular samples from different exposures. but

571
00:52:46,514 --> 00:52:51,514
we know there are lot of important in downers measuring and the pregnancy studies that might not

572
00:52:51,514 --> 00:53:24,818
play it's like a rolling. you

573
00:53:24,818 --> 00:53:30,159
yeah yeah. not so basically we're fitting a basic set of what we're doing

574
00:53:30,159 --> 00:53:35,518
in terms of the indication is that we're basically running against sampler to get estimates

575
00:53:35,518 --> 00:53:41,438
the solution to get in point location and we're taking the asked the

576
00:53:41,438 --> 00:53:46,698
rep with Eddie and Theresa to get the same floor plan here in the outcome of running

577
00:53:46,698 --> 00:53:55,318
back and send it. they're gonna be back from the outcome.

578
00:53:55,318 --> 00:54:01,058
the model is actually completely separately. if payment they have run. you know.

579
00:54:01,058 --> 00:54:16,878
okay. because fifty thousand. and that the demolition point here.

580
00:54:16,878 --> 00:54:23,155
yeah. yeah

581
00:54:23,155 --> 00:54:28,155
yeah worry worry about happy. be back from the. part of the

582
00:54:28,155 --> 00:54:33,434
model. let me know you're part of the mall and I think the people have been looking when people

583
00:54:33,434 --> 00:54:38,595
have been looking at this way mama and literature. we have a huge amount of your emergency about

584
00:54:38,595 --> 00:54:44,195
the exposure process. anyhow must let's see. I'll be out

585
00:54:44,195 --> 00:54:49,635
and so is the exposure all is well. involved somehow in the driveway.

586
00:54:49,635 --> 00:54:57,075
I'm on my and

587
00:54:57,075 --> 00:55:04,715
area. Wall mount volume information. bye-bye. later.

588
00:55:04,715 --> 00:55:15,335
love you.

589
00:55:15,335 --> 00:55:20,755
bye. thank you

590
00:55:20,755 --> 00:55:25,956
your on the line. we

591
00:55:25,956 --> 00:55:31,837
have it in pending. you know if we get to see a_lot_of very ability everybody.

592
00:55:31,837 --> 00:55:38,197
really on the line. yeah

593
00:55:38,197 --> 00:55:45,397
anyway.

594
00:55:45,397 --> 00:55:53,637
thank you.
