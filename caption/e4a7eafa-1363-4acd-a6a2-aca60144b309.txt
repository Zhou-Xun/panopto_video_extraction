1
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,507
After watching this video,

2
00:00:11,507 --> 00:00:15,650
you will be able to use PROC GENMOD
to run Poisson regression.

3
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:18,089
Let's use the following example.

4
00:00:18,089 --> 00:00:24,100
We have a cohort of 332 subjects who
will follow up an average of 14 years.

5
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:27,432
Incident coronary heart
disease events were collected.

6
00:00:27,432 --> 00:00:31,600
That's the outcome variable
called CHD in this data set.

7
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:36,406
And we're interested in knowing it being
physically active would be protected for

8
00:00:36,406 --> 00:00:39,880
coronary heart disease,
which we already know.

9
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,312
So, we will also use one
potential confounder job.

10
00:00:43,312 --> 00:00:47,901
That is coded as one for high income jobs,
two for million income jobs,

11
00:00:47,901 --> 00:00:50,470
and three for low income jobs.

12
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:55,370
Here you can see a print out of the tenth
first observations in the data set.

13
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:59,996
Note that the variable y represents
time in a study in years, so

14
00:00:59,996 --> 00:01:03,360
that's our person time.

15
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:08,345
Now, let's think of how to calculate
an incidence rate ratio kind of manually.

16
00:01:08,345 --> 00:01:12,977
The first thing you have to get is the
incidence rate of coronary heart disease

17
00:01:12,977 --> 00:01:15,698
among people who are not
physically active.

18
00:01:15,698 --> 00:01:19,796
And then, the incidence rate among
people who are physically active.

19
00:01:19,796 --> 00:01:23,940
And then just divide them to
get incidence rate ratio.

20
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:27,109
We're going to use PROC MEANS
in specifying the options SUM.

21
00:01:27,109 --> 00:01:31,441
So, we get the sum of events and the sum
of time by physical activity strata.

22
00:01:31,441 --> 00:01:36,490
That way we don't have to do
everything completely manually.

23
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:38,208
So, now with those figures,

24
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:43,540
we just need to calculate our incidence
rate ratio manually an we get 0.53.

25
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:47,316
Since our reference is people
who are not physically active.

26
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:52,266
The way we interpret this incidence rate
ratio is, that being physically active

27
00:01:52,266 --> 00:01:57,960
decreases the rate of coronary
heart disease events by 47%.

28
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,427
Now, let's do exactly the same, but
with our Poisson regression model.

29
00:02:02,427 --> 00:02:07,233
Remember, that Poisson models are used
to model counts, and rates are count.

30
00:02:07,233 --> 00:02:12,043
And when exponentiation the better from
the Poisson model we get an incidence

31
00:02:12,043 --> 00:02:13,809
rate ratio.

32
00:02:13,809 --> 00:02:18,445
The first thing we have to do before
going into PROC GENMOD is to create our

33
00:02:18,445 --> 00:02:20,339
offset variable.

34
00:02:20,339 --> 00:02:22,036
And we do that in other step.

35
00:02:22,036 --> 00:02:26,825
I'm going to create a temporary that I set
called Poisson from my original data set,

36
00:02:26,825 --> 00:02:29,057
and I'm going to create the variable.

37
00:02:29,057 --> 00:02:32,991
Remember that there are offset variable
has to be the natural log of time,

38
00:02:32,991 --> 00:02:34,879
I'll call it, ly.

39
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,935
And then we can run our Poisson model and
PROC GENMOD.

40
00:02:37,935 --> 00:02:43,159
In our model statement we have
the outcome = exposere, same as before.

41
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:46,919
The outcome here is CHD, and
this posture is physical.

42
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:50,807
In the options, we specify
the appropriate options for Poisson,

43
00:02:50,807 --> 00:02:53,525
the Poisson distribution,
and the log link.

44
00:02:53,525 --> 00:02:57,414
And there is one knew thing here
specific to the Poisson model.

45
00:02:57,414 --> 00:03:02,044
We have to tells us which is our offset
variable using their offset option.

46
00:03:02,044 --> 00:03:05,404
Here, we add the name of
the variable we just created, ly.

47
00:03:05,404 --> 00:03:09,918
Note also that I declared the physical
activity variable in their classes

48
00:03:09,918 --> 00:03:14,431
statement, not because it's totally
necessary, since this is a binary

49
00:03:14,431 --> 00:03:19,169
variable, but because then I can
specify the reference I want to use.

50
00:03:19,169 --> 00:03:23,300
In this case, I want people who are not
physically active to be the reference.

51
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:27,246
If you don't do that, SAS will
choose usually the higher value or

52
00:03:27,246 --> 00:03:31,431
the variable, and in this particular
example you don't want that.

53
00:03:31,431 --> 00:03:34,379
Okay, so now let's look at the output.

54
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:38,779
The first part of the output is kind
of similar to what we've seen before.

55
00:03:38,779 --> 00:03:42,389
It gives you some information about
the model that you already know.

56
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:45,123
It gives you the Number of
Reservations Read and Use,

57
00:03:45,123 --> 00:03:48,421
which is always important to make
sure you have missing values.

58
00:03:48,421 --> 00:03:52,669
And it gives you the levels
of the physical value.

59
00:03:52,669 --> 00:03:56,644
Now, the next part has some similarities
to would you have seen before,

60
00:03:56,644 --> 00:04:00,179
because it gives you tests
to assess goodness of fit.

61
00:04:00,179 --> 00:04:04,112
But there is something here that
we have not introduced before, but

62
00:04:04,112 --> 00:04:06,182
is useful for Poisson, deviance.

63
00:04:06,182 --> 00:04:10,442
I'm not going to cover any details
about this goodness of fit test, but

64
00:04:10,442 --> 00:04:14,355
you just need to know that values
close to one indicate a good fit.

65
00:04:14,355 --> 00:04:18,704
In there, much higher than one it means
that there is overdispersion, and

66
00:04:18,704 --> 00:04:24,419
if they are much lower than one,
it means that there is underdispersion.

67
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:25,483
And what is that?

68
00:04:25,483 --> 00:04:28,239
Well, underdispersion is kind of rare, but

69
00:04:28,239 --> 00:04:33,326
overdispersion may happens in Poisson when
they variance is larger than the mean.

70
00:04:33,326 --> 00:04:36,931
Which is one assumption of
the distribution of the model.

71
00:04:36,931 --> 00:04:41,421
So, in this situation there are things
that can be done like scaling it, or

72
00:04:41,421 --> 00:04:44,008
using a negative binomial distribution.

73
00:04:44,008 --> 00:04:48,439
But this is too much information, and
we're not going into the details,

74
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:53,259
just mention it here so
it will bring and build for the future.

75
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:57,599
So, for now we are really want to do
is to focus on our parameter estimates.

76
00:04:57,599 --> 00:05:01,712
And our parameter table is similar to
before with betas, but now there is

77
00:05:01,712 --> 00:05:06,511
something called scale, which is where you
can fix the problem of overdispersion.

78
00:05:06,511 --> 00:05:10,592
But as mentioned before, we are not
going to do anything about it yet.

79
00:05:10,592 --> 00:05:15,319
And this is fixed to one by default,
so you can ignore it for now.

80
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:18,926
However, if you look at your data for
the variable physical and

81
00:05:18,926 --> 00:05:21,528
you exponentiate the data you get 0.53.

82
00:05:21,528 --> 00:05:26,424
Which is exactly the same incidence rate
ratio that we calculated manually before.

83
00:05:26,424 --> 00:05:28,491
Just in case you didn't believe me,

84
00:05:28,491 --> 00:05:33,679
that way we could get incidence
rate ratios from Poisson models.

85
00:05:33,679 --> 00:05:37,104
Now, of course, you're not going to
be exponentiating your data manually.

86
00:05:37,104 --> 00:05:40,305
Also mostly, because you don't want
to calculate the confidencetiate

87
00:05:40,305 --> 00:05:43,139
intervals manually,
which could be a thing.

88
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:46,808
So we can use an estimate
statement to calculate that.

89
00:05:46,808 --> 00:05:52,139
Note that we are using not
physically active as the reference.

90
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:54,109
If you invert them -1 1,

91
00:05:54,109 --> 00:05:58,573
then you can change the reference
in the estimate statement.

92
00:05:58,573 --> 00:06:03,082
Now, being physically active will
be the reference, and therefore,

93
00:06:03,082 --> 00:06:06,026
the incidence reate ratio we get is 1.89.

94
00:06:06,026 --> 00:06:10,304
Which should be interpreted as
the rate of coronary heart disease is

95
00:06:10,304 --> 00:06:13,981
1.89 times higher among
people not physically active

96
00:06:13,981 --> 00:06:17,759
compared to people who
are physically active.

97
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,164
Don't worry if you don't
understand what that -1 1 means,

98
00:06:21,164 --> 00:06:23,101
because I have not explaining yet.

99
00:06:23,101 --> 00:06:26,722
So, I'll go back to that when
we see the log-binomial models.

100
00:06:26,722 --> 00:06:31,549
For now, just a little faith, use the code
as it is, and you will see later.

101
00:06:31,549 --> 00:06:33,512
And finally, the rest is the same.

102
00:06:33,512 --> 00:06:35,148
Adjusting for confounding or

103
00:06:35,148 --> 00:06:39,796
doing statistical interactions will be the
same as we did with the previous models.

104
00:06:39,796 --> 00:06:43,268
As an example, let's look here
at what happens if we adjust for

105
00:06:43,268 --> 00:06:47,149
occupation, which could be
a potential confounder.

106
00:06:47,149 --> 00:06:50,300
The strategy will be the same,
compare their model with and

107
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,694
without the confounder.

108
00:06:51,694 --> 00:06:55,474
And as you can see here, the better for
physical does not really change

109
00:06:55,474 --> 00:06:59,869
appreciably, so we will probably
adjust for job in the end.

110
00:06:59,869 --> 00:07:04,373
So, in summary, in this video, we use
PROC GENMOD to run Poisson regression.

111
00:07:04,373 --> 00:07:09,120
In the next video,
we will move into log-binomial regression.
