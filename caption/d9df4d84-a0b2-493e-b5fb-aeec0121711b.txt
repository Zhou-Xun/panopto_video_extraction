1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
amondul: There we go.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,069
amondul: alright.

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:12,030
amondul: So today, sorry any last questions before we continue I don't want to cut anybody off.

4
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:23,490
amondul: i'm going to bring up chat so I can see any questions you have a chat but again feel free to unmute and just ask if you need to.

5
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,540
amondul: Alright, so today we're gonna be talking about measuring disease.

6
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:29,430
amondul: So.

7
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:37,470
amondul: Did you guys manage and monitor the chat for me, I can find a way to put it up it's not annoying alright so.

8
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:55,140
amondul: Alright, so measuring disease we weren't we want to quantify how much disease there is, and you have to you always have to define this by some sort of place right so maybe in Ann arbor Michigan or in the US, etc.

9
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:05,550
amondul: heart disease and stroke, the first and third leading causes of death for men and women are among the most widespread Catholic health problems facing our nation today, yet they are also among the most preventable.

10
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:16,860
amondul: And that's from the CDC right, so they define which diseases they're talking about they define how common they are you know, as in the leading how much like where they fall in terms of the leading causes of death.

11
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:25,500
amondul: And they're talking about us we're also interested in morbidity right so there's mortality and morbidity.

12
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:38,670
amondul: And so we're going to start off talking about measuring disease with prevalent prevalent an incidence we're going to talk about these two concepts so prevalence.

13
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:43,110
amondul: Is the number of cases of the disease in the population at a specified time.

14
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:57,690
amondul: divided by the number of people in the population at that time, so they can these can be new cases or old cases of just the number of cases at any one time in the population Okay, we often express these things per 1000 or 100,000 people.

15
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:03,330
amondul: Because otherwise the number would be like some crazy tiny.

16
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:11,220
amondul: fraction right, so you can express it per 1000 or hundred thousand whatever kind of makes it a reasonable looking number.

17
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:29,400
amondul: When we talk about problems we can have a period prevalence or a point prevalence right, so the period prevalence will be the proportion of people who have the condition at any time over a specified time period, so you might say, in the year 2013, for example, or in some time frame.

18
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:35,790
amondul: The point prevalence is the proportion of people who have the condition at a given moment in time they've been given point in time.

19
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,880
amondul: We often use period prevalence because.

20
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:52,710
amondul: Unless you're talking about a situation, for example, like our outbreak yesterday, where you're dealing with sort of a smaller population of people, it might be really difficult to define exactly who has something at any given moment or any any given day, for example.

21
00:02:55,230 --> 00:03:08,130
amondul: So here we go this is data from purpose, we are fss I say purpose it's not a real word so that's how I pronounce it i'm going to indoctrinate those of you who haven't heard it before you're all going to say purpose now.

22
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,410
amondul: How many people have heard of purpose data or used it in the past.

23
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:15,690
amondul: Okay, great.

24
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:28,710
amondul: So for those who aren't as familiar, this is a nationally representative data set, it is a phone survey that was conducted in every state, and they do I think about 100,000 people every year now.

25
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:33,810
amondul: And they interviewed them over the phone and one of the you know they asked a lot of different questions about.

26
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,180
amondul: Preventive behaviors.

27
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:44,970
amondul: You know diseases, all kinds of stuff and one of the things that they asked about is Have you had your cholesterol checked in the past five years, and so we've got this.

28
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:51,630
amondul: heat map of the US based on that question So what do you guys think is this a point prevalence or a period prevalence.

29
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,180
Geehan Suleyman: Serious problems.

30
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:01,830
amondul: Absolutely it's a period prevalence right it's over this five year period, how many people have their cholesterol checked.

31
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,780
amondul: What is happening, where we going.

32
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:21,450
amondul: Okay, here we have the European Surveillance of Antimicrobial Consumption point prevalence survey of antibacterial use in 20 European hospitals in 2006.

33
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:34,050
amondul: So this is during 2006 they took some sort of point prevalence of antibacterial use in each of these different hospitals, this is the hospital number, which is some pretend things so that you don't know exactly which hospital you're talking about.

34
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,710
amondul: And you can see, this is the point prevalence mean shown there.

35
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,820
amondul: So if these are our data.

36
00:04:46,110 --> 00:05:10,080
amondul: And the URL is like the duration of an illness right, so we take say we have a total of 100 people and then these seven people were ill at some point between January 1 and December 31 2009 So what is the point prevalence of this disease on December 31 2009 How would you calculate that.

37
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:26,010
amondul: So you got 123 people who are sick, at that moment right three divided by how many total people do we have.

38
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,900
amondul: No, we have a total of 100 we're just showing you the line.

39
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:31,230
With.

40
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:38,490
amondul: The three over 100 is the point prevalence of December 31 2009.

41
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:44,100
amondul: So now Can somebody else tell me what the period prevalence is for the entirety of 2009.

42
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:50,910
amondul: This is all of the people who work for a second any point during 2009 right.

43
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,010
Clifton Addison: That would be.

44
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,590
Clifton Addison: Seven divided boundaries.

45
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:08,520
amondul: That is correct, seven divided by 100 i'm not going to go ahead and draw that out, but you can see we've got 1234567 people that were sick during 2009 so the point prevalence of seven for one of it okay.

46
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:16,740
amondul: Okay, no I don't want to do that.

47
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:32,010
amondul: Alright, so we talked about prevalence and now we're going to talk about incidence so you can think of incidents as dealing with the transition from health to disease Okay, it is new cases, people who are newly diseased.

48
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:38,970
amondul: So incidents, as the number of new cases of the disease occurring in the population, during a specific period of time.

49
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:49,680
amondul: Over the number of people at risk of developing the disease during that period of time Okay, so that is an important distinction, the people here have to be at risk of developing the disease.

50
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,110
amondul: And again, we will usually express this per some number of people.

51
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:11,250
amondul: Alright, so a simple example suppose there are 2000 people and rest during the year and 20 develop the disease over that period okay so we've got therefore our incidents would be calculated how.

52
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,360
Clifton Addison: 20 divided by 2000.

53
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:20,160
amondul: exactly right, and then you might multiply that by 1000 to get a reasonable looking number right.

54
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,320
Yes, okay.

55
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:33,120
amondul: Oh key points, for instance we're talking about new cases it has to be during a defined period of time and individuals in the denominator must have the potential to be in the numerator.

56
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:43,740
amondul: That seems like a really simple thing, but a really good example of where we actually do this kind of poorly is for uterine cancer.

57
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:55,320
amondul: One of the most common surgeries that has conducted in older women is hysterectomies right and so when we are getting our cancer statistics we are taking the number of.

58
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:59,400
amondul: Women who get uterine cancer divided by the population in the US right.

59
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:07,380
amondul: that's our you know, during a year period, we may take the number of new cases divided by the women in the US during you know, in a particular age group, for example.

60
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:14,520
amondul: trouble is a lot of those women have had a hysterectomy and we don't if we're just doing kind of population level statistics we don't actually know.

61
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:26,580
amondul: How many women that is and so they've done some statistic some math basically to try to assume what proportion of women might have had a hysterectomy and therefore what that has corrupted population should be.

62
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:35,370
amondul: But that's an example where we're getting kind of too low, of a number for the incidence of uterine cancer, because we're, including women in the town data we're not actually at risk of disease.

63
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:43,500
amondul: Alright, so we really have two types of incidents measures we have cumulative incidents and the incidence rate.

64
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:47,790
amondul: So, just a quick math review.

65
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:52,560
amondul: let's talk about the difference between ratios proportions and rates.

66
00:08:54,510 --> 00:09:01,080
amondul: Okay, so for ratio you divide one quantity by another and there's no specified relationship between the numerator and denominator.

67
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:06,990
amondul: right for an example, might be the number of hospital beds per 10,000 people right it's not like.

68
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:23,850
amondul: hospital beds are a subset of people right it's just two completely different numbers that you're creating a ratio of right proportion, however, is where the numerator is also in the denominator right, so this might be the number of women aged 2224 per 10,000 people.

69
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:27,420
amondul: prevalence is a proportion.

70
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:41,160
amondul: rate is the relative magnitude of change as a function over time Okay, so this is going to take into account time, so the number of deaths divided by the number of live in a certain timeframe okay.

71
00:09:42,570 --> 00:10:02,310
amondul: So let's talk about cumulative incidents, this is the number of new cases divided by the total population risk during a year Okay, so if you have 1000 people followed for a year 12345 of them get your disease that's five per 1000 per year.

72
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:13,230
amondul: This is the probability or risk of developing disease over a given period okay all 1000 people were observed over one year and have these five developed the disease.

73
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:26,850
amondul: Okay, every estimate of cumulative incidents must refer to a specific time period, you cannot give a cumulative incidence without saying what time period, you were referring to.

74
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:37,920
amondul: So here's an example of cumulative incidents in a screening of 1000 men 100 were found initially to have coronary heart disease okay.

75
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:53,490
amondul: During the 10 year period, another during a 10 year period, another 200 men developed CD so if we're talking about the cumulative incidence of CBD over this 10 year period, tell me how I would begin.

76
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:56,370
amondul: to calculate that.

77
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,160
amondul: What should go in my numerator.

78
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:03,930
amondul: How many.

79
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:06,870
Nolaundron Harris: well.

80
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,000
amondul: nope.

81
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:10,650
Nolaundron Harris: Sorry.

82
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,150
amondul: Yes, i've been new.

83
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,440
amondul: So when you start.

84
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:18,840
amondul: I was in people 101 hundred of them already had your disease, so they are not new cases.

85
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:33,840
amondul: Time that you started following them until the time that you ended this 10 year period of follow up 200 people 200 new cases developed so it's 200 new cases divided by the population at risk, what is your population at risk.

86
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:37,830
amondul: sega.

87
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:38,490
one.

88
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:44,760
amondul: Are all 1000 of these men at risk of developing PhD oh.

89
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:47,640
Divya Manohar: Yes, right.

90
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,940
amondul: hundred already had it so how many are at risk.

91
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:51,600
Divya Manohar: of developing.

92
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:56,130
amondul: very, very sneaky.

93
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,180
Yes.

94
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,010
amondul: Okay.

95
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:01,350
amondul: So if we calculate that out.

96
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,500
amondul: What do we get 200 divided by 900.

97
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:13,620
amondul: I didn't bring my fancy fancy calculator like I told you guys to so i'm breaking my own rule and using my calculator on my phone, but I paid.

98
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,790
amondul: 200 divided by 900 gives you a point to to.

99
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:18,900
Brenda Campbell: To to.

100
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:23,340
amondul: multiply that by 1000 say so we have 222.

101
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:32,010
amondul: per 1002 22 per 10 years right.

102
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:35,250
amondul: Good.

103
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,090
amondul: So can anybody interpret that for me.

104
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:55,860
Divya Manohar: I have one question professor, so it says hundred were initially found to have cdb coronary vascular disease and during the 10 year period, another 200 developed so that totals to about 300 right.

105
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:09,180
amondul: But these are not new cases you screen 1000 people 100 had your disease, so they are not new cases those are prevalent cases, you want to calculate cumulative incidents over a 10 year period.

106
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:14,790
amondul: Okay, so incidents is new cases, so we get rid of those those are prevalent cases.

107
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:25,770
amondul: So we have 900 minute risk that we're following for 10 years and over that 10 year period 200 of those 900 developed cardiovascular disease does that make sense.

108
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,450
Divya Manohar: Okay yeah Thank you.

109
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:31,950
amondul: No problem, so can anyone want to take a stab at interpreting this.

110
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,590
Joshua Tucker: vector model I I can yeah.

111
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:35,040
amondul: Go for it.

112
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:41,250
Joshua Tucker: The risk for CBD CBD.

113
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:49,620
Joshua Tucker: What it was whatever 200 divided by 900 is.

114
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:54,270
Joshua Tucker: Over the course of a 10 year period of follow up okay.

115
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:57,420
amondul: You might also see something about in in men right.

116
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:03,240
amondul: Because you have similar population here of men that might be another another thing to add right that's true okay.

117
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:12,480
amondul: So I will say that if you go to the homepage of the canvas site, there is a little link all the way at the bottom after all of the dates that says general resources.

118
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:27,270
amondul: One of the things in there is an interpretation sheet and it gives you examples of how to interpret all of these measures that we're going to calculate and then other you know things that are yet to come as well, so that is a good thing to have in your back pocket okay.

119
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,910
Brenda Campbell: Okay, what did you say that.

120
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:33,480
amondul: I can show you real quick i'm going to go ahead and.

121
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:36,570
amondul: I will share.

122
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,230
amondul: This this.

123
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:43,140
amondul: So if you go to the homepage.

124
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,370
amondul: All the way bottom here if you go to general resources okay.

125
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:51,480
amondul: And then you get interpretation sheet one, for example.

126
00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:05,250
amondul: Right, this will show you kind of an example of how to do this for food specific tax rates point prevalence period prevalence cumulative incidence right, so this is a really good resource to have.

127
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:06,810
amondul: Okay.

128
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,140
amondul: Does that help.

129
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,240
Yes, okay.

130
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,530
amondul: renouncing really weird.

131
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,900
amondul: was for like I move it and it moves incredibly.

132
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:35,250
amondul: Okay kids.

133
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:44,580
amondul: All right, that's whatever all right, I fixed it I guess Okay, so does everybody feel good about this example of cumulative incidence.

134
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:47,970
amondul: Okay.

135
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:53,640
amondul: So here is an example of commonly used cumulative incidence.

136
00:15:54,690 --> 00:16:13,620
amondul: And attack rate we talked about this yesterday, we talked about the overall attack rate and the food specific attack rates, this should make you angry because cumulative instance is not actually a rate right cumulative incidence is a proportion to the number of cases per number of people.

137
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:15,960
amondul: So.

138
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:27,240
amondul: This is sort of a misnomer people will use this do this, a lot they'll use the word rate or something when they actually mean a risk or a cumulative incidence so just be a little bit savvy about that okay.

139
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:34,560
amondul: This is a proportion that right it's the number of new cases of an infectious disease occurring in the population at risk over the epidemic period.

140
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:39,300
amondul: here's another example of an attack right, this was published in a paper in 2013.

141
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:49,680
amondul: This is looking at a severe flooding in Copenhagen consumers to overflow before the ironman triathlon which included an ocean water swim followed by a bike and run.

142
00:16:50,130 --> 00:17:07,410
amondul: And several athletes, separate from diarrhea and abdominal pains, and so you can see you've got the attack rate for all kinds of things, the highest is for swallowing water during the swim, so I think this goes on the list as reason number like 593 why I will not be doing an iron man.

143
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:17,460
amondul: All right now let's talk about the incidence rate so.

144
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:26,220
amondul: In order to discuss the incidence rate, we need to first talk about person time so incidence rate is calculated as.

145
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:32,790
amondul: The number of new cases divided by the total person time contributed by the people, followed okay.

146
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:47,130
amondul: So this is going to not a probability it's going to capture the speed or the rate at which events are occurring Okay, it allows for incomplete lot follow up and losses due to deaths and people who developed the disease are no longer at risk.

147
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:54,570
amondul: Okay, so this is, these are people getting the disease, these are losses to follow up data migration or death so let's.

148
00:17:55,860 --> 00:18:03,330
amondul: Go on, so again we're going to calculate this as the number of events divided by the number of person years which you can count individually for each person, if you have that data.

149
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:19,950
amondul: For large population data, you may need to estimate the person years as the average population size during the duration during the time that you're talking about maybe multiplied by the duration of the study you're going to see examples of this in the exercise that we do today.

150
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:26,940
amondul: Okay, so this is an example of calculating person time.

151
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:49,770
amondul: Directly right not estimating Okay, so if you have 1-234-567-8910 people in this dataset Okay, and they are followed for eight Year move this yes, I can.

152
00:18:50,400 --> 00:19:10,200
amondul: These people are followed for a year, all right, they are followed for me move this down here for now right so you've got 10 people each of these horizontal lines refers to a person that are followed from January 1 first 2000 to December 31 2000 okay so person one.

153
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:16,980
amondul: let's talk first about how many cases we have, how would we get our numerator here.

154
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:23,070
Geehan Suleyman: So number of people who have disease.

155
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:24,600
Divya Manohar: Disease do.

156
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:41,370
amondul: That is to correct now we have to calculate the person time at risk for disease, so this person, these people are easy right how much time did each of them contribute how much person time.

157
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:45,060
Divya Manohar: One year yes.

158
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:54,840
amondul: So that's 1234567 person years right and then let's add up for the other two people so let's say this person is like Point two five of a year.

159
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:11,940
amondul: Okay let's see this person's like Point seven five a year, maybe this person's like I don't know point three okay so, then you would add this up seven plus point two five.

160
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:13,830
Plus.

161
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,050
amondul: Point seven five.

162
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:28,050
amondul: plus point three that's really ugly i'm very sorry, so if you do that, you end up with 8.3 person years in your denominator correct.

163
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:38,790
amondul: So what you end up with is two divided by 8.3 which gives you point to four, and if you multiply that by like.

164
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:43,980
amondul: 1000 is 241.

165
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:48,210
amondul: Her 1000 person hears.

166
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:53,130
amondul: Okay, does that make sense to everybody.

167
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:57,990
amondul: How you calculate how you count up person time.

168
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:07,860
amondul: These people stopped contributing person time when they got the disease, because they are no longer at risk and person time is the time at risk for disease.

169
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:09,600
amondul: yeah.

170
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,800
Brenda Campbell: So, so the 2.5.

171
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:24,090
amondul: And 3.5 2.2 5.3 so this person was only followed until this point i'm estimating that that's Point two five of a year.

172
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:26,700
amondul: A quarter of a year.

173
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:33,840
amondul: i'm estimating that this person was followed for like three quarters of a year right.

174
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:38,250
amondul: i'm estimating this person was followed for a third of the year.

175
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:40,290
ish.

176
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:49,320
amondul: And you would be able to if you had exact dates that these people in your data set got disease, you would be able to count that exactly right.

177
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:54,780
amondul: Does that make sense.

178
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:03,570
amondul: So Jimmy says in some research studies aren't those people lost a follow up or def just thrown out of the data set.

179
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:09,840
amondul: They shouldn't be if you're doing it accurately right, so I guess in some they do.

180
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:19,680
amondul: People who are lost to follow up perhaps you can't get the outcome on them if they're truly lost to follow up and you don't know when they were lost.

181
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:29,850
amondul: You don't have the outcome but usually they're not they're not actually thrown out so, for example in my work if we're doing a prospective cohort study of cancer.

182
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:42,180
amondul: and your say in interviewing these people every year sending in the questionnaire every two years and then say 2000 the answer the questionnaire and then in 2002 they just stopped talking to you and you don't know what happens then.

183
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,990
amondul: You would stop counting their person time in the year 2000.

184
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:58,230
amondul: Right you don't know after that point anything about whether or not they got the disease, so you can't continue to count them as being at risk because you don't know.

185
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:04,740
amondul: So they don't count to the numerator and they stopped counting to the denominator at the point at which you stop following them.

186
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:16,470
amondul: Now, if you if you truly don't know anything about them and you're just doing a cumulative incidence you might get rid of them.

187
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:26,970
amondul: This is why incidence rates are a little bit better because you can count that time up until the point at which you lose them.

188
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:29,730
amondul: Okay.

189
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:41,190
amondul: Alright, so person time is a way to measure the amount of time all individuals in the study spend at risk.

190
00:23:41,790 --> 00:24:01,440
amondul: The denominator for an incidence rate incorporates both the number of people and the time that they spend at risk, it can be expressed as person years person months person weeks person days right it kind of depends on the question you're asking and what the right time metric is so.

191
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:03,990
amondul: let's think about.

192
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:10,830
amondul: Breast cancer in the general population if you're interested in incidence of breast cancer.

193
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:22,080
amondul: What person time unit, do you think you're going to use you're going to follow these people over some period of time to figure out how many breast cancers you're going to get what do you think years months.

194
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:23,370
Geehan Suleyman: and years.

195
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:35,640
amondul: You probably probably years yeah because this is a, this is a disease that takes a long time to develop you're going to follow people, probably for years and have cases accumulate during that time.

196
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,230
amondul: How about something like myocardial infarction in the general population.

197
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:49,170
Geehan Suleyman: I mean, I can be money, it could be days months years it just depends.

198
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:54,090
amondul: I think it's probably going to be more like yours, maybe months.

199
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,440
Brenda Campbell: yeah you.

200
00:24:55,500 --> 00:25:06,480
amondul: that's a longer term kind of thing right as opposed to if you're looking down here at you know incidence of diarrhea and a group of malnourished children or death in lung cancer cases.

201
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:22,500
amondul: That might be more like a month kind of thing right, thankfully, now we have screening tools for lung cancer, people are living longer, with it, but you know it's not a cancer that people survive with for a long time generally.

202
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:36,570
amondul: And diarrhea is pretty common and malnourished children, so you might be following them for a period of months to get a reasonable number of cases, so when you're doing your incidence rates, you might be expressing this in person months right.

203
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:47,610
amondul: influenza in the general population or recovery and children with acute diarrhea you know here, you might be talking about days right weeks days.

204
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:57,960
amondul: So you know the the time scale that you're talking about kind of depends on the disease that you're studying right that makes sense to everybody, yes.

205
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:02,220
amondul: alright.

206
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:06,450
amondul: So now let's talk about approximating person time.

207
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:08,490
amondul: So.

208
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,740
amondul: let's say.

209
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:12,450
amondul: That.

210
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:20,280
amondul: You don't really know what your population is at the beginning, or at the end of this year, but you do know what the population is on July 1.

211
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,940
amondul: So if you are going to.

212
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,370
amondul: This is that same.

213
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:32,040
amondul: This is the same thing right we've got the same 10 people to got the disease right.

214
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:42,420
amondul: So let's use a midpoint approximation right, so if we were to use a midpoint approximation, how many people are in our population at the midpoint.

215
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:57,660
amondul: Why 123456789 right, we have one extra line here sorry we've got 11 people now not exactly tough so we've got nine people.

216
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:00,780
amondul: That can't buy it right what.

217
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:03,420
amondul: 6789.

218
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:08,010
amondul: yeah Okay, so what you would do to use your.

219
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:16,590
amondul: Your midpoint approximation is you would take your two people who died over the year divided by.

220
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:25,590
amondul: To get your person years she would say Okay, we got nine people at the midpoint we're going to assume that and we're going to multiply that by one year right.

221
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,900
amondul: Okay equals nine person years.

222
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:37,410
amondul: So we've got two per nine person years for our approximation.

223
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:42,060
amondul: Okay, so that is using.

224
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:43,710
amondul: The midpoint.

225
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:46,710
amondul: Okay.

226
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,010
amondul: We can also.

227
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,700
amondul: Do the average right.

228
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:59,640
amondul: Again, our numerator is to how many people do we have at the beginning.

229
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:01,920
Brenda Campbell: 11.

230
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,900
amondul: levin okay.

231
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,050
amondul: How about at the end.

232
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:09,750
amondul: date.

233
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,300
amondul: Okay, this is going to be.

234
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:18,630
amondul: divided by two right.

235
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:22,650
amondul: Time is one year.

236
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:25,290
amondul: So that's going to give us what.

237
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:31,170
amondul: 19 divided by two.

238
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,740
amondul: 9.5 person years.

239
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:41,760
amondul: Right.

240
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:49,620
amondul: So you can see that they're both you know pretty similar and pretty similar to the direct calculation, if you actually counts up the person time.

241
00:28:51,300 --> 00:29:04,800
amondul: What you are assuming though keep in mind, you are assuming using these approximations that events and losses to follow up are occurring uniformly over the following period right if all of the events happened at the beginning.

242
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:20,550
amondul: This might not be as good of an approximation of the person time the denominator right because you're kind of assuming that these people who are dropping out are sort of dropping out uniformly true out this year, does that make sense.

243
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:37,170
amondul: But you often will have to do that, like if you're using census data or you know some sort of like that's where we get population estimates for like the US population or a State population right we get it usually from the census, and we don't know.

244
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:43,500
amondul: How many people move out of an area or come into an area or you know and we're going to see that in the.

245
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:57,630
amondul: In the exercise today right you just kind of have these points of time, would you count the number of people, and so you have to use those different points in time at which you counted say on January 1 and understand the 31st to make some approximation.

246
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:00,720
amondul: Okay.

247
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:07,560
amondul: alright.

248
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:09,210
amondul: So.

249
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:18,720
amondul: Here is an example, we are looking at annual age adjusted cancer incidence rates among men and women for selected cancers in the US.

250
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:26,700
amondul: Between 1975 and 2003 So these are rates okay they're per.

251
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:38,040
amondul: hundred thousand population, the reason that they are rates is that they're per year okay so 100,000 population is 100,000 person years when you're talking about for one year okay.

252
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:48,870
amondul: So here we go we've got all of these different cancers in men and women, the age adjusted piece we're going to talk about I think in more detail tomorrow Is that correct.

253
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:54,420
amondul: I think tomorrow we're talking about age adjustments so you'll learn how to do that, but essentially it's, taking into account that.

254
00:30:55,260 --> 00:31:00,060
amondul: An older population is going to have more cancers in it right so looking at just the number.

255
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:07,890
amondul: per hundred thousand people probably doesn't help if you're comparing an older population to a younger population and population age structures do change over time.

256
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:14,970
amondul: So normalizing to age allows you to compare over time and it's like comparing apples to apples, rather than apples to oranges okay.

257
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:18,420
amondul: So this is an example of incidence rates.

258
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:21,420
amondul: that are used very commonly.

259
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:22,950
Okay.

260
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:30,030
amondul: So here's our summary table for incidents we've got cumulative incidents and the incidence rate.

261
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:37,170
amondul: cumulative incidence measures, the risk or probability of developing disease over a specified period of time.

262
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:51,000
amondul: Whereas the incidence rate takes into account the speed at which the disease occurs over a specified period of time, both of them use new cases for the numerator numerator because these are both incidents measures right, so they will always use new cases.

263
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:55,890
amondul: For cumulative instance the denominator is the number of people at risk.

264
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,190
amondul: Whereas incidence rate uses person time.

265
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:02,190
Brenda Campbell: I know units.

266
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:06,330
amondul: For the ci, but there is person time as your unit for incidence rate the range here is.

267
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:15,180
amondul: from zero to one or zero to 100%, whereas it can go to infinity for an incidence rate, this is the proportion, while this is a true date that makes sense.

268
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:20,340
Okay.

269
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:22,260
amondul: So.

270
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:26,070
amondul: We talked about proportions and we talked about true rates.

271
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:34,470
amondul: So let's talk now a little bit about the connection between incidents and prevalence we talked about prevalence at the beginning, so that's all of the cases.

272
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:42,240
amondul: In the in the population at a given time whether they're new or not incidences about the transition from not being diseased to being diseased.

273
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:49,200
amondul: So this is just another sort of table comparing all of these.

274
00:32:51,150 --> 00:33:01,200
amondul: The interpretation really of prevalence is looking at disease burden and you might really want to use it for resource planning right, so you might think, why would you why would you want to look at the prevalence of the disease.

275
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:12,630
amondul: Rather than the risk, you know we kind of use the incidence rate of the cumulative incentives to understand kind of causes, prevention and treatment of disease, maybe.

276
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:22,200
amondul: But the prevalence of I really want to know resource planning right so like doesn't kind of matter if it's a new case or an old case if you've got a case of something that person is going to need.

277
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:29,310
amondul: A hospital bed they're going to need medicine they're going to need a doctor right, so if you're planning for resources prevalent cases matter.

278
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:45,330
amondul: prevalence it depends, both on the incidence of disease and on the duration of disease, so this isn't important calculation, you can approximate prevalence by multiplying incidents time duration times duration.

279
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:58,350
amondul: Okay, and duration is a function of both survival and perhaps treatment you're kind of making the the assumption here that this is under steady state conditions and when prevalence is relatively low.

280
00:33:59,610 --> 00:33:59,850
amondul: Okay.

281
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:09,180
amondul: So we can illustrate this with like a little picture here right, so you have a jar full of beans each Bead is.

282
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:18,270
amondul: A case of your disease right, so your prevalence is how many beds are in your jar right how many cases there are.

283
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:23,730
amondul: Incidents adds new beans to your jar these are new cases that are coming in.

284
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:25,710
amondul: So.

285
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:40,650
amondul: You can also lose beans, people will die or be cured of their disease right, so this is about duration right if the duration is forever you always have the disease, the only way you leave the bottle is by dying right.

286
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:52,650
amondul: So your prevalence is is a function of incidents and duration right if people are coming in faster than people are going out your prevalence will increase.

287
00:34:53,790 --> 00:35:00,930
amondul: If people are not coming in very much lots of people are getting cured or dying then your problems will decrease does that make sense to everybody.

288
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,110
amondul: All right.

289
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:13,140
amondul: So look at this athlete prevalence increase from 2001 to 2010 and is now at its highest level.

290
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:18,270
amondul: Are we scared are we worried is this bad.

291
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,090
amondul: My God we have so much as.

292
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,280
Geehan Suleyman: It could be.

293
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,370
Geehan Suleyman: that people are smiling.

294
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:40,110
amondul: yeah it could be we've got better treatments right so maybe the same number of people are continuing to get asthma between.

295
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:50,400
amondul: But more of them are surviving and doing better because of better treatments, and so our prevalence is increasing.

296
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:58,560
amondul: Right, it could also be that our treatments are the same people are dying of asthma, at the same rate.

297
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:04,200
amondul: But more people are getting it right so prevalent doesn't really tell us anything about whether new cases are happening every time.

298
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:13,200
amondul: But this would tell us something about how many how much resources, how many public health resources we need in order to deal with asthma in our population right.

299
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:23,850
amondul: prevalence of myocardial infarction by age and sex, this is data from inhales between 2000 17,010.

300
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,930
amondul: What do you guys think of this.

301
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,180
amondul: Nana just goes up.

302
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:35,820
yeah.

303
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,550
Brenda Campbell: great deal and at.

304
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:49,320
amondul: keep in mind, though this is prevalence right, so this is anybody this doesn't mean that they all had it in their 80s you're adding right every time you've got these people in their 20s they're also.

305
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:53,610
amondul: You know, then, if you were to interview these same people in their 20s in their 40s they would be in here.

306
00:36:54,870 --> 00:37:07,440
amondul: Does that make sense, because you're just if ever having had one its prevalence yes, so this is telling you something about how many people in their 80s you're going to need to care, perhaps.

307
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:21,630
amondul: But it's not telling you anything about instance now, of course, we know incidence of EMI does increase with age right so it's, it is also that we know that that's part part of there's lots more beach coming into our jar in the older age groups right.

308
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:32,400
amondul: But it's also good right, because we know there's more beads coming in, but this is still high, so that means they're not all dying right so that's that's useful to know as well.

309
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:38,880
Nolaundron Harris: That mean that is just happened is more like age related or like late diagnosis.

310
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:47,700
amondul: Or to say from the state, because these are just problems data, this is telling you how many people in the age 80 plus group have had an eye right.

311
00:37:49,290 --> 00:38:00,900
amondul: And we can speculate about what that means in terms of incidents or duration or death, but you would really have to do studies, where you looked at the incidence rate of the mortality or any of that to really figure that out does that make sense.

312
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:09,960
amondul: To understand whether how you get this prevalence if it's by more people coming into the JAR fewer people leaving the JAR you have to do, different studies measure different things.

313
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:20,040
amondul: This is just telling you how many people in the JAR and we're speculating about how they are out there right but we this data doesn't tell us that for sure.

314
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:22,140
amondul: That help.

315
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:25,890
Brenda Campbell: And also shows that men are more at risk.

316
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:27,330
Yes.

317
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:36,510
amondul: Definitely, there are definitely more men now, it could not tell me how else you could get to fewer prevalent women.

318
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:40,620
amondul: You can have more men going into the JAR.

319
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:53,460
amondul: But fewer of them dying right, it could be, what if they What if men and women have the same risk of an eye, but when women die more from it.

320
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:55,980
amondul: Your prevalence would be lower.

321
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:02,850
Nolaundron Harris: So a question came up like this, like what can you assume.

322
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:11,070
Nolaundron Harris: chances are we should probably say we can't really assume anything because there's not there's not enough information.

323
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:18,330
amondul: that's right prevalence tells you something about what you need for resource planning and how like how big of a public health problem, do we have.

324
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:25,920
amondul: How many people are living with this disease, which is useful for a certain point of view, but you don't want to probably don't want to calculate prevalence if you want to understand.

325
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:32,850
amondul: How many new cases are happening what the risk is like you would want to calculate it incidence rate or cumulative incidents for that right.

326
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:38,370
amondul: Okay, because I was just responding to I think it was Brenda if i'm not mistaken.

327
00:39:38,850 --> 00:39:39,570
amondul: Correct me if i'm wrong.

328
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:40,770
amondul: As you said that.

329
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:53,910
amondul: You know men are more at risk, I don't think we can necessarily assume that from this picture, it could we could have a higher prevalence of men with heart disease or with myocardial infarction.

330
00:39:55,110 --> 00:40:07,740
amondul: If because they were more at risk, you could have this picture, because more men are coming into the JAR you could also have this picture, because the same number of men and women are coming into the JAR but more women are dying more men, women are leaving the JAR right.

331
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:13,710
Geehan Suleyman: And men are more likely to be diagnosed and women are one.

332
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:15,300
Geehan Suleyman: yeah so.

333
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:19,020
amondul: You could be missing cases in women.

334
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:24,930
amondul: So they could truly have fewer and eyes or you could be diagnosing fewer of them.

335
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:32,490
amondul: So all of those are hypotheses that are valid and you could check by looking at incidence right.

336
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,630
Clifton Addison: So how can you get against.

337
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:46,560
Clifton Addison: misinterpreting the data we can i'm pretty sure some people will use it use it for one of them.

338
00:40:48,240 --> 00:41:01,740
amondul: Take this class and you learn what prevalence tells you and what it doesn't tell you right you learn that you know prevalence is a is a function of both incidents and duration of disease right so prevalence is useful for some things right, you can you can learn.

339
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:17,640
amondul: You know it's useful for research planning and understanding the overall disease burden it's not useful for understanding incidence right, it does not tell you how many new cases, you have you can get a high prevalence because you have a lot of new cases or because you have few deaths.

340
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:21,450
amondul: Right, you can get this number a few different ways.

341
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:32,070
amondul: So I think just understanding what prevalence beans and being cognizant of what statistics you're looking at in a picture are really important right.

342
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:40,680
Brenda Campbell: Right, because if you present this data and that's what they looked at, is what is being shown right now.

343
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,600
Brenda Campbell: Oh, they don't have to go.

344
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:55,020
amondul: But it says prevalence so that's why being calibrated to what each of these you know what these measures of disease mean and what they're actually telling you is very important.

345
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,950
amondul: Making sure that you're looking carefully at what's being presented.

346
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:06,030
Clifton Addison: Here, well, I think it's particularly important with the issue we face now with the coffin.

347
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:06,810
amondul: Because I think.

348
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:20,370
Clifton Addison: A lot of the skepticism that i've heard is the fact that some people just didn't believe these numbers or accurately represent and what's the true indication of what's going on in the Community.

349
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:23,760
Clifton Addison: So we had these big doubts.

350
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:27,840
Clifton Addison: Because of the uncertainty as to what was really accurate.

351
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:41,040
amondul: yeah I was, I was talking to my mom about this class and she's like well, I think I should take that class because I go to look at these coven statistics and I don't understand what half of the mean and why some of them are different than others and i'm like yeah I guess.

352
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:44,130
amondul: Like I think in today's day and age we should all have a class like that.

353
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:48,660
amondul: So you know, maybe my mom will join us later.

354
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,240
amondul: All right.

355
00:42:53,520 --> 00:43:09,870
amondul: Okay, so let's talk about incidents prevalence of HIV infection so HIV incidence then incidents has remained stable of we're all in recent years, at about 50,000 new HIV infections per year prevalence is 1.1 or so million people age 13 years and older, who are living with HIV infection.

356
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:18,720
amondul: And over time, I imagine, this prevalence is increasing right because we have better drugs fewer people are dying of HIV.

357
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:29,040
amondul: Alright, so estimation of incidence and prevalence you need to define your cases.

358
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,810
amondul: So this is an example of.

359
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:52,050
amondul: A natural history of a disease so someone's healthy they get the disease, then, at some point, then they start to have symptoms, they seek care and are diagnosed they receive some treatment and then there's an outcome right perhaps they're cured, or they are disabled or perhaps they die.

360
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:53,700
amondul: So.

361
00:43:55,110 --> 00:44:03,990
amondul: You might have various sources of data interviews physician records hospital records so let's think about.

362
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:21,570
amondul: You know how what cases you're going to find really depend on your source of data right, so if you're asking people in interviews, you might get more cases and you might find them from this moment of symptom onset.

363
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:26,460
amondul: If you're going for a physician records you're going to get those that seek care.

364
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:41,910
amondul: And if we think about co that is a good example, there are people who don't go to the doctor right who have a very mild case and stay home, so if you interview people and say hey did you have Kobe did you have a cough did you lose your sense of smell whatever for taste.

365
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:49,710
amondul: they're going to say yeah and you're going to get those people if you go to physician records you're only going to get the people who went to the doctor.

366
00:44:50,580 --> 00:45:03,750
amondul: And you're going to find out their incidents their date of diagnosis that time on the timeline when they become a case and you stopped counting their person time at risk is going to be at the time that they went to the doctor right.

367
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:12,150
amondul: If you go to hospital records, it might even be later right and you might get a different subset of people who are more severe and had to be treated in hospital.

368
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:21,540
amondul: and your date of diagnosis, with the disease might be the date that basic care if the hospital, which is that leader in their natural history.

369
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:34,920
amondul: Right, so your source of data is going to determine some things about your case definition like which cases you get and when you're counting them as a case does that make sense.

370
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:39,180
amondul: In some cases it won't matter that much.

371
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:44,070
amondul: Cancer is a pretty good example of this.

372
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:57,060
amondul: Although you know, depending on on you know whether someone is diagnosed through screening or through symptoms, you will definitely get a different date of diagnosis, for that person.

373
00:45:57,690 --> 00:46:07,890
amondul: But you're not really going to miss cases probably most people with cancer end up going to the hospital for it or to the doctor for it at some point right so kind of doesn't you're going to get all the cases sort of.

374
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:16,290
amondul: Regardless the time at which they're diagnosed might be different in terms of when and the natural history of it, it is, but you're not just going to totally miss people probably.

375
00:46:17,370 --> 00:46:19,950
amondul: Whereas Kobe could be different right there are people who just.

376
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:27,780
amondul: Tough it out at home they didn't have that bad of a case that will cough couple sniffles and then they moved on right and you're going to totally miss those people.

377
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:35,430
amondul: So you know you have to think carefully about what your goal is with your study and what your best source of information is does that make sense.

378
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:39,240
amondul: Okay.

379
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:49,680
amondul: prevalence of asthma ages less than 18 and 18 plus USA 1982 2000 alright So here we have this weird.

380
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:52,320
amondul: discontinuity.

381
00:46:53,820 --> 00:47:08,130
amondul: discontinuity between 1996 and 1997 is due to a change in the question use to determine prevalence, so this is a ongoing questionnaire at some point they changed their question and it looks like they have a totally different number of cases.

382
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:18,570
amondul: Probably it's not actually a different number, but using a different question gives you an apparent different number right and so sometimes you have to be thoughtful about.

383
00:47:19,050 --> 00:47:27,930
amondul: Whether something changed in the way that you assessed outcomes and if that you know, is this are real change over time, or is it just that they used a different instrument that's the point.

384
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:33,150
amondul: Here you go, this is the number of people and prevalence of dementia.

385
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:39,690
amondul: And the Canadian study of aging cohort right, this is from your book, this is the number of people who have dementia.

386
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:54,840
amondul: And it is a big range, and this is, depending upon different classification systems right so whichever classification system you use it's going to give you kind of a different answer in terms of who's got dementia.

387
00:47:55,950 --> 00:48:03,150
amondul: This one seems to catch a lot more people and i'm not familiar with these classification systems, I don't really know, perhaps this one is.

388
00:48:04,470 --> 00:48:06,540
amondul: less stringent right.

389
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:15,330
amondul: Okay, so how you choose to define your cases will determine your problems in your instance.

390
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:20,280
amondul: So who belongs to the denominator let's define our denominator.

391
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:24,720
amondul: What do you think belongs the denominator if we're interested in breast cancer.

392
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:29,370
Divya Manohar: The women.

393
00:48:31,350 --> 00:48:33,510
amondul: Women yep people with breasts yes.

394
00:48:34,830 --> 00:48:36,720
amondul: males can get breast cancer.

395
00:48:39,090 --> 00:48:40,800
amondul: Should you include them in the denominator.

396
00:48:41,670 --> 00:48:42,990
Geehan Suleyman: it's people at risk.

397
00:48:43,710 --> 00:48:44,790
amondul: For breast cancer.

398
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:58,470
amondul: I see a lot of struggling and like maybe so technically men are at risk right but it's kind of a different disease male breast cancer is almost kind of a different thing than vino breast cancer.

399
00:48:58,890 --> 00:49:03,960
amondul: So we actually do only use females, as our denominator in most cancer statistics for breast cancer.

400
00:49:05,190 --> 00:49:06,300
amondul: But that is a.

401
00:49:07,530 --> 00:49:13,020
amondul: Maybe a less straightforward question than it seems like it at first glance right.

402
00:49:15,390 --> 00:49:31,950
amondul: And I you know I heard people say biologically female or you know I said, people with breasts you know you could have men trans men or none right and they could have pressed to be a risk for breast cancer if they haven't had top surgery, for example, so you know so that is.

403
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:42,480
amondul: Not you know you do have to be a little bit clear, I think, for the purposes of like population level statistics for breast cancer, we use women.

404
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:47,160
Right.

405
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:54,600
amondul: Alright, so any questions about that before we talk briefly about surveillance.

406
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:04,560
Nolaundron Harris: I can never ask my questions because it's in the moment i'm thinking about it somewhat process.

407
00:50:06,150 --> 00:50:09,360
amondul: Okay, if you think about it during the exercise, you can always ask them then.

408
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:12,390
amondul: You can always interrupt me to while i'm talking I don't mind.

409
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:15,780
amondul: I find my way back to my point one way or the other.

410
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,500
amondul: Okay surveillance.

411
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:30,030
amondul: So the objective so surveillance or, to be able to explain what you know, so your objectives here sorry the objectives here today, when that when we're talking about surveillance or be to be able to explain what it is.

412
00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:38,220
amondul: To be able to give examples of how these data are used and people describe the difference between active and passive surveillance Okay, so this is.

413
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:43,140
amondul: a quote from David Patrick who is, are you a surgeon general.

414
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:50,220
amondul: He says in public health we can't do anything about surveillance, that is where public health, the gifts.

415
00:50:51,750 --> 00:51:00,720
amondul: So public health surveillance is the systematic ongoing collection, management, analysis and interpretation of data, followed by dissemination of these data.

416
00:51:01,110 --> 00:51:15,300
amondul: to public health programs to stimulate public health action right, so we, I think, often with surveillance, we think of it as collecting the data but analyzing and interpreting it and disseminating it is equally important, as part of the surveillance system.

417
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:24,390
amondul: So, here are some examples of surveillance statistics So these are the 2009 he just estimates of the percentage of adults with diagnosed diabetes.

418
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:29,880
amondul: Here we have.

419
00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:45,780
amondul: I can't read my thing, because this is another way I can move it back did it, so this is the medium red blood cell folate levels of the US population, this is in people for an older and females 15 to 45.

420
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:50,310
amondul: Anybody know why we're specifically interested in women 15 to 45 for this.

421
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:53,490
Geehan Suleyman: Pregnant women.

422
00:51:53,970 --> 00:51:54,930
amondul: or women who are a.

423
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,940
Divya Manohar: Child and reproductive age group.

424
00:51:57,510 --> 00:52:06,570
amondul: yeah yeah, this is the age group, that we are worried about protecting right, and so you can see somewhere in here, we did fornication and boom the light went off.

425
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:13,290
amondul: This is the port proportion of women 40 and older, who had a mammogram by race by year.

426
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:22,620
amondul: And here we've got knee replacements for hospital and patients 45 and over and we've got that broken at the 45 to 64 years and 65 and older.

427
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:36,750
amondul: Okay, so these are all examples of surveillance statistics right they are we have collected the data we have analyzed it put it into a usable format and are you know very disseminating it.

428
00:52:38,910 --> 00:52:42,480
amondul: Okay, so let's talk about passive versus active surveillance.

429
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:44,730
amondul: Okay, so.

430
00:52:46,320 --> 00:53:05,670
amondul: In this case, this is passive surveillance, so a health related event happens a doctor or school or somebody finds out about it, they then report it to like the local state or National Health Service.

431
00:53:06,870 --> 00:53:16,740
amondul: And then it gets collected and collated and report it out, so this is passive surveillance in the sense that you are requiring the people to note an event and send it in themselves.

432
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:25,320
amondul: Okay, active, so this is an example of passive surveillance data, this is mumps reported cases per 100,000 population by year.

433
00:53:26,550 --> 00:53:32,850
amondul: And essentially what would happen is if a physician saw case of mumps they would send that information into their state or local health department, they would.

434
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:41,640
amondul: put all their data together send it to the CDC and now we have this information for the US for each year Okay, so this is a passive surveillance system.

435
00:53:43,410 --> 00:53:48,510
amondul: Passive surveillance works pretty well for this disease, because it's not that common because we have.

436
00:53:49,500 --> 00:54:02,010
amondul: Vaccination for moms right so it's pretty infrequent it's really clear what it is right when it happens, like oh that's The case of mumps and it's unusual a doctor is going to go well that's weird i'm going to send this into the health department right.

437
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:13,710
amondul: Active is, on the other hand, where you go those health departments or health agencies are going to go actively look for cases.

438
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:20,610
amondul: Okay they're going to go out to the hospitals to communities and try to find all of the cases of something that they can.

439
00:54:21,510 --> 00:54:24,990
amondul: Okay, so this is an example of active surveillance data, so this is foodborne illness.

440
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:32,340
amondul: Right, and so they actually have these this this is this food, food borne diseases active surveillance networks right there in the name called food that.

441
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:42,180
amondul: And they actually have like Sentinel sites where they go out and actually try to find these these cases of foodborne illness and figure out what's happening with something sense.

442
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:43,800
amondul: Excuse me.

443
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:51,570
amondul: In this case, are using laboratory confirm infection, so they published by the laboratories and finding confirmed actions.

444
00:54:53,340 --> 00:55:07,110
amondul: All right, versus, this is an active surveillance system they actively call hundred thousand people per year on the phone right and try to get them to tell them information so here you go this as adults who met physical activity recommendations its best and 11.

445
00:55:08,670 --> 00:55:10,140
amondul: we've Colorado showing off.

446
00:55:11,730 --> 00:55:14,370
amondul: Who we a mountain bikes we have melons.

447
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:18,210
amondul: Okay.

448
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:25,530
amondul: Comparison of estimated expenses for health department active and passive surveillance system, this is old, so these numbers are like.

449
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:38,700
amondul: I don't know, can a big calculate 1980s money into today Monday it's a lot more right, so this is, these are not accurate numbers anymore, but you can see very, very clearly that the cost for an active surveillance system is.

450
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:46,440
amondul: You know quite a lot more than for the pastor guild system right 10 times essentially as much.

451
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:53,490
amondul: So this is why we have to be thoughtful about whether active or passive surveillance is necessary.

452
00:55:54,060 --> 00:56:05,520
amondul: Because we probably have finite resources to spend on active surveillance systems, and so you want to be thoughtful about can I get what I need from a passive surveillance system or Do I need an active surveillance system to get that information.

453
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:07,470
amondul: So.

454
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:13,770
amondul: disadvantage of active surveillance is that it has a very high cost, but the reporting is going to be much more accurate right.

455
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:31,530
amondul: In passive reporting the data may be less complete and the quality may be lower when passive recording is used local outbreaks, maybe missed active reporting is a good way to identify local outbreaks, but for a lot of the notifiable diseases we use a passive reporting system.

456
00:56:32,670 --> 00:56:48,750
amondul: Because a lot of them are kind of unusual I mean for anything that is unusual and very clear what it is, particularly if it requires you to go to the doctor for it, I mean the other thing too is keep in mind, we kind of have a passive reporting system now for covert don't we.

457
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:55,650
amondul: We do have a passive reporting system for covet people are going to get a test and the test results are getting.

458
00:56:57,090 --> 00:57:05,940
amondul: sent in, but if you don't go to a PCR tests site right or get your dentist or the doctor or whatever, if you take a home test no one's going to know.

459
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:09,300
amondul: Unless you report it which most people are doing.

460
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:22,350
amondul: Right so you're getting coven numbers from my hospitals doctors testing sites that kind of thing, but people are taking home tests and staying home they have mild disease so we're only getting the more severe cases through our passive surveillance system.

461
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:27,540
amondul: Going back to mumps I think most people who get months probably go to the doctor.

462
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:37,110
amondul: you're probably doing pretty well with that one because you're not missing a lot of cases that stay home that were super mild you're probably catching those and it's a.

463
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:41,220
amondul: rare enough kind of weird enough thing that the doctor is going to be like Oh, I need to send them that report.

464
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:57,690
amondul: So you can kind of see how you're going to you know what what the pros and cons are what things lend themselves better to a passive surveillance system and what things lend themselves better to an active surveillance system that makes sense.

465
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:00,780
amondul: Okay.

466
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:05,580
amondul: That is the end of today's lecture.

467
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:08,400
amondul: Any questions.

468
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:14,940
amondul: alright.

469
00:58:15,990 --> 00:58:30,750
amondul: let's take a 10 minute break so come back at 240 and then we will get you guys into groups to start working on today's exercise I think we're going to switch the groups up today so you'll be working with different people and so you'll get a chance to meet meet some other folks okay.

470
00:58:32,790 --> 00:58:35,610
amondul: All right, 10 minutes, and then we will come back.

471
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:42,420
This meeting guys.

472
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:44,850
amondul: Sorry.

473
00:58:45,930 --> 00:58:48,960
amondul: Welcome back everybody if we get off mute that would be great I know we were all.

474
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:52,560
amondul: chatting in our groups, but let me meeting, it would be good to mute.

475
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:54,840
amondul: alright.

476
00:58:56,370 --> 00:59:04,290
amondul: So let's go over this exercise i'm going to call on the groups again like I did last time.

477
00:59:05,670 --> 00:59:12,270
amondul: So i'm um this one was a little less calculating a little more thinking through right.

478
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:20,700
amondul: So you were given this little blurb about this stroke among Mexican Americans compared with an honest panic whites.

479
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:28,500
amondul: So group, one can you tell me what the main disease outcome is of the study and what two groups are being compared.

480
00:59:35,370 --> 00:59:41,970
Divya Manohar: So we were comparing the stroke incidents between Mexican Americans and non Hispanic whites and.

481
00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:46,350
amondul: you're the main diseases stroke.

482
00:59:46,410 --> 00:59:50,250
amondul: And you're comparing Mexican Americans to non Hispanic whites great.

483
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:54,150
amondul: And group to.

484
00:59:55,620 --> 01:00:01,020
amondul: let's see why is it important from a public health perspective to quantify and understand the stroke burden and Mexican Americans.

485
01:00:03,690 --> 01:00:12,360
Sarah Ferri: So we had there is a higher frequency of stroke among Mexican Americans, and so they have a greater burden from a public health perspective.

486
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:24,840
Sarah Ferri: And additionally they're one of the nation's largest and fastest growing minority groups, and so they are a population that is making themselves known aware so it's really helpful to know that for them.

487
01:00:26,910 --> 01:00:35,010
amondul: And I think in this in the key it also mentioned that, from a policy standpoint document being a burden allows us to allocate resources.

488
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:49,740
amondul: To programs that prevent stroke and mitigate the harmful consequences right, you can also if you can show the risk in this group, specifically, it might allow public health agencies to develop programs that are tailored perhaps culturally relevant specifically to this group.

489
01:00:52,200 --> 01:01:00,600
amondul: And also, it might help clinicians to develop a heightened awareness about this risk when interacting with Mexican American patients right.

490
01:01:02,070 --> 01:01:07,020
amondul: So did anybody else come up with anything that's not listed here that I didn't mention.

491
01:01:08,670 --> 01:01:13,020
amondul: discuss anything interesting with respect to this answer you want to bring up the whole group.

492
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:17,010
Okay.

493
01:01:18,210 --> 01:01:35,280
amondul: Her three you were given this other little blurb longer little blurb boop boop boop boop there it is and a table, and then you were asked what measure of disease frequency is being calculated in table one and instead of ratio proportion or renovate.

494
01:01:36,870 --> 01:01:37,320
amondul: who's in.

495
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,430
Joshua Tucker: I can do it um.

496
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:47,310
Joshua Tucker: let's get this pulled up sorry about that.

497
01:01:48,570 --> 01:01:56,400
Joshua Tucker: So this was these are cumulative incidences cases of stroke among the two ethnic groups and then pages.

498
01:01:57,450 --> 01:02:02,730
Joshua Tucker: In q1 of incidences of proportion, or versus over persons overpopulation right.

499
01:02:02,790 --> 01:02:07,140
amondul: And you know it is not a race because person time is that included in the denominator.

500
01:02:08,670 --> 01:02:10,890
amondul: That is correct, good job.

501
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:23,160
amondul: All right, so group for what is the data source for the numerator is meaning the stroke cases and why is it important that the steady community is geographically isolated with respect to capturing.

502
01:02:23,190 --> 01:02:24,600
All of the stroke events.

503
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:43,440
Geehan Suleyman: So the this they screened admissions to the emergency room and then the impatient visits using a validated diagnostic code and then they used icd codes to identify stroke patients.

504
01:02:46,830 --> 01:02:49,950
Geehan Suleyman: yeah so basically they used all hospital and clinic records.

505
01:02:52,050 --> 01:02:55,350
amondul: So why is it important that the Community is geographically isolated.

506
01:02:56,430 --> 01:03:07,950
Geehan Suleyman: Because it didn't look like, I think the next the nearest facility was about 150 miles so you're capturing pretty much everyone who's at risk and who seeks care.

507
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:15,330
Geehan Suleyman: In that facility or those facilities so you're capturing everyone.

508
01:03:15,930 --> 01:03:27,510
amondul: that's right, so they did you are correct, you, you mentioned all of this, about how they did surveillance and admissions to eat emergency departments that impatience visited visits blue sorry.

509
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:36,240
amondul: And then the geographic isolation is important because it ensures that very few cases would be missed, which is essentially what you were saying right it's a district it's a.

510
01:03:36,540 --> 01:03:41,430
amondul: People aren't going to stay home and be like oh i'm just going to wait out the stroke like they're they're going to the hospital right.

511
01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:54,750
amondul: And they're going to those specific hospitals right, because it is not eat the other any any other hospital is far enough away that they're you know what something emergent like this they're not going to take them to one of those okay.

512
01:03:56,220 --> 01:03:56,700
amondul: Great.

513
01:03:58,620 --> 01:04:03,090
amondul: Group and any other questions about that or any other thoughts about that that we didn't bring up.

514
01:04:09,060 --> 01:04:19,230
amondul: Okay group five so you were asked to consider table one, what is the data source for the population denominators and how did the authors to find Mexican American race, ethnicity from this data source.

515
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:27,210
amondul: How does this definition compare to that used for the numerator is and what Why is comparability of these definitions important.

516
01:04:32,910 --> 01:04:39,240
amondul: We said that population like data was taken from the US census data doesn't census right.

517
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:43,860
amondul: Like how the office define next to the American research facility.

518
01:04:44,910 --> 01:04:47,850
amondul: To get in with participants self reported.

519
01:04:49,860 --> 01:05:07,680
amondul: There their respective cities and same categories at the census data and pretty much anyone himself, important as Hispanic descent was reported as Mexican American that's what the researchers have you mean in the in the study yes for the numerator yes, how they find Mexican American.

520
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:25,440
amondul: that's important in terms of like how how you import race, ethnicity, in terms of who you report is your denominators will soon, can you record as a major impacts your general population that subset of that so yeah okay.

521
01:05:26,820 --> 01:05:36,630
amondul: Data source for the denominator is the 2000 us census like you said for the denominator, the authors to find Mexican Americans, as those who reported Hispanic ethnicity, regardless of reported race.

522
01:05:37,950 --> 01:05:40,260
amondul: And that's similar to what's used for the numerator.

523
01:05:42,330 --> 01:05:42,720
amondul: he's me.

524
01:05:44,730 --> 01:05:59,100
amondul: Excuse me, so I think this is what you were getting at the cumulative incidences of proportion, so those included the numerator numerator must be a subset of those than the dominator so really the consistent definitions should be used for the both the cases and the source population.

525
01:06:00,420 --> 01:06:14,310
amondul: Because they're getting the cases from the surveillance of the hospitals and the source population data from the census it's not perfectly exactly the same, but I don't know does anybody think that this is a huge problem, or do you think it's probably pretty good.

526
01:06:17,220 --> 01:06:21,180
amondul: yeah I think it's probably pretty good does anybody else have another thought.

527
01:06:29,820 --> 01:06:33,060
amondul: And the thing is there, probably isn't really a better way to do it right.

528
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:46,980
amondul: So sometimes in the epidemiology we we do the best that we can and what she really hopefully at the end of this class part of what you'll be able to do is to be able to say okay.

529
01:06:47,580 --> 01:06:58,440
amondul: This is the most expedient way to do this, this is the easiest way or the most cost effective way or the way that you know is kind of the most logistically feasible.

530
01:07:00,390 --> 01:07:10,260
amondul: it's not perfect in these ways does that cause a big problem or a small problem right, because if it's a small problem, then the trade off is probably fine.

531
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:19,230
amondul: If it causes a big problem and such that you're not going to get the right answer then there's no point in doing it right So these are always kind of what we're waiting.

532
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:27,240
amondul: Alright, so, then you were asked to do some calculations so i'm just going to show these.

533
01:07:29,010 --> 01:07:31,530
amondul: What do you guys think is that approximately what you guys got.

534
01:07:33,990 --> 01:07:35,610
amondul: Yes, but.

535
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:40,140
amondul: Was there any confusion about this, we need to go over this any more detail.

536
01:07:45,150 --> 01:07:45,390
Okay.

537
01:07:48,270 --> 01:07:57,390
amondul: So um you were asked to that interpret the measures of disease frequency that you calculated in Question six and compare them by age of ethnicity so.

538
01:07:58,410 --> 01:08:06,360
amondul: These are written out in the way that you are shown to do it in that document that I mentioned the interpretations sheet.

539
01:08:08,610 --> 01:08:19,890
amondul: If you are particularly if you are taking this for credit, this is the kind of interpretation that we are looking for when we asked you to interpret a measure Okay, so it has the time.

540
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:26,580
amondul: It has the actual you know, so this is so, for Mexican Americans 45 to 59.

541
01:08:27,150 --> 01:08:38,040
amondul: Between January of 2000 and December of 2002 the risk of developing stroke was 76 cases per 10,000 people among Mexican Americans aged 45 to 59 living in noises county right.

542
01:08:38,460 --> 01:08:46,710
amondul: you're you have time, you have the the measure that you have related and then the population in which you measured it right, so that kind of detail is what we're looking for.

543
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:49,800
amondul: Any questions about that.

544
01:08:52,230 --> 01:08:56,220
Nolaundron Harris: Little cheat sheet for this and be safe to just say answer the WHO what when where.

545
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:07,350
amondul: There you go that's right yeah you want to be detailed right you want to you want to say we said in the lecture particularly that cumulative incidents always includes a time.

546
01:09:08,010 --> 01:09:12,510
amondul: component, you always have to define the time period during which you're calculating it.

547
01:09:13,290 --> 01:09:26,430
amondul: And then, in this case, you know you want to say in in noises county right because it's in this particular geographic area and it is in these groups right that's the whole point is that you're comparing ages likes straight up of age race yeah.

548
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:29,880
amondul: more detail us better.

549
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:32,700
amondul: Okay.

550
01:09:35,130 --> 01:09:41,820
amondul: So, in general, what we see is that the incidence increase the cumulative incidence increases with agent both groups.

551
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:50,760
amondul: The groups, but the cumulative incidences fire and Mexican Americans that non Hispanic whites within each age group right, so if we go back to the table this is maybe a good way of looking at it.

552
01:09:51,570 --> 01:10:06,600
amondul: In the 45 to you know, so if we just look down the Mexican American column the older folks have a higher cumulative incidence same with the non Hispanic white calm right the older folks have a higher cumulative instance, but both this way, and this way.

553
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:12,480
amondul: In the younger and and the older age groups, the Mexican Americans have a higher cumulative instance than the whites.

554
01:10:17,910 --> 01:10:22,920
amondul: Did anybody have anything else that they wrote for that or anything else that they noticed wanted to talk about.

555
01:10:24,540 --> 01:10:28,380
amondul: Sure, will ask something yeah stay in terms of data regarding.

556
01:10:29,610 --> 01:10:42,270
amondul: That, although, like in in general, from the data, the city plus like aged people had overall higher incidences and people aged 45 to nine that's interesting that's comparing.

557
01:10:42,930 --> 01:10:52,140
amondul: That to live it's just between us Americans and then we're back to the age range, which is 26 to 36 that's nearly twice as high PR to.

558
01:10:52,560 --> 01:11:02,760
amondul: Mexican Americans live instance for 60 plus which is 27 yes not nearly double the non satellites instance number, so we got those kind of interesting to observe.

559
01:11:03,210 --> 01:11:07,380
amondul: yeah that you get almost a doubling of the incident that cumulative incidence.

560
01:11:07,830 --> 01:11:15,750
amondul: By you know, comparing Mexican Americans to the non Hispanic whites in the younger group but it's not as higher but not like, certainly not twice them right.

561
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:27,150
amondul: So what do you think that means sentence like generally us humans age there's I feel like you to share discrepancies of disparities between.

562
01:11:27,780 --> 01:11:36,990
amondul: Next, Americans and authentic voice as you get older maybe DEM DEM so like lessons and they get older like the difference between two year olds I came to the year olds yeah.

563
01:11:39,060 --> 01:11:40,110
amondul: Also you've.

564
01:11:41,370 --> 01:11:51,600
amondul: People have to survive, to be 60 to get into that group right so maybe all of the really susceptible people are all the Mexican Americans didn't have the highest risk.

565
01:11:52,620 --> 01:11:53,670
amondul: already had their stroke.

566
01:11:57,510 --> 01:12:01,920
amondul: yeah that's what joshua just said is that is that what I was describing is actually thinking joshua.

567
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:04,860
Joshua Tucker: yeah sorry.

568
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:08,850
amondul: Smoking like the smoking.

569
01:12:10,230 --> 01:12:24,300
amondul: Like mortality rates with smoking peak younger and then kind of come down and it's because you kind of weeded out the susceptible people, people who are like 90 and still smoking a pack of lucky strikes a day like there's something special about before you know they mean.

570
01:12:26,850 --> 01:12:27,480
amondul: They made it.

571
01:12:28,530 --> 01:12:32,340
amondul: You can't kill them once they get to that point you're like they're just unkillable I guess.

572
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:36,930
Nolaundron Harris: it's the line of 80 years old i'm going to do what I want you can tell me anything.

573
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:38,310
amondul: that's exactly right.

574
01:12:38,700 --> 01:12:40,230
amondul: I actually did know somebody.

575
01:12:40,860 --> 01:12:57,540
amondul: on the Internet, who said that they quit smoking in their 30s and the like, but if I make it to 70 i'll start again like I like smoking I miss it i'll do all i'll quit until i'm 70 and then I get smoked again and I was like I don't know what how to feel about that as a professional.

576
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:02,520
amondul: The cancer me i'll just i'm kind of anti but like I sort of get the logic, I guess.

577
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:10,980
Joshua Tucker: What What about the people who are like they get a diagnosis that they're like on the borderline of respectable versus non respectable lung cancer.

578
01:13:11,460 --> 01:13:18,300
Joshua Tucker: The doctors like you got to stop smoking and then you know they're like well I don't think I can do that, like all right well can't really do much for you.

579
01:13:19,290 --> 01:13:33,210
amondul: yeah I mean that is a real thing that happens, I mean so that's that is not I was making kind of a joke about about the person starting to get at 70 but yeah that's I mean that is real right there are there are people who you know have have worse outcomes because of that.

580
01:13:35,310 --> 01:13:35,850
amondul: All right.

581
01:13:37,020 --> 01:13:38,610
amondul: We talked about interpretation.

582
01:13:39,990 --> 01:13:48,750
amondul: Alright, so if you wanted to calculate the stroke incidence rate and Mexican Americans invoices counted, could you do this, using the data presented and what assumptions would that calculation require.

583
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:52,620
amondul: Some i'm not going to call in any group I will let you guys.

584
01:13:54,390 --> 01:13:57,120
amondul: volunteer yourselves as tribute for this one.

585
01:14:12,150 --> 01:14:14,640
Will Brodwater: So we were saying that you could calculate.

586
01:14:15,270 --> 01:14:21,300
Will Brodwater: You could calculate the incidence rate, but certainly would have to make some assumptions, similar to what you were talking about in the lecture.

587
01:14:21,930 --> 01:14:30,750
Will Brodwater: you'd have to assume that you have a steady state population in terms of patients who are aging into this age bracket and people who are dying at a steady rate and also assuming that.

588
01:14:31,230 --> 01:14:36,780
Will Brodwater: you're not having like massive swings in your population in terms of people moving into the area or out of the area.

589
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:45,180
Will Brodwater: Right and then you're kind of having to just assume like your mid point that as well, because we don't know the actual numbers of people at the beginning and the end of the study.

590
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:48,510
amondul: yeah you kind of really know what the beginning right.

591
01:14:49,950 --> 01:15:03,360
amondul: You have you have census data from 2000 so you sort of know from the year 2000 and then you don't really have an endpoint even so you just have to kind of assume that that that that the 2000 census population is steady state and that you're.

592
01:15:07,890 --> 01:15:16,080
amondul: You know the population, the population is stable and that your events are kind of happening evenly across right, so you would just take your.

593
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:25,140
amondul: If you look at the Mexican American population between ages 45 to 59 you have this many people in 2008 which sold at about three years right.

594
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:29,760
amondul: Wait a minute.

595
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:33,570
let's see which.

596
01:15:35,970 --> 01:15:41,430
amondul: model is the preview maybe it's extrapolate your data is with previous years in terms of growth.

597
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:47,190
amondul: In population growth of nuts, I mean.

598
01:15:49,620 --> 01:15:59,700
amondul: You could look back and see if your your assumption that the population was relatively stable was a good one, but keep in mind census How often do you get census data, do you know.

599
01:16:01,980 --> 01:16:02,460
Geehan Suleyman: Every time.

600
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:08,640
amondul: it's every 10 years right so like something really big could have happened between 1990 and 2000.

601
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:18,390
amondul: That wouldn't necessarily be reflective of what happened between 2000 2003 but you're thinking about along the right lines right, I mean you can you're thinking about what other data, you might have.

602
01:16:19,140 --> 01:16:28,110
amondul: That would allow you to to make some some some better assumptions, but I think, given the fact that I mean the other thing is like where are we sitting in time with this.

603
01:16:31,980 --> 01:16:34,920
Geehan Suleyman: 2002.

604
01:16:36,570 --> 01:16:44,220
amondul: But i'm wondering Oh, and so, and this was published in 2004 OK, so the Paper was published in 2004 so we don't even have we don't have the 2010 data yet so.

605
01:16:44,610 --> 01:16:53,970
amondul: I mean, at this point in time you're sitting here in like 2003 probably writing this paper your best your best guess is probably what is described here I would think.

606
01:16:55,050 --> 01:16:55,980
amondul: yeah no problem.

607
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:03,870
amondul: Okay, and then what factors impact the numbers of people within history of stroke, which would be the prevalence in the population.

608
01:17:06,090 --> 01:17:07,650
amondul: prevalence equals.

609
01:17:10,620 --> 01:17:18,030
amondul: Incidents times duration exactly right, so it is the incidence rate, as well as in the case of stroke.

610
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:30,300
amondul: Death basically right because you're not going to get cured and not have a history of it right that's not really.

611
01:17:32,550 --> 01:17:35,850
amondul: So it would be basically the length of survival after you have your stroke.

612
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:39,630
amondul: Did anybody have a different thought for this.

613
01:17:40,110 --> 01:17:43,500
Nolaundron Harris: Oh OK OK.

614
01:17:43,650 --> 01:17:44,640
amondul: But were you thinking right.

615
01:17:45,540 --> 01:17:54,660
Nolaundron Harris: Now I it's like you said before the words, if you read the words, then you can put it in the context I had put age ethnicity.

616
01:17:55,740 --> 01:17:57,870
Nolaundron Harris: I was also thinking about geography.

617
01:17:58,620 --> 01:18:07,020
amondul: Oh, I see what you're thinking you were thinking about in a given population like in Ann arbor compared to noises county.

618
01:18:07,050 --> 01:18:13,140
amondul: Florida cars, yes, and you are right in that sense, that is all true right, so the the demographics.

619
01:18:13,710 --> 01:18:29,730
amondul: socioeconomic status of the people in the population, access to health care, all of those things that you're talking about will certainly impact the prevalence of stroke in a given population, because they impact the incidence rate and also how well, people are surviving correct.

620
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:30,300
yeah.

621
01:18:31,650 --> 01:18:41,340
amondul: So we were getting at that idea that prevalence is a combination of people coming into your jar and people going out of your chair, but you are right that those things all have lots of things that impact.

622
01:18:44,580 --> 01:18:46,860
amondul: You still have a little no.

623
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:48,660
Nolaundron Harris: I gotta make a correction.

624
01:18:49,590 --> 01:18:50,010
Nolaundron Harris: Okay.

625
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:52,140
Nolaundron Harris: The brain the thinking and not.

626
01:18:55,230 --> 01:18:55,860
amondul: A problem.

627
01:18:58,680 --> 01:18:59,550
amondul: anyone else.

628
01:19:00,090 --> 01:19:00,990
Have thoughts about that.

629
01:19:03,150 --> 01:19:10,110
Geehan Suleyman: Oh, I we put down incidence on death and cure basically impact your problems.

630
01:19:10,680 --> 01:19:11,490
amondul: yeah you're.

631
01:19:11,610 --> 01:19:14,640
amondul: you're generally correct, but with with stroke, is there really.

632
01:19:14,820 --> 01:19:16,590
Geehan Suleyman: To not there's not yeah.

633
01:19:16,650 --> 01:19:20,490
amondul: yeah once we had a stroke you, you are a person with a history of stroke.

634
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:21,240
yeah.

635
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:25,890
amondul: Can you think of an example of something where cure would.

636
01:19:27,060 --> 01:19:28,140
amondul: be relevant.

637
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:39,870
Sarah Ferri: And whenever I was thinking about stroke, the only way that I could get myself to think about cure ability would be no neurologic so Kuala after the stroke.

638
01:19:40,590 --> 01:19:54,090
Sarah Ferri: it's like if you had a stroke, and it was a single time period, as opposed to being something that you are continually affected by like diabetes that's sort of that was kind of the only way I could kind of convince myself of care ability right.

639
01:19:54,180 --> 01:20:00,000
amondul: And so I guess then number nine It might then say what factors impact the number of people with.

640
01:20:01,140 --> 01:20:02,910
amondul: stroke related neurologic.

641
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:07,770
amondul: What sort of.

642
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:10,320
Sarah Ferri: history of strokes ic s.

643
01:20:10,350 --> 01:20:11,430
amondul: yeah it would be people.

644
01:20:12,690 --> 01:20:19,380
amondul: If you were to think of cure in that way of like you you've received whatever care, you need so that you don't have neurological quality right.

645
01:20:20,070 --> 01:20:27,300
amondul: Then the question would be what factors, in fact, the number of people with a history or with stroke related neurologic problems right.

646
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:39,420
amondul: And then you could include that cure piece, but I think people have a history of stroke it's just once you've had it you've had it right, and the only way to kind of get out of the JAR at that point would be to die, therefore, not being the population anymore.

647
01:20:41,010 --> 01:20:41,880
amondul: Does that make sense.

648
01:20:42,630 --> 01:20:42,900
yeah.

649
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:49,350
amondul: Can anybody think of a disease, where pure would make sense for changing prevalence.

650
01:20:50,790 --> 01:20:51,330
Geehan Suleyman: In fact.

651
01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:56,550
amondul: It was hard to hear, I think you said something infectious.

652
01:20:56,580 --> 01:20:57,210
amondul: Is that right.

653
01:20:57,540 --> 01:21:00,900
Geehan Suleyman: yeah usually losses, for example, you can get.

654
01:21:01,350 --> 01:21:12,060
amondul: Tuberculosis is correct that's a good example right, you can you can cure people, you can give antibiotics and so people could die of the disease, but they could also be cured, and that would they would no longer be prevalent if they were cured.

655
01:21:15,630 --> 01:21:16,110
amondul: Okay.

656
01:21:17,550 --> 01:21:18,690
amondul: Any other questions.

657
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:24,150
amondul: All right, what are we doing tomorrow.

658
01:21:25,110 --> 01:21:26,280
Nolaundron Harris: I do have a question for you.

659
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:30,300
Nolaundron Harris: Please exam reason so like questions like number nine.

660
01:21:30,810 --> 01:21:31,200
Of.

661
01:21:34,470 --> 01:21:51,600
Nolaundron Harris: Justification questions always weird like with stats I guess the like the way, how do you how do you want someone to answer questions because that's what I mean like my brain is going to have to switch to if the brain right now for this course correct.

662
01:21:52,350 --> 01:21:58,740
amondul: Okay, so I think a good way of addressing that for yourself, would be to look if you go to the day.

663
01:21:59,100 --> 01:22:07,680
amondul: On the home on a canvas page if you go to the day for the exam reviews, I think that is monday's class, there are some example questions example.

664
01:22:08,010 --> 01:22:17,250
amondul: example questions for the exam some sample questions to work through I do recommend that everybody worked through those kind of over the weekend, and then you can bring them to.

665
01:22:17,850 --> 01:22:24,690
amondul: You can see how you do on them and then any questions you have about that we can go through on Monday, as part of the review, I think that would be a good way to do that.

666
01:22:26,250 --> 01:22:33,030
amondul: I think what you'll find is that on the exam The questions are written in a much more straightforward way.

667
01:22:34,440 --> 01:22:44,790
amondul: You, the questions and the in class exercise are meant to be open, ended and inspire board discussion between you guys as group members and make you think a little more deeply about things.

668
01:22:45,810 --> 01:22:47,790
amondul: they're not going to be quite as.

669
01:22:48,930 --> 01:22:55,050
amondul: nebulous on the exam it'll be a little bit more obvious I think what the right answer is on the exam.

670
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:57,570
amondul: Does that make sense.

671
01:22:58,650 --> 01:23:11,640
amondul: you're going to be asked to do some calculations in the in class exercises that are maybe a bit more difficult or a little bit more of an extension of skills, then you would be asked to do on the exam it'll be a little bit simpler on the exam.

672
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:17,760
amondul: So I think you'll get a good sense, if you look at those sample questions does that help.

673
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:33,780
amondul: yeah because the purpose of the group exercises to get you guys talking as a group and thinking through lots of potential scenarios and that kind of thing, whereas on the exam we want to assess your knowledge right, and so you don't want to be confusing one of exam.

674
01:23:39,630 --> 01:23:41,310
amondul: Okay, any other questions.

675
01:23:44,910 --> 01:23:46,140
amondul: don't want this.

676
01:23:47,250 --> 01:23:54,330
amondul: Why do I have okay sorry I rolled over something, and it was telling me all about the weather and the news i'm like absolutely not but now is not the time, stop it.

677
01:23:56,340 --> 01:24:01,140
amondul: Okay, so tomorrow, we are going to talk about measuring death and age standardization.

678
01:24:02,190 --> 01:24:15,450
amondul: Okay, so you're going to read gorgeous Chapter four you're going to do, Chris number three before you come to class and we're those of you interested in reading quiz when able to access it now, I believe the ta is fix that so that you can.

679
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:25,290
amondul: Please let us know if you aren't able to get to it, and we can we can fix that for you okay tomorrow is going to be a math day everybody.

680
01:24:26,550 --> 01:24:28,170
amondul: mentally emotionally prepare.

681
01:24:29,340 --> 01:24:30,000
amondul: gonna be okay.

682
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:33,210
amondul: get your nerdy little calculators going to be great.

683
01:24:35,610 --> 01:24:36,060
amondul: Okay.

684
01:24:40,590 --> 01:24:42,480
amondul: last questions going once going twice.

685
01:24:43,620 --> 01:24:46,110
amondul: Alright, you get an hour back have a good afternoon.

686
01:24:48,990 --> 01:24:49,860
Nolaundron Harris: Thank you.

687
01:24:50,070 --> 01:24:50,460
Geehan Suleyman: You too.

688

Divya Manohar: Thank you bye my.

689
