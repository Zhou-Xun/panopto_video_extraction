1
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:08,550
All right. We're going to go ahead and just look at how we're going to get started.

2
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:15,530
Any announcements from anyone today? No announcement.

3
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:21,809
Okay. And two, I know that this week and for some people this week and next week are midterms.

4
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:28,820
So I know your brains may be a little fried, so I'll try to just keep that in mind when we're talking.

5
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:36,000
So thank you for showing up for those that showed up and you didn't show up, you know who you are talking to right now.

6
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:42,900
And so just a couple of reminders then.

7
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:50,190
And by Thursday, you should turn in your journals, the critical reflection journals.

8
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:55,170
And again, this is just a midway check to see how you're doing.

9
00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:07,320
And yeah, it's pretty easy breezy and, uh, you will have the other assignment done.

10
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,850
Ah, Matthew, by the end of this week. Those are still going well.

11
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:21,720
Uh, he was also a graduate student and also has midterms, so we want to be sensitive to her about it.

12
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:31,830
Everything else. All right, we're going to first of all, I want to say I really enjoyed our conversation last week.

13
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:38,489
I think you all are doing a really great job of digging into this material more.

14
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:42,300
And again, this classes learn more about the process and the outcome.

15
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:54,920
And hopefully when you change your process and your way of looking at things, then you will have different outcomes when you use this.

16
00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:08,319
Here. We were all right. So we were talking about critical race theory is also about how conservatives have

17
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:16,780
made the word theory a bad word like gender and sensitivity and Tudor tradition.

18
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:24,850
And I don't know, like this this election cycle, there's some real interesting people.

19
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:33,940
But isn't that one woman drama who talks about things like domination, demonic possession and things like that?

20
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:39,549
I don't know where she came from. But I've never heard of her before.

21
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:44,950
And I'm hearing all these things about, you know, demons and all this other kind of stuff.

22
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:58,440
But also, Election Day does fall into, as it always does, as does this class, so that they know that we want a mass exodus.

23
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:07,030
But if you two need time to vote, you know, feel free to do it during class, but you can't any other time.

24
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,870
I just want to kind of throw that out there. Anyone remember anything about critical race theory here?

25
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:18,550
It shouldn't keep this up because then you really never remember anything about it.

26
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:23,970
You should know by now. I always ask you. In the beginning it was about the last class.

27
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:28,330
So it's kind of a trend or a pattern of behavior that's predictable.

28
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,910
Anyone remember anything about critical race theory?

29
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,020
Other than it's the root of all evil and is making poor white children feel more about themselves?

30
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:47,340
Anything? Yes. Amelia, it's like asking us to acknowledge what racism is like, ordinary and everywhere,

31
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:52,079
and that it's not like something that only exists in certain spaces or is done by certain people, but is like everywhere.

32
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,340
All right. It's pervasive. It's endemic. I mean, it's everywhere.

33
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:01,679
And and just because some people use the lack of ordinariness to then call people,

34
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,770
oh, you're being overly sensitive or that's not racist, all that other kind of crap.

35
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:09,600
Yes. Kind of similar, but just indifferent words like racism is the rule, not the exception.

36
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,970
Mm hmm. Excellent. That's a really good for. Well, yeah.

37
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,900
ADLER I'd say critical race theory requires critical consciousness and reflection.

38
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,030
Tell me more about that.

39
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:35,340
Like, I think that you really have to reflect upon not only your actions, but kind of like the societal impact of racism and actually start analyzing.

40
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,660
And truly, I mean, I think that's why the word critical is in it,

41
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:44,900
because you really start to have to think creatively, think critically, and act accordingly from like that.

42
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:54,569
And yeah, I think it's right. Yeah. So it's not just like a simple model you follow, you know, like do A, then B and C, it's really a process.

43
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:59,700
And it and like you said, critical is at the core of critical race theory.

44
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,290
You know, that's why sometimes when I hear people talk about critical race theory,

45
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:08,760
you don't really know anything about their learning theory, especially when it comes to children.

46
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:14,970
It's the way they presented as that.

47
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:21,120
It's just it's just, you know, it's a story that is told that makes people feel bad or something.

48
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,370
And then it's not about the process, you know, and education should be critical, right?

49
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:33,959
I mean, we should be teaching kids how to think. So just as we teach kids how to think about math and science and other things,

50
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:38,820
we should all teach them how to think about race and ethnicity and culture and all these other things.

51
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:45,210
Anything else you remember? Yeah. It also talks about the fact that race is socially constructed.

52
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:52,350
Right. And what does that mean? Is socially constructed, as you say that like genetically we're not actually different,

53
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:58,709
but the fact that we categorize people by race is like something that society made up, right?

54
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:03,840
And it's like I think we talk about how it changes based on what's going on in exactly.

55
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:06,510
Exactly that good. Anything else?

56
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:15,540
Yeah, I think it talked a little bit about how because like racism and racist structures like keep white people in power.

57
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:19,630
There's like little motivation. People in power to like. Eradicate it.

58
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:24,040
Yeah, exactly. Pretty much like, you know, as Fred talks about about oppression.

59
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:30,040
I mean, it is it's a it's a form of of oppression and marginalization and things like that.

60
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:35,410
What else? Anything else? All I know.

61
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:47,010
Oh, I saw him. All right. So long since we've talked about ordinariness, increased convergence of construction,

62
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:53,580
differential regionalization, and how that shifts over time intersectionality and then the unique voice of color.

63
00:06:53,730 --> 00:07:00,360
But I think, again, one thing that just reiterates some of what you all said about that last point is the

64
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:09,060
tension of wanting people of color to speak for their own community versus others,

65
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:14,640
but then also the burden that that can put on people to always have to speak for your community.

66
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:23,700
So it's important to create those spaces, but also not to have an expectation that just because that space is created, someone has to fill it,

67
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:32,060
because it needs to be an individual decision about whether or not you're ready, whether or not you're prepared or whether or not you have the energy.

68
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:39,030
I mean, sometimes, you know, racism and other forms of oppression can be so physically,

69
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:43,830
emotionally, spiritually exhausting that you just don't have the energy to do that.

70
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:54,930
So Sandra Ford is a professor at UCLA and she was one of the first people,

71
00:07:54,930 --> 00:08:05,640
really her and Lisa Bowling in the George Washington University she knew really to start to apply critical race theory to public health.

72
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:15,569
And again, this is one of those things where it's important for us in this field, which public health is really made up of a bunch of other fields.

73
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:21,270
I mean, we really we pull from all over the place to realize that this isn't a new

74
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:25,610
revelation and that that critical race theory can be applied to public health.

75
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:25,799
I mean,

76
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:37,160
people are talking about the essential elements and tenets of critical race theory in multiple fields way before we ever have and in public health.

77
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:48,750
But the this article that that they published really kind of talked about CRT within how it could be used in public health.

78
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:57,570
So they talk about critical race theory, also talk about centering in the margins or making the perspectives of socially marginalized groups

79
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:03,030
rather than people belonging to dominate the central axis around which discourse on the topic evolves.

80
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:09,060
So another again, some of these things come out of black feminist theorists.

81
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:16,090
So, you know, bell hooks talked about suffering in the margins.

82
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:24,840
Other prominent black feminists also wrote about a lot of these concepts, also race consciousness.

83
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:36,820
And I think with you know with this and again it shares a lot of the the tenants or is in alignment with critical race theory is really acknowledging

84
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:45,610
that that race is something that you can just like take a break from you know it it's it's something that's always there so it's not like okay,

85
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:50,139
I'm going to be a white person today or, you know, I'm going to not be like that.

86
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:56,860
I'm not going to live with diabetes today. I'm just going to like put that on hold, going to have my pancreas kick in and produce some insulin.

87
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:07,060
Race is always race and racism are always there. And so to pretend like they're not is really, you know, living in Fantasy Island.

88
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:15,610
There's been a lot of expansions of different types of critical race theory.

89
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:23,410
So there's like queer critical theory and Latino critical theory are often called black crit.

90
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:36,340
And so I just wanted to show this an example of one, because I think that, you know, we often I think in public health and in other areas,

91
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:47,290
and especially when it comes to the next populations, we just kind of put everyone in this huge box and we know that that is not appropriate.

92
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,710
We know there's so many differences, unfortunately.

93
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:57,730
And if y'all heard about the kind of person that was, I think, present at the city council in Los Angeles,

94
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:06,340
next woman who was like dogging on all these other black next cultures and on in a black culture and all these other things.

95
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:15,040
You know, unfortunately, she was recorded in this whole thing and so there's been a lot of fallout from that.

96
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:26,510
But I think that with lab cred, it really is recognizing the complexities of when we're talking about the Latino populations and communities.

97
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:32,920
And to what Meg said are one aspect of it can make it really challenging, too,

98
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:41,340
is that people who have a Latin X ethnicity can have different races as well.

99
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:49,899
So you have that intersectionality of race and skin color, morphological or, you know, different facial structures, body structures.

100
00:11:49,900 --> 00:12:03,070
And then also you have the ethnicity component and that that makes it even more challenging because you're not just looking at kind of one aspect.

101
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:07,930
I'm also immigration is often an issue that's talked about a lot more as well.

102
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:17,080
We don't often talk about that. And, you know, for black Americans, although we have a lot of immigrants from different parts of sub-Saharan Africa,

103
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:29,950
are Afro-Caribbean, you know, areas. But I think that in the last current world and I think there's a lot of really great writings in this area,

104
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:34,660
but something you're interested in because it really does go beyond the kind of black white

105
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:40,060
dichotomy that was really the center of a lot of the discourse on critical race theory.

106
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:51,760
And it really does. I know it's complex and and I think, you know, two languages in there.

107
00:12:51,760 --> 00:13:00,280
I mean, there's so many different aspects tied up in there. And I think that, you know, what this has to do with public health is that, you know,

108
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:16,479
when we're working in different Latin communities and places that we have to really pay attention to and be aware of that the complexity of all that.

109
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:22,719
So a language and, you know, raise the race kind of slash ethnicity, intersection.

110
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:33,910
I mean, there's so many different aspects that you have to pay attention to. The fire should probably go outside the area.

111
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:44,850
You know, I'm not worried about anybody else, but.

112
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:51,880
I guess I don't really I don't really feel like.

113
00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:04,020
I never really know what.

114
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:42,210
On. Not so much because she didn't want to leave anymore.

115
00:15:42,510 --> 00:21:10,960
And. And.

116
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:39,890
Last week, he sent a letter, an affirmation that you are something great.

117
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:48,770
I always thought you might as well be funny.

118
00:33:50,240 --> 00:34:07,580
Larry was just that, like I was just telling him that I looked so sexy, like.

119
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:33,130
You know, I was there and I was like. I thought we were going to see because this going to take stickers and stuff so you can do it.

120
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:59,360
Nothing like a lot of your whole life that you just had on fire more than you were.

121
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:03,740
I just thought about that. About. You're watching this recording.

122
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:25,160
And I thought that I've done my job and I still have a nice little break.

123
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:31,729
A lot of ladies who are just talking like there was no one out there.

124
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:48,080
Like there's all these offices right there among themselves, like, hey, he's coming from this now.

125
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:55,610
It's kind of weak. So that means it's just a sense.

126
00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:02,800
We're not going to try to stand by everybody all the time.

127
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:10,540
All right. So this is just an example about applying critical race theory.

128
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:17,349
And again, I think that one kind of error that I see some people doing with applying critical

129
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:20,710
race theory is thinking that there's some like formula for how to do it.

130
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:25,150
And again, it's not it's a process. It's a philosophy. It's a way of looking at things.

131
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:33,700
So this is just an article that was in your reading.

132
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:42,399
This is a popular model, Anderson's model of health outcomes.

133
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:51,490
And it's really looking more at a lot of times the models more use that are more used to look at seeking health care.

134
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,710
But here they were trying to apply it to HIV testing.

135
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:04,150
And so this diagram just kind of shows this is the model as it was originally created.

136
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:16,450
And then when applying critical race theory to it, they added things like in the predisposing factors because this added demographic characteristics.

137
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:26,409
So here they added perceived racism as a factor, also patient satisfaction as being something that could lead to both of these.

138
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:30,460
And this is again based on satisfaction with the services.

139
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:40,780
Keep in mind that for a lot of people of color, the health care environment isn't always a place where they're satisfied or affirmed.

140
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:46,240
So it just kind of shows, you know, one way in which you can apply critical race theory.

141
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:51,730
We have say with the study, actually, King and I were just talking about a colleague of mine in Emory,

142
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:59,440
and we've been doing a study called Open Mind Look at mental health utilization among black women with HIV.

143
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:06,750
And we use that as a model to predict engagement in mental health services.

144
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,460
So, you know, seeking out, seeing the therapist, things like that.

145
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:22,390
And we use both critical race theory and somewhat kind of minority stress theory, our approach to that, too.

146
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:31,600
And so we looked at a number of additional factors, two things that were based on qualitative research.

147
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:39,130
We did first with the community to find out what were some of the race related factors that impact both HIV care and its own health.

148
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:48,430
So when you're applying critical race theory, it's really critical and important that you do this from a truly informed perspective.

149
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:52,780
And then keeping in mind all the tenets of critical race theory that this is really centered

150
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:59,470
around the lived experience of the community in the population and recognizing the role of racism.

151
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:07,840
Another model that Ford and others have created as a public health critical race practices.

152
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:16,149
And so with this, the this is really, again,

153
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:25,540
kind of a framework for how to think about public health research that's informed by critical race theory.

154
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:37,090
And I think one of the the core tenets of this is that even if your research is not about race, racism is still there.

155
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:46,990
Now, even if it's about a population who may not experience racism in the kind of traditional sense,

156
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:52,870
it still is a part of every kind of fabric of people's lives.

157
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:58,689
And so it's important for people to understand that this is worth pointing down.

158
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:09,220
So one of the first steps in this process is to understand how might race or tacit use of the question how migrates have shaped the study aims.

159
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:12,700
So again, it's it's this critical process.

160
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:16,240
So it's not just, okay, I'm going to do this, I do that.

161
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:21,849
But after you have created or while you're creating your aims for your study is really thinking

162
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:30,070
critically about what role race plays or shapes that and then what structural factors are are at play.

163
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:34,000
So it could be related to funding as the example is here,

164
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:46,690
but it could also be other structural factors like lack of access to services or even thinking about your participants in your research project.

165
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:50,530
How are they going to where are you doing the study? How are they going to get there?

166
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:56,230
How are they going to be compensated? I mean, all those things have to be within a racialized context.

167
00:40:56,570 --> 00:41:01,370
And it's really, you know, very times about critical consciousness here.

168
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:10,910
It's talking about having a real racial consciousness and just always being aware of all these factors in the work that you do that we see.

169
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:18,650
All right. So there's four focus areas for for this approach, too.

170
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:23,360
So there's for each area of the research,

171
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:31,700
you should use critical race theory principles to understand the different aspects of contemporary race relations, knowledge, production.

172
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:36,820
So how is knowledge produced? Conceptualizations and measurement.

173
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:41,390
So the measures that you're using in the study, how those measures been used with the ethnic racial groups,

174
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:46,000
and they've been used with populations that are similar to your population.

175
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:52,579
And then the last focus is actions. So really making sure that your research has an action element that it doesn't

176
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:59,750
just get stuck on a shelf somewhere and become another line on someone's CV.

177
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:07,610
So here's the model by focus and then how it's connected with critical race theory.

178
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:16,430
So you see a lot of the elements that we've talked about about racism being a dominant social force,

179
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:25,250
the ordinary ordinariness, social constructions of knowledge, race is a social construct, other things.

180
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:38,000
So when you look at this model, how easy, hard, challenging, not challenging would it be to apply this to an actual research project?

181
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:41,770
What do you think? I know you all haven't probably developed your own research project.

182
00:42:41,790 --> 00:42:47,720
Some of you have worked on research projects. What would this be like to actually apply this in a Real World Research Project?

183
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:59,720
So you had all that fresh air in your brains and then that relaxed load.

184
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:04,630
I know it's kind of a hard question to ask, right? What would be some challenges.

185
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:07,790
Let's do that already. Some challenges with applying this.

186
00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:12,400
Yeah, I think applying it meaningfully instead of just doing sort of check the boxes.

187
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:18,879
Yeah, exactly. Yeah. And I think again, that kind of goes, as I said earlier about, you know, when we think about critical race theory,

188
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:23,920
it's not just checking the boxes off, but it's really a philosophical orientation.

189
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:33,040
Again, sometimes like when you're trying to measure something, it's easy to forget about, like relations and you.

190
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:37,660
Yeah, like the individual kind of aspects when you're looking at the whole thing.

191
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:46,060
Yeah. Yeah. And the measurement is, is huge.

192
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:54,880
And part of it is I'm trained as a psychologist and my training was very heavy into psychometric measurements and things like that.

193
00:43:55,180 --> 00:44:00,639
And, and in public health, I see so many times when we use measures that are not really appropriate for a

194
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:05,470
population and then funding decisions and other decisions are made based on that.

195
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:11,950
And it's really we don't even know we're measuring what we think. Yeah, I was going to mention like H.S.,

196
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:21,460
like when you're looking at your results and some of those results could be produced or not be produced like from in the U.S.,

197
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:26,070
you know that my students that are like other complicating factors.

198
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:34,500
Right. Yeah. And even with that, you know, with intersectionality, it's like it's so tough to disentangle, you know, all that.

199
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:43,839
So like what is kind of what may be more central to someone's self-identification versus how others perceive you?

200
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:45,370
I mean, yeah, it gets really, really complicated.

201
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:52,299
I mean, I was going to say something along those lines, but I was also just thinking about how like time consuming,

202
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:58,520
something like, yes, this is really important research and stuff.

203
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:05,410
Like I like to do things like this at the time to actually do it right.

204
00:45:05,650 --> 00:45:13,570
Yeah. Yeah. No, that's very, very true. So I have a doctoral student, Gabriel Johnson, who's working with me now and he's using this framework.

205
00:45:13,570 --> 00:45:19,600
And also his dissertation is coming from a critical race theory and perspective.

206
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:28,600
And just, you know, he spent a year developing his proposal and really thinking through how do you meaningfully do all it?

207
00:45:28,610 --> 00:45:33,100
So it's not just let's slap this on here, but how do we meaningfully do that?

208
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:39,520
And because he's working with Black Gay by queer and Man, he's also addressing the intersectionality there,

209
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:44,080
too, which makes it even more complicated of taking all those layers and bring them together.

210
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:52,330
Sarah Atlanta. Yeah. Like if you're basing your approaches on past studies being cognizant of like how that information was obtained,

211
00:45:52,330 --> 00:45:55,750
like who obtained it, what were the methodologies in that respect?

212
00:45:56,380 --> 00:46:00,130
Yeah. And that's why we had to do the first assignment.

213
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:06,370
And, and I really encourage you to be like critical as [INAUDIBLE] when you, you know, when looking at articles,

214
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:14,709
I mean, I always journal editors love me and people are trying to get articles published,

215
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:21,520
hate me because I won't like critique the [INAUDIBLE] out of everything because I want to know like how is the community involved in this?

216
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,190
You don't tell us, you know, how were people recruited?

217
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:30,820
Were there ways that you recruited people that will pull for mostly high income or highly mobile people,

218
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,469
you know, things like that because all of those things are going to impact what your outcome looks like.

219
00:46:35,470 --> 00:46:45,100
So yeah, it's really good to be very, very critical of what's come before, you know, that can cause some people to get their feathers ruffled.

220
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:51,820
I definitely have ruffled a few feathers and some of my areas of work by challenging people.

221
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:57,520
And it's funny how like defensive some people get, you know, like their whole life gets wrapped up into the research.

222
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:02,320
I mean, you know, I'm really passionate about it, but, you know, your parents have a life but anyway.

223
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:06,279
But so just to like warn you, if you do start to critique people self,

224
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:12,160
especially as a student, some people may not take it so brightly, but, you know, for for ever.

225
00:47:13,210 --> 00:47:23,470
Excuse me. So I was thinking of like a framework for use this in the real world for research and like after reading it,

226
00:47:23,470 --> 00:47:26,920
like the first thing that came to mind was like the criminal justice system I think would

227
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:34,180
benefit from like this type of framework and especially like using it within like research.

228
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:38,889
And I don't know, I think there's obviously a lot that needs to be fixed by the criminal justice system.

229
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:46,390
But when applying this framework and actually like listening to marginalized communities and addressing the issues that already exist,

230
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:54,820
I think this is definitely a way that that could help the predominantly get into the criminal justice system and work on that system.

231
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:58,180
And it's horrible. I'll just leave it at that.

232
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:07,850
So I was thinking about is like the marginalized. If you're coming in for like a third party, like how you are now completely marginalized,

233
00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:12,069
like you don't want to be the person saying, oh, you're marginalized because like that as a form of oppression.

234
00:48:12,070 --> 00:48:15,670
But at the same time they may not know that they are marginalized to sit again.

235
00:48:16,150 --> 00:48:24,879
I think yeah. No, that's a really good point. And to, you know, even then, you know, even the terms that we use are marginalized.

236
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:28,420
Oppressed, you know, even minorities.

237
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:36,610
I mean, minorities, all these things, the ownership on the side, but in a minority, all those terms, it's they're so subjective in some ways.

238
00:48:36,610 --> 00:48:46,330
I mean, you know, because some people may, by one standard, may not have as much as someone else, but by another standard, they may have much more.

239
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:49,359
So yeah, and this is something that I always see.

240
00:48:49,360 --> 00:49:01,510
And, you know, in Kenya and a lot of the communities that I work in, you know, some folks don't have much material by U.S. standards,

241
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:06,399
but in terms of like social connectedness and love and, you know,

242
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:11,620
other things like that, they're much more abundant than a lot of folks here, you know?

243
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:19,269
And so it's just really interesting, I think, having those different, you know, viewpoints and perspectives, you know,

244
00:49:19,270 --> 00:49:26,290
because a lot of folks that I work with say, well, no, I'm not I'm not poor because I have I have food to eat.

245
00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:31,750
I have a house to stay in, and I have what I need and I have lots of friends and I have a great job.

246
00:49:31,990 --> 00:49:39,880
So I'm rich in many ways. So it is really interesting about who's defining what is oppressed, what is marginalized, things like that.

247
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:47,050
Well, I know like my freshman year, I'm almost like still thinking about it,

248
00:49:47,350 --> 00:50:02,410
but you guys can spend our money for not including that were it was mostly focused on like oh yeah, every year.

249
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:10,780
Yeah. And stuff like that. So definitely like so around like intersectionality and like race as a social construct.

250
00:50:10,910 --> 00:50:22,210
Like we would often see like how if they were like more culturally tailored than any other of like outcomes, right?

251
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:28,930
Meanwhile, like if the studies were only like catering to like specific groups, then like it wouldn't be like seems like the same.

252
00:50:30,130 --> 00:50:32,080
Yeah, I think that's true.

253
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:40,239
I mentioned before about, you know, Latin excuse me, Asian communities are, you know, also very complex and we use that term.

254
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,250
I mean, there's always that could be included in there.

255
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:49,180
And like know one thing you're saying about the culture is specific ones are closely tailored being much more effective.

256
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:53,490
I mean, we see that over and over and over again. But I think the challenge is back to what you're saying.

257
00:50:53,550 --> 00:51:03,340
Things like this is really time consuming, right? So a lot of times people don't have time and money to do studies in the way they should be done.

258
00:51:04,870 --> 00:51:10,690
And so unfortunately, we end up getting a lot of really [INAUDIBLE] research that's going on out there.

259
00:51:11,770 --> 00:51:13,540
All right. So we got through that one.

260
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:30,280
We are going to I don't know if that's so I'm going to go through this next one super fast because we are behind with our predetermined schedule,

261
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:41,500
although schedules are always evolving. So how does anyone know who Mazie Hirono is in person from Hawaii?

262
00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:46,959
She is amazing. If you don't know where you need to get to know her. I mean, I don't know personally.

263
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:55,210
It's always been up to you or anything, but I just love this quote from her says, I bring quadruple diversity to the Senate.

264
00:51:55,210 --> 00:51:59,620
I'm a woman. I'll be the first Asian woman ever to be elected to the U.S. Senate.

265
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:07,420
I'm an immigrant. I'm a Buddhist. When I said this at one of my gatherings, I said, yes, but are you gay?

266
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:20,560
And I said, Nobody's perfect. So obviously I got a little biased by some of the readings under this section.

267
00:52:21,190 --> 00:52:35,079
And what I tried to do is to pick different approaches to looking at how to apply critical theories to public health interventions.

268
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:41,920
And so, again, I'm not sure that we're going to breeze through this and then we're going to jump more into cultural humility.

269
00:52:42,370 --> 00:52:53,349
But if you haven't read this, it is, I think, a really interesting study on crowd funding for transgender health care.

270
00:52:53,350 --> 00:53:01,690
And it's pretty sad that people have to do that in order to get gender affirming care.

271
00:53:02,050 --> 00:53:08,830
A lot of times, you know, using Facebook and other social media sources.

272
00:53:12,350 --> 00:53:17,290
How many people did read this? And I think just a few.

273
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:40,530
I would encourage you to read it because it is, I think. It's a different approach to thinking about health care that says people have no.

274
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:48,959
Well, I'm going to skip this one because if you haven't read it,

275
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:53,760
I won't be able to ask the questions I wanted to ask, but I'd encourage you to read it.

276
00:53:54,480 --> 00:54:00,680
Also, than one of the other articles talked about suicide prevention for rural indigenous communities.

277
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:08,130
And it looks at an alternative to suicide prevention programing.

278
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:12,090
And so they they talk about.

279
00:54:12,330 --> 00:54:22,230
So this was a model developed really with people from the community to look at the whole concept of suicide from different approaches.

280
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:33,990
I think that, you know, in I would say in the US, we, we seem to have a general framework that suicide is something that's not good.

281
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:43,980
And, you know, it's illegal to kill yourself. I mean, there's so many different both direct and indirect messaging around that.

282
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:53,590
But I think that it's also important for us to keep in mind that in different communities and cultures, suicide may mean very different things.

283
00:54:53,610 --> 00:54:59,610
You know, it could be an honorable thing. It could be seen in a variety of different ways.

284
00:54:59,610 --> 00:55:07,379
So when you're developing programs around this, especially working with the indigenous,

285
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:17,110
I think this was done in Canada for a while since I read it with local populations and really just taking a very different approach to that.

286
00:55:17,130 --> 00:55:24,690
So I thinking about, you know, utilizing critical approaches, critical race theory and other critical approaches.

287
00:55:25,110 --> 00:55:31,350
Even looking at your health outcome critically is really important because we may value certain things,

288
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:36,600
but the communities with which we're working may view those health outcomes a different way.

289
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:42,960
So another clear example is, you know, the flurry of work and programs around obesity.

290
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:47,760
You know, how do we define obesity? What are the meanings of obesity?

291
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:51,810
You know, there's even a whole movement in the past, probably ten years or so.

292
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:56,700
And there's a whole academic movement called fat studies.

293
00:55:56,700 --> 00:56:07,470
And there's journals about studies that really talk about how being larger does not necessarily equate to health risks.

294
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:12,150
Then you can be a larger person and still be very healthy.

295
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:14,000
And so but, you know,

296
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:22,350
coming in from a public health framework where we're really kind of like have it being in your head that you have to have a particular body weight.

297
00:56:22,770 --> 00:56:25,440
And we're not really looking at things that are more important,

298
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:29,750
like what is your cholesterol level, what is your blood pressure, what is your resting heart rate?

299
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:39,150
I mean, all these other kind of things are better predictors of health outcomes then are just how big you are, you know, how big your body is.

300
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:50,309
And that's, you know, so I think that thinking about critical race theory and our public health interventions,

301
00:56:50,310 --> 00:56:55,049
we really have to engage in this process from the very beginning.

302
00:56:55,050 --> 00:56:58,770
Like so if someone, you know, if you're working in the health department and they're like,

303
00:56:58,770 --> 00:57:03,690
Oh, we have new funding to do research on X first, find out what does X even mean.

304
00:57:04,050 --> 00:57:12,510
So whether it's alcoholism or, you know, who defines what alcoholism is, who defines what extensive alcohol use is.

305
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:23,160
So that's another thing that I've seen in in Kenya is that there are fine US standards, especially in the LGBT community.

306
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:32,240
There's really high rates of substance use, but alcohol use, part of that is because alcohol is cheaper.

307
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:35,970
The alcohol content in a lot of the beer is much lower,

308
00:57:37,110 --> 00:57:44,220
and gathering spaces where alcohol is involved is one of the few places where people can be safe.

309
00:57:44,730 --> 00:57:51,780
And so if you take measures that were developed in the US in other contexts and you apply them,

310
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:57,210
you know, most of the people turn out having what's called a hazardous substance use.

311
00:57:57,780 --> 00:58:04,620
But within that local context it's not. I mean, people are functional, people don't have any negative health outcomes from it.

312
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:08,990
I remember the first couple of times when I was working,

313
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:16,290
I have a beer called Tusker and it comes in this big ass bottle and people order them in twos.

314
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:24,240
Now I don't drink alcohol, I never have, so I don't really know what it would be, but what Tusker is like.

315
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:31,350
But people drink it like water and you know, we can have meetings where people will down like six or eight of them.

316
00:58:31,710 --> 00:58:40,050
Yeah. And I was like, oh my God, I would assume that, you know, in the US you'd probably be, you know, on the floor or something.

317
00:58:40,410 --> 00:58:45,150
But I mean, we can go. I've had meetings since I got to our meeting where the.

318
00:58:45,210 --> 00:58:48,300
Go through six or eight and they're totally fine mountains.

319
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:55,110
Yeah. Yeah. So I don't. I don't know what's in it or what's not in Arnold's tolerance.

320
00:58:55,530 --> 00:59:03,680
But, you know, again, we have to be really careful because, again, in the U.S., that would be considered, you know, vintage regime.

321
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:12,690
But in there, it's Tuesday. It's and then we had to be really careful with how we we conceptualize our our health outcomes.

322
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:17,940
Seems to me I'm going to skip that.

323
00:59:18,210 --> 00:59:26,450
There we go. That was really easy. And I mean, a lot of the stuff or concepts we've already talked about here now.

324
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:32,700
And if you ever go to Kenya, hopefully you won't start trying it down.

325
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:45,630
So many customers. And yeah, it's really it's really weird there because Diet Coke Zero, which is my drink of choice in Kenya,

326
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:59,280
is so much more expensive than beer, like a little tiny 12 ounce bottle of Coke Zero cause as much as two large beers.

327
01:00:00,030 --> 01:00:05,460
So, you know, again, if you think about just what people can afford, you know, to drink one little.

328
01:00:06,650 --> 01:00:10,220
Not that tiny, but one small thing, you know,

329
01:00:10,230 --> 01:00:16,940
a little I thought about it things like how sometimes I get like thinking like movie theaters are concerts,

330
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:24,350
like they'll sell like a, you know, like a fountain, soda, whatever, for like $2 and like, a bottle of water is like $6, is that it?

331
01:00:24,470 --> 01:00:32,770
Yeah, it really is. Yeah, it's. It's pretty wild. All right, so if anyone ever tries Tusker, tell me what you know, what?

332
01:00:32,910 --> 01:00:37,270
What it's like to just. Yeah. Yeah.

333
01:00:37,310 --> 01:00:47,090
In this last trip. And then I was up above that Husker, we were with one of my projects that we're doing that lesbian bi queer women.

334
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:57,550
We had a meeting at this outside cafe place and that one, they didn't have a town.

335
01:00:57,910 --> 01:01:01,910
It begins as your order. I'm in twos, which, again, I don't understand that either.

336
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:10,700
But the one one person was doing them pretty quickly and I just kept waiting for her to like fall off the bench.

337
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:16,280
And she just didn't tell me. She was like not even vaguely signing up to do that.

338
01:01:16,370 --> 01:01:19,550
So we're talking about culture humility. What is cultural humility? Who knows?

339
01:01:22,580 --> 01:01:32,330
Abigail That's like going into like community and recognizing that you don't know like everything about them and like being willing to learn that,

340
01:01:33,380 --> 01:01:36,670
like the culture. Okay, good.

341
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:38,480
That's one part of it. Yeah. What else?

342
01:01:39,830 --> 01:01:48,170
If you're in the undergrad program, I think one of the guiding principles of the undergrad program is pulling down an 11 year old girl.

343
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:53,680
So you should all know it. You're all majors, right?

344
01:01:54,290 --> 01:02:00,620
I should give you a principal quiz. What are the ten principles for the Undergraduate Program on Public Health?

345
01:02:01,580 --> 01:02:05,420
Did you know you have guiding principles? Like I said, I know one out of ten.

346
01:02:05,450 --> 01:02:10,040
Okay. Well, when is called to your abilities?

347
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:22,719
Because I like anyone else, I think it extends cultural competency.

348
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:27,310
And it's not just like being aware of a lot of different drivers license fees,

349
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:31,390
but the structures that contribute to those and how that can play into your health.

350
01:02:32,530 --> 01:02:36,480
Yeah. Like similar to like the difference between health disparity and health inequity.

351
01:02:36,490 --> 01:02:36,770
Right?

352
01:02:36,790 --> 01:02:45,550
So health disparities, I know things are different, but inequities realizes those structural, systematic, you know, challenges, things like that.

353
01:02:46,060 --> 01:02:49,420
So some of the answers are right here.

354
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:55,720
Yeah, I would go stand in front of it to block it from figuring that would just look stupid.

355
01:02:56,050 --> 01:03:02,800
But, you know, when we're well, there's a lot of conferences that really progress from website culture comments,

356
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:08,230
he says, I'm the expert culture M.D. says you're the expert over conferences and product culture.

357
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:13,660
Humility is a lifelong process. Cultural competency implies an objective set of best practices.

358
01:03:13,660 --> 01:03:23,410
Culpability implies a subjective set of best practices. Again, similar to critical race theory, it's not a formula you follow, it's a process.

359
01:03:23,410 --> 01:03:34,480
And and it very much is in alignment with our approach to the critical pedagogy, critical consciousness, things like that.

360
01:03:34,930 --> 01:03:40,450
So when we're talking about cultural competence, we're just talked about a lot.

361
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:54,850
So this is the idea that you can become competent in someone else's culture so you can understand, you know, what are the different practices?

362
01:03:54,850 --> 01:03:59,200
How do people view health care, especially cultural competence specific to health,

363
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:10,480
and also recognizing that different cultures conceptualize health, wellness, disease differently?

364
01:04:11,290 --> 01:04:17,469
And so understand so just like I was talking about, you know, if you drink six tuskers,

365
01:04:17,470 --> 01:04:20,650
that may not be substance abuse because of a particular culture.

366
01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:22,120
Again, that's Tuesday.

367
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:35,860
Also, how do people think about health and wellness and what kind of practices do they use to move to a state of wellness or to a state of health?

368
01:04:36,190 --> 01:04:40,470
So do you go to a faith healer or do you go to a traditional doctor?

369
01:04:40,750 --> 01:04:45,490
Even if you do go to doctors, do you go to someone who's more doctor, osteopathic or traditional,

370
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:49,600
medical doctor or chiropractor or an acupuncturist, things like that.

371
01:04:49,990 --> 01:04:58,510
So it's really trying to understand that and then also understanding what cross-cultural communication is.

372
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:01,750
So how do people communicate in different cultures?

373
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:12,400
So for example, in some cultures that you're working in, it may be inappropriate to make direct eye contact, especially across sex and gender.

374
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:17,350
And so being aware of that or in other cultures,

375
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:25,930
it could be that you only talk to the elder in the family and you don't talk to younger members of the family.

376
01:05:26,290 --> 01:05:30,070
So really knowing culturally what is appropriate.

377
01:05:31,090 --> 01:05:36,290
So those are, I think, some aspects that I think most of would argue those are good things too,

378
01:05:36,310 --> 01:05:43,720
to know that the challenges are with cultural competency that a lot of Italian makes right now or not.

379
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:54,160
Is that with cultural competence? There's this underlying belief that, you know, all these things and then you know about that culture.

380
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:58,810
So you learn all these things and then you can implement them.

381
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:07,110
So just an example in this, like my training back in the 1800s when I was no,

382
01:06:08,090 --> 01:06:14,440
it was in the 1980s when I was in grad school for planning and saying we would take classes.

383
01:06:16,450 --> 01:06:21,549
Our diversity classes were learning about different ethnic,

384
01:06:21,550 --> 01:06:27,790
racial families and then how to work with children and families from these different ethnic racial groups.

385
01:06:27,790 --> 01:06:34,270
So we would have a section on the black family like there is just one black family,

386
01:06:35,050 --> 01:06:40,600
and then we would have a section on the Latino family and then the Asian family.

387
01:06:40,810 --> 01:06:48,250
I mean, that's seriously what the training was like. And so you would read these chapters like for the black family, religion is important.

388
01:06:48,610 --> 01:06:54,040
So ask them about their religion, you know, and they are the Latino family.

389
01:06:54,220 --> 01:07:01,450
Religion is important. So some of our girls are Asians and respect is important.

390
01:07:01,660 --> 01:07:04,889
So make sure you respect that. I mean, it was like really scary.

391
01:07:04,890 --> 01:07:08,680
And so that's kind of how it was, you know?

392
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:11,889
And so you're like, Oh, I'm going to work for the black family now.

393
01:07:11,890 --> 01:07:13,270
Let me get my manual out.

394
01:07:14,510 --> 01:07:28,760
And I can see what I'm supposed to do or say, even to the point where during some of my training they would match you with a therapist,

395
01:07:28,850 --> 01:07:34,610
a more senior therapist of a certain race or ethnicity so you could learn how to work with that race or ethnicity.

396
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:47,720
So I remember having my black family supervisor for my black family clinical pace, who would then teach me about black families.

397
01:07:47,930 --> 01:07:56,630
So that's the cultural competence model. So I am culturally competent to deal with black families, Latino representation families.

398
01:07:57,520 --> 01:08:11,900
Others didn't exist in that way. The other thing, too, is like early in the HIV pandemic, when when I was doing work again early, early on,

399
01:08:12,740 --> 01:08:19,700
when they were trying to train a psychologist to work with families and children,

400
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:28,760
adolescents impacted by HIV, you would have different training modules for general practice.

401
01:08:29,060 --> 01:08:37,780
And then there was the black HIV module and then the Hispanic HIV modules, and that was it.

402
01:08:37,830 --> 01:08:40,310
So sorry, everyone else. Those were the only two.

403
01:08:40,610 --> 01:08:49,940
And so I had to get certified by the Red Cross and black families, and then I got certified in Hispanic families.

404
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:59,660
So that was kind of to me even back then, I think I was pretty critical on my friends that make any sense.

405
01:08:59,690 --> 01:09:07,010
I mean, like, there are so many different elements and aspects and you know, stuff like that, but that's the cultural competence model.

406
01:09:07,220 --> 01:09:15,590
Now some medical training still utilizes somewhat of a similar framework, not so blatant, but for different populations.

407
01:09:15,590 --> 01:09:20,570
So there will be an LGBT health training.

408
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:29,030
And most of the research shows that medical students get 3 to 5 hours total of training on LGBT health.

409
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:37,219
And I've actually been asked by different med schools to come in and give a talk on that.

410
01:09:37,220 --> 01:09:44,930
And I actually refused because I'm like, No, you're not going to take my entire community and boils down to a one hour lecture.

411
01:09:46,940 --> 01:09:52,429
So that's the competence model. Now, what's wrong with that model? Because I got all kinds of certificates.

412
01:09:52,430 --> 01:09:53,780
I mean, I can't wait. You know,

413
01:09:54,110 --> 01:10:03,019
I got all let's get skills that one thing I'm thinking about as like the examples in the reading where a black nurse said

414
01:10:03,020 --> 01:10:10,950
that she heard the Latina woman was the patient and she was complaining about like pain problems in the black nurse.

415
01:10:10,970 --> 01:10:15,690
Like all I learned in this class, like they're just going to exaggerated,

416
01:10:15,710 --> 01:10:22,520
which I'm like girl was like, that's a little form of like how that's put into practice,

417
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:29,710
like the things that you're taught and like sometimes like I can't really understand it, but I guess if you're taught that as fact,

418
01:10:29,990 --> 01:10:36,130
you don't have any like classes like this where you're like, you know, like I forgot the problem, right?

419
01:10:36,140 --> 01:10:41,330
Yeah. I can push back on that if you're taught that as fact and you're going to put that into your practice.

420
01:10:41,870 --> 01:10:44,950
And like the example, there was someone who was like, No,

421
01:10:45,140 --> 01:10:49,340
but there might not be that person might not get the care that they need because of

422
01:10:49,340 --> 01:10:55,550
these false notion that that person is going to continue doing throughout their course.

423
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:58,770
I mean, that course throughout their work as a nurse right now. Yeah.

424
01:10:58,770 --> 01:11:06,290
And I think that's a really good point is like I do love the term and Garcia article because Motor City because they give such real,

425
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:09,020
like real world examples that really illustrate the points.

426
01:11:09,350 --> 01:11:19,129
And you know, I think it's particularly heightened in medical training because like you said, you're you're trained technically.

427
01:11:19,130 --> 01:11:22,880
So it's like this is what you do, right? So if you have these symptoms, you do this.

428
01:11:23,300 --> 01:11:30,350
Whereas like in other fields, like in psychology, we are trained so to that, but we're also trained to be analytical and clinical and all that.

429
01:11:30,650 --> 01:11:35,810
But in the medical field, a lot of it is really about, Oh, I need to do this protocol.

430
01:11:36,110 --> 01:11:44,719
And so if, like you said, if you're taught that, then it's easy to then translate that into your work because that's just how you do things.

431
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:48,140
So because of that, all the aspects of your training.

432
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:52,280
Yeah. Excellent. Yeah. You set off for that.

433
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:55,650
Like, it's so interesting like that.

434
01:11:55,690 --> 01:11:59,470
A like it's boiled down to a one hour lecture for like, most of these topics.

435
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:02,920
And sometimes I'll just combine, like, race and ethnicity plus.

436
01:12:02,930 --> 01:12:06,970
Oh, yeah, I want to, like, all world day, a little rich, you know,

437
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:13,400
because and it's interesting just the way that med school is set up, like one of my friends, like you're studying 16, 18 hours of.

438
01:12:13,660 --> 01:12:19,390
Sleeping like 4 hours a day because they're telling you, like all these classes are super important, whatever.

439
01:12:20,290 --> 01:12:28,180
So it's already just a setup. It's like making like classes that do teach you this content are supposed to write on the back burner, you know?

440
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:33,410
And then, like in residency, you get like one day to go do like a little presentation.

441
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:41,980
So again, it's just like putting it on the back burner, which I've been promotes, like the bulbs that are seen in culture.

442
01:12:42,490 --> 01:12:50,020
Yeah, yeah. I remember there was one time where I did agree to come talk to a group of residents because I figured they'd be a little more advanced.

443
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:56,049
And I actually stopped in the middle and just called them out and said, you know,

444
01:12:56,050 --> 01:13:00,100
because they were like some of them were halfway sleeping somewhere, like texting.

445
01:13:00,370 --> 01:13:04,179
And I'm like, look, I'm if you're going to continue this, I'm walking out the door.

446
01:13:04,180 --> 01:13:10,270
You know, this is not for me. I know this. And, you know, and, you know, they all scrambled and stuff like that.

447
01:13:10,270 --> 01:13:18,639
And, you know, I did finish and the person in charge was a little shocked at my bluntness with it,

448
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:23,440
but it was like it was [INAUDIBLE] because it was really it was a tack on to something and

449
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:27,069
it was clear they didn't really give a [INAUDIBLE] and they didn't really want to be there.

450
01:13:27,070 --> 01:13:31,420
Like you said, they're exhausted because the training doesn't prioritize this, right?

451
01:13:31,750 --> 01:13:37,240
So if I have to talk to someone after they've been doing something else for 12 hours or coming off the floor,

452
01:13:37,630 --> 01:13:41,230
you know, for a week, it's not going to sink in.

453
01:13:41,410 --> 01:13:44,649
It's just going to be, you know, some icing that you're putting on top of the cake.

454
01:13:44,650 --> 01:13:49,870
But, you know, there's no feeling in the middle. That's a really bad analogy, I guess.

455
01:13:49,870 --> 01:13:57,310
I'm hungry and yeah, I kind of want to add on to that and just kind of seeing like within like medical practice nowadays, like,

456
01:13:57,880 --> 01:14:03,490
you know, like there's been articles and studies about it saying that like doctors and people in the medical field in general have.

457
01:14:03,490 --> 01:14:07,930
So we become like numb to the sort of like caring and feeling of, to their patients.

458
01:14:07,930 --> 01:14:11,229
And so even like if you go to like a regular checkup or whatever,

459
01:14:11,230 --> 01:14:16,000
it's kind of like just let's get this patient done so we can go to the next group, whatever it may be.

460
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:24,459
And I think that just like within that schooling process, it kind of takes it like numbs that sort of like empathy or whatever it is.

461
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:32,460
And so also just not being considerate then in that terms and just like adding, yeah, I think, you know,

462
01:14:32,470 --> 01:14:41,160
some of that too is the kind of corporatization of health care, you know, in this country and like, you know, how many billable, you know,

463
01:14:41,170 --> 01:14:47,530
I what's more long billable hours but I mean like how many patients you can see within a certain time frame and you know,

464
01:14:47,530 --> 01:14:51,339
how much you can spend with them and always thinking about the next patient because,

465
01:14:51,340 --> 01:14:55,330
you know, you only have 10 minutes or, you know, so along with them.

466
01:14:56,170 --> 01:15:07,239
And then I think that then coupled with the training you were talking about then really heightens the use of stereotypes and the use

467
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:14,230
of frameworks that you just apply to the next patient because you know that you only have 10 minutes and you've got to go again,

468
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:20,200
again, again. I remember one time when I came back from Kenya, I was like violently ill.

469
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:23,739
There was like the only time I got to get medevacked back to the US,

470
01:15:23,740 --> 01:15:29,530
which is cool because I got to fly first class, although I was like flying shirt and couldn't move.

471
01:15:29,770 --> 01:15:35,800
But anyway, they were trying to figure out what what I had, what kind of infection or whatever.

472
01:15:36,190 --> 01:15:42,940
And so I waited like three months to see this tropical medicine specialist at Northwestern University.

473
01:15:42,950 --> 01:15:55,930
She seems to be this like super amazing person. And as soon as she found out that I was gay, she kept asking if I had had an HIV test.

474
01:15:57,400 --> 01:16:01,780
And I must have told her 20 times, Yes, I'm negative.

475
01:16:02,020 --> 01:16:11,020
Didn't ask about any behaviors, didn't even ask. She just assumed because I'm a gay man that I was, you know, engaging in unprotected sex or sex mode.

476
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:14,800
You know, she she asked me it was literally like three or four times.

477
01:16:15,670 --> 01:16:22,090
It's like, don't you think if I waited three months for you and I've been through all these tests, but in her mind, that's all she could see.

478
01:16:23,050 --> 01:16:28,990
And even before that, I think I mentioned my husband, and that's when she was like, Oh, you're gay, HIV.

479
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:31,839
You know, she was asking other questions.

480
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:39,220
But I think that happens to for a lot of people based on race and gender and other things, like they just make these assumptions.

481
01:16:40,660 --> 01:16:53,320
So I think that cultural competence trainings can increase the likelihood that that occurs if it's not done from a more critical lens or perspective.

482
01:16:53,980 --> 01:17:01,840
So with cultural humility and the tribal on the Garcia article, it's an older article, but it's still, I think, rings true.

483
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:10,780
So with this, it's really this this commitment to active travel, a lifelong process.

484
01:17:10,780 --> 01:17:17,100
I mean, we're we're all learners at all points. I mean, no matter how many degrees you stack up, you're still learning every day.

485
01:17:17,940 --> 01:17:21,830
And you really need to be. You never stop.

486
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:26,280
Like, you never get to a point where, like, I'm done. You know, I'm always learning and I'm always growing.

487
01:17:26,610 --> 01:17:31,350
And so it's really about the self-evaluation, this critical analysis,

488
01:17:31,740 --> 01:17:39,560
and thinking about power imbalances or thinking about what kind of power might I have in the space when I'm working with this community?

489
01:17:39,570 --> 01:17:46,440
How might that be playing out? Also having, you know,

490
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:54,240
partnerships with the communities that we're working with to make sure that we're learning as much from them as they are from us,

491
01:17:54,600 --> 01:18:00,780
and then having that mutual trust, which is really critically important. If you don't if people don't trust you, it doesn't matter.

492
01:18:00,780 --> 01:18:04,979
You can do really amazing things and it's not going to do [INAUDIBLE]. And so, you know,

493
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:14,550
cultural humility is really this concept idea that we are never truly competent in another person's culture and that we always have to be learning.

494
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:20,579
Now, one thing to keep in mind, and someone brought this up before in this general region,

495
01:18:20,580 --> 01:18:24,330
I'm a special kind of person, so I know it's talked about in this area,

496
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:37,680
but is that the ownership should not necessarily be on the populations you're working with to do all that work, you know, you have to do the work.

497
01:18:38,100 --> 01:18:43,140
So if you're working in another community or culture, do your homework first and then ask questions.

498
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:47,040
Don't come in like, oh, I don't know anything about, you know,

499
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:53,610
people from Bangladesh and I'm going to work with this community and I'm just going to come in and just start throwing questions at you,

500
01:18:54,270 --> 01:19:03,150
do your damn work. I mean, especially with an Internet, you know, so like an old man, the German Internet and Facebook and Twitter,

501
01:19:04,110 --> 01:19:12,300
with all those things, you should be able to do a fair amount of work before you even get into actually talking to him.

502
01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:23,520
All right. So we're going to stop there. What actually kind of sort of a little bit about us and that we will do on Thursday and Thursday.

503
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:30,299
We want you to journal the lives of you have it today and you want to give it to me.

504
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:31,050
I'm going to take it.
