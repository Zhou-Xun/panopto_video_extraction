1
00:00:05,855 --> 00:00:08,880
Hello, my name is Peter Jacobson.

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,340
I'm professor emeritus in the Department
of Health Management and Policy.

3
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:18,210
Today, I'll be talking about the United
States health care delivery system.

4
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:22,550
So we'll be looking at a general
overview of the system,

5
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:27,810
that includes key organizing
principles and framing concepts.

6
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:32,540
How the system is structured, how it's
financed, how health care is delivered.

7
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:38,020
And then we'll talk about how we regulate
health care at both the state and

8
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,750
federal levels.

9
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:45,150
Keep in mind throughout
the presentation some key questions

10
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:49,360
that you should consider asking and
answering.

11
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,001
First, one of the strengths and
weaknesses of the US health care system.

12
00:00:54,001 --> 00:00:57,807
Second, given those strengths and
weaknesses,

13
00:00:57,807 --> 00:01:02,480
what changes would you make
to improve the system?

14
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,870
Third, would you prefer being
a patient in the United States or

15
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,340
in some other country?

16
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,810
If the latter, which one and why?

17
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:16,574
And finally, what are the criteria
you would use to assess how

18
00:01:16,574 --> 00:01:20,154
well the US health care
system is performing?

19
00:01:20,154 --> 00:01:25,690
So let's look first at some of
the key organizing principles.

20
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:30,540
We can start at the top of the circle,
with the fact

21
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,270
that it's market-based system
with some governmental oversight.

22
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:38,930
That's what we'll really
be focusing on today.

23
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:45,410
Effectively, it's really a non-system,
in part because it's decentralized.

24
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:50,730
That is, there's no single
point of system accountability,

25
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:54,110
which gives us diffused responsibility.

26
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:58,950
As I said before, with regulation
at the state and federal levels,

27
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:03,530
plus how the market regulates or
self-regulates.

28
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:07,605
And it's organized into different sectors,
and

29
00:02:07,605 --> 00:02:10,740
that's what we will be considering today.

30
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:15,110
What are the sectors and
how do they function?

31
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,100
Second, the system is really
characterized right now by rapid changes.

32
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:25,890
From one thing, there's considerable
consolidation at the level

33
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:30,310
who finances health care, the insurers,
and who provides health care and

34
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:34,610
the consolidation into larger and
larger systems.

35
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:38,170
At the same time,
it's quite innovative, and

36
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:42,050
there's far more entrepreneurial activity,

37
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:47,410
particularly through the use of
venture capital, now than ever before.

38
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,770
One question to think about, though, is,

39
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:54,520
how does this affect the mix of profit and
non-profit?

40
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:59,410
For most of its history, healthcare
has been largely non-profit with,

41
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:02,650
as we'll see, considerable profit.

42
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:06,480
After all, physicians are profit seekers.

43
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,340
At the same time, we're seeing more and
more venture capital

44
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:16,790
shifting a lot of health care
to a more for-profit system.

45
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:21,680
We also see a mix of public and
private providers.

46
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,600
That includes public and
private insurers, public and

47
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:29,620
private providers of health care.

48
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,640
And a mix of federal and

49
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:36,780
state responsibilities,
it's heavily regulated system.

50
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,780
As a final organizing principle,

51
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:43,730
keep in mind that there is
no right to health care.

52
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:48,060
While the Affordable Care Act makes
health care more affordable and

53
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:54,190
available to many Americans, especially
through the expansion of Medicaid.

54
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:59,840
We don't have a single payer
system in the United States,

55
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,440
and we don't have a right to health care.

56
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:08,430
So let's look at some of
the key framing concepts here.

57
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:11,974
We can start with the fact
that public health and

58
00:04:11,974 --> 00:04:14,730
medical care are separate systems.

59
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:18,710
While there's considerable
interaction among the two, or

60
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:23,290
between the two systems,
they are technically very separate.

61
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:28,540
With medical care absorbing
about 97% of all dollars

62
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:34,210
spent on health, and
3% going to public health.

63
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:39,812
What you might think about in terms of
defining the separation is that the health

64
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:45,630
care system is really based on
individual's, primarily, clinical care.

65
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:50,400
In contrast, the public health system
thinks about population health,

66
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,380
that is, keeping the community healthy.

67
00:04:54,380 --> 00:05:01,630
Second, as we discussed above,
health care really is emerging more as

68
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:08,540
a business enterprise with
a considerable non-profit aspect to it.

69
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:12,110
So it raises the question of,
who owns the health care system?

70
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:14,903
Is it the shareholders of
the for-profit enterprises?

71
00:05:14,903 --> 00:05:16,503
Is it the community?

72
00:05:16,503 --> 00:05:20,910
Or the non-profit health care systems?

73
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:25,600
A third framing concept is
the role of competition policy.

74
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,821
I think of competition policy
generally as the government's

75
00:05:29,821 --> 00:05:32,183
oversight of the private sector.

76
00:05:32,183 --> 00:05:36,870
That would include how we tax,
the role of tax exemption,

77
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:43,590
the role of antitrust in dealing with the
consolidation in the health care system.

78
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:48,050
And then the role of health policy,
the Affordable Care Act, again,

79
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:54,490
being the most important recent
aspect of health policy.

80
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:58,800
A fourth concept is
the employer-based insurance system.

81
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:05,940
For historical reasons, much of how the
system is organized conceptually is around

82
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:12,870
large employers providing healthcare
insurance for their employees.

83
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:17,970
For those who don't work in large
employers, how do they get insurance?

84
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,980
We'll talk about that later.

85
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:25,870
As noted, the system is seeing
increasing consolidation into larger and

86
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,650
larger players.

87
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:31,100
Primarily the insurers
with really three or

88
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:35,170
four major national insurance companies,
and

89
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:39,790
certainly, a variety of
local commercial insurers.

90
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:42,550
But also larger and larger health systems.

91
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:47,420
It's becoming harder and harder for
a community-based hospital

92
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:53,020
to survive without being part
of a larger health system.

93
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:57,481
One concept that continues to
be problematic in health care is

94
00:06:57,481 --> 00:07:01,020
the coordination of care is fragmented.

95
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,210
Because it's decentralized,

96
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:08,385
there's no easy way to coordinate
care across different providers.

97
00:07:08,385 --> 00:07:13,605
If, for example, you move from a primary
care provider to a specialist,

98
00:07:13,605 --> 00:07:18,840
to inpatient care, to post-acute care,
how is that care coordinated?

99
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:24,670
And then how do we keep people healthy
once they leave the health care system?

100
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:29,356
To date, because it's largely a fee for
service system,

101
00:07:29,356 --> 00:07:34,520
which means that payment is arranged
based on prescribed fee for

102
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:39,130
a particular service,
the emphasis has been on volume.

103
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:44,560
Increasing volume is how health
care providers make their money,

104
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,360
rather than providing value.

105
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:53,470
And one of the policy challenges is to
make the shift from volume to value.

106
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:56,850
Because of the consolidation and
lack of coordination,

107
00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:02,420
the policy focuses then on
the integration of care and systems.

108
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:07,950
And that includes how to integrate
population health defined, as

109
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:14,390
I said before, through the public health
system with the clinical care encounter?

110
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:20,000
And how do we provide the right
incentives for health care systems

111
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,200
to coordinate care so that quality
is improved and costs are lowered?

112
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:30,280
And one organization has built
a conceptual framework for

113
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:34,300
addressing the integration of care and
systems.

114
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:41,051
And that is the Triple Aim,
the institute for health care innovation.

115
00:08:41,051 --> 00:08:45,943
And it's designed to improve
the experience of health care,

116
00:08:45,943 --> 00:08:52,270
improve the population's health, and
reduce per capita cost of health care.

117
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:58,820
So as an overview to the system, we might
look at the fact that it's high cost and

118
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:03,990
modest quality relative to
European Union countries.

119
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:11,272
Despite the enactment of the Affordable
Care Act, we still have around 12.5% or

120
00:09:11,272 --> 00:09:15,970
so, 12% people without health insurance.

121
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:21,470
Now, that's down from 18 to
20% just a few years ago,

122
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:28,080
so the trend is definitely in the right
direction, but it's got a long ways to go.

123
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,540
We've had robust policy debates.

124
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:34,050
Those of you who have followed, first,

125
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:38,700
the enactment of
the Affordable Health Care Act, and then

126
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:44,160
the subsequent attempt in congress
to repeal and replace the act.

127
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,220
Know that the health policy
debates have been quite robust,

128
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:52,410
with little consensus,
expect for one fact.

129
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:57,487
Almost every one agrees now that
people should be protected from

130
00:09:57,487 --> 00:10:02,990
exclusions based on their
preexisting health care conditions.

131
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:06,070
That is, they should be able
to get insurance regardless

132
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:08,650
of what their health status has been.

133
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:11,230
And one aspect to keep in mind

134
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:14,280
throughout is that we live
in a culture of technology.

135
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,640
We think that more technology is better,
and for the most part, that's right.

136
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,790
But when we're depending on
that culture of technology,

137
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:27,300
it tends to have high cost
implications and access implications,

138
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:31,700
if people can't afford the new technology.

139
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:36,970
As a result, the system suffers
from several structural flaws.

140
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:42,730
The incentives in fee-for-service
medicine are to increase volume,

141
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:49,370
as noted before, there's poor coordination
of care, very fragmented system.

142
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:51,630
Access remains a problem.

143
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:55,800
As Enthoven and Kronick said in 2009,

144
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,250
we live in a paradox of excess and
deprivation.

145
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:04,228
If you look at technology, we have an
excess of the best technology available,

146
00:11:04,228 --> 00:11:10,650
but people can't get access to it,
it remains very high cost.

147
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:16,470
Recent data suggests the costs are not
rising as quickly as they had been.

148
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:19,968
Nevertheless, they're still rising, and

149
00:11:19,968 --> 00:11:26,090
health care absorbs now almost 18%
of the gross domestic product.

150
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:29,870
Quality, I think, is getting better, but

151
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:33,730
many experts believe that
it's not good enough.

152
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:41,055
And in some ways, a very important
structural flaw, maybe the most important,

153
00:11:41,055 --> 00:11:46,021
is the existence of racial and
economic disparities.

154
00:11:46,021 --> 00:11:52,385
As I suggested, economic disparities
have been reduced, but not enough.

155
00:11:52,385 --> 00:11:57,502
And we know that there are clear and
significant racial and

156
00:11:57,502 --> 00:12:03,330
ethnic disparities in how
health care is provide.

157
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:06,998
When you're looking around for
sources of information,

158
00:12:06,998 --> 00:12:13,330
some are really very reputable and
will give you a different orientation.

159
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:18,660
The Kaiser Family Foundation
provides excellent ongoing

160
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:22,940
policy information, and
same with the the Commonwealth Fund.

161
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:27,360
Health Affairs presents
recent research and

162
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,730
has an ongoing blog to
talk about ongoing events.

163
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:35,600
Same with Vox online,
the Incidental Economist, for

164
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,290
those of you who like to follow
the economics of health care.

165
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:45,560
And then two on the more conservative
side, the American Enterprise Institute,

166
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:51,860
a free market-based think tank, presents
a lot of colloquia about health care.

167
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:55,340
And the Cato Institute is
a libertarian think tank,

168
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:59,980
producing free market-based
health care data.

169
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:04,190
And I encourage you to read the major
newspapers, the New York Times,

170
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:08,910
Wall Street Journal,
Washington Post, other dailies for

171
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:14,761
continuing and
up to date news about health care.
