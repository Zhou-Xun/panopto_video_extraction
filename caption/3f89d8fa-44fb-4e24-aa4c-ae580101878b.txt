00:00:08,402 --> 00:00:11,627
Welcome to episode 634 module on vector borne disease.

2
00:00:11,627 --> 00:00:14,403
In this module present a model for malaria and

3
00:00:14,403 --> 00:00:17,845
infectious disease transmitted by a mosquito vector.

4
00:00:17,845 --> 00:00:21,949
The learning objectives of this module are to, one described vector

5
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:25,925
borne diseases of the specific case of a dissimilar groups model.

6
00:00:25,925 --> 00:00:29,784
And two, describe the basic dynamics of malaria transmission.

7
00:00:29,784 --> 00:00:35,246
Vector borne diseases are those that must pass through two species sequentially

8
00:00:35,246 --> 00:00:39,754
to successfully transmit and spread throughout the population.

9
00:00:39,754 --> 00:00:42,500
In the case of mosquito borne pathogens,

10
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:48,155
mosquitoes are considered the vector that transmits the pathogen from host to host.

11
00:00:48,155 --> 00:00:53,981
Mathematically this is codified as a dissimilar group model that we studied

12
00:00:53,981 --> 00:01:00,443
earlier in the semester where within group transmission is not possible, there's

13
00:01:00,443 --> 00:01:06,650
only between group transmission as we see depicted in this coupled SIS diagram.

14
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:10,156
Here are the equations for this model.

15
00:01:10,156 --> 00:01:14,553
We have a set of equations for the human host and for the vector.

16
00:01:14,553 --> 00:01:19,799
The human host model has a mass action term, where the susceptible human

17
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:24,873
state variable is multiplied by the infected vector state variable.

18
00:01:24,873 --> 00:01:28,703
This term represents the forceful infection of

19
00:01:28,703 --> 00:01:31,774
mosquitoes transmitting to humans.

20
00:01:31,774 --> 00:01:36,920
The analogous mass action transmission term occurs in the vector SIS model

21
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:42,484
where the force infection term represents humans transmitting to mosquitoes.

22
00:01:42,484 --> 00:01:46,942
You may have noticed that we divide by the total population each of

23
00:01:46,942 --> 00:01:48,736
the transmission terms.

24
00:01:48,736 --> 00:01:51,743
You will see this in some transmission models.

25
00:01:51,743 --> 00:01:57,319
The assumption behind dividing by the total population is if we think

26
00:01:57,319 --> 00:02:04,255
that the risk does not increase linearly with increasing susceptible populations.

27
00:02:04,255 --> 00:02:07,336
This is true when there's social structure,

28
00:02:07,336 --> 00:02:12,708
that is if you only interact with your social group, the fact that the population

29
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:17,136
increases doesn't mean that you will be contacting more people.

30
00:02:17,136 --> 00:02:22,477
This may also be true with mosquito human interaction.

31
00:02:22,477 --> 00:02:25,067
Since the mosquito is host seeking,

32
00:02:25,067 --> 00:02:28,918
it will find a host regardless of the population size.

33
00:02:28,918 --> 00:02:31,557
When we divide by the total population,

34
00:02:31,557 --> 00:02:35,290
we call that frequency dependent mode of transmission.

35
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:39,213
When we don't divide by the total population,

36
00:02:39,213 --> 00:02:43,734
we call that density dependent mode of transmission.

37
00:02:43,734 --> 00:02:48,445
Lastly, you will notice that there is no recovery in the vector population

38
00:02:48,445 --> 00:02:49,280
equations.

39
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,510
We assume that the vector is infected for

40
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:56,887
life which is reasonable given their short lifespan.

41
00:02:56,887 --> 00:02:58,715
The reproductive number for

42
00:02:58,715 --> 00:03:03,296
this model structure is the product of the pathway specific R naughts.

43
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:07,013
The vector are not times the human are not.

44
00:03:07,013 --> 00:03:12,521
We will look into this in more detail later in this module.

45
00:03:12,521 --> 00:03:16,611
For the remainder of this module we will focus on malaria as an example of

46
00:03:16,611 --> 00:03:18,053
a vector borne disease.

47
00:03:18,053 --> 00:03:20,966
Malaria is a protozoan parasite.

48
00:03:20,966 --> 00:03:24,368
Four main species cause human disease,

49
00:03:24,368 --> 00:03:28,479
plasmodium vivax is the most common worldwide.

50
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:31,450
Malaria has a complex life cycle.

51
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:35,718
We start with an infected mosquito biting a human.

52
00:03:35,718 --> 00:03:41,467
It did injects sporozoites into the blood.

53
00:03:41,467 --> 00:03:45,895
These sporozoites migrate to the liver and

54
00:03:45,895 --> 00:03:49,831
developed in the parenchymal cells.

55
00:03:49,831 --> 00:03:56,280
As they divide or multiply they release merozoites into the bloodstream.

56
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,623
Merozoites penetrate the red blood cells,

57
00:03:59,623 --> 00:04:04,326
subdivide, rupture cells and invade other red blood cells.

58
00:04:04,326 --> 00:04:10,038
This processes is what causes much of the pathology.

59
00:04:10,038 --> 00:04:14,805
Eventually merozoites developing the gametocytes which

60
00:04:14,805 --> 00:04:17,924
are the sexual stage of the parasite.

61
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:21,469
These gametocytes are the infectious

62
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:26,241
unit that can infect a mosquito that bites a human.

63
00:04:26,241 --> 00:04:32,873
Once a mosquito ingests gametocytes, the female gamete is fertilized and

64
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:37,512
developed into oocyst on walls of the mosquito gut.

65
00:04:37,512 --> 00:04:42,088
From the oocyst, it's emerge sporozoites,

66
00:04:42,088 --> 00:04:50,554
these immature sporozoites migrate to the mosquito's salivary glands and mature.

67
00:04:50,554 --> 00:04:53,703
This is the infectious stage of the mosquito.

68
00:04:57,849 --> 00:05:01,300
Sir Ronald Ross is credited with developing the first malaria model.

69
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:07,240
It was a simple model where x is the fraction of infected humans,

70
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:12,860
h is the rate of becoming infected and r the rate of recovery.

71
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:19,712
Here, 1 -x represents the fraction of susceptible.

72
00:05:19,712 --> 00:05:25,877
This solution is an exponentially increasing

73
00:05:25,877 --> 00:05:32,362
function where the endemic level is h over h + r.

74
00:05:32,362 --> 00:05:35,903
In this model there's no mass action dynamics and

75
00:05:35,903 --> 00:05:38,190
there is no mosquito dynamics.

76
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:45,528
Ross went back and forth between rates and probabilities when modeling transmission.

77
00:05:45,528 --> 00:05:49,104
So, here's a quick note on the relationship between rates and

78
00:05:49,104 --> 00:05:49,988
probability.

79
00:05:49,988 --> 00:05:54,335
If we assume that an infection event is a process where h is

80
00:05:54,335 --> 00:05:58,504
the average number of events per individual per time,

81
00:05:58,504 --> 00:06:04,863
then each the minus h is the probability of no infection per individual, per time.

82
00:06:04,863 --> 00:06:09,397
And one minus e to the minus h is the probability that one or

83
00:06:09,397 --> 00:06:12,811
more infections per individual per time.

84
00:06:12,811 --> 00:06:19,387
If h is small then one minus e to the minus h is approximately equal to h.

85
00:06:19,387 --> 00:06:23,596
Therefore, h which is defined as a rate of infection,

86
00:06:23,596 --> 00:06:28,637
[COUGH] approximate the probability of infection when h is small.

87
00:06:28,637 --> 00:06:32,400
We saw the same concept early in class when comparing

88
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,847
the transmission rate parameter of the mass action model with

89
00:06:36,847 --> 00:06:40,794
the probability of infection in the read frost model.

90
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:49,482
Now, let's look at a model that does include mass action and mosquito dynamics.

91
00:06:49,482 --> 00:06:51,614
Here we show the equations for

92
00:06:51,614 --> 00:06:56,395
the fraction infected in both the human and mosquito population.

93
00:06:56,395 --> 00:07:01,303
We don't show the susceptible equations as they are simply represented

94
00:07:01,303 --> 00:07:03,642
as 1- the infected population.

95
00:07:03,642 --> 00:07:08,644
So here, M is a total mosquito population and

96
00:07:08,644 --> 00:07:12,339
n is the total human population.

97
00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:14,956
IH and IM are the fraction of human and

98
00:07:14,956 --> 00:07:18,596
mosquito populations infected, respectively.

99
00:07:18,596 --> 00:07:23,555
The transmission rate term for the human population is

100
00:07:23,555 --> 00:07:29,159
the product of three factors, the biting rate per mosquito,

101
00:07:29,159 --> 00:07:36,413
a, the number of mosquitoes per human M over N and the infectivity parameter B.

102
00:07:36,413 --> 00:07:41,229
Note that we have the total population in the denominator

103
00:07:41,229 --> 00:07:46,158
representing a frequency dependent transmission mode.

104
00:07:46,158 --> 00:07:49,456
The parameter R represents recovery rate.

105
00:07:49,456 --> 00:07:54,860
Note that in the transmission term for mosquitoes we don't divide by M and

106
00:07:54,860 --> 00:08:00,368
therefore, our modeling this transmission as a density dependent mode.

107
00:08:00,368 --> 00:08:05,137
This is because a mosquito is host seeking for humans,

108
00:08:05,137 --> 00:08:09,077
it is not host seeking for infected humans and

109
00:08:09,077 --> 00:08:13,952
therefore the greater the number of human infections,

110
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:17,911
the greater possibility for transmission.

111
00:08:17,911 --> 00:08:24,814
Finally, MR Mu is the mosquito mortality rate.

112
00:08:24,814 --> 00:08:27,452
Now let's derive the reproductive number.

113
00:08:27,452 --> 00:08:32,157
To do this, we first calculate the nullcline for

114
00:08:32,157 --> 00:08:38,146
our two equations by setting the dIH/dt and dIM/dt to zero.

115
00:08:38,146 --> 00:08:43,801
And we get the following two equations.

116
00:08:43,801 --> 00:08:48,967
If we set the two nullcline equations equal

117
00:08:48,967 --> 00:08:53,702
to each other, we get the following and

118
00:08:53,702 --> 00:08:58,450
solving for IH, we get this equation.

119
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:03,005
This is our steady state value for IH.

120
00:09:04,933 --> 00:09:09,595
We note that the term a squared times b times m

121
00:09:09,595 --> 00:09:14,635
divided by r times Mu must be greater than one for

122
00:09:14,635 --> 00:09:21,327
there to be an endemic solution that is IH is greater than zero.

123
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:26,048
Therefore, this term I squared times b times m

124
00:09:26,048 --> 00:09:29,810
divided by r times Mu is our r naught.

125
00:09:32,018 --> 00:09:36,857
Here we can take a heuristic look at r naught.

126
00:09:36,857 --> 00:09:41,357
If we have one infectious human,

127
00:09:41,357 --> 00:09:46,339
then m times a is the maximum number of

128
00:09:46,339 --> 00:09:51,164
mosquito human contacts that could

129
00:09:51,164 --> 00:09:55,986
result in infection and one over r,

130
00:09:55,986 --> 00:10:04,531
the recovery rate is the duration of a human being infectious.

131
00:10:04,531 --> 00:10:08,723
Therefore, ma over r is the number of mosquito

132
00:10:08,723 --> 00:10:12,818
infections caused by one infectious human.

133
00:10:12,818 --> 00:10:17,411
We multiply this by a times b we get the number of successful

134
00:10:17,411 --> 00:10:20,428
human infections per human per time.

135
00:10:20,428 --> 00:10:25,979
And finally, if we multiply this by the lifespan of the mosquito one over

136
00:10:25,979 --> 00:10:31,999
Mu we get the total number of human infections caused by one infectious human.

137
00:10:31,999 --> 00:10:34,747
This is our definition of r naught.

138
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:41,567
Although we are able to determine the equation for r naught without

139
00:10:41,567 --> 00:10:45,914
plotting the nullclines, there's still much that we can learn by plotting them.

140
00:10:45,914 --> 00:10:51,952
And here's the plot for our two nullclines, IM and IH.

141
00:10:51,952 --> 00:10:56,946
As opposed to our prior models where our phase portraits

142
00:10:56,946 --> 00:11:02,047
was always a plot of I versus S, this time we're plotting

143
00:11:02,047 --> 00:11:07,379
IM versus IH the infected mosquitoes and infected humans.

144
00:11:07,379 --> 00:11:12,777
To orient you let's first focus on the IM nullcline.

145
00:11:12,777 --> 00:11:19,619
We note that when IH equals zero, IM also equals zero.

146
00:11:19,619 --> 00:11:26,840
And and as IH increases, IM increases monotonically and

147
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:35,122
it's a symptomatically approaching a constant value a over Mu.

148
00:11:35,122 --> 00:11:40,283
And therefore, we see the curve is leveling off.

149
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:46,033
For the IH nullcline, we also see that when IH equals zero,

150
00:11:46,033 --> 00:11:53,048
IM also equal zero, but in contrast to the IM nullcline as IH increases,

151
00:11:53,048 --> 00:11:59,386
the IH nullcline increases in slope and heads towards infinity.

152
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:04,196
This is because there is a one minus IH in the denominator so

153
00:12:04,196 --> 00:12:09,497
that as IH approaches one, the denominator approaches zero and

154
00:12:09,497 --> 00:12:13,441
therefore the function approaches infinity.

155
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:18,061
So, the IH and IM nullcline intersect at two points

156
00:12:18,061 --> 00:12:22,260
elimination IH equals zero and IM equal zero.

157
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:27,152
And at endemic equilibrium point shown here,

158
00:12:27,152 --> 00:12:33,933
this endemic equilibrium point is a stable equilibrium point.

159
00:12:33,933 --> 00:12:36,800
So, the question is, is there a threshold for

160
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,887
elimination where the elimination point becomes the stable equilibrium point?

161
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:43,796
And the answer is yes.

162
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:48,341
Each of the two nullclines in each of the two nullcline

163
00:12:48,341 --> 00:12:53,189
increased from I equals zero and is reflected by a slope.

164
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:57,559
The slope for the IM nullcline is a over Mu and

165
00:12:57,559 --> 00:13:03,124
the slope for the IH nullcline is r over a times b times n.

166
00:13:03,124 --> 00:13:06,341
You can see that in the figure on the left.

167
00:13:06,341 --> 00:13:12,573
And you can also see that A over a Mu is greater than

168
00:13:12,573 --> 00:13:18,356
r over times b times M in this plot on the left.

169
00:13:18,356 --> 00:13:24,026
But if a over Mu becomes less than r over a times b times n,

170
00:13:24,026 --> 00:13:28,976
then the only intersection of the two nullclines

171
00:13:28,976 --> 00:13:33,819
is at the elimination point 00 as shown here.

172
00:13:33,819 --> 00:13:40,489
And with a little algebra, we see that this threshold constraint for

173
00:13:40,489 --> 00:13:45,779
elimination is a square times b times m over r times Mu,

174
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:49,463
which is our expression for r naught.

175
00:13:49,463 --> 00:13:56,942
And we see this nullcline plot under these conditions here.

176
00:14:00,453 --> 00:14:04,221
It has been well known that malaria exhibits different transmission dynamics

177
00:14:04,221 --> 00:14:05,371
in different regions.

178
00:14:05,371 --> 00:14:11,823
For example, in some regions, malaria transmission is characterized as stable.

179
00:14:11,823 --> 00:14:16,405
Stable reasons are characterizes highly endemic with small

180
00:14:16,405 --> 00:14:21,445
seasonal fluctuations other than small seasonal fluctuations.

181
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:27,797
Low vector densities and low vector densities needed to maintain transmission.

182
00:14:27,797 --> 00:14:30,436
Due to the highly endemic nature of

183
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:34,898
transmission immunity is conferred to all but the young.

184
00:14:34,898 --> 00:14:39,187
Here's a plot of cases from Italy from the 1920s and

185
00:14:39,187 --> 00:14:42,573
30s that exhibits stable transmission.

186
00:14:42,573 --> 00:14:46,410
This type of transmission is difficult to control and

187
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:51,113
characterized by high biting rates and long mosquito lifespan.

188
00:14:51,113 --> 00:14:55,789
In contrast, unstable regions are characterized with variable

189
00:14:55,789 --> 00:15:00,559
endemicity fluctuations in cases that occur at epidemic levels.

190
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:05,173
High vector densities that are needed to maintain transmission.

191
00:15:05,173 --> 00:15:10,154
Immunity that is variable since transmission

192
00:15:10,154 --> 00:15:14,757
is less stable and immunity is short term.

193
00:15:14,757 --> 00:15:19,635
Here's a plot of cases from Ceylon in the 1930s and

194
00:15:19,635 --> 00:15:24,619
40s, this type of transmission is easy to control and

195
00:15:24,619 --> 00:15:30,681
is characterized by low biting rates in a short mosquito lifespan.

196
00:15:30,681 --> 00:15:33,883
MacDonald in the 1950s,

197
00:15:33,883 --> 00:15:38,753
defined a over Mu as this index of stability.

198
00:15:38,753 --> 00:15:45,245
So, the higher the biting rates and the lower the mortality rates are and

199
00:15:45,245 --> 00:15:51,329
lower mycolates are both indicators of more stable transmission.

200
00:15:51,329 --> 00:15:55,881
Interestingly, we can see how this index stability

201
00:15:55,881 --> 00:16:00,848
reflects whether transmission is more or less stable and

202
00:16:00,848 --> 00:16:06,032
can be seen in the characteristics of our nullcline plots.

203
00:16:06,032 --> 00:16:11,526
For example, if we look at the stable

204
00:16:11,526 --> 00:16:15,955
case where a over Mu is large,

205
00:16:15,955 --> 00:16:20,919
we see that the equilibrium point

206
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:26,075
reflects high human prevalence.

207
00:16:26,075 --> 00:16:31,675
Also changes in the slope of a over Mu will have minimal

208
00:16:31,675 --> 00:16:36,537
impact on changes in the inhuman prevalence.

209
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:42,648
In contrast, in the unstable case where a over Mu is small,

210
00:16:42,648 --> 00:16:47,784
we see the equilibrium point reflects lower human

211
00:16:47,784 --> 00:16:53,162
prevalence and changes in slope of a over Mu will have

212
00:16:53,162 --> 00:16:58,075
larger impact on changes in human prevalence.

213
00:16:58,075 --> 00:17:03,478
So, our simple transmission model for malaria is able to capture this stable and

214
00:17:03,478 --> 00:17:08,021
unstable feature that was observed by MacDonald in the 1950s.
