00:00:06,522 --> 00:00:09,627
Hello everyone,
I'm Carrie Karvonen-Gutierrez and

2
00:00:09,627 --> 00:00:13,270
today we're going to talk
about case control studies.

3
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:17,065
Case control studies are another type of
observational study design that we use

4
00:00:17,065 --> 00:00:20,295
in epidemiology.

5
00:00:20,295 --> 00:00:22,747
The learning objectives and
key concepts for

6
00:00:22,747 --> 00:00:26,499
this module are to identify the key
features of a case control study.

7
00:00:26,499 --> 00:00:32,220
To describe the strengths and
limitations of using case control studies.

8
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:35,680
To compare the design of case
control studies with cohort studies,

9
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,240
which is another observational study
design that we've recently learned about.

10
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,595
And to understand how to do set up a two
by two table for case control studies.

11
00:00:43,595 --> 00:00:46,686
And to be able to calculate
the appropriate measure of

12
00:00:46,686 --> 00:00:49,950
association from that two by two table.

13
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:54,575
The key terms for this module are case
control study, cases, controls,

14
00:00:54,575 --> 00:00:59,628
exposure history, and odds of exposure.

15
00:00:59,628 --> 00:01:04,261
So as I said before, case control study
is really an observational study design.

16
00:01:04,261 --> 00:01:07,050
So it's another type of
observational study,

17
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:11,731
as opposed to an experimental study
designed like a randomized control study.

18
00:01:11,731 --> 00:01:15,861
So really, we're not doing anything
in terms of intervention here,

19
00:01:15,861 --> 00:01:18,106
we're just observing individuals.

20
00:01:18,106 --> 00:01:23,320
And the individuals that we're observing
are defined by their disease status.

21
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,590
So we're interested in cases and

22
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:29,020
those are the individuals who
have the disease of interest.

23
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:35,070
And controls and those are the individuals
who do not have the disease of interest.

24
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:40,270
And in a case control study design, we
really are interested in understanding how

25
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:45,940
the exposure history is different
from cases as compared to controls.

26
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,290
So unlike in a cohort study design,

27
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:53,000
where we are starting with known
exposure status at baseline and

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,750
following up individuals to see who
gets the disease and who doesn't.

29
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:01,437
At the beginning of a case control study,
we already know who has a disease and

30
00:02:01,437 --> 00:02:02,128
who does not.

31
00:02:02,128 --> 00:02:06,632
And we're really looking at whether or
not there's differences in

32
00:02:06,632 --> 00:02:13,180
their exposure that may have led to
them having or not having that disease.

33
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,300
And so because of this,

34
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,640
we select participants based
upon their disease status.

35
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:22,190
So again, contrasting this with a cohort
study, where in a cohort study we select

36
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:25,540
participants based upon
their exposure status.

37
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,147
In a case control study design,

38
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:32,008
we select participants based
upon their disease status.

39
00:02:32,008 --> 00:02:36,354
So this is a schematic of the design
of a case control study as was

40
00:02:36,354 --> 00:02:40,370
presented in your
epidemiology book by Gordis.

41
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:42,765
And so we see that we start
here with two different groups.

42
00:02:42,765 --> 00:02:43,740
We've got our cases,

43
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:46,316
those are the individuals that
do in fact have the disease.

44
00:02:46,316 --> 00:02:48,098
And we've got our controls,

45
00:02:48,098 --> 00:02:52,780
those are the individuals that
do in fact not have the disease.

46
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:55,315
And so
what we do is at the time of recruitment,

47
00:02:55,315 --> 00:02:59,670
we recruit them into our study and then
based upon that, we look to see whether or

48
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,558
not they were or were not exposed.

49
00:03:01,558 --> 00:03:07,495
So here in the cases we've got
were exposed and were not exposed.

50
00:03:07,495 --> 00:03:11,385
And then same thing in the controls,
we wanna know those who were exposed and

51
00:03:11,385 --> 00:03:13,455
those who were not exposed.

52
00:03:13,455 --> 00:03:18,650
And then we compare that between
the cases and the controls.

53
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:20,710
So let's do a brief example.

54
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:24,530
Let's assume that we're interested in
the relationship between breastfeeding and

55
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:27,250
breast cancer among women.

56
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:32,923
So we may first start by recruiting
a set of breast cancer cases.

57
00:03:32,923 --> 00:03:37,200
So these are our cases.

58
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,110
And they're individuals who we
recruit because we know that they

59
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,510
do in fact have breast cancer.

60
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:45,910
And then we're interested in
recruiting some controls.

61
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:48,400
So these are individuals
without breast cancer.

62
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,830
And we do recruit them because they're
known to not have breast cancer.

63
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:55,930
And then among those two groups
of individuals, we look and

64
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:58,380
we ascertain their exposure status.

65
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:01,560
So here, our exposure is breastfeeding.

66
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,540
So we query the breast cancer cases and
we see whether they did or

67
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,730
did not engage in breastfeeding.

68
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:11,266
And same thing with the controls,
we asked them whether or

69
00:04:11,266 --> 00:04:15,540
not they did or
did not engage in breastfeeding.

70
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:19,530
The nice thing about a case control study
design is that because of the nature of

71
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:26,342
the way we do the study, we can actually
ask about multiple different exposures.

72
00:04:26,342 --> 00:04:29,302
So perhaps breastfeeding is our
primary exposure of interest.

73
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:33,517
But we're also interested in other
types of exposures, for example,

74
00:04:33,517 --> 00:04:35,655
such as physical activity.

75
00:04:35,655 --> 00:04:40,595
So once we have set up this group of cases
and controls, we can ask them about their

76
00:04:40,595 --> 00:04:45,045
breastfeeding status but we can also
ask them about physical activity.

77
00:04:45,045 --> 00:04:50,582
So we can say, were you someone who
had high verses low physical activity?

78
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:54,240
And so we could ask that of
both the cases and controls.

79
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,177
We could also ask them about
their alcohol consumption.

80
00:04:56,177 --> 00:04:59,602
So those who did consume alcohol
versus those who did not.

81
00:04:59,602 --> 00:05:05,233
And so if we have an outcome of
interest where we are interested

82
00:05:05,233 --> 00:05:09,904
in studying many different
risks of that disease.

83
00:05:09,904 --> 00:05:14,446
We can look at many different exposure
patterns within that one study and

84
00:05:14,446 --> 00:05:20,906
that's really a strength
of the case control study.

85
00:05:20,906 --> 00:05:24,126
So, unlike our cohort two by two tables,

86
00:05:24,126 --> 00:05:29,830
the case control tables are really
structured a little bit differently.

87
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:34,320
So, rather than on the top, like we've
seen before where we have disease,

88
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,350
yes or no,
here we have cases versus controls.

89
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:41,980
And so again,
cases are those that do have the disease,

90
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:45,170
controls are those that
do not have the disease.

91
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:47,512
And then over here,
we have our history of exposure.

92
00:05:47,512 --> 00:05:51,030
And so these are with positive
history of exposure and

93
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:54,638
these are those that do not
have a history of exposure.

94
00:05:54,638 --> 00:05:57,397
And so for example, our cell A here,

95
00:05:57,397 --> 00:06:03,270
these are cases that do have a history
of the exposure of interest.

96
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:05,120
As compared to our B group,

97
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:11,570
which is our controls who do
have a history of that exposure.

98
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:14,790
So, let's take our breast cancer and
breastfeeding example.

99
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:18,720
Our cases here are those that
do have breast cancer and

100
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,980
our controls are those that
do not have breast cancer.

101
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:24,110
Our exposure here is breastfeeding.

102
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:28,990
So, those that do have a history of
that exposure would be those that do

103
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:34,490
engage in breastfeeding and no history of
that exposure would be no breastfeeding.

104
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:38,703
And so this would be the way that we
can set up our two by two table for

105
00:06:38,703 --> 00:06:39,707
this example.

106
00:06:39,707 --> 00:06:44,159
So really, the goal of this type
of study is to compare cases and

107
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:48,868
controls to see which group has
a greater proportion of exposure.

108
00:06:48,868 --> 00:06:53,383
And so because of the way we do
a case control study design,

109
00:06:53,383 --> 00:06:58,651
we're ascertaining that exposure
among both cases and controls.

110
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:05,692
So we really wanna see which group
has a greater proportion of exposure.

111
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:10,282
So here's some data that's out
of a study by Awatef et al,

112
00:07:10,282 --> 00:07:16,820
looking at this research question
among a case control study in Tunisia.

113
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:21,070
And in that study, they ascertained
cases and controls with and

114
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:22,700
without breast cancer.

115
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:27,474
And they defined breastfeeding as
being greater than equal to 24 months.

116
00:07:27,474 --> 00:07:33,590
So at least two years of breastfeeding
as their positive exposure.

117
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:37,410
And they were comparing that to
individuals who had breastfed for

118
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:39,360
less than six months.

119
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,760
And this is the data that they had.

120
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:47,920
So among the cases, 81 of them reported
having two years or more of breastfeeding.

121
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,040
Whereas among the cases,

122
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:54,270
85 of them reported having less
than six months of breastfeeding.

123
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:56,734
So if we go back to our goal here and

124
00:07:56,734 --> 00:08:02,475
think about comparing the proportion
of exposure among cases and controls.

125
00:08:02,475 --> 00:08:06,504
We're first interested in
the proportionate of the cases that

126
00:08:06,504 --> 00:08:07,930
are exposed.

127
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:11,520
And so, in other words, this is
the proportion of cases that breastfed for

128
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,140
more than or equal to 24 months.

129
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:20,400
So that proportion would be 81 cuz
that's our number that in fact,

130
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:25,330
did have the exposure divided
by the total number of cases.

131
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:31,182
And that's 81 plus 85 and
if we do that math we end up with 48.8%.

132
00:08:31,182 --> 00:08:35,222
Then we look at the proportion
of controls that were exposed.

133
00:08:35,222 --> 00:08:40,131
And so again, this is the proportion of
controls that had the exposure which was

134
00:08:40,131 --> 00:08:43,140
breastfeeding of 24 months or more.

135
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:46,100
And that's 114 individuals.

136
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:52,101
So if we go down here, we have 114 divided
by the total number now of controls,

137
00:08:52,101 --> 00:08:56,277
which is 114 plus 71 and
we end up with 61.6%.

138
00:08:56,277 --> 00:09:01,454
And so what we see is that in fact
the controls had a greater proportion of

139
00:09:01,454 --> 00:09:06,548
being exposed to long term breastfeeding
as defined by greater than or

140
00:09:06,548 --> 00:09:13,351
equal to 24 months as
compared to the cases.

141
00:09:13,351 --> 00:09:15,356
So that's an interesting observation.

142
00:09:15,356 --> 00:09:20,195
We do see that there's a much
higher proportion of exposure

143
00:09:20,195 --> 00:09:23,895
among controls as compared to cases.

144
00:09:23,895 --> 00:09:27,645
But we really, in epidemiology, are
interested in measures of association that

145
00:09:27,645 --> 00:09:31,835
can help us understand
the magnitude of that association.

146
00:09:31,835 --> 00:09:36,675
And so what we use is our odds
ratio which we're familiar with

147
00:09:36,675 --> 00:09:39,625
from before from our cohort studies.

148
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:42,665
But here we're really interested
in the odds of exposure.

149
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:46,718
So rather than in the cohort study, where
we're looking at the odds of disease.

150
00:09:46,718 --> 00:09:52,010
In case control studies,
we're looking at the odds of exposure.

151
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:57,380
So the odds ratio for a case control study
is the odds that a case was exposed,

152
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:01,040
divided by the odds that
a control was exposed.

153
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:06,880
And so that's our formula here,
you can that's AD over BC.

154
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,060
So let's do an example with this data.

155
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:15,743
So our odds ratio, AD,
would give us 81 times 71,

156
00:10:15,743 --> 00:10:19,490
divided by 114 times 85.

157
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:24,378
And so we end up with
an odds ratio here of 0.593.

158
00:10:24,378 --> 00:10:25,847
And so how do we interpret that?

159
00:10:25,847 --> 00:10:32,148
We would interpret that, that women with
breast cancer had a 0.593 times the odds

160
00:10:32,148 --> 00:10:38,680
of breastfeeding for 24 months or more,
than did women without breast cancer.

161
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:43,867
So that in fact, in this study,
we do see that breastfeeding

162
00:10:43,867 --> 00:10:50,074
is associated with the controls have
a greater odds of breastfeeding for

163
00:10:50,074 --> 00:10:58,231
long term for 24 months or
greater than do the cases.

164
00:10:58,231 --> 00:11:02,061
One really important caveat
about case control studies,

165
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:07,010
is that we cannot get prevalence
data from case control studies.

166
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:10,870
So if we look more deeply into this study
that we've been considering on breast

167
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,279
cancer and breastfeeding.

168
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:15,270
This is the full data from that study and
so

169
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:19,885
we see that there were a total
of 400 cases that were recruited

170
00:11:19,885 --> 00:11:24,860
that did in fact have breast cancer and
then also, 400 controls.

171
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:29,698
And so we see this often where
the investigator will recruit

172
00:11:29,698 --> 00:11:33,600
a similar number of cases and controls.

173
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,260
And then based upon that, they're
categorized by their exposure status.

174
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:41,981
And so there were a group of individuals
who breastfed for less than six months.

175
00:11:41,981 --> 00:11:45,951
Who breastfed for
somewhere because 6 months and 23 months.

176
00:11:45,951 --> 00:11:51,382
And then those who had the high
exposure of long term breastfeeding for

177
00:11:51,382 --> 00:11:53,050
24 months or more.

178
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:59,118
But what's important to note here is that
both groups have 400 individuals in there.

179
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:04,248
And so, just because there's 400
individuals who have breast cancer,

180
00:12:04,248 --> 00:12:09,711
does not mean that the prevalence of
breast cancer in this population is 50%.

181
00:12:09,711 --> 00:12:14,663
What it means is that instead,
the investigator of this study

182
00:12:14,663 --> 00:12:19,712
selected 400 individuals with
breast cancer as the cases,

183
00:12:19,712 --> 00:12:26,240
and then also chose to select 400
controls without breast cancer.

184
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,768
And so these numbers, the number of
cases and the number of controls,

185
00:12:30,768 --> 00:12:35,240
are fixed by the investigator and
decided upon by the investigator.

186
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:39,154
And are not a function of prevalence or
incidence of disease.

187
00:12:39,154 --> 00:12:45,112
That's not something that we can
get from case control studies.

188
00:12:45,112 --> 00:12:48,532
So with that in mind, let's review
some of the important strengths and

189
00:12:48,532 --> 00:12:50,570
limitations of case control studies.

190
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:54,003
So a major strength of the study
is that as we discussed,

191
00:12:54,003 --> 00:12:56,131
we can study multiple exposures.

192
00:12:56,131 --> 00:13:00,483
And the example we gave, we could
study exposures of breastfeeding but

193
00:13:00,483 --> 00:13:05,475
we could also look at physical activity,
as well as alcohol consumption.

194
00:13:05,475 --> 00:13:11,555
We could also look at things like parity
or exposure to oral contraceptives.

195
00:13:11,555 --> 00:13:15,815
That's really an important strength of
a case control study is this ability, once

196
00:13:15,815 --> 00:13:21,810
you've recruited the cases and controls,
to be able to study multiple exposures.

197
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:22,700
Because of this,

198
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:27,900
it's often useful as a study design
to search for a cause of disease.

199
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:33,997
If there's little known about what
the risk factors for disease might be,

200
00:13:33,997 --> 00:13:40,304
it's a nice study design to be able to
examine multiple possible exposures.

201
00:13:40,304 --> 00:13:41,519
And see whether or

202
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:48,340
not there is something that may be
indicative of an association there.

203
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:52,580
Case control studies by their design
are generally less expensive,

204
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:58,170
particularly less expensive than cohort
studies and randomized control trials.

205
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:02,055
And this is because they don't
take quite as long to conduct.

206
00:14:02,055 --> 00:14:05,878
The individuals already have disease
at the time of recruitment and

207
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:09,778
then you're asking them about
exposure history retrospectively.

208
00:14:09,778 --> 00:14:12,548
And so it does not take as long or

209
00:14:12,548 --> 00:14:17,940
as much cost to be able to
conduct this type of study.

210
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,750
And so accordingly then,
they can be carried out more quickly.

211
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:25,920
Unlike a cohort study, you're not waiting
for an individual to become diseased.

212
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,500
You're already recruiting them
based upon their disease status.

213
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,930
And so then, because of this,
it's a really good study design when we're

214
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:40,140
looking at studies that are either quite
rare or that have a long latency period.

215
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,140
And what I mean by this is,
is in a cohort study,

216
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:44,852
if you're interested in studying
a disease that is quite rare.

217
00:14:44,852 --> 00:14:49,781
You will have to enroll a large
number of individuals to yield

218
00:14:49,781 --> 00:14:53,270
very few cases of the disease of interest.

219
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:58,178
Whereas in a case control study,
because you're selecting on disease

220
00:14:58,178 --> 00:15:02,937
status at the start, you can enroll
Individuals with that disease.

221
00:15:02,937 --> 00:15:05,560
And it's much more efficient in that way.

222
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:10,479
And then accordingly, those that have long
latency period, so you don't need to spend

223
00:15:10,479 --> 00:15:14,479
the time in a cohort study waiting for
individuals to become diseased.

224
00:15:14,479 --> 00:15:18,223
You can recruit them once they
have already got the disease and

225
00:15:18,223 --> 00:15:22,050
then examine their exposure history.

226
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:23,450
So this all sounds quite good.

227
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:25,950
There's a lot of strengths
to case control studies, but

228
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:29,570
there are some important
limitations that we must consider.

229
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:32,950
One of them, as we discussed,
is that you can't access prevalence or

230
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:34,210
incidence of disease.

231
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:38,124
And so this is a major limitation
of case control studies and

232
00:15:38,124 --> 00:15:41,111
an important caveat that
we must reflect on.

233
00:15:41,111 --> 00:15:44,876
Particularly when we're looking
at our measures of association,

234
00:15:44,876 --> 00:15:52,000
that we're really looking at the odds of
exposure rather than the odds of disease.

235
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,935
Also, while we can study
multiple exposures at a time,

236
00:15:55,935 --> 00:15:58,505
we can only study one outcome at a time.

237
00:15:58,505 --> 00:16:01,933
And so because our recruitment
patterns are based upon having or

238
00:16:01,933 --> 00:16:05,435
not having a disease of interest,
we can only study one outcome.

239
00:16:05,435 --> 00:16:08,339
And so
this is different from cohort studies,

240
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:12,870
where we can look at
multiple different outcomes.

241
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:16,422
And also, there's some concerns about
generalizability which we'll talk a little

242
00:16:16,422 --> 00:16:17,614
bit more in our next module.

243
00:16:17,614 --> 00:16:22,447
And this is based upon who we select as
cases and who we select as controls and

244
00:16:22,447 --> 00:16:26,528
whether that's really indicative
of our larger population.

245
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:30,883
And so these are the types of questions
that we should always be thinking about

246
00:16:30,883 --> 00:16:33,499
when we're conducting
a case control study.

247
00:16:33,499 --> 00:16:38,509
So in summary, case control studies
are again, an observational study design.

248
00:16:38,509 --> 00:16:43,268
And we look at where individuals who
have the disease are compared to those

249
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:44,737
without the disease.

250
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:47,737
And we're really looking
at differences in exposure.

251
00:16:47,737 --> 00:16:52,640
And so that's our primary
feature of a case control study.

252
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:57,390
They're good for diseases that are either
rare or have a long latency period.

253
00:16:57,390 --> 00:17:00,141
And really, our measure of
interest is the odds of exposure.

254
00:17:00,141 --> 00:17:01,840
And this is really key.

255
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:06,518
We're looking at the odds of exposure for
cases as compared to controls.

256
00:17:06,518 --> 00:17:09,706
And because of this,
we cannot assess disease prevalence or

257
00:17:09,706 --> 00:17:21,974
incidence from case control studies.
