1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:13,050
To give a quick summary here. Okay.

2
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:22,880
So this is a just quick summary. I think this should also benefits is beneficial to people for us sitting here in this lecture.

3
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,990
Wait, wait, have a talk about what they even are.

4
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:36,840
We talk about is a definition of the survival function and then we talk about actually how to define

5
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:45,810
the survival function when our survival time is discrete or when our survival time is convenience.

6
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:52,110
Right. Okay. Basically in this situation, we always define our survival function here to be probability.

7
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:56,350
You know, t is greater than two. I get an idea that includes that you cosigned.

8
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:06,000
Yeah. Okay. And then for the hazard function, then we have to have two different definitions, right.

9
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:11,040
For the for the has our function, then we have the for the continuous case way.

10
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,300
We know that the has our function is defined a to be you know,

11
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:22,139
sort of that that we can use the the the the denominator here actually is going to

12
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,310
be the left has a limit of asked here and as the numerator here is going to be

13
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:32,850
the R after right and as n we also define the has our function well our teeth here

14
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:38,310
is this well I'll have the t r underlined random variable t is it is this quick.

15
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:40,140
Okay, okay.

16
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:50,610
And as I think actually fundamentally actually we have established the relationship between the has our function and as a survival function.

17
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:56,730
I said this is very important for both these great and a continuous cases.

18
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:00,120
We have established a such connection.

19
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:11,910
Okay why is this useful? Because is the sensor they not was t well our survival time and the sensor and time are independent.

20
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:18,900
Yeah. Turns out we will be able to frame the theoretical.

21
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:24,030
So theoretical define a kind of function in terms of our observer theta.

22
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:37,620
Right. I think actually this give us the fundamental basis to construct the estimate are given our data to estimate of the hazard function.

23
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:48,150
So and also we talk about once you have that has a function, you will be able to construct the survival function.

24
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:56,550
Right? Okay. Then we talk about as a survival function you will be able to construct a many useful quantities,

25
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:04,830
for example, the average survival time, right, and also the mean residual time.

26
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:08,490
So for example, if you have already survived the past five years,

27
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:15,030
how many more years do you can survive you basically that you can calculate the mean residual time after the five years.

28
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:20,550
Okay. And as in we also talk about a very important concept that is that.

29
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:29,340
Median survival time, the median survival time here is the if you look at the survival curve,

30
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:36,240
which is going to be the first time point, the survival curve drops, you know, or at 50%.

31
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:43,350
Right. Okay. I think this is something we have to be very careful with because actually, for the for the continuous case, it's not a big deal.

32
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:51,160
But for the for the for the step function where you are survival distribution are step functions, then you have to be very careful.

33
00:03:51,180 --> 00:04:02,960
Right. And then we also talk about actually how to use the mean how to use the survival function here to calculate the so called risk restricted.

34
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:08,130
So so for example, you allowed to calculate. Okay, within a certain time.

35
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,690
Within a certain time,

36
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:21,149
what is the average survival time you can observe rising which is this is a restricted the survival restricted means survival time hopefully

37
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:32,880
actually this is a quick summary of let's go jump into that sector and then I hope after you will be able to read the my course number two here.

38
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:43,590
And then for the people who could come up, who then come to the class today, maybe you should ask your fellow students to borrow the power of notes.

39
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:53,460
You know, people are taken from my log, from the blackboard, the transactions which somebody have to remind me this.

40
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:04,210
Okay, don't not don't go yet. And I still have a little bit of residual, residual time.

41
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,200
Okay. So I will.

42
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:15,880
So well, let me come back to next tools in it.

43
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:30,570
Right. Okay. So this is already Thursday. Okay. We are gonna talk about how to estimate huddle, how to use our data to estimate has a kaplan-meier.

44
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:38,270
Okay. To try to derive the kaplan-meier estimate or actually today we have already derived the kaplan-meier estimate of.

45
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:49,409
Right. So because we have already connected the connected to the as the hazard function and as a

46
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:55,170
survival function by for the discrete case we talk about entering your order to survive December

47
00:05:55,350 --> 00:06:00,389
you have two for first a survival of January February also on right so this kind of stuff

48
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:06,810
actually this actually give us the basis of the Hollywood that derive the Kaplan-meier estimate.

49
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,230
Okay. So when we come back, you know, next Tuesday,

50
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:19,100
we we are gonna just give you some concrete examples to tell you how to use our data to derive the compromise estimate estimates.

51
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:24,090
And then once you have the Kaplan-meier estimate here,

52
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:36,150
we will also need to talk about how to estimate the variance of your estimate or you or yours, how to characterize the uncertainty of our estimate.

53
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:42,450
And as in order to do this, we are gonna use the so called the other hand to assert.

54
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:47,520
Now if you haven't heard about that, the outcomes are you should Google this right out, you know, right away.

55
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,620
Okay. So maybe this is going to be very useful when we talk about how to use a delta method,

56
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:58,050
derive the standard errors and the last way you know how to calculate is the standard errors.

57
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,170
Then we'll be able to construct the confidence intervals.

58
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:08,010
Right. And then I are of course note I was post here that, you know,

59
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:16,230
some are code that will compute to use R to calculate the the kaplan-meier estimate or KAPLAN-MEIER estimates.

60
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:23,730
You should all go to our cameras website and try to go through the files and then you will find a lot of, you know,

61
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:35,430
what a document Z are just to give you some commands in using R three to calculate the some important estimates.

62
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:39,100
Okay. I think that's is all I have for you this past week.

63
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:45,570
Thank you very much. And again, we have our homework posted, which is not consistent and it gets a lot.
