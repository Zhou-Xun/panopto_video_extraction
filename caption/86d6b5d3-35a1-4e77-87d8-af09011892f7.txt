1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:05,070
Okay. All right. Welcome back, everybody. You all had a nice Labor Day long weekend.

2
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,620
So what? We had a couple of random things.

3
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:14,580
So today is the end. So my unit won that one quickly, right?

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:20,660
So we have two units on energy balance. We had energy expenditure on Wednesday, the amount.

5
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:25,709
Pretty sure it'll be on the midterm stuff. And then today, we're going to talk about appetite.

6
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:32,620
So energy intake. So where I want to start is the reason we care so much about energy balance is a lottery.

7
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:37,860
The main reason we care about it so much is there's so many chronic diseases that are caused by obesity.

8
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:42,570
And the root cause of many of these diseases is the excess about a positive.

9
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,959
So understanding how we can alleviate that is very important, and it's extremely important in practice.

10
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:53,250
As many of you who become registered dietitians, the majority are working with people in weight management backgrounds,

11
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:59,220
even if you're working in, say, a clinic or or even there's a lot of number that else.

12
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:04,470
So I want to start first with this question here. So there were some videos I hope you watched.

13
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:12,360
And based on the fact that the average is like 90%, it looks like maybe most of you did about the heritability of obesity and the genetics these.

14
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:18,450
So what I want you to do is just spend a minute and just drop down some thoughts about what you think about this question.

15
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:24,299
And then after a minute, I'll make somebody noise and then I'll have you guys talk among yourselves,

16
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:32,840
and then we'll report back out about your partner, obesity and the genetics and sort of a minute by yourself.

17
00:01:32,840 --> 00:02:47,709
And we'll talk about it afterwards. Okay, so that's going to bed.

18
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:51,700
So spend three or 4 minutes talking to the people around you about what you thought, what they thought.

19
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:56,010
And then I'll ask you guys to report back. Can do what you said.

20
00:02:56,470 --> 00:03:00,870
So what do you take away? So.

21
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:17,230
Like I said, it was a mix up for this weekend, culturally diverse country and many more religious parties.

22
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:34,160
So like I said, you're not going to see what's best.

23
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:42,060
You got it. I also thought it was interesting, actually.

24
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:58,190
So I saw. But thought it was really good.

25
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:03,400
Like. Like. So.

26
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:11,990
I don't know. Do you have any sort clear?

27
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:24,080
Oh, God. You are absolutely right.

28
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:32,900
Oh, it's just a lot of people.

29
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:45,470
But something like that would go down.

30
00:04:46,220 --> 00:05:05,930
Well. You know, it's not something I think that could happen.

31
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:21,100
I don't know why I can tell you.

32
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:29,070
Oh, right, right, right.

33
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:42,370
You know, I have to tell you that I.

34
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:52,850
I, you know, my brother.

35
00:05:54,120 --> 00:06:17,840
Yeah. That's why I was like, I'm so busy trying to get, like, something like this to help me find out if that's going to work out.

36
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:32,560
Find somebody like that. Like, I usually like to plan ahead, so was like, I might just like this idea.

37
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:36,040
Okay. All right, so let's hear your guys's your guys's thoughts.

38
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:44,920
It. So we talked about our knowledge affecting of the targeting of pharmacotherapy.

39
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:56,380
So with appetite suppression or other mechanisms that would help the individual specifically to their genetic profile.

40
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:01,780
We also talked about genetic counseling like early on in life.

41
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:15,310
I did have a little bit of a out there idea about IVF and how there have been issues introduced with selecting which embryo to move forward with.

42
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:27,910
So with that, a little out there, but still. And then about personalizing lifestyle modifications, but recognizing that it's not a sole determinant.

43
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,610
That that's those are all three really good points.

44
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:37,810
One thing I just want to rip on a little bit is one big advantage of spacing out for those who take a little while to get there like I do sometimes,

45
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:41,500
you know, your genetic profile from basically conception. Right.

46
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:46,569
So you could use that as a way to sort of predict even way before somebody develops obesity what the risk is.

47
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:50,830
Right. That's the big advantage of genetics. Right. You don't want to wait until somebody already has obesity.

48
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:55,000
You can say, well, these person's at 20% higher risk or whatever, whatever the genetics says.

49
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,260
Yeah.

50
00:07:55,270 --> 00:08:03,150
And then you could tailor therapy to that and maybe not ignore some maybe not focus so much effort on somebody who's at very low risk of obesity,

51
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,970
soon to be 70 bucks different or an additional two brains.

52
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:21,770
And I think the environment if we like to you sorry my language that's good to try and explain if like for example if we know about the obesity if

53
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:33,700
their history I mean if the child would look like obese after a few years if we like provide a healthy environment that will not let him talk,

54
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:41,050
it would be like if there is unhealthy environment, that it would be high risk to be an obese when he grew up.

55
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:51,580
So I think that's only that makes you think since genes think the person to be obese also the environment around the.

56
00:08:53,740 --> 00:09:01,149
Yeah. No, that's a really good point. And so one of the maybe somewhat difficult things to get your head around a little bit is there are these,

57
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:04,330
you know, genetics says that it is extremely heritable.

58
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:04,809
Right.

59
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:11,310
So there are all these obesity associated genes that are in there and explains a lot of the variance in the human population in terms of obesity risk.

60
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:15,990
But we also know that obesity rates have increased really dramatically in the last 30 years.

61
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,090
Right. And that can't be evolutionary, right? Our genes have not changed in 30 years.

62
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:26,030
Right. So there are as you know, there has to be some genetic predisposition to interact with a particular change in the environment.

63
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:31,560
Right. These genetics of obesity existed 200 years ago, but those people weren't obese.

64
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,770
Right. Even though they had obesity related genes. Right. So that suggests environment is a really important point.

65
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:41,469
Know this is kind of I watched a documentary on this a while ago, so I don't know how research is developed,

66
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:48,160
but kind of thinking about especially during pregnancy, like exposure to obesity and chemicals.

67
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,500
And so if someone's already at a higher risk, then maybe try to have it.

68
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:58,880
And if they're pregnant with a child, like maybe trying to have them overweight, whatever those chemicals are most commonly found in.

69
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,230
So I don't know how much more research has come out about that. Yeah.

70
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,660
So that turns to the idea of obesogenic chemicals. It sort of turns out to be a really difficult thing to study, right?

71
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:12,760
Because women, for example, who are pregnant, our views are much more like the children who actually develop what you see.

72
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,910
Now, that could be a maternal environment thing or could be past genetic threat.

73
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:19,870
It could be the mother itself had obesity related genetics, and that's the puzzle.

74
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:26,200
And in terms of environmental chemicals, part of the problem is quite often that's part of a constellation of a lot of other

75
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:31,480
both behaviors and dietary habits and social structure is they're all together,

76
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,070
and it's really hard to separate those things out.

77
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:39,639
I've not seen a really compelling study that could really delineate is and obviously would be like wildly ethically

78
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:44,950
impermissible to like expose pregnant women to various environmental toxins to see which kids got abuse.

79
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:49,540
So it's going to be impossible to really ever know, but it is an area of sort of really active research for sure.

80
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:58,960
But there's also a lot of psychosocial impacts of people who are suffering from obesity kind of being able to step out of it.

81
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:01,810
It's a shame that I can't get anywhere with this.

82
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:10,300
I'm trying everything right, but maybe more because it's not the right environment, whatever you're in for doing the thing that you need to do.

83
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:16,720
But also when they go into treatment, avoiding things that just aren't going to work based on their particular profile.

84
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:23,979
Right. So there's two parts of that. So I think the second part is this idea of like finding more effective treatments,

85
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:26,620
which is sort of the basis of precision nutrition that we know, for example,

86
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:30,549
that for the vast majority people, exercise is not going to lose weight loss,

87
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:34,260
but maybe for some population of particular genetic variants, that is true.

88
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:36,640
You could maybe be more effective in terms of treating.

89
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:39,760
But I think your first point, which you're getting on, I think is really important that I think, you know,

90
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,690
is this idea of people think they have over control of their bodies and their disease states and things like that, but they really don't like.

91
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:50,800
In fact, my guess is that many of you, if I ask you before you learn anything about this,

92
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:57,040
ask you what percent of obesity is heritable, even if, I don't know, like 20 or 30% and I have control over 80 or 90% or whatever.

93
00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:00,610
But it's actually the opposite, right? So there's determinism in there.

94
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:03,880
It's 70% of it is genetics, 77% of it is genetic.

95
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:07,749
And you don't have to control it and you can't go back and change your genes right now.

96
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:11,140
And so, you know, having a little compassion for people who are struggling.

97
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,930
And then it's not because they're out there making poor life choices.

98
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:17,670
And if they were only, like a little more determined, they could, like alleviate themselves,

99
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:20,919
the symptoms they were born with a particular profile that is going to make

100
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:25,210
their journey much more difficult than somebody else's for kids for reading.

101
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:30,399
And I think that's a counseling standpoint. Again, I'm not already I don't counsel people well for a counseling standpoint.

102
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,229
I think that's maybe a really important takeaway here.

103
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:36,370
Right, is that, you know, just because somebody, you know, you told somebody you need to make these changes,

104
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:40,150
they may have made all those changes, maybe working really hard to make those changes, but it's certainly not helped.

105
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:45,079
Right. It may still not matter because of other changes that I was thinking about,

106
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:51,520
even if it's knowledge can help with trying to treat from a prevention standpoint.

107
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:58,800
If we know that a kid has a higher risk, how can we help prevent obesity from developing?

108
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:02,790
Because there is other associated, you know, chronic diseases.

109
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,940
Right. So that's where I think I was thinking about for my kids.

110
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:11,430
Yeah, absolutely. And I wish as a society, Western society, this includes Canada.

111
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:13,180
We did a better job of that, too. But you're right,

112
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:21,610
like focusing limited health resources on the subset of people that could be most helped by this as opposed to focusing on what we want more.

113
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:29,110
And so this is a question, I mean, going back to like 70% of it being genetic is not like this might be a real question.

114
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:36,040
Is that like a mutation? Like has it always been that way? Like, why are some people more predisposed to being obese versus others?

115
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:39,640
Is that like why?

116
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:45,490
That is a very that's a very big question. So I'm going to answer the narrowest part of your question,

117
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:52,360
which is the part I can answer is so when we say it's 70 to 80% genetic, that's largely based on twin studies and.

118
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,010
A lot of that is actually based on twin studies where twins were born,

119
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:00,540
obviously at the same time as kids who are quite a raised in different environments.

120
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:07,830
Right. And there's these canonical studies were done in Denmark and Sweden and France where they looked at twins raised in discordant family in birth,

121
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:11,310
and they found that really didn't matter where they were raised. It mattered that they were twins.

122
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:15,780
And that explained most of the variance. Now, that's something called broad sense heritability.

123
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:18,840
We don't know the exact genetics of those twins, or at least as far as I know.

124
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:24,569
We don't know the exact genetics, those twins. But we do know because twins or siblings have this much correlation with each other

125
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:28,860
compared to unrelated twins or unrelated siblings or even guys like Gore-Tex twins.

126
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:36,450
You can make assumptions on what percent is genetic. Now the actual genes that underlie that 77% that we do not yet understand.

127
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:41,310
Right. We can explain somewhere around 15 or 20% by knowing individual genes,

128
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:46,230
but we can't explain all of that variation that explains why twins are closer than these iconic twins.

129
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,270
Part of that is because we don't know all the genes yet,

130
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:53,190
but part of that is also because genes interact in unique ways and genes interact with the environment anyway.

131
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:58,940
So we may never get all the way up to about 70%, but that is the broadest sense of heritability that sounds.

132
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:02,159
So it's not a mutation that's just like a literal gene.

133
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,480
That means it's probably many, many, many different genes adding and working in synergy with each other.

134
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:10,550
Okay. Yeah, that's a really good question. And that makes it harder.

135
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:15,630
That makes it harder in terms of when we talk about predictive algorithms, even though we know it's 77% genetic,

136
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,110
we actually can only be predictive to about 20% because that was in the genes we know.

137
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,830
Right. But that's better. Like five years ago, we could only predict like 6%.

138
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:24,150
Right. So we're getting much better.

139
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:36,840
It's like although, like looking at genetic variants could be helpful and determining risk in terms of actual treatment,

140
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:41,880
wouldn't it be more beneficial to look at more specific biomarkers related to phenotype

141
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:47,940
rather than genetics because we're more able to match treatments to those things,

142
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:54,330
whereas with genotype, you don't necessarily know what genes might be treated better with which treatments.

143
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:58,830
Yeah. So that's. So there's, I guess there's two points there. So one is I think you're right.

144
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:05,610
The problem is for a lot of these phenotypes, the the root molecular phenotype is quite hard to measure.

145
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:09,720
So as we're going to talk about it today, a lot of the phenotype exists in the brain.

146
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:15,149
Right. And so you get like biopsies in the brain to figure out like what's going on, you know, even if you might want you know,

147
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:21,100
there are some cases where there might be a circulating biomarker like leptin or GOP one or something where that could be much more effective.

148
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:26,100
But watching a lot of the phenotypes exist in a complex neural in a very small part of the brain.

149
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,690
I wanted to tell you about in a minute, and that's a little harder to assess, right?

150
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:35,159
But you're right. Ideally, maybe there is some sort like biomarker that reflects what's going on in those parts of the brain.

151
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,840
And we at some point learn that, okay, so I'm going to move on.

152
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:45,179
I think I've already taken three or 4 minutes of time. So as I will continue to say, I've never taken a nutrition class in my life.

153
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:48,390
And so almost everything we talk about is not my area of expertize.

154
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:55,440
So this particular lecture about that, but appetite, regulation, we're lucky we have an expert who's going to come in.

155
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:01,560
So Warnick which who is a Ph.D. student studying the neurons harami and neurophysiology of appetite,

156
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,959
he's going to tell us a little we're going to take about 40 minutes here,

157
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:08,730
and he's going to talk a little bit about the regulation of appetite from a package of different perspectives.

158
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:15,360
And Warren has also taken a nutrition class. In fact, he took this exact nutrition class last year.

159
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:18,990
Right. So he's much more of an expert on this. And so I'm going to turn it over to him.

160
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:24,140
Warren, generously. Also, you might have seen him on perusal already this week, but he's also generous.

161
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:28,440
He said [INAUDIBLE] be available. If you have any questions that come up in the class, let them know to me and I look forward to Evan.

162
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:32,399
Just happy to keep engaging with you as we go on right through.

163
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:41,060
You are looking.

164
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:59,780
That's. Can you hear this on the media?

165
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:06,780
Can you hear this? Yes. Yes.

166
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:08,150
Thanks, Dave, for the introduction.

167
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:18,890
I am a student in the Department Physiology Network and I got an admission that you there are any things you can contact indirectly.

168
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:25,729
I am in the lab of Martin Meyers and we study like in like is high and read a lot of

169
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:30,920
cellular signals that contribute or give rise to diseases like diabetes and obesity.

170
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,710
And so part of that involves feeding.

171
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:41,910
And so before we begin, there is a review posted on perusal as an assignment written by Brad Wall and Mark Anderson.

172
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:47,310
They are neighboring labs at Harvard and both of them study appetite from different perspectives.

173
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:53,310
Mark studies the perspective of external cues and and how that shapes motivation to feed.

174
00:18:53,640 --> 00:19:01,320
And Brad has made a ton of discoveries on certain populations of neurons over the past couple decades and has completely reshaped the field.

175
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:09,380
And so they offer this encyclopedic review article that will go into way more detail than anything I can really cover by the Sun.

176
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:16,640
So all of us, each and all of us probably do this multiple times a day.

177
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:23,590
That's something that you're probably not thinking about, is that there's actually different stages of feeding behaviors that all of us go through,

178
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:28,690
and that would be accredited phases, consummately phases and post concentric phases.

179
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,490
And so the penalty phase of feeding behavior would be, I am hungry,

180
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:40,150
I am going to seek out food that I know is a resource to me and try and resolve my energy depletion.

181
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:43,810
And so that would mean I'm like walking to the sandwich shop down the street.

182
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:49,990
For animals, this becomes a lot more complex. They might have to actually find food sources that are not as accessible.

183
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:54,310
And so they have to seek forage and make sure that they are finding an adequate

184
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:58,730
amount of energy for them in that kind of Defense Department work is pretty simple.

185
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:07,270
That is me actually consuming the food. And so whether that is me going McDonald's and eating a burger or a mice or rat eating pellets,

186
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:13,330
this is us actually physically ingesting the food and then some triggered behaviors involved.

187
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:18,460
For rodents, it's very predictable. You seek out the food, you eat the food, and then they begin to groom make nests.

188
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:24,310
For us, it's a little different. Some of us have our own thing. Like all of us may go for a run or exercise after we eat within a couple of hours.

189
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:26,440
Others may take a nap when we get tired.

190
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:33,819
You guys, we'll talk about like the post Thanksgiving meal later on in the protein unit and how that is rumored to make you tired.

191
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:42,400
But keep in mind that feeding behavior is really three phases, and each of these phases can be interrupted or influenced by various things.

192
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:47,139
And so I love this sentence of eating to live or living to eat.

193
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:52,030
And really, we do both of these things all the time, right? We eat because we have to survive.

194
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:57,040
We also eat because food is great. We love food and it's a big social aspect of our lives.

195
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:02,080
And so understanding when we have to eat based on homeostatic means,

196
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:07,209
which is survival or hedonic influences, which is I like this food, this tastes good, I'm going to eat.

197
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:14,650
It helps us shape the idea that we really balance homeostatic and hedonic influences, and that shakes a meal.

198
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:22,780
And so really there are four parts to what a meal is, and that is meal frequency, timing, content and size.

199
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:30,400
And so frequency how often we are eating per day or how often we are eating per week, timing is a little different.

200
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:37,420
That would be there are specific windows that we like to feed and that would be when we wake up within a couple of hours.

201
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:42,070
And typically a lot of us eat before we go to bed within a couple of hours. Food content.

202
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,430
This is touching more on the index side of feeding.

203
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:50,410
And so things that we like to eat, we may eat more sugary foods if that's something that your palate enjoys,

204
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:54,250
more spicy foods, if that's something that you enjoy. So content makes up the meal.

205
00:21:54,490 --> 00:22:00,590
And then size. Size is influenced both by the dining influence and homeostatic influence.

206
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:05,979
And what this means is we have to eat enough food to not only ensure that we're going to survive for the next day.

207
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:09,560
I need enough calories, but if something tastes good, we may eat more of it.

208
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,620
And so something I want you to take away from the slide is that there are both

209
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:19,390
feedback mechanisms for eating and there are feedforward mechanisms for feeding.

210
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:25,390
And this is very important, right? A lot of us are probably familiar with feedback systems as a generality rate.

211
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:30,230
Something is low in your body, let's say like for example, modeling is low blood glucose.

212
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:34,500
Glucagon hormone causes blood glucose. To increase, you return to normal rate.

213
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:40,930
That is a feedback we detected in error in our environment and we've had a physiological response to then correct.

214
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:48,610
That error in forward mechanisms is something that probably all of us are a little less familiar with, but it requires a much more cognitive control.

215
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:51,520
I have to be able to, in terms of feeding,

216
00:22:51,670 --> 00:23:00,970
anticipate when there will be and when there won't be food available to me and have that influence all of these concepts of the meal in my feeding,

217
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,510
right? And so, for example, I'm hopping on an airplane later this evening.

218
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:08,200
I anticipate there's going to be a six hour window that I can't eat dinner.

219
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:14,709
And so I may eat a larger meal at 4 p.m. And through cognitive measures,

220
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:19,540
I'm able to make that decision to say I'm going to eat more now because I know there will be no food available for me later.

221
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:27,220
And we have to be very good at both feedback and feedforward mechanisms of feeding or else we are not, to put it bluntly.

222
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:30,670
And so the differences between hunger and appetite,

223
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:38,619
then we like to classify things that give them terms so we can actually talk about them in literature in this world.

224
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:44,620
And so hunger, the term emotional state associated with food deprivation and appetite.

225
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:49,990
The difference is that there is a short term desire to eat in the intensity of the desire to eat.

226
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:56,259
And so things like hunger, we can measure right in an animal, which is how all of this stuff is studied.

227
00:23:56,260 --> 00:24:00,219
We can say, okay, the now suppress to the letter 40 times to get 40 pellets.

228
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:04,910
It was 40 pellets hungry. That is a unit for us. We can't ask a mouse.

229
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:07,360
Are you hungry? Right. I can ask all of you. Are you hungry?

230
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,140
You can tell us when we do protein and studies, we have to have a way to operationally quantify the.

231
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:19,899
And these terms gave us about. Okay, so motivation to eat comes in all different forms.

232
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:25,000
And so whether we willing to seek and consume food or whether we going to terminate the meal,

233
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:29,709
there are a lot of factors that influence this and we'll go over some of these throughout the lecture.

234
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:37,000
But essentially there are internal physiological motivations that cause us to seek and consume food.

235
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:40,600
This may be that we're hypoglycemic, we have low fat storage.

236
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:48,069
These are towards more chronic signals. And hormonal signals would tell us that cause us to seek and engage in feeding

237
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:53,260
behaviors like repetitive or constant Borges and low micronutrient levels like salt.

238
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:57,219
A lot of you guys will probably talk more about the micronutrient stuff next semester,

239
00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:03,460
but all of these are very powerful and the age in the act of eating so and so.

240
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:11,559
Not only do we have to eat because we survive, but there are also external cues in the environment that we see every day that

241
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:15,820
force us or allow us to begin entering one of these feeding behavioral phases.

242
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:19,990
Right. And so I may walk my insomnia cookies and say, Oh, that sounds really good.

243
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:23,590
I want to do that. And that could be accessibility to palatable or rewarding foods.

244
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:29,320
Also, I could be very, very hungry and I could say, okay, I absolutely need to eat now.

245
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:32,740
And I can see a sign that I recognize as what we call food cue.

246
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:39,790
Right. And so this could be the subway sign. This could be the McDonald's sign and is a food cue that I've grown to associate those signs with.

247
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:48,340
Food is there. I will go there. And so external cues can cause us to seek or engage in a pattern over constantly phrases.

248
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:54,670
As far as meal termination goes, we again have internal signals and external signals,

249
00:25:55,030 --> 00:26:00,490
and so internal signals would be things like hormones, high insulin or left in levels that helps us terminate a meal.

250
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:05,650
Gut distention signals stress in the stomach or in the intestines.

251
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:10,270
It tells us it all and relays those signals to our brain to say, okay, we must terminate the meal.

252
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:17,079
There is enough and you have enough energy. And then that allows for inhibition of what we call primary feeding centers in the brain.

253
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:21,220
And we'll talk about that and what those are. And finally,

254
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:28,989
the external or environmental cues that would allow us to terminate a meal on animals

255
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:33,580
experienced predator threat when you're in an environment they may encounter if they are prey,

256
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:36,730
animal operator is they know when to stop eating and run away.

257
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,560
But for us it could be things like noxious stimuli, things that we just don't like to use.

258
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:47,679
And these are sick or social stigma. We may be there may be anxiety surrounding eating in public.

259
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:52,540
And so that could cause us to terminate a meal in a large practice by while we are having our lunchtime meal.

260
00:26:55,500 --> 00:27:02,610
So now we'll talk a little bit about the anatomy. And so that's my brain, like picture in the brain.

261
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:08,249
And so what I want you to understand is that humans and rodents and and other species as well.

262
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:17,549
There are many areas that are conserved between species because these behaviors are so fundamental throughout involution to make sure that we seek,

263
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:20,100
engage and find food to actually eat.

264
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:25,710
And so, for example, areas that have thrown up on the board in our fictional human brain would be the nucleus accumbens,

265
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:30,300
the hypothalamus, the ventral segmental area, and the dorsal vagal complex.

266
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:34,739
And so the two that we'll talk more about today are mindfulness.

267
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:41,280
In the dorsal vagal complex. The hypothalamus is kind of our big homeostasis center in the brain.

268
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:45,540
Four things way more than feeding, but it contains tons of different neurons,

269
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:51,210
thousands that are interconnected with each other, constantly sending signals on what our internal state is.

270
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:55,020
And the dorsal vagal complex lies in behind the brain.

271
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:03,600
And several areas within that complex basically help with meal termination and relaying those signals to the hypothalamus itself.

272
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:12,420
And so that's something that's conserved between humans and rodents and helps terminate meal and relay long term energy status to the brain.

273
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:16,319
And so the nucleus accumbens and ventral segmental area,

274
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:25,140
these are areas that are lesser known to be involved in actual homeostatic feeding or eating to settlement or eating to survive.

275
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:35,220
And rather they influence things that we like to eat or addictive properties or I say addictive take that lightly.

276
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:42,660
Addictive properties of food are highly researched and we don't actually know if like food addiction or certain foods are more addictive than others,

277
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:50,580
but they are like helping relay what we find is like in rewarding food to our hypothalamus and to the north, a little complex.

278
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:56,490
And so let's go into the hypothalamus, which we had our human brains.

279
00:28:56,490 --> 00:29:03,270
But let's imagine you finally standing sideways. The brain's facing this way, and then we make a cut down this way.

280
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:09,120
And so now we're projecting a parallel section upon the board, and we're looking right at the hypothalamus.

281
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:17,549
And so the hypothalamus is made up of tons of different what we call nuclei or just tons of cells compacted into anatomical areas.

282
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:20,970
That's a term that neuroscientists use for regions in the brain.

283
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:25,379
And so all of these different areas within the hypothalamus are talking to each other,

284
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:36,270
are sending signals both from peripheral signals from the body that are hormone based and peptide based and like glucose is also one.

285
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:44,879
And they are receiving these signals from the periphery through that third ventricle, which is designated in the gray, large space.

286
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:54,570
And so this is a giant liquid filled area that allows for things like hormones and things like nutrients to actually enter and enter the brain.

287
00:29:54,690 --> 00:30:01,530
They've crossed the blood brain barrier from the periphery and then they actually interact directly with neurons in all of these areas.

288
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:09,450
And so to break down what some of these areas do, we have the argument nucleus, which is at the bottom near the third ventricle,

289
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:13,739
this is what we would call the one of the primary feeding centers in the brain.

290
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:18,900
It contains two of the most important populations of neurons that are related to feeding.

291
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:29,730
And so these neurons, we call them first order neurons because these neurons are some of the first to actually receive peripheral signals like leptin,

292
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:38,670
insulin and other hormones. And so those hormones travel from the third ventricle through what we call the median eminence, which is basically a gate.

293
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:48,150
And this gate is a bunch of different capillaries that with various widths and it allows certain sizes of things to cross and peptides,

294
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:51,840
and these hormones can then cross and interact with neurons in the surrounding area.

295
00:30:52,500 --> 00:31:01,409
And so when we have this idea of first order neurons and they control hunger and satiety and we have this idea that peripheral

296
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:08,910
hormones are entering the brain and they're actually communicating to these hunger and satiety based neurons in terms of feelings,

297
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,470
why do we need other spaces in the brain that actually control these things?

298
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,840
And as it turns out,

299
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:23,040
this is super complex and that answer is not really well understood because there are tons of different areas in the brain that control feeding.

300
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:28,230
And if you were to like artificially stimulate certain neurons in probably six or seven different areas of the brain,

301
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:30,390
you could cause an animal to eat immediately.

302
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:38,400
And so it becomes really complex with trying to understand, well, the venom inhibits food intake, but the damage also inhibits food intake.

303
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:44,159
And so what we think is that each of these different areas that are involved with either turning,

304
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:47,760
feeding on or turning feeding off, it's context dependent.

305
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:54,390
And so the VM amend the data is pretty controversial, but we think that the V-NAND inhibits food intake.

306
00:31:54,700 --> 00:32:00,090
In times of stress or under threat in animals, but in no other circumstance.

307
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:04,750
And so we also think that the dorsal medial hypothalamus inhibits feeding,

308
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:10,000
like when we see food and starts to shut down the idea that we need to keep seeking for food.

309
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,910
And so while if we artificially stimulate the damage,

310
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:19,719
we can turn off feeding and if we artificially stimulate the being, then we can also turn off feeding or inhibit food.

311
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:26,710
Intake becomes a lot more complex when we add, well, what is the context of what these things are doing in real life situations?

312
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:30,750
And I just wanted to put this up here.

313
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:38,700
So hypothalamic neurons project within each other, and they project from certain cells like in the lateral hypothalamus,

314
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:42,410
they'll project to the damage, but they may also project to other areas in the brain as well.

315
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:52,200
And so not only do they share projection targets, but they may project to the same downstream cells elsewhere in the brain or in the hypothalamus.

316
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:59,219
And so we can have two neurons projecting to one other neuron, for example, in a different area.

317
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:08,790
Or we could have one neuron projecting to many other neurons and depending upon how many connection sites this helps decide what is the complexity

318
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:16,110
of the feeding behavior we are engaging in and what is the type of response the animal release now in order to start feeling for some.

319
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:23,590
Okay. So let's take a break from just talking and we'll do a group discussion.

320
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:30,280
So you guys learned about heritability of obesity and that it can influence genetics.

321
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:34,360
It can also influence the brain structure of the brain.

322
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:43,360
And that helps build the case for this is not the only thing, but this is also a structural and and signaling thing as well, obesity.

323
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:49,090
And so let's discuss how heritability may influence feedforward mechanisms,

324
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:57,910
our ability to anticipate food consumption or our anticipate to anticipate like food degradation and feedback that is associated with it.

325
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:01,780
So let's take a minute, think about it and then we will end this.

326
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:18,550
And I want to hear. Make sense.

327
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:56,800
Right. Let's do small groups now and then I'll walk around. I was thinking that.

328
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:10,450
I. Sometimes triggers, like when your finances are just moving your heart like.

329
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:17,810
Like the response you are.

330
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:23,700
You know, like my crazy. Yeah.

331
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:36,080
Like, yeah, that is like. Just so you know.

332
00:35:42,300 --> 00:36:22,880
I mean, I think you're always I think maybe I should go back to, you know, one of the challenges that we have sometimes.

333
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:54,610
So I went through the first and second half chemotherapy.

334
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:13,760
And after that, I think probably something like that, like, you know, like My Fair Lady something.

335
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:25,890
So, yes, you are. Because I would think so.

336
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:41,660
Yes. That's is one of the challenges is trying to be as good as it was, but really another world.

337
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:54,409
And so you're right. So people can move or they can also, Rosie, I'm afraid for the pregnancy.

338
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:58,400
I'm really going there has to be some signal related to the pregnancy,

339
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:19,260
like I knew about this requirement for some people argued that it might be something else cause, you know, that's a good example.

340
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:28,730
Like, just like doing other things, like, it's gonna be all right, okay?

341
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:37,640
We don't know right now, you know?

342
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:43,640
So I think it might help.

343
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:51,470
Trust me. Like, yeah, that's exactly how that works.

344
00:38:54,630 --> 00:39:01,340
Tell me about what you know about something in there.

345
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:15,110
I mean, so.

346
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:25,580
So how can there be a reason why I'm not fully available in my life?

347
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:30,580
So you just make an error and misjudgment?

348
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:39,280
I know that it's not necessarily.

349
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:54,890
I think sometimes not. So when it comes to, like, citizens or something like that, you get less sensory.

350
00:39:56,600 --> 00:40:04,430
So they're like, so I don't know if you can imagine genetic material.

351
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:24,130
I mean you're to helping are you going for that counter back so that was like moving right?

352
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:32,780
Right. Yeah. I mean. So what are what are groups thinking?

353
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:49,179
I talked to. Older people have got to volunteer because I don't have enough information.

354
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:58,930
And that seems like a lot of money that they've lost.

355
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:08,089
But they have some people that resistance. You have to have climbed up to levels that you want to be important them like in the pilot.

356
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:14,200
Then you should decrease the source of the intake and the instructor feedback.

357
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:18,940
You can see the thing is, maybe the reward system will be affected.

358
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:22,840
I want to enjoy the sugarless sweets.

359
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:27,480
Are you disappointed that I'm. I got three words.

360
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:33,670
I have to stop. She thinks I can go so musicians can play it all. They were systems that be chronically activated.

361
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:36,700
That's why we have all this to. To eat. We have food.

362
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:40,270
And this. This is how the feedforward is affected.

363
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:43,329
They forgot to fix it. I think it ends up in context.

364
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:48,710
We have to link it to the feedback mechanism. When you have mutations, it will affect the future.

365
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:51,940
Yeah, I like those thoughts, especially the cravings.

366
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:59,520
So I think the point about cravings or if we have excessive cravings on food are probably going to eat more anticipation that like,

367
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:03,850
oh, I probably will have access to this free donut box that's outside the classroom right now.

368
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:07,990
So going to have for donuts in anticipation that later I'm not going to going to have that same food.

369
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:14,230
But in reality later on, I may have access to that food again and therefore, the feedforward mechanism is compromised.

370
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:19,690
We'll talk about leptin in leptin resistance like five or ten slides because it's a good discussion.

371
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:25,120
Any other thoughts? When we talk about critical development time points?

372
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:29,179
I think it brings in a whole psychological part of it as well.

373
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:33,610
Like genetically, your bodies presuppose a certain size or something.

374
00:42:34,270 --> 00:42:38,530
At my example, as I adopted a dog live and starve to death,

375
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:44,590
and even though we got into a healthy weight and he had regular meals that he could plan on and he still scavenged,

376
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:53,260
like psychologically because he had been in that position where his body was begging for more food all the time, forever more.

377
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:59,320
He carried that with him, despite being at a normal weight where those genes kind of make that psychological issue.

378
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:07,600
And he always had to measure measures, couldn't just like playing, you know, free feed him or whatever being clients.

379
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:10,980
He was always in a performance of his weight. Yeah.

380
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:14,080
Because of that development. Because he was as a puppy developmentally.

381
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:20,080
And I'm sure childhood and famine and food insecurity have some of the same hoarding issues.

382
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:27,160
Yeah. So I don't know if you guys talk about this later, like when the Dutch winter hunger.

383
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:32,410
Hunger. Winters Yeah. You know, okay.

384
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:38,470
So, so when you shift from like a low energy available environment to a high energy and environment,

385
00:43:38,770 --> 00:43:46,720
depending upon when in your life or like developmental stages, an embryo you do that can have drastically different effects on how you seek out food.

386
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:51,640
And so I'll just touch on this in case you bring up later in the semester. They don't want or hunger.

387
00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:55,299
There was a famine, right. And a lot of people were pregnant at that time.

388
00:43:55,300 --> 00:44:01,360
And when they were pregnant and carrying their baby, they were essentially starved and under effect.

389
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:11,559
Their child was start and then the famine ended and those who survived and gave birth gave birth to children in energy surplus environments.

390
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:23,110
And so they that is basically one of the highest risk factors of like obesity is being developing during an energy like replete or a low environment.

391
00:44:23,110 --> 00:44:29,860
And then later on you are in energy, high environment, and you just consume food because I guess part of the reason that of all three.

392
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:34,120
Yeah, that's a good point. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

393
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:40,120
I think that relates to what I was thinking about earlier. I was thinking about almost like a treatment for like the three forward,

394
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:46,509
like thinking about hypnotherapy and hypnosis to be able to potentially break some of those like for example,

395
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:54,010
like food cues, like if you could treat it through hypnotherapy to like disassociate like Domino's,

396
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:59,440
it's like it's time to eat you about that aspect of it as well.

397
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:06,560
Yeah. Yeah. And probably over the next couple of decades as we learn more about this stuff like alternative therapies to help it,

398
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:11,980
once we understand about what the external environment in is doing, that's going to something helpful, right?

399
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:15,700
Because that is a relatively new field as of like a decade ago.

400
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:18,879
We have the technology to ask those questions. So pretty exciting.

401
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,610
It's gonna be really quickly. Next, attention. All right.

402
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:32,170
So now what we're going to talk about is we've had the opportunity in the brain to identify basically two sets of neurons.

403
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:35,290
They are in the argument and they.

404
00:45:35,390 --> 00:45:42,140
One, we've assigned the emotional state of hunger and one able to assign the emotional state of satiety.

405
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:48,679
And so if we are in a different part of the hypothalamus, we're a little bit more forward or explosive.

406
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:57,230
Euronews than we were in the last while. We have the argument nucleus and in the Arctic nucleus there are two major cell populations.

407
00:45:57,260 --> 00:46:02,839
One is a group called these hunger neurons, and one is harnessing neurons.

408
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,700
And we call these the satiety neurons.

409
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:13,430
And these neurons project to the exact same cells downstream in another area of the hypothalamus called the power ventricular English.

410
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:16,550
And these cells are called M.C. for our cells.

411
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:26,900
And so what they are doing is when we are hungry and we are in an energy deficit, the ERP neurons are sending signals,

412
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:32,720
lots of signals downstream to the ventricular nucleus and specifically the MCE for our cells.

413
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:36,230
And they are inhibiting those cells, they are turning those cells on.

414
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:39,800
And so the feeling of hunger is actually an inhibition.

415
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:44,450
And so we are sending cell signals downstream that say turn these cells off.

416
00:46:44,450 --> 00:46:48,650
And so that's what causes us to actually engage in food seeking behavior.

417
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:54,720
Now likewise, when we are sated, HRP Neurons are off and poncy.

418
00:46:54,740 --> 00:47:01,129
Neurons are sending tons of signals to the energy for our cells and basically saying we do not need to seek for food.

419
00:47:01,130 --> 00:47:06,020
There are more important things going on in your life. We have to move on from the food seeking in the population.

420
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:13,100
We are good, we are energy away from that. And that's basically those activities are very high between meals.

421
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:17,750
And so what we know is that HAARP neurons are not only activated by energy deficit,

422
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:22,370
they're also activated by cortisol, which they will go to in a little bit of stress eating cycles.

423
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:30,950
But they are also activated by growing, which is a hormone from the stomach that basically causes this feeling of hunger and pharmacy neurons.

424
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:34,010
They are activated by the sensory detection of food.

425
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:42,130
So if I am hungry and I am encountering a couple, immediately my HRP neurons turn off and my passing neurons turn on.

426
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:47,030
Now that doesn't cause me to stop eating or say, Oh, I don't want the apple anymore, I'm not hungry.

427
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:51,560
But there is some sort of lasting signal that our neurons provide.

428
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:56,720
But we have to shut them off right away so that we don't overeat or overconsume food.

429
00:47:57,080 --> 00:48:02,030
And so it's important to note that not only do air neurons cause the food seeking behaviors,

430
00:48:02,390 --> 00:48:07,549
but also they are shut off immediately at time of meal consumption because of prolonged,

431
00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:12,230
sustained signals sitting sent from our neurons cause more eating.

432
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:21,770
And so other important statement involved is both of these cell types receive hormone input and other types of inputs from the periphery,

433
00:48:21,890 --> 00:48:30,020
from the meeting eminence and directly interact with each other to make these determinants of hunger or flip to satiety.

434
00:48:31,430 --> 00:48:38,720
And so these are pretty great studies done where we are able to artificially activate air p cells in mice.

435
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:44,510
And so how this works is just by show of hands. Has anyone heard a designer receptor is activated by designer drugs?

436
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:50,840
A few people. What about optogenetics? Okay.

437
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:54,550
So these are two of the most important tools in neuroscience right now.

438
00:48:54,560 --> 00:49:04,070
And what they allow us to do is either chronically turn on cells, dreads or rapidly and quickly turn on cells or optogenetics.

439
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:05,209
And so on the left,

440
00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:14,510
what we see is we manipulated a mouse and manipulated its genetics to exclusively express this dread molecule in ag RPE cells only.

441
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:24,110
And what happens is in when you give an injection of CNO into the animal, the CNO interacts with this dread molecule and turns the cells on.

442
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:27,770
And so the CNO does not interact with anything else in the body.

443
00:49:28,070 --> 00:49:32,360
And essentially it targets specifically this genetic modification that we've made.

444
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:38,870
And so we are able to turn on HAARP cells only and observe the effects on food intake with that.

445
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:44,670
And so what happens is if you give the injection when a mouse is not likely to eat,

446
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:50,990
it turns out that if you turn these cells on, you can force the mice to feed and really feed a lot.

447
00:49:51,140 --> 00:50:00,200
And so that red line is when we've given the CNO injection and we've turned on our neurons and the food intake is on the left,

448
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:02,960
and so food intake goes up and up and up and up and up over a four hour period.

449
00:50:03,290 --> 00:50:07,580
Whereas if you give a control injection or don't give an injection, the mouse basically doesn't eat at all.

450
00:50:07,910 --> 00:50:13,879
Right. And on the bottom, we also have a dread molecule that will turn off cells.

451
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:21,590
And so if you use that to manipulate the mice's genetics, to express this other dread molecule that turns off just NTR neurons,

452
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:28,010
if you turn those cells off at a time where mice need to feed and are hungry, they eat less.

453
00:50:28,370 --> 00:50:32,840
And so that red line now is less than the other lines, because we turn those cells off,

454
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:38,600
the mouse eats less compared to if we were to leave those cells on during a normal feeding period.

455
00:50:39,890 --> 00:50:44,090
Now, if we shift to the right, we're using optogenetics for the second experiment.

456
00:50:44,090 --> 00:50:51,200
And so after genetics, basically a similar concept where we manipulate the mice's genetics to respond to

457
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:58,430
where only in your cells is there a ion channel which opens in response to light.

458
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:06,050
And so when you shine light in the mouse's brain, the cells turn on and we can see immediately what happens as far as behavior goes.

459
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:10,310
And so when we turn on these cells in the absence of food,

460
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:17,180
so if we are constantly stimulating these cells for an hour when there is no food present and then present food to a mouse,

461
00:51:17,390 --> 00:51:22,940
it will eat like voraciously, even though we've not we're not turning on those cells anymore.

462
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:27,050
And so we've turned them on for an hour. Air T cells. They're active, active, active, active.

463
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:30,320
Sending signals, sending signals. And then we cut off the stimulation.

464
00:51:30,770 --> 00:51:34,340
There is now large food consumption when we actually present food.

465
00:51:34,670 --> 00:51:43,069
And so what we know is not only our neurons when they're active, are they sufficient to induce feeding long after they are active?

466
00:51:43,070 --> 00:51:46,260
We can still continue to induce feeding greater.

467
00:51:48,210 --> 00:51:56,310
And so we'll briefly touch on the internal and physiological basis as to why we seek food and to why we terminate the meal.

468
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:04,820
And some of this involves European concerns into Greenland is a hormone released

469
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:09,470
from steam and when you're something is empty or when you when be hungry,

470
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:17,120
ghrelin levels rise and then ground levels are able to activate HRP cells and induce this feeling of hunger.

471
00:52:17,690 --> 00:52:23,210
Likewise, that presence of ghrelin inhibits passing neurons turning off satiety.

472
00:52:23,330 --> 00:52:31,040
Right. So stomach is empty run. The levels are high energy RPE cells are on and hunger is the emotional state that we are feeling.

473
00:52:31,610 --> 00:52:41,240
And so the idea is to try and like hijack this idea that volume in the stomach is what's causing the feeling of hunger.

474
00:52:42,050 --> 00:52:45,110
People sometimes undertake what's called a volumetric diet,

475
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:52,880
and so they basically eat foods like vegetables that are super high in volume and water dense, but not necessarily calorically dense.

476
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:59,030
And that causes the stomach to expand. And theoretically, ghrelin levels would go down and appetite would go down.

477
00:53:00,650 --> 00:53:08,120
But likely you're probably just going to have to eat again sooner and later because you have not actually depleted your energy storage rate.

478
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:13,580
But volumetric diets are basically built around this idea that we can suppress ghrelin action.

479
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:22,800
So let's talk about London. This is what I study. And so I study locked in action in the brain and specifically in the DNA.

480
00:53:23,850 --> 00:53:28,920
And so London is this molecule that the more adipose tissue we have,

481
00:53:29,370 --> 00:53:37,230
the more left in there is in circulation and leptin acts to inhibit food intake and increase energy expenditure.

482
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:46,740
And it does so by, in the same manner, crossing the blood brain barrier and acting directly with cells all throughout the hypothalamus and hydrogen.

483
00:53:47,790 --> 00:53:55,709
And it basically causes this inhibition of food intake signal, because if we have lots of adipose tissue and if we have lots of London,

484
00:53:55,710 --> 00:53:59,640
theoretically we are energy replete and we don't need to seek out more food.

485
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:09,240
We don't need to eat more. But the idea is if so many neurons express the leptin receptor and our leptin sensitive, why?

486
00:54:09,270 --> 00:54:13,480
Like, why do we need so many different areas of the brain to actually interact with London?

487
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:22,740
An answer is we just don't know yet. We don't know why leptin receptor action in some cells produces changes in food intake as opposed to other cells.

488
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:29,580
It just doesn't seem to do much. And so leptin is basically the idea that we have a direct connection between the

489
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:33,840
body and the adipose tissue in the brain to tell us what our energy reserves are.

490
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:45,330
So you brought up leptin resistance earlier, and so leptin resistance is a hypothesis for why those individuals who are obese do not have the

491
00:54:45,330 --> 00:54:50,040
connection between the body and the brain to tell the brain that there's enough energy around,

492
00:54:51,570 --> 00:54:55,740
it's a good hypothesis. So leptin is relatively newly discovered.

493
00:54:56,460 --> 00:55:02,000
Like 30 years ago, people discovered leptin and thought it was going to be the cure for obesity because we could take leptin and

494
00:55:02,060 --> 00:55:06,300
we could inject to individuals and they would eat and they would burn energy and then they would lose weight.

495
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:14,340
And it's a really cool idea. But like you said earlier, the problem is that those who are obese already have high levels of lockdown.

496
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:18,569
And so it didn't seem to have that inhibition on food intake that we thought it would.

497
00:55:18,570 --> 00:55:24,300
And it turns out leptin injections don't really do much in terms of trying to prevent obesity.

498
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:28,920
And there are only like 20 people worldwide who have been identified for lack of funding.

499
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:32,040
So many people not. The treatment works great for everyone else.

500
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:38,160
It doesn't. And that's the resistance that is associated with type two diabetes.

501
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:46,350
So, so yeah, in some ways. So leptin resistance is the hypothesis for why all of this happens.

502
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:56,640
So the idea is more adipose tissue promotes inflammation and inflammation in the periphery leads in to be inflammation in the brain.

503
00:55:56,910 --> 00:56:03,930
And that kind of mucks up all of these intracellular signals within the neuron that causes leptin to function properly.

504
00:56:04,290 --> 00:56:07,140
And there is some evidence to support resistance.

505
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:15,900
And the evidence says neuroinflammation in the hypothalamus specifically causes leptin signals to basically not work.

506
00:56:16,890 --> 00:56:24,420
The problem is that if you have a mouse that is overweight and is obese and you give it a leptin injection,

507
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:29,010
there are effects of leptin that are still observed. There is an increase in energy expenditure.

508
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:32,819
We can see increases in blood pressure and heart rate.

509
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:36,810
All of these functions attributed to leptin. We can still see when we get the leptin injection.

510
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:44,760
So if there is less than resistance and if it's real, it may be localized only to very specific areas in the brain.

511
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:49,370
But some people don't believe in the resistance, others do.

512
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:54,420
It's kind of like a thing where there's evidence for some, there's evidence for it not it's it's kind of controversial.

513
00:56:54,660 --> 00:57:01,350
But I think personally, I've only you know, I've been working on this stuff for a little bit, but I think it's possible.

514
00:57:01,350 --> 00:57:05,190
But it's probably not the whole story that's that's causing things.

515
00:57:06,950 --> 00:57:10,010
Okay. The last thing here is we'll talk about insulin as a hormone.

516
00:57:11,090 --> 00:57:14,990
Insulin is extremely well studied in the brain in terms of development.

517
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:24,680
Insulin has a huge control over neurons forming connections in the brain and has an especially important aspect in feeding neurons,

518
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:26,990
finding connections at various levels of development.

519
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:34,850
And what we find is that if an increase in insulin in the brain is actually able to inhibit HRP neurons.

520
00:57:34,850 --> 00:57:40,790
And so we think, okay, this acute action of insulin is to inhibit food intake post meal.

521
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:48,260
The problem is if you knock out insulin receptors from HRP neurons or if you basically take in some receptor out of those cells,

522
00:57:49,010 --> 00:57:52,610
it doesn't seem to have a huge thing on food intake.

523
00:57:52,610 --> 00:58:00,620
It doesn't seem to have a huge impact. And so we don't really know exactly how insulin is is really making its mark on appetite control.

524
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:07,490
But there's something there and and there's definitely something there developmentally something that is new.

525
00:58:07,490 --> 00:58:10,700
And I don't know if anyone knows Carrie Ferrario, but she's a professor here.

526
00:58:10,970 --> 00:58:16,130
She studies insulin signaling in the nucleus accumbens, one of the reward centers in the brain.

527
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:20,750
And she thinks that insulin action has some connection between association of work.

528
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:25,910
And so I would point you towards her work to really understand the action of insulin and an appetite control.

529
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:34,700
And so we spend all this time talking about signals and all this time talking about hormones and neural signals.

530
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:40,309
But the important thing is that some of these are post ingested like insulin

531
00:58:40,310 --> 00:58:46,730
and ghrelin is pre ingested and air neuron have it right before food intake.

532
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:54,500
This is slow, right? And so the general steps to meal termination are that p cells are inhibited.

533
00:58:54,500 --> 00:59:01,520
As soon as we see food, the gut distention and mechanical stress in the stomach and the intestines send signals to the hungry.

534
00:59:03,230 --> 00:59:07,100
Over here. There that's marked nts. That's where the dorsal vagal complex is.

535
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:10,520
And then these signals are related to hypothalamus. And we say, stop you.

536
00:59:12,470 --> 00:59:17,629
This is slow, right? You can take a little while from food to get from your mouth to your stomach enough for it

537
00:59:17,630 --> 00:59:22,220
to actually expand and cause these mechanical signals to be translated into neural signals.

538
00:59:22,670 --> 00:59:26,450
And so the actual if you're hungry, right.

539
00:59:26,450 --> 00:59:32,029
And, and you're influencing over meal size, you could probably eat a lot of food before your body says,

540
00:59:32,030 --> 00:59:35,750
okay, you've, you've had enough, you've had actually way too much.

541
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:40,130
Now there's a lot of signals being sent and now you feel bloated and you eat too much,

542
00:59:40,670 --> 00:59:45,230
but you can kind of hijack this post ingested signal system to eat more.

543
00:59:46,130 --> 00:59:52,490
And so finally, the chronic signals would come in like leptin and say, okay, your full environment and we're going to shut this down.

544
00:59:53,960 --> 01:00:00,710
And so the point here is that post suggestive signals become delayed posting.

545
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:09,860
And so we talk a lot about the single or specific genes that could be associated with obesity.

546
01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:14,839
Here are examples of that do exist where mutations in these genes.

547
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:24,050
Absolutely and definitely will cause obesity, some of them on the left in button receptor and for arsenal in corridors out there.

548
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:31,849
And so all of these things, these mutations absolutely cause obesity, yet they are a very small number of the population.

549
01:00:31,850 --> 01:00:39,200
And so it doesn't explain the whole picture. It doesn't explain exactly what's going on for the majority of the patients who have obesity.

550
01:00:41,540 --> 01:00:45,260
So if you just call this out, but what are some external stimuli?

551
01:00:45,290 --> 01:00:49,040
We're going to shift now to talking about the outside environment in.

552
01:00:49,620 --> 01:00:59,890
And I wanted you to tell me, like, what are some external stimuli that might cause you to eat or engage in feeding behavior and show that that

553
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:06,410
kind of that association of doing a thing and requires food and moving for that kind of environmental science.

554
01:01:06,710 --> 01:01:10,430
You associate that? Sure, yeah. Like that kind of thing.

555
01:01:10,430 --> 01:01:18,170
Something like a catch phrase or a sound or even like actively assign like food cues are really, really good athletes to do.

556
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:21,560
Being a visual representation of something, I know what food means.

557
01:01:22,670 --> 01:01:26,720
So McDonald's sign, that's a great thing. That would be an external stimuli.

558
01:01:26,930 --> 01:01:29,960
A catch phrase is a good thing. Anything that gets us thinking about food.

559
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:40,040
And so let's talk about what the external signals are that seek and consume food and then the ones that cause us determined not.

560
01:01:40,670 --> 01:01:48,560
And so accessibility to palatable and rewarding food does not necessarily mean that the food itself is rewarding.

561
01:01:48,860 --> 01:01:52,549
Or could it be in like a wrapper that is we know is rewarding?

562
01:01:52,550 --> 01:01:58,960
Is like, what if someone pranked you and put like a Klondike bar in the word no, sorry.

563
01:01:58,970 --> 01:02:04,210
The kale in a Klondike bar wrapper. Right. You would see the packaging and you would say I want Klondike bar, that's me.

564
01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:08,900
Great. And then you open it up and. Immediately. Disappointment is great because it's not it's not what you thought it was at all.

565
01:02:08,930 --> 01:02:16,659
And that's evil. And I hope all of you do that to your friends. But yeah, that's something that can cause us to think about what's possible,

566
01:02:16,660 --> 01:02:21,670
what's rewarding this q in the Environ is telling me I'm going to engage in eating because it tastes good.

567
01:02:22,630 --> 01:02:30,010
And like we talked about food cues being a visual, auditory or a sense of smell and what would be some,

568
01:02:30,010 --> 01:02:33,700
maybe some more food cues related to some of those three things.

569
01:02:35,590 --> 01:02:39,930
What are your food cues like when you see food signs or smells like?

570
01:02:39,940 --> 01:02:45,020
What are the things that make you hungry? Talking about antigens.

571
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:48,740
Okay. Is that is that essential? Yeah. Okay. Of course.

572
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:52,700
I sort of go with that. Yeah. Okay. So that's something the smell.

573
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:56,330
And then is it blue? Is it a blue sign? So like the blue science thing.

574
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:59,390
So you can see that and you say, okay, I definitely do these pretzels. I can eat that.

575
01:02:59,750 --> 01:03:03,200
Does anyone have any other, like interesting food cues for them?

576
01:03:03,410 --> 01:03:08,600
Like my phone feels when people eat? So that is the more sounds.

577
01:03:08,870 --> 01:03:12,500
Yeah, yeah, definitely. And that's also a good one.

578
01:03:13,010 --> 01:03:19,220
And so these two things that we pointed out like these aren't personal to you and they may not affect me at all.

579
01:03:19,250 --> 01:03:25,670
I I've never been to a cat restaurant ever. And so that's not something that would ring that same external cue to me.

580
01:03:27,860 --> 01:03:31,050
Everyone. So this is the last slide I'm going to cover.

581
01:03:31,940 --> 01:03:37,190
And basically I want everyone to understand that there are so many things that contribute to what hunger is,

582
01:03:37,430 --> 01:03:45,320
and there are multiple things that can trigger satiety or other steps along the way to engage in either food seeking or food termination behaviors.

583
01:03:45,650 --> 01:03:52,400
And so anything in black means it causes this, and anything in red means it inhibits this.

584
01:03:52,910 --> 01:03:58,320
And so this is so some of his work is very new in in the past ten years.

585
01:03:58,940 --> 01:04:04,130
And so we're able to do this work and understand how mice process what they see and then associate with food.

586
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:11,120
But we can relate it to humans. In this example, where I am hungry, I need food.

587
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:18,560
I haven't eaten in probably 6 hours. I'm walking down a New York City street and this street is cluttered.

588
01:04:18,950 --> 01:04:24,500
There's tons of buildings, there's tons of people. The environment is what we would call noisy and distractible.

589
01:04:24,990 --> 01:04:31,070
There are so many things that are blurring the food cues that like, I'm just all over the place,

590
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:36,530
your brain is actually able to mute all of the things that don't matter in that moment.

591
01:04:36,650 --> 01:04:43,790
And so if hunger is the predominant feeling, there are certain areas of the brain that shut down you being able to associate what else is

592
01:04:43,790 --> 01:04:48,950
around you and enhance your attention span on specific food cues that are personal to you.

593
01:04:49,310 --> 01:04:53,540
And so for me, I know at the McDonald's sign is a lot of us know what the McDonald's sign is.

594
01:04:53,540 --> 01:04:56,180
If I'm on a New York City street and I'm walking and I'm hungry,

595
01:04:56,450 --> 01:05:00,350
the thing that I'm going to see and pay most rapid attention to is the McDonald's signs.

596
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:07,730
And then I can go and I can eat. And so this type of work is now being done to where we can say, okay, whether we are hungry or not.

597
01:05:07,730 --> 01:05:12,620
Our brain stops focusing on certain things and enhances the attention span on others

598
01:05:12,620 --> 01:05:17,690
in order to make sure that we either engage in homeostatic or phenomenon feeding.

599
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:24,780
Well, now, Dave, we'll talk about stress in the stress response, but we're.

600
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:47,810
All right. So I just want to elaborate on for one more hormone that Warren touched, like most times, but didn't go into too much.

601
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:51,590
And that is this idea of stress or a particular psychosocial stress.

602
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:54,190
And so stress can propagate in a lot of different ways.

603
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:58,969
They can be things like, for example, in the previous slide thread could be a surprise and hunger, right?

604
01:05:58,970 --> 01:06:04,340
So, you know, no matter how hungry are people are going to see a bear. You may decide not to have that hamburger.

605
01:06:06,170 --> 01:06:13,969
But one major contributor to, too, when we're talking about obesity is sort of chronic stress.

606
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:20,270
Right. So we have these dual public health crises in Western societies of high levels of chronic stress and obesity.

607
01:06:20,270 --> 01:06:23,180
And there's always this question of how are these things related to each other?

608
01:06:23,570 --> 01:06:26,870
So we've learned a lot last couple of years about how stress is propagated.

609
01:06:26,870 --> 01:06:33,110
The primary chronic stress hormone is called cortisol in humans and it has direct targets on it.

610
01:06:33,830 --> 01:06:40,979
So you can directly activate those pro feeding neurons in mice and using similar studies, the ones that Warren described,

611
01:06:40,980 --> 01:06:50,150
if you knock out the glucocorticoid receptor in inner arms, those mice no longer become hyper vigilant in response to various stressors or threats.

612
01:06:50,780 --> 01:06:57,430
It's also relevant to things like drugs. So pharmacologically many people who are on anti-inflammatories are on Google for granted

613
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:02,240
agonists which physiologically function identical cortisol that can cause weight gain.

614
01:07:02,270 --> 01:07:06,890
There is diseases like Cushing's disease where you have a cancer which produces cortisol.

615
01:07:06,950 --> 01:07:12,649
Those are also associated with obesity. And then more social things such as social stress, food insecurity.

616
01:07:12,650 --> 01:07:16,080
All of these are thought to potentially elevate cortisol.

617
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:20,059
We're going to talk about cortisol. A lot of cortisol, those voices, diurnal rhythm.

618
01:07:20,060 --> 01:07:25,969
It's the highest when you wake up in the morning, which might be why you are hungry in the morning and it as well as at night.

619
01:07:25,970 --> 01:07:27,950
And that varies, of course, between people.

620
01:07:27,950 --> 01:07:34,130
Some people don't have this high morning cortisol response and they tend to be people that issue eating breakfast.

621
01:07:35,270 --> 01:07:40,180
But one framing for why cortisol important is this question of weight stigma and what is wrong with it.

622
01:07:40,580 --> 01:07:47,360
So this is a model called the cobwebs model and really cobwebs and talk about assistance for stress and reporting on the obviously.

623
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:54,920
But there's this model for the self-reinforcing pathway where somebody experiences some sort of stress.

624
01:07:55,190 --> 01:08:00,260
Let's start with food insecurity and then there's all these stress responses and there's a whole variety of these.

625
01:08:00,410 --> 01:08:06,770
This could include activation of eating neurons, changes in our insulin sensitivity, changes in our behavior and executive function changes.

626
01:08:07,100 --> 01:08:12,770
All of those somehow might result in more weight gain. For example, just hyper vigilance could cause increased weight gain.

627
01:08:12,980 --> 01:08:18,830
That could then called stigmatization. Right. So then people treat you differently unfairly because of your body size and

628
01:08:18,830 --> 01:08:22,150
that then causes more stress and this can become this positive feedback loop.

629
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:27,260
So one model for why these two public health crises intersect could be this complex model

630
01:08:27,260 --> 01:08:31,760
where chronic stress mediated through weight stigma can exacerbate levels of obesity.

631
01:08:31,940 --> 01:08:38,750
And if this is true and it's debatable, it's not entirely clear what percent of obesity is related to this.

632
01:08:38,900 --> 01:08:44,540
But there's also suggests a potentially effective public health intervention where you could intervene at the level of stigma,

633
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:49,640
therefore breaking this potential cycle and you could replace the initial stress or potentially the

634
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:56,030
weight stigma with really any kind of stressor input and or any kind of discriminatory approach.

635
01:08:56,040 --> 01:09:00,019
You could look at stress as in terms of, say, instead of weight,

636
01:09:00,020 --> 01:09:04,190
it could be food insecurity and that stigma could be related to sex discrimination or racial discrimination.

637
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:08,090
And that cycle could look the same no matter what the the stigmatization thing.

638
01:09:08,090 --> 01:09:12,470
If it causes reinforcing of stress, it could cause exacerbation of obesity.

639
01:09:12,770 --> 01:09:21,889
And one thing we know for sure, even if we don't know the causes, is minoritized and impoverished groups tend to have much higher obesity rates.

640
01:09:21,890 --> 01:09:24,379
Right. So how much of this is due to stigmatization?

641
01:09:24,380 --> 01:09:31,090
And this sort of complex model is not clear, but it does suggest that thinking about this from a societal perspective can be useful.

642
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,460
Okay. It was very little of me.

643
01:09:34,610 --> 01:09:39,800
So I'm going to pass over to this newbie here and then we're going to do just this one more activity and we're going to end after this activity.

644
01:09:40,010 --> 01:09:43,170
Right. So what we are going to do a.

645
01:09:46,360 --> 01:09:54,590
She's. We're going to do a loop assignment on Intuitive City to start doing that.

646
01:09:54,700 --> 01:09:59,950
I want to know how many of you are familiar with the historical intuitive eating.

647
01:10:02,540 --> 01:10:07,460
Almost more than half of their annual share.

648
01:10:07,490 --> 01:10:14,080
What they think this means is eating. No.

649
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:21,920
Yeah. Essentially just listening to your body signals on like when to eat, what to eat and like kind of rejecting the,

650
01:10:23,370 --> 01:10:31,579
like, traditional diet type mentality or like really any kind of nutritional guidance.

651
01:10:31,580 --> 01:10:35,600
Just kind of focusing what like thinking what does my body want right now?

652
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:41,960
Like I'm going to go after that, I'm going to do that and only listening to that and rejecting any timeframes as well.

653
01:10:42,470 --> 01:10:46,760
Yes, exactly. Well, actually summed up pretty well.

654
01:10:47,420 --> 01:10:51,469
It's listening to your body, which you say normal signals that regulate,

655
01:10:51,470 --> 01:10:57,770
drive to eat, feelings of fullness and dieting can change these normal responses.

656
01:10:58,130 --> 01:11:01,310
There are many definitions of intuitive eating.

657
01:11:01,820 --> 01:11:08,360
There are some great ideas here, they said. Rejecting diet and eating only when you feel hungry.

658
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:17,810
Pay attention to when you feel full and choose the foods that make you feel good and respect your emotions and.

659
01:11:21,430 --> 01:11:31,930
Now what we are going to do that group assignment. You have to go on great craft first, create a group and submit it for approval to create craft.

660
01:11:32,530 --> 01:11:37,500
We have to approve your group request and then you can submit your assignment.

661
01:11:37,540 --> 01:11:41,769
So do it now and then start working on the assignment.

662
01:11:41,770 --> 01:11:44,230
In the meantime, we will try to approve all the groups.

663
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:53,320
You have to pick either an internal or external food related signal, and then as a group come up with a hypothesis.

664
01:11:53,860 --> 01:12:01,659
Following this line, I think that training in mindful eating or intuitive eating will alter whatever you say to the signal in

665
01:12:01,660 --> 01:12:07,360
the direction are that it will increase your intake or to be whatever direction you think it will go.

666
01:12:07,570 --> 01:12:14,649
And then design this study describing how you might test the hypothesis that this signal connects,

667
01:12:14,650 --> 01:12:19,090
saying during meeting to energy intake briefly within 4 to 5 sentences.

668
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:23,910
This is your general guideline how to submit,

669
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:34,210
but first grade a group and then you have to wait for our approval to somebody to decide how big is a group like what's the size of three?

670
01:12:34,690 --> 01:12:49,410
I think 3 to 5 35011.

671
01:12:51,220 --> 01:12:56,810
Oh, you do. You just really don't know.

672
01:12:56,980 --> 01:13:05,030
I guess I can really figure out what I need to go.

673
01:13:06,170 --> 01:13:13,120
So like I said, this is the last thing we're going to do today. So at the end of this, you can just in the past time out, so you can work on it here.

674
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:19,089
If you want to leave work on another side of this. Make sure you submit as soon as it's ready to do.

675
01:13:19,090 --> 01:13:32,260
Today, only one person submits the group right of like it's going to be eating a conservative estimate.

676
01:13:32,260 --> 01:13:39,730
It was submitted by one of these.

677
01:13:41,570 --> 01:13:46,990
So I think that's what I see my clients would have to be.

678
01:13:47,170 --> 01:13:51,470
So yeah, yeah.

679
01:13:51,610 --> 01:13:55,089
And then think about things like that.

680
01:13:55,090 --> 01:14:02,740
Now I'll say, you know, this is something you might want to say.

681
01:14:03,870 --> 01:14:14,310
Okay, guess I like to think about that.

682
01:14:20,730 --> 01:14:26,080
I always do. I'll do it. You know, I'm sticking with this.

683
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:36,129
Like if you are going to say you went to 45, I think your name is the type three.

684
01:14:36,130 --> 01:14:40,710
The middle name. Yeah, yes, yes, yeah, yeah.
