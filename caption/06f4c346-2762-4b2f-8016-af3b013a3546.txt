1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:07,260
Oh, yeah, that's great.

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:13,710
All right, everybody, happy Thursday. Hope you're all doing well.

3
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:23,250
So today, just to recap where we are, we're right in the midst of what I kept telling you earlier in the semester.

4
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:28,230
It's going to get a little technical. This is where we are, but the end is in sight.

5
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:35,630
Once we get past quiz two, you'll see. We'll zoom back out to more environmental and we'll do it.

6
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:42,450
Won't be quite as in-depth and technical at that point, but just a couple more weeks and we'll be there.

7
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:50,309
So again, as a reminder, I know problems that one took a long time from said to hopefully not as long but again,

8
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:59,850
try to do the questions you can after each lecture that match up that would make the workload a lot more efficient for you if you can.

9
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,820
And again, on the questions,

10
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:08,010
early questions that are interacting with the same methods where I ask you to kind of report out different aspects of the methods,

11
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:13,139
please be sure you don't need to write big. The big thing for each one.

12
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,530
It's just for me to get a sense that you're interacting with material,

13
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:26,940
understanding the different components of these methods and where to find things and, you know, a basic level of understanding.

14
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:30,360
So hopefully that'll help speed things up for you as well.

15
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:36,990
So last time we talked about directory against from these passive samplers, thermal sampling,

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,890
things like that and now we're going to move into a different approach for exposure assessment, which is biomarkers.

17
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:47,309
This is the first lecture about biomarkers.

18
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:59,010
I'll talk more about biomarkers in a couple of weeks more generally, but this one is kind of more focused on occupational applications of biomarkers.

19
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,810
Any questions or comments? Concerns about the schedule?

20
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:18,530
Okay. So biomarkers and bio monitoring occupational for patients.

21
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,970
So we're going to start today with definitions and history biomarkers and talk

22
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,710
a bit about body burden considerations for when you want to use biomarkers.

23
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:33,400
Then we're going to go into a little bit of depth on the biological exposure indices for basically age.

24
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:38,870
Again, focusing on occupational and with some advantages of this families.

25
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:41,870
And this will serve as a good baseline again for a couple of weeks from now.

26
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:46,550
And we'll talk a little bit more broadly about about biomarkers as well.

27
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:53,830
So you'll recognize this. This is our exposure to disease continuum that we've been talking about throughout the semester.

28
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:57,490
We have, you know, some sort of source pathway in or out.

29
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:01,390
We over there on the left hand side. And if.

30
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:12,350
It can lead to some sort of absorption or internal dose, and then that can transform into a potentially biologically effective dose,

31
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:17,900
really affect altered structure and then potentially ultimately disease.

32
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:23,300
So we want to understand as much as we can here to be able to prevent that disease.

33
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:27,379
So here we're talking currently in between here and here.

34
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:32,300
So we've spent a lot of time so far on that external exposure piece.

35
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:36,410
The last several weeks have been, you know, air sampling, things like that.

36
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:45,710
Now we're going to talk about know how might we monitor that internal dose and why recall this hopefully from Quiz one

37
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:55,010
and earlier lectures where we had that sort of general priority list of what was the best type of exposure measurement.

38
00:03:55,370 --> 00:04:03,380
And if you recall, biomarkers did appear at the top of that. But there's going to be some caveats to that, some mutations that we want to be aware of.

39
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:13,680
And kind of getting a grasp of where we are back to our basic exposure assessment strategies.

40
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:23,580
We've been moving around this quite a bit, but here today we're going to be talking over here within the direct methods for biological monitoring.

41
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:32,900
Okay. So a couple of definitions. First is defined as the evaluation of the internal exposure of the organism to chemical agent,

42
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:40,010
as determined by analysis of biological specimens collected from the in this case, worker at a specified time.

43
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:56,090
So this is actually the second lecture on biomarkers. Anybody here worked with biomarkers, blood samples, blood samples, any specific application?

44
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:00,950
Just like Sinclair's hospital. Okay, you know what else?

45
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:04,969
Are you surprised aren't blind spots for? It was green. Okay, that.

46
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:10,790
That works. Your blood glucose and emergency medicine.

47
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:14,090
Okay. Let me go back monitoring through here.

48
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:16,790
Oh, okay. So we got quite a bit of experience here.

49
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:28,610
Anybody been part of a biomarker study or had other surveillance by a monitoring group before it was a biomarker?

50
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:35,360
But it's okay if we participate in the COVID 19 tracking.

51
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:40,580
Yep. And that was my example this morning. Nobody raise their hand like anybody here got to come at a COVID test.

52
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:43,969
Everyone rings are here. Yeah. Yeah. Carpet fire monitoring effort.

53
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:48,200
So. So, obviously, that's not a chemical hazard as we define it here.

54
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:54,260
But, you know, it's useful to think about in the context of of biomarkers or more generally.

55
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:59,930
So with that, we have different types of biomarkers.

56
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:03,919
So a big focus here, of course, is going to be this type of biomarker exposure.

57
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:13,760
And exposure can cause metabolite or product of that interaction within the body, but it's going to represent exposure to that chemical of interest.

58
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:21,800
So that's a big focus here. We also have biomarkers, biomarker effect, which in this context it is very broadly defined,

59
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,600
measurable, biochemical, physiologic behavioral and other alteration in organism.

60
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,410
And then finally, biomarker of susceptibility,

61
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:38,360
indicator of inherent or acquired ability of an organism to respond to the challenge of exposure to a specific chemical.

62
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:44,149
These are basic types, and you can categorize biomarkers into different ones.

63
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:46,430
So those of you who've done work with biomarkers,

64
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:50,810
you might be thinking about what you've worked with in the past, which one of these it might fit under.

65
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:57,709
So, you know. Nicole probably here, glucose probably here.

66
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:04,150
Right. Whatever you guys were measuring could be anywhere, right?

67
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:11,290
So if we overlay these definitions with the disease continuum, it would look like this where we have,

68
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:14,540
you know, exposure on the left all the way to disease on the right.

69
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:18,890
Our biomarkers of exposure might encompass at different points along the way here,

70
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:29,270
could even be more of an external exposure to internal dose to biologically effective dose versus that biomarker effect will take over.

71
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:32,899
Once you get further down that that continuum, then you lose.

72
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:37,520
The susceptibility is potentially impacting every relationship along the way.

73
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:42,950
And that's important to know because that's one of the strengths and limitations of biomarkers.

74
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:48,710
Actually, when we talk about exposure is that individual nature of it.

75
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:52,970
And so biomarkers of exposure.

76
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:58,790
We'll talk about a lot of examples. Biomarker effect besides glucose,

77
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:07,340
what they measure and comatose depending on the type of test or some other examples of biomarkers affect people can think of.

78
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:19,250
They're screening tests for various things. In your blood, in the urine.

79
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,300
Yeah, that would be a very kind of a blunt instrument for sure.

80
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:28,730
Some sort of effect. You might not know what it is, but it's a cause for investigation, right?

81
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:33,860
You know, for, like, prostate cancer screening, they have certain chemicals they measure.

82
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:43,610
Uh, in my research, we do a lot with things like circulating hormone levels, so that's not necessarily bad, right?

83
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,809
We're kind of upstream a little bit. Um, cytokines.

84
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:55,700
Other markers of inflammation. Pregnancy test? Yeah, that would be definitely along the lines of a biomarker effect.

85
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:02,270
Uh, oxidative stress markers. DNA damage is an interesting one, because that might be.

86
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:10,380
Right. Somewhere in the middle. Especially if you can go upstream. So like pages we talked about a lot here.

87
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:14,820
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, they actually form a protein addition product.

88
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:21,420
You can measure DNA, ADCs. That could get you more of a biologically effective dose.

89
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,030
That's further along with Continuum.

90
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:31,650
That might be more correlated with, say, cancer that you're interested in looking at and measuring page an area or wherever you might be looking.

91
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,150
So biomarkers of fact.

92
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:44,820
What about biomarkers of susceptibility? Do you think the examples of white blood cell count?

93
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:49,860
Yeah, yeah. That's going to impact how your body might respond.

94
00:09:50,850 --> 00:10:00,460
What you. Shifting into screening for possible DNA fragmentation.

95
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,579
So genotype is a big one that we used to look at.

96
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:12,550
You know, are some people more likely to in the example you measure their age, you can measure urinary metabolites,

97
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:22,270
a DNA addict and does that genotype change that relationship between those and of course, the relationship with the health outcome as well?

98
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:26,980
You get more detail like enzyme function, gene expression,

99
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:36,640
all kinds of things that could relate to the way the chemicals metabolized or how the body is working in response to it.

100
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,310
So a lot can be done with biomarkers within this within this continuum.

101
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:49,480
And some biomarkers I still don't know how to define sometimes depends on contexts like Epigenomics.

102
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,890
Some people in some contexts will say that's kind of more of an exposure.

103
00:10:54,700 --> 00:11:00,430
Some will say it's more of an outcome variable, and some might say it's a measure of susceptibility.

104
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,790
HIV aids could be affect and susceptibility. Right?

105
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:10,030
Right. So it's it's a matter of perspective sometimes when we're looking at where things fall here in this world.

106
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:19,840
All right. This one, I have mixed feelings. I put this together a couple of years ago, and I still don't know if I felt like it.

107
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:27,970
So I might tinker with it at some point. But this is what I was viewing, as, you know, a very rudimentary history of biomarkers.

108
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:35,850
And I was able to do that back to like the 1400s was something called the erotic copy where they have the the

109
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:40,930
physician people would come bring their urine sample to the physician and they would kind of look at it,

110
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:48,820
smell it, taste it even, and can diagnose things like diabetes, which is what I'm told, the sweet taste to it.

111
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,770
So that's, you know, a very primitive form of of biomarker of effect,

112
00:11:55,180 --> 00:12:02,649
if we define it broadly of something happening in a biological system that's related to an exposure of

113
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:09,549
concern you can get to the canary in the coal mine would be one example that's an external biomarker.

114
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:17,920
But using eco toxicology as a measure of of exposure, then of course you have a silent spring talking about wildlife.

115
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:23,740
And DDT, for example, really sounded the alarm on the impacts that that could have.

116
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:34,360
And then getting more to human exposure biomarkers led lit blood or blood lead has been around since the early 1900s, late 1800s.

117
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:39,309
So it's been around for a long time, but it's really gotten more sophisticated.

118
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:40,900
That's in the last couple of decades.

119
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:52,090
And here's the facility showing a lot of mercury vapor from mercury, a similar element that early on was able to be measured to more recently,

120
00:12:52,480 --> 00:13:00,610
you know, thinking beyond exposure, we have always multi-omics approaches to various things.

121
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,950
There's a hierarchy of what can be done. So there's a lot of omics here.

122
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:13,359
So we have genomics which we've talked about epigenomics, metabolomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, there's some little ones here.

123
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,630
Lipid omics secrete omics.

124
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:24,040
So there's a lot of okay, so these are basically platforms that give you a broad range of measurements within that,

125
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:31,300
with that within that universe of gene, gene expression, transcription, metabolites, whatever it might be.

126
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:38,079
So that's feeding into where we currently are in environmental health sciences with exposure biomarkers.

127
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:46,810
It's the concept of the zone which I'm sure you've been thinking about, which is, you know, the totality of exposure throughout the life course.

128
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:52,330
Very difficult concept to really wrap your head around logistically,

129
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:57,280
but biomarkers do play a big role in that when you start combining some of these

130
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,909
approaches targeted versus some targeted approaches and things like that,

131
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:04,180
which we'll come back to next time I talk about.

132
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:10,090
Biomarkers. So that's this is a work in progress.

133
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:16,980
Being a topic for a book someday. All my spare time.

134
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:27,720
Okay. Here's a figure of a workplace where a chemical xylene was measured in the workplace here.

135
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:31,469
That's our x axis and biomarker.

136
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:38,160
Precisely. AMH A and urine methyl acid is on the y axis.

137
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:43,080
So if this was a perfect biomarker, precisely what would this.

138
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:49,610
Looks like. It was like this.

139
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:54,550
Yeah. Good. Good agreement. You have a really high R squared near one.

140
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:59,320
And all these dots would kind of fall in line. Right? Why?

141
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:05,950
Why do we think this isn't like that? I mean, it's it's decent, I guess probably better than random chance.

142
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:15,190
But if this is thought to be a biomarker, what reasons could it be that you're not getting good agreement here or and time sensitive.

143
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:19,750
Could be sensitivity issue. There's a lot of right answers here.

144
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:27,460
Which is biochemical differences in people's physiology, the way people metabolize and process the chemical.

145
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:33,550
So, of course, participants like it here create more air with more and be different.

146
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:41,560
Absolutely. Absolutely. If you're exposed to really rough stuff in here, that's another big one, certainly.

147
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:45,399
So keep thinking about this figure. We'll come back to at the very end.

148
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:49,300
We'll see if we have. These are all great answers. We'll see if we have even more at that time.

149
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:57,130
So a rationale for biological monitoring.

150
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:03,720
It reflects the input from all around so it's that absorbed dose not always that the observed dose but it's accounting for all the various routes.

151
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:06,760
So we've talked about field sampling.

152
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:13,310
So if you have something that's a multi-year multi pathway and you have to go out and sample every single pathway around,

153
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:16,930
that can get complicated and hard to interpret.

154
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:23,200
So this is one way to get at that with more of a single measurement is to use biological monitoring.

155
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:30,520
So as was just mentioned in the last slide, a different route, exponentially of information, but it can also account for dermal ingestion,

156
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:37,030
which as we talk about in the workplace might be important and overlooked because of all of our

157
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:43,480
guidelines and standards are based on air concentrations and the exposures outside of work as well.

158
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:48,020
Individual differences was also mentioned for the last slide.

159
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:57,720
But that can again make a big difference on how much of an external exposure becomes an internal dose.

160
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:05,960
Can relate to a lot of these things. Work habits was mentioned, but a lot of these issues along that continuum.

161
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:13,280
As we talked about, you know, there's not a ton of examples of biologically effective dose,

162
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:20,269
but in theory, you could devise more markers to get there toward that that disease endpoint,

163
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:28,250
which in epidemiology would be great to have and that would also be great as a screening tool for other applications as well.

164
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,800
Here's a long list of other ways you might use by March one.

165
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,250
I can read all these, but general screening and scoping.

166
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:45,440
We'll talk about those next time in a bit more detail, as well as new trends.

167
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:48,620
Population wide, general population. These can be extremely.

168
00:17:49,660 --> 00:18:02,460
The useful things to use biomarkers for epidemiology coupled with toxicology, very, very useful pharmacokinetic modeling and then risk assessment.

169
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,880
It could have. Modifications within risk assessment.

170
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:11,880
If we think back to earlier in the semester, exposure assessment was one of the four main components of risk assessment.

171
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:16,890
And so biomarkers can play a key role.

172
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,590
So a lot of times you'll hear the term body burden.

173
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:33,620
People talk about biomarkers by monitoring, and that's basically just the mount for mass of a chemical that's present in the body at a given time.

174
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:44,150
And so those of you taking toxicology, this is probably review or hopefully at least complimentary to some of the concepts you've been learning.

175
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:53,270
But the chemical will make its way to different compartments in the body and will depend on a range of different things.

176
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:57,709
So one big one is, of course, time we talk about variability and exposure.

177
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:03,020
Over time that's going to impact what happens in the body.

178
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:05,030
That magnitude, frequency and duration,

179
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:13,910
the underpinnings of of exposure are going to play a big role in where the chemical ends up of chemical solubility.

180
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:24,620
Is it more water soluble versus lipid soluble reactivity, things that are able to react and get changed into a different chemical?

181
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:30,710
A lot of times that happens for the better or they become more hydrophilic and they can be excreted more,

182
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:35,190
more readily than non-reactive chemicals may be.

183
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:39,890
Sit there for a while and then we'll talk more about metabolism as well.

184
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:47,600
So it's hard to if you don't know anything about an exposure except the name of the chemical,

185
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:52,210
you try to go out and collect a blood sample and measure that chemical. That's not super useful.

186
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:58,040
You really need to know what it represents and whether you're measuring the right the right thing.

187
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:02,540
So the tax code kinetics that call it is extremely important to them.

188
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:07,680
So you want to know the determinant? What are you trying to measure?

189
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:14,670
Sometimes it's the apparent chemical. Sometimes it's a known metabolite or reaction product.

190
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:22,110
What kind of specimen do you want to measure? In occupational settings, we tend to focus on urine, blood and exhaled breath.

191
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:29,820
But if you look at biomarkers as a whole, there's a much larger range of types of samples you can use.

192
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:36,180
The timing of the sampling, you want to do it while the exposure is happening afterward, etc.

193
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:41,430
And then finally, what's it telling you for as far as.

194
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:46,570
Exposure and that's going to depend on some of the properties of that.

195
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:55,600
I've got to turn the. Here is a picture of the human body.

196
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:06,240
It's just like that, right? This is getting out talking about the red circles represent a relative exposure

197
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,070
and where they can really in typically and then making it to the bloodstream.

198
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:22,110
You have these two way arrows going to each of these organs that can lead to getting it to where it needs to go to be processed,

199
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:25,560
you know, metabolize, excreted, etc. I'm oversimplifying.

200
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:27,360
But then you have, you know,

201
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:36,750
the blue circles are things we might focus on in occupational settings to measure as a representation of what the exposure was.

202
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:43,270
But again, he need to know how does it get from here, here, here to there in order to know what it's telling?

203
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,550
Here's a different way of looking at it. So we have our roots exposure up here.

204
00:21:56,030 --> 00:22:02,479
And this also is kind of a visual that always reminds me that our exposure is important for a lot of things like how metabolism

205
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:12,760
works and potentially toxicity because it might be bypassing important reservoirs of enzymes or whatever it might be or you know,

206
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:18,410
when it passes, the liver might change between whether it's inhaled, ingested or absorbed through the skin.

207
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:26,250
You're different types of media you could be using for your biomarkers here at the bottom.

208
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:32,780
And I always like to point out this one. I got to do a study on tears, just kind of scanning.

209
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:38,800
Very sad. I think he'd be the best IRP to the Human Subjects Committee.

210
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,819
People just put some onions. Yeah, yeah.

211
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:48,850
There you go. Oh, I work for Sample Hall, so.

212
00:22:50,170 --> 00:23:03,040
Again, this is simplifying how things work, but give you a sense of the complexity of how that chemical could be distributed, stored, excreted.

213
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:07,840
So in talks called kinetics, this is referred to as ADMA.

214
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:13,330
These aren't the TikTok videos my kids watch, but the crunchy sounds.

215
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:17,350
That's what's nice. Yes. Yes, that's number one.

216
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:24,550
This is ADI. It uses absorption, distribution and metabolism and elimination of a chemical.

217
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:31,630
So that's the study of toxicant kinetics, very similar to pharmacokinetics.

218
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:39,580
It's just the application is different. Pharmacokinetics are usually focused on drugs, how a drug is delivered to have the effects that you want.

219
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:44,230
It talks, cooking acts. It's more about maybe an unwanted exposure.

220
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:53,450
Where is it ending up and how is it being excreted? And as I mentioned, the occupational settings are three main types of media.

221
00:23:53,450 --> 00:24:00,610
We use our blood where we assume typically before everyone tissues and organs, urine.

222
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:06,859
So we measure that with an elimination rate and then exhaled breath again,

223
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:11,480
assuming equilibrium with blood levels and assuming that you're getting the alveolar.

224
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:17,480
So that plays into how you have to collect the sample to account for the dead space as well.

225
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:31,860
So those of you in tux. Tux classic talk about this, right?

226
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:36,690
You know. So once really happened. Just as a quick reminder, the.

227
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:49,390
So you can model how this goes for a specific chemical based on various properties, uptake, distribution, metabolism and elimination.

228
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:55,210
And you can divide it into different compartments. They have simpler models where you might have a single compartment assumption,

229
00:24:55,750 --> 00:25:00,760
or you can do complex models where you have multiple compartments and try to try to go from there.

230
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:12,340
And that's based on different organ groups or systems based on perfusion level of semen, blood flow in metabolic activity at that site.

231
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:19,000
And the properties of the chemical relate to solubility, which would give you a partition coefficient.

232
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:28,510
So here's an example of some of these groups. Yep. And again, it's pointing out the important aspects to metabolism distribution here.

233
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:36,850
So one group has high perfusion, low metabolic activity, blood rich group, high perfusion, no metabolic activity.

234
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:41,230
And then vessel rich vessel, poor muscle group and fat group.

235
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:47,559
So they kind of have different levels of perfusion or blood flow and different levels of metabolic activity.

236
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:51,370
And that's going to dictate how chemicals move in and out of there.

237
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:57,580
And this is what it might look like for this is tetrahedral ethylene.

238
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:06,280
So we have your exposure time and you see the richly perfused,

239
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:12,520
the ones with areas with higher blood flow are going to increase the level more rapidly because it's getting there more quickly.

240
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,450
But they should also be able to clear it more rapidly as well.

241
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:23,290
But that's going to depend on some chemical specific properties, whereas that that rich group,

242
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:28,000
you know, it stays there because there's no metabolism going on. There's little to no blood flow.

243
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:33,160
So if it's a lipophilic chemical and it makes it, there is not too much.

244
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:40,270
But you have the vessel rich group by contrast is moving that out as is the long.

245
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:50,970
So it paints a bit of a complicated picture and you can try to model this with different approaches.

246
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:57,640
So the most basic approach is called the one compartment model, and that's showing this is on the walk scale.

247
00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:04,460
So it's it's there. Simple elimination kinetics.

248
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,120
But here this first line is your single compartment model.

249
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:12,530
That's usually not going to be the most accurate way to think about it.

250
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:19,880
Much more common way is the two compartment model, which gives you two phases of the value of the nation.

251
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:25,459
So you see that bend here in the curve. Then you have a different approach, which is the metabolic model,

252
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:31,700
which also accounts for additional metabolism or metabolites being formed after the exposure.

253
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:35,210
So you get this bit of a lag period before the decline.

254
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:44,010
Did you guys do this in talks about do you have to model anything or just, you know, pharmacology?

255
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:48,360
Oh, so they do that? Yeah. Okay. Because, yeah, they really want to know where the where it ends up.

256
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:52,960
Yeah. That's the therapeutic benefit of what they're working with.

257
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,500
So another important concept here is biological half life.

258
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:07,810
So this refers to the persistence of the chemical in the body.

259
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:12,909
So the figure you call from the few slides go the amount of toxicant in the body that is

260
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:19,090
the body burning and that's usually in a unit of mass or a unit of mass body weight.

261
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:29,200
And it's a function of time. So, you know, it's not going to be the same all the time because of these metabolic processes that are going on.

262
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:34,830
So again, we've kind of focused a lot on inhalation here.

263
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:40,270
But in this example, given a dose of inhaled toxic, it received and exposures ceased.

264
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:49,420
The body will continue to eliminate that from circulation and you won't have a first or elimination kinetic pattern like this.

265
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:55,540
So this is the equation describing that first order of elimination.

266
00:28:56,530 --> 00:29:02,200
And those of you in industrial hygiene who want to take up the age exam some day, this equation refers.

267
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:06,090
You know, it's useful for radiation as well. Anything where you talk about half lives.

268
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:12,550
So it's a good one to get to know. So here we have our.

269
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:18,780
Material chemical matures x two years time.

270
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:28,860
So the amount of people that you get in time is the amount of the initial chemical x nine times the exposure of negative alpha.

271
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:34,350
So that's half our elimination rate constant times time.

272
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,180
So it's a it's a pretty simple equation but can be very useful.

273
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:44,730
We'll also see it next week when we talk about air power modeling.

274
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:54,240
Okay. So a couple of basic examples might be good to know for common sense or quizzes.

275
00:29:55,290 --> 00:30:02,670
So we have one assuming it's not 100 milligrams. Alpha or rate constant has a value of 0.1 per hour.

276
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:08,640
Determine the body burn after 6 hours. We enter this into the equation.

277
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:14,430
If we wanted to know the amount of chemical x that 6 hours is equal to the original

278
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:20,850
100 milligrams exponential function of negative point one per hour times 6 hours,

279
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:24,390
you should get 54.9 hours.

280
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:32,080
All right. That's pretty straightforward. Those are the fun kind of calculations to do, right?

281
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:43,750
So we can do a little bit differently. So here's an example to assume that the elimination of the 100 milligrams falls relationship ratio before,

282
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:51,610
at what time will one half the chemical be eliminated? So here we're trying to calculate the half way from that previous equation.

283
00:30:53,410 --> 00:31:04,630
So instead of solving for X at time T, we're solving for X of time one half, basically solving for the time in which there's one half of that left.

284
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:16,900
On the previous slide was answer 54. So just glancing at this, using our intuition, we're going to think it's more or less than 6 hours.

285
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:23,300
More. Probably a bit more, but maybe not too much more, right? So that's a good start.

286
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:28,070
Just even going in that we have kind of a mental estimate of where we might be.

287
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:32,170
So 50 equals 100. And here's our point one again.

288
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:36,520
And then we just have our unknown variable there or halfway.

289
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:42,650
We divide both sides by 125 equals that.

290
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:52,460
Then we take the natural log of both sides and then we rearrange the equation to get natural log 2.5 divided by our Alpha point one,

291
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:59,100
and then we get 6.9 hours. These are half life. So.

292
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:03,680
Any questions on that? Pretty straightforward.

293
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:12,620
But again, these types of equations are applied in a lot of different ways in our field, so it's always fun to see those.

294
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:26,720
You can go shorthand a little bit if you wanted. So if you're solving for half life, that can be simplified to natural log of two over alpha.

295
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:34,010
And again, as with all equations in this class, we kind of think about different manipulations, what's going to happen.

296
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:43,100
So if you have a smaller alpha, that's going to mean increased half life, right?

297
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:49,940
If you have a larger alpha, it's going to be a smaller half life. So that alpha is again that read constant.

298
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:59,820
So a higher number means it's eliminated more quickly. So this is just reiterating that fact.

299
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:10,950
So it calls upon Catholics. You have if you measure something in blood, for example, as long half life,

300
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:16,150
that's going to indicate much more long term exposure compared to something measured in the blood with a short half life.

301
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:20,050
It's going to represent more recent exposure, right? That's pretty intuitive.

302
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:25,480
So do we have examples of chemicals you guys know about that have, let's say, a long half life?

303
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:30,149
Yes. Familiar with it? Yeah. Dioxins. Dioxins?

304
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:35,400
Yeah. Cadmium? Yeah. Uranium, probably.

305
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:40,120
Yeah. I'm not as familiar with that one, but that's.

306
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:44,550
That's what I meant for billions of years. Yeah, the decay, for sure.

307
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:49,720
Okay. Yeah, those are good. So persistent. Getting to an element.

308
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:53,570
What about short half flows? Many examples there.

309
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:09,810
Balance. Yep. That leads a lot of the stuff you hear about, you know, personal care products and things like that.

310
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:15,130
Consumer products. Pesticides are interesting.

311
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:22,390
Of course, back in the 1950s when they really gained in popularity, a lot of those were very long housewives like DDT.

312
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:27,940
Nowadays, they're supposed to have very short effects. That doesn't mean necessarily they're less toxic.

313
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:33,810
It just means I'm not going to hang around as long. So here are some really old tables I'll show you.

314
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:41,550
So this one is showing some toxins with very slow elimination in those very long half lives.

315
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:48,330
So we have fibrous dust in the lung, unfortunately, mercury levels.

316
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:53,010
And this is per thousand hours. So it's 43000 hours, I guess, in bone.

317
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:58,500
And then cadmium just blows more out of the water. So good job there.

318
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:02,670
So you have 410000 hours.

319
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:09,640
It's going to be a lot of years. So this tells us a couple of things also.

320
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:17,440
The as far as storage. So we've been talking about elimination, but you also have storage.

321
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,740
So bone is where blood likes to be stored.

322
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:30,930
Cadmium tends to be stored in the liquid. How about some a short half flights?

323
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:35,100
So this is a lot of organic solvents.

324
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:42,840
Most of them have very commonly encountered in occupational settings, but most of them do have short half lives.

325
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:46,140
There are a couple of exceptions in this slide.

326
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:52,530
One being nitrous, benzene and tetra couleur ethylene, which we talked about in a previous slide, you know,

327
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:59,850
not huge 86 hours in 70 hours versus sort of single digit hours for a lot of the other ones and even minutes for others.

328
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:07,130
So that's, you know, huge range depending on all the different chemicals we talk about,

329
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:13,610
all the companies that can be encountered, you to have just extreme ranges and you know how persistent they are.

330
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:21,780
And this is biological. So they'll all have their own environmental persistence as well.

331
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:29,690
That might differ from biologically. One example I think of is trichloroethylene.

332
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:36,050
TCE can be very persistent in the environment but doesn't tend to be as persistent in the body.

333
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:49,040
All right. So we all go to work for 8 hours every weekday and come home.

334
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:53,779
We all have a perfectly symmetrical exposure profile working every day.

335
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:59,300
Right. And we've come all the way with zero exposure for 3.5 days and then we're done.

336
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:05,210
Well, that's oversimplified, but it's just to illustrate what happens when you have different half lives.

337
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:10,820
So assume this is your external exposure profile over a work week.

338
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:14,810
If you have a very short lived chemical less than 3 hours half life,

339
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:24,500
you get something like this sawtooth shape curve over time where you have this rapid and gradual increase throughout the day

340
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:31,820
and then a rapid decline after the exposure ceases and it gets back basically the background between between days or shifts.

341
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:38,410
Once you get a half life of about 6 hours, it's not going to fully clear between days.

342
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:47,930
So you start to get this escalation in that saw to get above 100 hour half life and you don't get much decline at all.

343
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:51,770
It's just going to keep escalating. So you're going to get a buildup.

344
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:57,530
So that's that can be a dangerous situation for something that's persistent.

345
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:06,620
Here's another, more complex illustration of the same thing.

346
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:11,850
So the top, when you have a constant exposure, doesn't vary at all.

347
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:18,710
And I'm guessing the Y axis are different for the two. But can you see how the five hour half life builds up faster?

348
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:25,730
50. Here's what we just showed them. A more uniform daily exposure.

349
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:32,690
They come in for lunch break, it looks like, in this photo. You see how 50 hours differs from five?

350
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:37,399
And then this is probably a more reasonable assumption where you have variable exposure

351
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:42,580
profile each day at work and then it's going to be it's not quite as perfect as.

352
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:55,080
Biomarker profiles. Yeah. So in the bottom one is that just hair or the flower goes but 50 are I think it's different x axis.

353
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:58,680
I should have put the footnotes in here.

354
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,640
Y axis should be higher.

355
00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:09,070
Yeah. Good question. So I think it's just comparing the shapes, not necessarily the.

356
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:15,460
At this point. Okay.

357
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:21,340
So that's half life. Any question we're going to play? Okay. It's fairly straightforward, but again, super important.

358
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:26,489
We talk about this stuff? Yeah. I mean, they're just playing.

359
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:32,220
You're just playing the slogan The Nation's by 80 divided by 2001 and that Super Bowl table.

360
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:35,820
Yeah, I don't know. Maybe because they're scared of big numbers.

361
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:44,580
I don't know why they did that, just to make it kind of like if you look at like a budget table where they say in millions,

362
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:48,780
you know, probably the same guy who's trying to make it look simpler.

363
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:54,460
I don't know. They could have said days, I suppose. So some decision was made.

364
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:58,860
I don't know if it's customary in pharmacology. You guys are taking that class?

365
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:08,050
Yeah. So? I don't know. It's some decision somebody made. It looks like this was probably fairly old to you, so.

366
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:12,640
Probably used a typewriter and can do scientific notation.

367
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:19,250
Good question, though. Any other questions on that flight?

368
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:29,010
Let's talk about sampling a little bit. So we want to know what the body burn is of a specific chemical.

369
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:36,690
Again, hopefully we know what the chemical is and how it's distributed, stored and excreted throughout the body.

370
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:41,970
And that'll help us decide what kind of matrix we want to collect our sample type.

371
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:47,370
We need to measure it. Again, the three most common occupational are blood and exhaled breath.

372
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:51,330
So there's a lot that goes into this.

373
00:40:51,630 --> 00:41:01,190
You have to be very careful to stick to protocols and there are some nuances with regards to contamination concerns, things like that that.

374
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:05,610
I can't remember if I have it in this one or the next one.

375
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:10,140
But the fact that when you collect this and sometimes for exhaled breath,

376
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:15,870
you have a direct reading monitor, think blood alcohol level the breathalyzer.

377
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,110
But for a lot of these, you'll send it to a lab, get the results sent back to you.

378
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:26,170
They'll use for metals or element's atomic absorption.

379
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:35,759
This is common for if you're just doing one or a couple metals like PMS is is good for a broad range of chemical of metals and then for organics,

380
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:42,660
a lot of times we're talking, you know, GMOs are helping us to get at the specific chemical or whatever you're interested in.

381
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:51,720
So a lot of criteria to think about when picking a biomarker.

382
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:57,360
Invasiveness This can make a big difference. My context is a little different,

383
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:04,230
so I use this for epidemiology a lot and it's definitely something we think about because a lot of people obviously don't like needles,

384
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:10,320
so that can really limit what you're able to do if you're if you're forced to do a blood sample.

385
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:14,430
So invasiveness utility,

386
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:20,090
how how useful is it if you don't know what that number means when you get it back from a lab

387
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:25,120
that it's not that much utility and you may have to put people at the needle for a reason.

388
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:30,630
That specificity is a big one, especially if you're talking about metabolites.

389
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:37,410
There are some metabolites that are have the same parent compound. So two different chemicals might metabolize the same thing.

390
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:44,350
And if you don't know that, you might be concluding an overestimate of the exposure if you're not accounting for the other parent company.

391
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:49,410
Sensitivity is a big one, just like we talked about with piercing point.

392
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:54,870
You know, you don't want to go to all this trouble to collect the sample sent to lab, get back a bunch of blank numbers.

393
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:59,190
That's always a bummer. Of course, you want to try to make sure your sensitivity matches your.

394
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:07,840
Your needs and I quote little method precision limited detection of important.

395
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:16,820
And you can match it with your needs. If you don't need something that's super precise, you might be able to get it for a lower cost.

396
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:21,140
But the more precise, the more sensitive. Typically, the price does go up.

397
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:28,130
Sample volume, something that requires, you know, a liter of blood probably is not a good message.

398
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:36,980
You might want to seek alternatives for that. I do studies being ahead of myself, not occupational children all the time.

399
00:43:37,010 --> 00:43:44,470
Sample one becomes an issue there as well. Stability, storage, all those things you got to think about.

400
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:49,480
Is it sensitive to sunlight, if distorted at -80 degrees?

401
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:55,000
You have to snap, freeze in liquid nitrogen, all things that you need to know before.

402
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:03,470
Then once you get the data, how do you interpret it?

403
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:10,340
We've talked about Antarctica. Kinetic models can help to know what you're looking at.

404
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:15,590
How do you how do they know what's the metabolite of a chemical in the first place?

405
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:18,890
Somebody at some point must have done a lab study. Right.

406
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:27,230
So, you know, if it's a that to be more of a nontoxic chemical, you can probably go that far enough back in the literature where they did humans,

407
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:34,850
you know, dosing humans with a chemical have them excrete and then see what they can measure that's elevated after that dosing.

408
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:41,660
More recently, your price point that's done in rodents and hopefully they know the difference in that metabolic

409
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:49,040
pathway that kind of exists between species to do that and then through field studies,

410
00:44:49,490 --> 00:44:52,729
it's very helpful to know what other people have tried before. What worked?

411
00:44:52,730 --> 00:44:56,120
What didn't work. To know what you're doing.

412
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:06,640
Okay. So usually we use a combination of those above to know the most relevant sample type, what our results mean,

413
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:15,810
and sources of variability that might impact what we conclude some more sources of variability.

414
00:45:15,930 --> 00:45:21,130
And again, this is where biomarkers are great in one way because they're very individualistic,

415
00:45:21,430 --> 00:45:24,670
but they can be challenging at the same time because of that same reason.

416
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:36,040
So, you know, physical stress or increased exercise can obviously impact the way it's taken up by the body and the metabolic rate as well.

417
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:44,780
Excretion rate can increase. So that's going to be helpful to diet.

418
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:49,920
So things that are lipophilic. That could impact that.

419
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:58,550
Health status, you know, your relevant organs, you know, liver is extremely important for metabolism.

420
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:03,739
If there's a change in that liver function, it's going to change the ability to metabolize kidneys.

421
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:07,160
Super important for excretion of urine. Of course.

422
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:10,160
Long. So smoking, obviously.

423
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:15,569
And unfortunately. And these are just a partial list.

424
00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:20,430
If there's there's probably a lot more. Okay.

425
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:26,820
So with that, let's talk a little bit about the HGH, the eyes.

426
00:46:27,270 --> 00:46:35,670
So we talked a lot about that, these two guys before, right where they have their levels for a large number of chemicals.

427
00:46:36,090 --> 00:46:43,770
They're not legally enforceable, but they're much more health based and more recent than OSHA levels.

428
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:48,330
So in addition to tell me, they have also beaches.

429
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:54,390
So back in 1984, when they first came out with to be a concept, they only had six chemicals.

430
00:46:54,900 --> 00:47:01,110
Now they're up to more than 50. So they're really they're really making progress.

431
00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:09,360
If you recall, OSHA looks pretty much the same as did 13 for HGH is really just getting things done.

432
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:19,980
Okay. So as with the TLB generally indicates concentration below which nearly all workers would likely not experience an adverse health benefit.

433
00:47:20,850 --> 00:47:24,850
So there's a great range of reasons why you might go to B, obviously, you don't have to.

434
00:47:24,870 --> 00:47:30,980
It's not legally enforceable at all. And anything that has a B is also going to have a TLB.

435
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:36,930
So the reasons you might also look to a API is, as we talked about before,

436
00:47:37,410 --> 00:47:44,400
if dermal uptake is of concern or ingestion, maybe inadvertent ingestion or things like that.

437
00:47:45,810 --> 00:47:51,720
Getting to know with that body, perhaps that internal dose reconstruction of exposure.

438
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:56,100
So getting to know what what happened in the past either because it's a.

439
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:05,810
Persistent long half life chemical or because it's representative of a previous task, an occupational exposure.

440
00:48:06,530 --> 00:48:12,600
This is a big one. So if people are wearing PPE, you don't know what they're exposed to.

441
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:15,139
You assume that the protection factor, for example,

442
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:25,190
on their respirator is protecting them about that factor for a way to potentially validate that is by also using a biomarker and practices as well.

443
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:34,540
Another way to monitor that. So I have you on the problems to look at one of these.

444
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:40,350
So as with the TLB, they have documentation for TLB. They also have documentation for every BVI.

445
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:48,580
We'll talk about the criteria and the justification for having a biological expert index,

446
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:54,850
the methodology employed, what confounding factors have to be aware of and then.

447
00:48:55,360 --> 00:49:03,850
Those protocol details that are so important and the limitations on the methodology and its interpretation.

448
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:13,160
All right. So how did the beginnings, the biological exposure indices relate to the threshold limit values?

449
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:16,130
So they're based on a correlation.

450
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:24,110
So if your exposure is through air and the top is listed as an airborne exposure to be is thought to forward that level of exposure.

451
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:28,670
So if you have an air measure that's below the top,

452
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:37,339
but your B is above the level to be published for your biomarker levels above B, that means something else is going on.

453
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:43,400
Right? Some of those factors that we've been talking about are impacting and you might need to do some additional.

454
00:49:47,350 --> 00:49:55,930
Some caveats. Lead and carbon monoxide might be more health based to be vice, but other than that, the EPA is based on the title.

455
00:49:56,560 --> 00:50:01,700
So the TV is based on a health fact, but the movie is based on the TV, not the original script.

456
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:06,800
That makes sense. So indirectly it is the.

457
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:14,070
And then, as I mentioned, there's confounding factors that can confuse what you're seeing.

458
00:50:15,590 --> 00:50:22,840
So. With that, some cold variables or confounders that have to be paid attention to carefully.

459
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:26,320
One is the time. So how long was exposure?

460
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:31,419
When was the sample collected in relation to that exposure?

461
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:41,290
Variability, both intra and within and between individual variability and exposure can make a difference in what you're seeing.

462
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:48,070
Other chemicals that might be there, certain instances where if you're exposed to one chemical,

463
00:50:48,130 --> 00:50:53,680
it downregulate an enzyme that's responsible for metabolism, another chemical.

464
00:50:54,610 --> 00:51:02,790
So that's where you get some interactions potentially happening. And we're talking about shared metabolites for multiple parent companies.

465
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:06,420
And we just talked about different personal factors.

466
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:15,190
And, you know, as with any sampling, the more samples should be better to try to get that variability.

467
00:51:15,330 --> 00:51:19,320
But obviously, there's limitations and feasibility cost.

468
00:51:20,910 --> 00:51:25,230
So if you were to go and look at the beaches, I'll show a couple examples here in a minute.

469
00:51:25,590 --> 00:51:31,980
As with the TV's, there's a whole bunch of different notations that they might include for a specific chemical.

470
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:37,020
And here's the definitions here. There's a B that represents high background.

471
00:51:37,110 --> 00:51:42,150
So, you know, if you use that chemical, you just know that there's high background levels that you need to be aware of,

472
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:46,830
you know, from an occupational exposure or just the workplace itself.

473
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:55,139
And Q means not quantified. It means that there is a there is something you can measure as a biomarker.

474
00:51:55,140 --> 00:52:01,500
They just don't have a set level. They don't know what that the relevant number is that would correlate with the job.

475
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:07,370
So just one. So you can use it and maybe compare it with literature to see try and see where you're at.

476
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:09,930
But they don't publish a specific number for that.

477
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:19,940
And is that situation where you have a metabolite that could be representative of multiple apparent compounds or exposure to the metabolite itself?

478
00:52:19,950 --> 00:52:25,560
So it's not specific. And askew.

479
00:52:26,330 --> 00:52:30,050
Semi quantitative. So it's it's ambiguous.

480
00:52:30,350 --> 00:52:35,930
So if you see a a B within us or askew, it might.

481
00:52:40,830 --> 00:52:46,530
And as Q it might tell you to also do an end as a validation.

482
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:50,640
So there's ways to combine these limitations so that these notations are limitations.

483
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:58,829
But if you use multiples, it might help build that evidence. And then finally, population notation, if they don't are able to correlated with the TLB,

484
00:52:58,830 --> 00:53:03,230
they might give you what's found in the general population from something like that.

485
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:14,860
All right. That's the fine print. It'll also tell you when to collect the sample to compare it with that BPI level.

486
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:19,570
So it might be prior to shift. Prior to last shift.

487
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:31,850
Increase during shift. So that means both pre and post sample during work shift and of work shift and of work week or discretionary.

488
00:53:31,870 --> 00:53:37,540
So there's a lot here. I'd say most of them say end of shift, some say discretionary.

489
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:40,930
And that's first chemicals is very long half lives.

490
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:44,890
They're like, it doesn't matter when you collect the sample because it's not going to change much.

491
00:53:46,030 --> 00:53:50,349
And then, you know, various half lives might dictate some of these other ones,

492
00:53:50,350 --> 00:53:54,400
but end of shift is usually your shorter half life organic chemical type of.

493
00:53:56,830 --> 00:54:05,500
Yeah. So do the videos kind of vary depending on the context so I can absorb those versus a biologically effective dose?

494
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:13,330
Or is it all just biological? Yes, I'd say most of em are not biologically effective dose unless you're thinking about like carbon monoxide.

495
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:16,880
Most of them are just going to be like an internal dose or dose.

496
00:54:16,990 --> 00:54:24,760
Okay. Um, but, you know, if you read the documentation, it might say something about enzymes and so there could be some variation.

497
00:54:25,030 --> 00:54:28,720
And that's why sometimes it's good to look at that documentation.

498
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:33,130
So so you're clear on that. But usually for the most part, it's that internal dose.

499
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:41,390
And. Yeah. So here's a sample page out of the book.

500
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:45,550
And just randomly here.

501
00:54:46,090 --> 00:54:56,540
So kind of like with the TV's, you have your chemical and the case number over here and then underneath it in the smaller print.

502
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:59,140
I'll tell you what you're actually measuring and in what matrix.

503
00:55:00,250 --> 00:55:07,360
So methyl chloroform, you're measuring either methyl chloroform in exhaled air or metal core form in urine.

504
00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:11,770
And I'll tell you when you measure it.

505
00:55:12,790 --> 00:55:19,990
So the exhaled air says prior to shift at end of the workweek and if you read the documentation, it probably tells you why that is.

506
00:55:20,710 --> 00:55:26,550
And if you're doing the urinary one, it's at the end of shift and then it will tell you what the API level is.

507
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:34,300
So if you have 20 people that excel there or 700 micrograms per liter and you're just one example there.

508
00:55:35,070 --> 00:55:41,980
So these other ones, you'll notice it's a different chemical in the parent. That means it's a metabolite of that.

509
00:55:44,110 --> 00:55:46,360
He's pointing out things.

510
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:55,180
And then the notations we talked about in the last slide and Q not quantified see how it's just a blank so you can go measure it,

511
00:55:55,540 --> 00:56:01,120
but then you're kind of on your own to interpret it. Ooh.

512
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:06,190
Circle too many things at the same time. So here we have background and not specific.

513
00:56:06,710 --> 00:56:11,440
So that means that it's probably could be present in the blood from a different source as well.

514
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:18,310
Here we have one milligram per gram. Anybody know what that means?

515
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:27,400
For two months, oxy acetate as in urine at the end of shift and a workweek.

516
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:31,640
Anybody know what that means? It's like a way to normalize. Yeah.

517
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:36,150
Yep. So you'll notice this is where it gets a little confusing. This one's a urinary one.

518
00:56:36,510 --> 00:56:40,589
It's. It's reported in micrograms per liter. This one's a urinary one.

519
00:56:40,590 --> 00:56:46,020
It's reported more milligrams per gram creatine. So some chemicals.

520
00:56:47,730 --> 00:56:54,420
Sort of go through tubular secretion. Those are the ones where you see just a mass per volume.

521
00:56:55,200 --> 00:57:03,300
The ones we see mass per mass and creating, those are ones that go through glomerular filtration and that's thought to be a constant process.

522
00:57:03,910 --> 00:57:08,400
Yeah. Metabolic product of muscle.

523
00:57:09,090 --> 00:57:15,360
So that's sort of a way to start to normalize your output as much.

524
00:57:17,030 --> 00:57:21,440
Because that muscle metabolism GFR is thought to be constant.

525
00:57:22,070 --> 00:57:27,440
So if you have a sample with. So say you're drinking water all day.

526
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:31,370
It's tons of water, tons of coffee. And that urine is very dilute.

527
00:57:32,270 --> 00:57:35,299
It's not going to have very much creatinine and it's also not going to have very

528
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:40,310
much of a chemical of interest compared to somebody who has a drink all day.

529
00:57:40,610 --> 00:57:45,580
That's going to be a very concentrated sample of that chemical of interest, as well as with periodic.

530
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:52,040
That's where that adjustment can be useful. However, there are some limitations.

531
00:57:54,320 --> 00:58:04,790
There are well documented sex differences. You know, eating a steak dinner can also increase your creatinine levels, exercise some other variables.

532
00:58:05,210 --> 00:58:08,960
So there is some movement to look look into.

533
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:11,300
Other ways to normalize specific gravity is one.

534
00:58:11,510 --> 00:58:18,110
We've talked about specific driving in here for other purposes, but it can also be used as a, you know, the relative density of the liquid.

535
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:23,240
The more density, the more concentrated it's going to be.

536
00:58:23,990 --> 00:58:29,060
And that is correlated with cramping, but not quite as susceptible to some of these differences.

537
00:58:30,350 --> 00:58:34,370
So that's just a note on urinary dilution correction.

538
00:58:35,270 --> 00:58:42,590
There's also limits on how to do it and how concentrated it can be and still be thought of as reliable.

539
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:47,860
So those are published as well. Okay.

540
00:58:48,790 --> 00:58:53,320
So here's just an example using styrene. So you have styrene.

541
00:58:55,330 --> 00:59:00,040
If you inhale styrene, about 1% of it's going to be exhaled unchanged.

542
00:59:00,350 --> 00:59:03,520
Maybe you want to measure that by, but that's not the by PTI.

543
00:59:04,390 --> 00:59:14,410
It gets further metabolized into styrene oxide and then an acid 85% so that you know that

544
00:59:14,410 --> 00:59:19,180
that makes it maybe a good target for a biomarker rate and that's going to be plentiful.

545
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:23,740
You also have this PGA, which is about 10%.

546
00:59:24,220 --> 00:59:27,610
So the B for styrene is actually the sum of those two.

547
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:33,310
And then you have some that actually remains unchanged in the blood.

548
00:59:34,210 --> 00:59:37,720
So that also could be a biomarker.

549
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:45,430
So this goes all the way back ten years ago.

550
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:49,410
This is what this diary by the I think.

551
00:59:53,930 --> 00:59:57,790
Party by statistics on Thursday by 4:00.

552
00:59:58,910 --> 01:00:08,510
So this is what the styrene video look like in 2013. You have the MDR, FPGA, some in your end of shift, 400 milligrams per gram of creatine.

553
01:00:08,510 --> 01:00:13,560
So in this case, you have to also measure, measure creatine in the sample and this is styrene and B means blood.

554
01:00:13,970 --> 01:00:16,790
So on chain starting in the blood at 0.2 milligrams per year.

555
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:24,050
But how many workers you think are excited about that and of work and of work shift and how I'm going to go home.

556
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:35,240
Oh, I got to get you a needle. So in 2003, they changed it or 2015 they changed it.

557
01:00:35,570 --> 01:00:40,550
So instead of the blood one, they said, you know what? We can also measure the parent compound in urine.

558
01:00:40,820 --> 01:00:47,450
And it's a pretty good marker and they don't even adjust that one for suggesting it.

559
01:00:47,450 --> 01:00:52,300
It goes through a different excretion pathway than the GFR.

560
01:00:52,310 --> 01:01:00,410
So so these do this just to again illustrate that the HGH does change things quite often.

561
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:04,249
So I have some old TV books and this one's good enough.

562
01:01:04,250 --> 01:01:11,690
I'll use this and I don't know, it's different. You got to get the new one so they get you on the hook to be a member of this.

563
01:01:12,020 --> 01:01:16,010
So you got to know that this first one, the MDA plus PDA, is nonspecific.

564
01:01:17,130 --> 01:01:21,450
So if you're using now and you have to keep that in mind, for us, the steering is specific,

565
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:27,090
but, you know, low levels of exposure could be an issue if you're not detecting.

566
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:30,640
Because it is a smaller fraction.

567
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:43,980
And then I noticed as I was looking at this last night that the 2022, there's a notice for change in the story again.

568
01:01:45,060 --> 01:01:50,790
But because it's protected, I could not copy and paste that into here.

569
01:01:51,150 --> 01:01:54,420
I would have had to take a picture of my phone or something. So I didn't.

570
01:01:54,510 --> 01:02:02,130
But basically what it is, is it's it's reducing these to lower values either because the star until be changed

571
01:02:02,250 --> 01:02:06,030
or they've gotten more information about that correlation it's different than.

572
01:02:08,390 --> 01:02:12,110
So again, they do change from time to time.

573
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:19,850
Another example is carbon monoxide. So carbon so hemoglobin and blood or seal itself in exhaled air.

574
01:02:20,990 --> 01:02:24,620
But this one is an example where you have some things, other things going on.

575
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:31,100
So you have high background because it's it's everywhere at low levels due to combustion, tobacco, smoking.

576
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:38,120
And then it can also be nonspecific because of other chemicals that could metabolize to the same.

577
01:02:42,710 --> 01:02:54,080
So here is what it looks like for carbon monoxide, end of shift, hypoxia, hemoglobin or the exhaled air background.

578
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:59,270
Hi backgrounds. You got to be careful. And they're both labeled as nonspecific.

579
01:03:01,270 --> 01:03:05,410
So again, you probably want to combine that with air air measurements as well.

580
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:12,330
Last example, benzene. So this one has been through a lot of changes.

581
01:03:13,050 --> 01:03:19,830
Originally, it was phenol in urine, which is the metabolite of benzene and then also benzene and exhaled here.

582
01:03:20,730 --> 01:03:21,150
But.

583
01:03:24,690 --> 01:03:34,890
That became problematic because phenol was also representative of phenol exposure itself, and then other things were metabolized to phenol as well.

584
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:43,530
So a little too nonspecific for that. And I think benzene in exhaled air was fine in the old days when benzene was super high levels.

585
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:49,620
You know, you can measure it easily. But I think as the years have gone down,

586
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:55,050
people have become more aware that it's actually a carcinogen and you want to limit exposure as much as possible,

587
01:03:55,050 --> 01:03:56,370
then you add something more sensible.

588
01:03:56,970 --> 01:04:06,690
So currently what you have is as people were captured, acid in urine, tonic, acid and urine, and they both have that background designation.

589
01:04:07,230 --> 01:04:12,360
But these are going to be more specific and more sensitive than the previous ones they had for the same chemical.

590
01:04:13,050 --> 01:04:17,360
Again, just to illustrate the various changes that. Do occur.

591
01:04:17,870 --> 01:04:20,930
And here's the current levels and of shift.

592
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:30,550
There. And to suggest that more benzene is metabolized to the acid than the other one.

593
01:04:35,380 --> 01:04:38,860
And we'll come back to this the next time we talk about biomarkers environmentally.

594
01:04:38,860 --> 01:04:42,580
But you can do some crossover with what's found in the general population.

595
01:04:43,060 --> 01:04:50,170
And as we've talked about throughout the semester, occupational levels tend to be higher, the allowable levels are higher, and as you would guess,

596
01:04:50,230 --> 01:04:58,050
the I's are much higher typically than what's found in the general population, although some of these cadmium is pushing high.

597
01:04:59,980 --> 01:05:03,170
So we'll come back to that. Later.

598
01:05:04,170 --> 01:05:10,590
Couple of things. All right. So overall, some advantages of biomarkers, as we said, confirms absorption.

599
01:05:11,580 --> 01:05:16,649
The integrated exposure technology is getting very good where you can measure what different things.

600
01:05:16,650 --> 01:05:21,780
We're learning more about metabolism, so more possible analytes to be looked at.

601
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:29,129
When we go out and do our environmental monitoring or modeling to come up with an exposure estimate,

602
01:05:29,130 --> 01:05:35,880
it's really excellent to be able to go out and select a biomarker to help validate what you're measuring to our modeling.

603
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:42,480
We'll talk more about exposure trends in the future class and then public health interventions.

604
01:05:42,510 --> 01:05:48,000
There are some issues if you just have the biomarker, you don't know where it came from.

605
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:51,420
Can't tell what source or relative exposure pathway.

606
01:05:51,810 --> 01:06:01,080
So it's usually best with other information. And for a lot of them, we don't know what a toxic dose is, one because of individual factors.

607
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:05,040
And for a lot of chemicals, we just don't want to be eyes help with that.

608
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:08,730
But when you go outside those 53 chemicals, it becomes very difficult.

609
01:06:09,570 --> 01:06:16,470
And then, you know, the rest of the limitations are kind of along those lines of of not knowing how to interpret the information.

610
01:06:18,620 --> 01:06:27,620
So back to this one. Any additional thoughts? It's kind of a pre post to see if my intervention I'm trying to teach you guys about biomarkers work.

611
01:06:29,090 --> 01:06:35,360
You guys actually had a lot of good answers before we even started, so hopefully you didn't just waste the last 60 minutes.

612
01:06:37,330 --> 01:06:42,660
The other thoughts. So what do we have? Before we had dermal exposure as possible.

613
01:06:43,890 --> 01:06:49,040
We had. This is also a test.

614
01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:55,040
You guys remember differences in maternal metabolic differences, which now we know.

615
01:06:55,280 --> 01:07:02,850
More specifically, it could be due to a lot of various factors underlying disease activity, level one.

616
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:10,170
What else did he say? I've got my theories, guy.

617
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:13,860
I kind of contributed to the stake in creating new models.

618
01:07:14,130 --> 01:07:17,130
Okay. Specific differences. Yeah, that's one.

619
01:07:17,140 --> 01:07:23,110
Is just by creating so that I might be throwing it off. What about non occupational exposure?

620
01:07:23,130 --> 01:07:28,590
So this is just measuring in at work. Maybe somebody goes home and works with solvents in there.

621
01:07:30,270 --> 01:07:33,600
Yeah. There's a lot of ways in which you might be exposed to solvents, I suppose.

622
01:07:34,530 --> 01:07:40,050
How was the air sample collected? Are these all personal air measurements that were placed exactly correctly where they should be?

623
01:07:40,650 --> 01:07:49,710
The people wear them the entire shift. So you can go through every point of how each was measured and pick apart where that variability make you fit.

624
01:07:49,740 --> 01:08:00,180
And that's why some of this doesn't surprise me at all. So it's it's hard to find in real life observational studies to get to be a perfect agreement.

625
01:08:02,210 --> 01:08:02,670
All right.

626
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:10,040
So to summarize, this can be useful in the occupational setting, but typically used as a supplement to other approaches that we've been talking about.

627
01:08:12,260 --> 01:08:14,930
Part of that reason is because interpretation can be difficult.

628
01:08:15,950 --> 01:08:19,640
So that's a little bit of a different perspective than what we'll talk about in a couple of weeks.

629
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:26,960
More. It's always good when you take multiple routes are important in the occupational setting.

630
01:08:27,980 --> 01:08:33,950
You require a lot of knowledge about the toxicol kinetics to know how to sample and what type of sample.

631
01:08:34,370 --> 01:08:43,220
And then the pieces for 50 or so chemicals can be very useful guidance to help with that again in the work place.

632
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:47,990
All right, thanks, everybody. Have a good rest of your afternoon.

633
01:08:47,990 --> 01:08:51,800
Any questions? How are we doing on time?

634
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:55,339
See, I'm pretty good right in front of me like five or 10 minutes early.

635
01:08:55,340 --> 01:09:03,380
Every time that I'm building goodwill for, I guess this these are elections that sometimes go wrong but yeah.

636
01:09:03,530 --> 01:09:07,350
And put it to the extra time on the problems.

637
01:09:07,790 --> 01:09:11,130
Right. You're not going to happen to. All right.

638
01:09:11,820 --> 01:09:16,180
I don't think I can find the time. Okay. Going the provide.
