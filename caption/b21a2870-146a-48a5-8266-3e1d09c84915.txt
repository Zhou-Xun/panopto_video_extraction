1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:06,040
So the last premise has to do with the aggregation issue.

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:10,156
As I said, we can talk about aggregating single measures across patients or

3
00:00:10,156 --> 00:00:12,859
time and you can talk about the aggregation across

4
00:00:12,859 --> 00:00:16,806
a bunch of different measures like the consumer reports does when they.

5
00:00:16,806 --> 00:00:20,411
I don't know reading, they try to aggregate across a whole bunch of

6
00:00:20,411 --> 00:00:23,540
different dimensions of the car coffee maker.

7
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:26,314
And there's a big push in health care to do that for

8
00:00:26,314 --> 00:00:30,478
health care indicators because one of the ways to make it more intelligible

9
00:00:30,478 --> 00:00:35,061
to the consumer is that or to the payer is to just reduce it to one single dimension.

10
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,651
So you know what's the idea?

11
00:00:38,651 --> 00:00:42,391
And the idea is you have this big powerful continent provider

12
00:00:42,391 --> 00:00:46,951
who's causing good outcomes in most of their patients, hopefully not.

13
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:52,440
Yeah, that's good quality, hopefully they're not having too many bad outcomes.

14
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,259
And you could look for the difference between the two,

15
00:00:57,259 --> 00:01:01,658
and the problem is that when you really look at this

16
00:01:01,658 --> 00:01:05,849
cartoon of the British under care provider is,

17
00:01:05,849 --> 00:01:10,180
really you've got a different situation here.

18
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:15,342
What determines whether somebody survives that has a good outcome or

19
00:01:15,342 --> 00:01:20,860
dies is often some input from the position, but it's also a whole bunch of

20
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:27,282
different inputs from other things that's implicit in the regression adjustment.

21
00:01:27,282 --> 00:01:31,766
We were talking about earlier for case mix, but it really at the end of the day

22
00:01:31,766 --> 00:01:36,744
when you think about it, it's a signal to noise problem, and the more noise there is

23
00:01:36,744 --> 00:01:42,340
for the signal, the more difficult, more challenging the measurement procedure is.

24
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:47,161
It also has some implications in terms of your measurement, your analytic methods.

25
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:54,828
So if you look at this graph and if I tell you that the actual true mortality

26
00:01:54,828 --> 00:02:00,070
rates and some hospitals are actually along this lower axis here.

27
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:04,640
That's the spread that you would expect to see around 2% mortality rate.

28
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,401
If you measure that with a lot of measurement error, and

29
00:02:08,401 --> 00:02:13,361
a lot of noise compared to your signal, what you will actually observe our

30
00:02:13,361 --> 00:02:19,040
mortality rates that look like what's on the upper access, all right?

31
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,900
And why would that happen?

32
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,340
Well, think about it.

33
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,625
Each one of those points you're gonna make a measurement of and

34
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:27,140
it's gonna have a huge amount of measurement error in it.

35
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:31,934
So, any given measurement you make will fall somewhere on a big spread of possible

36
00:02:31,934 --> 00:02:35,440
points that's gonna spread out from that point.

37
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,994
And if every one of those as that with their measurements that you're likely to

38
00:02:39,994 --> 00:02:44,893
measure fanning out from it in any given instance, you're gonna see something with

39
00:02:44,893 --> 00:02:49,661
a much wider spread than the original distribution that it came from, all right?

40
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:54,449
That's a principle, it's actually been known for

41
00:02:54,449 --> 00:02:59,440
a long time called the James Stein to account for a James Stein estimator.

42
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:05,670
Yes, this graph is actually a reverse situation.

43
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:08,896
These were the measured mortality rates on the top,

44
00:03:08,896 --> 00:03:13,810
and they were introducing a technique analytically that allowed you to recover

45
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:18,209
what the actual measurement, what actual mortality rates were likely

46
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:22,561
to be of those hospitals given the measurement error in the measures.

47
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:28,527
So basically you have to, there's one thing you just have to realise is

48
00:03:28,527 --> 00:03:33,140
when you measure something with very low reliability.

49
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:37,785
The reliability in that what you observe is gonna be much larger than

50
00:03:37,785 --> 00:03:41,626
the truth variability, right, generating the data.

51
00:03:41,626 --> 00:03:47,030
Which is why CMS and its reporting on the hospital compare is using a technique

52
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:52,540
multilevel modelling or hierarchical regressions to try to recover.

53
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:56,861
Yeah, they call shrunken estimate for better two.

54
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,280
If you don't do that, you're gonna overestimate their ability.

55
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,954
And that was a big problem with some of the early work on variation and

56
00:04:06,954 --> 00:04:07,942
health care.

57
00:04:07,942 --> 00:04:12,143
Whether people were looking at naive estimates of what the variability was and

58
00:04:12,143 --> 00:04:15,132
they were sort of chopping off the top quartile saying,

59
00:04:15,132 --> 00:04:19,456
well if we moved to top quartile to the bottom, quartile, think about much money

60
00:04:19,456 --> 00:04:23,050
because it looks like you saved a lot more money or a lot more lives.

61
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:28,800
If you do it with the to spread out sort of imprecisely measured estimates,

62
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,561
then if you do it with the ones reflect the measurement error.

63
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:41,440
So here's some by these are actual bypass surgeons New York state.

64
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,381
These are their mortality rates for their bypass surgery and

65
00:04:45,381 --> 00:04:48,704
the black dots are the sort of naive measurement and

66
00:04:48,704 --> 00:04:53,960
the red dots are the ones are shrinken based on the precision of the measurement,

67
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:58,541
and why is the precision of measurement that vary across physicians?

68
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:00,708
Some of them are operating on three or 4 patients.

69
00:05:04,356 --> 00:05:09,415
There's a lot sort of the report essentially how reproducible

70
00:05:09,415 --> 00:05:15,054
measurements are within position as opposed to across the position.

71
00:05:15,054 --> 00:05:18,518
So that's that the basic idea is that you have to take

72
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:21,356
into account really imprecise measures or

73
00:05:21,356 --> 00:05:26,893
measures were really low signal to noise to take into account planning precision.

74
00:05:28,344 --> 00:05:31,876
Even worse, a lot of these the report card, the franks,

75
00:05:31,876 --> 00:05:36,512
they never give you confidence intervals on the race pretty hard to develop

76
00:05:36,512 --> 00:05:38,511
complex symbols on the rights.

77
00:05:38,511 --> 00:05:44,514
But do they are much wider than they are racist.

78
00:05:44,514 --> 00:05:49,304
These are the shrinken for 51 hospitals for

79
00:05:49,304 --> 00:05:52,714
mortality after hip fracture.

80
00:05:52,714 --> 00:05:55,428
And if you look at the config funerals for the rankings,

81
00:05:55,428 --> 00:05:58,503
you can see you can't distinguish these hospitals very much.

82
00:05:58,503 --> 00:06:02,636
Yeah, most report cards will just sort of show you those point estimates.

83
00:06:02,636 --> 00:06:05,240
My God, look at these horrible outliers up here.

84
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:10,602
Pretty hard to distinguish a lot of the ones who were in the middle

85
00:06:13,732 --> 00:06:17,492
A lot of this has to do with how much differences there are between,

86
00:06:17,492 --> 00:06:21,402
how much difference is they are between the units we're measuring.

87
00:06:21,402 --> 00:06:24,011
It's easier with the measurement, a basic principle.

88
00:06:24,011 --> 00:06:27,011
It's easier with the measurement to distinguish between things that are far

89
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:29,440
apart in between things that are close together.

90
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,992
Okay, for any given amount of measurement error, you can tell a lot more,

91
00:06:33,992 --> 00:06:38,183
you can tell people apart a lot more when they're wide apart than when

92
00:06:38,183 --> 00:06:39,861
they're close together.

93
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:45,959
And that means, in a sense, the take home message from that is that you should

94
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:49,561
be measuring at the level where there's the most variability.

95
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:54,114
Oftentimes it seems like the whole goal is to get down to some level where you can

96
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:56,240
point a finger at an individual person.

97
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,483
But if the variability is not at that level, at the practise level,

98
00:07:00,483 --> 00:07:04,670
ability level at the population level, then, you're missing.

99
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:07,524
First of all, it's gonna be harder to distinguish between them and

100
00:07:07,524 --> 00:07:10,577
second of all, you may not be thinking about the right factors in terms of

101
00:07:10,577 --> 00:07:13,140
thinking about why those differences exist.

102
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:17,769
So, position, this just basically gives you a sense of what the physician affects,

103
00:07:17,769 --> 00:07:21,564
size, meaning the proportion of the variability in this measure that

104
00:07:21,564 --> 00:07:25,900
is attributable to the position for a couple of different types of things.

105
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:29,055
They're fairly high 8-10% of the variability for

106
00:07:29,055 --> 00:07:31,268
whether or not you obtained a lab test,

107
00:07:31,268 --> 00:07:35,111
kinda makes sense because who orders the lab test position orders.

108
00:07:35,111 --> 00:07:38,944
So they have a lot of control over where you've got a lab test,

109
00:07:38,944 --> 00:07:43,323
they don't have as much control over pharmacy costs or on an outcome.

110
00:07:43,323 --> 00:07:46,816
Like how low your LDL your blood cholesterol level gets,

111
00:07:46,816 --> 00:07:51,037
they have some control but it's also a lot of patient variability and

112
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:55,915
biologic variability, and there's almost no effect in terms of what they're

113
00:07:55,915 --> 00:08:00,181
some other a lot of other outcome values like their last Haemoglobin.

114
00:08:00,181 --> 00:08:04,271
A one C value, a measure of glucose control and diabetes,

115
00:08:04,271 --> 00:08:09,961
several other outcomes very little over pharmacy costs for for some other kind.

116
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:15,440
Yeah, so it makes more sense to kinda look for where the variability is.

117
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,776
You're gonna measure something and

118
00:08:16,776 --> 00:08:18,461
measuring where things are the most various.

119
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:25,447
This is just a sort of shows you a curve of the the variance is

120
00:08:25,447 --> 00:08:29,040
attributable to the level of care.

121
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,142
Yeah, as a function of the panel size,

122
00:08:32,142 --> 00:08:37,640
you would need in order to be able to use these as a measure.

123
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:42,608
Again, the less precise measure is the bigger number of measurements you need

124
00:08:42,608 --> 00:08:43,887
tell people apart,

125
00:08:43,887 --> 00:08:48,718
given how little of the cholesterol level is attributable to the position.

126
00:08:48,718 --> 00:08:54,078
You have to have at least 200 patients for the position to be able to use it,

127
00:08:54,078 --> 00:08:58,859
distinguish between the whereas whether or not you order a lab test,

128
00:08:58,859 --> 00:09:02,339
you don't have to have that bigger panel look at.

129
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:05,709
Many conditions for many types of diseases,

130
00:09:05,709 --> 00:09:11,384
as a physician doesn't have any money that many people of anyone conditions

131
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:16,452
that may not be able to get enough precision to be able between them.

132
00:09:16,452 --> 00:09:21,258
There's also an issue of kinda when you're aggregating these

133
00:09:21,258 --> 00:09:26,154
measures is whether you're it's kinda Willie Sutton effect,

134
00:09:26,154 --> 00:09:31,141
are you going somewhere just because that's where the money is or

135
00:09:31,141 --> 00:09:33,793
is it because what's important?

136
00:09:33,793 --> 00:09:35,859
This was the original,

137
00:09:35,859 --> 00:09:41,239
the way that Medicare decided to evaluate Medicare programme?

138
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:51,040
Yes, nine measures and included mainly a bunch of immunisations.

139
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,761
Cheque obviously a lot more.

140
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,070
But those are the things that could measure.

141
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:02,670
So that was the first performance measures for Medicare, what's the problem there?

142
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:05,350
Well, if you only measure nine things and

143
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:10,558
they're all about screening in a programme that has a huge number of other things,

144
00:10:10,558 --> 00:10:15,169
you obviously have some risk for shifting the emphasis of the programme.

145
00:10:15,169 --> 00:10:20,059
Part of there's a English term called the significance,

146
00:10:20,059 --> 00:10:25,363
which is a figure of speech in which a part signifies the whole.

147
00:10:25,363 --> 00:10:29,169
So, like all hands on deck doesn't really mean the hands are getting up on deck and

148
00:10:29,169 --> 00:10:32,258
the people that you're using the hand to represent the people, or

149
00:10:32,258 --> 00:10:35,039
you could say Michigan the reverse, like Michigan beats.

150
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:39,131
Ohio state of Michigan beating.

151
00:10:39,131 --> 00:10:42,720
Ohio presenting something under that,

152
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:48,006
you guys all experienced this in your educational career.

153
00:10:48,006 --> 00:10:50,065
When the teacher says good luck on the state test,

154
00:10:50,065 --> 00:10:53,168
to test what you learnt from the practise test to prepare you for the test.

155
00:10:53,168 --> 00:10:58,351
Yeah, it's supposed to be measuring your knowledge and your education really.

156
00:10:58,351 --> 00:11:02,630
What it's about is testing you the things that are the test and it relates to this.

157
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:07,057
Adage that there's stuff that counts, there's stuff that can be counted and then

158
00:11:07,057 --> 00:11:11,482
there's other stuff, and if you go back to sort of the whole premise of kinda pay for

159
00:11:11,482 --> 00:11:14,740
performance, you look at some of the economic text.

160
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,440
Talk about pay for performance, yeah.

161
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,334
They say things like the desirability of providing and send us for

162
00:11:20,334 --> 00:11:23,861
any one activity decreases with the difficulty of measuring performance in any

163
00:11:23,861 --> 00:11:27,561
other activities that make competing demands on the agents, time and attention.

164
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:33,600
So this is these two are the actual one of the main textbooks economic

165
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,427
organisation of management, and this is a pretty fundamental lesson

166
00:11:38,427 --> 00:11:43,361
that you need to think about when you're designing incentive system.

167
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:49,556
And in many cases where we're actually using intensive systems,

168
00:11:49,556 --> 00:11:52,395
we don't, no, we have this problem.

169
00:11:52,395 --> 00:11:56,835
Let's get that on this sort of summarise the different kinds of

170
00:11:56,835 --> 00:12:00,790
aggregates that you can be thinking about health care.

171
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:03,571
Yeah, we've got quality measures that are at the patient level.

172
00:12:03,571 --> 00:12:05,915
We aggregate them to make a patient measure,

173
00:12:05,915 --> 00:12:10,010
we aggregate patients to make a provider level up to an organisational level.

174
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:14,161
We aggregate across clinical domains to make measures in specific

175
00:12:14,161 --> 00:12:18,906
clinical areas that we can aggregate across different components of care,

176
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:20,560
prevention and so forth.

177
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:26,254
So we're doing a lot of aggregating and you have to think about these issues,

178
00:12:26,254 --> 00:12:31,686
both kinda covering the domain and some of these measurement issues about

179
00:12:31,686 --> 00:12:37,029
how much signal to noise do you actually have area, and do you have enough

180
00:12:37,029 --> 00:12:42,921
observations to support the betterment given the signal to noise specialist.

181
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:47,351
There's not, there's also a basic causality problem.

182
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:53,232
This is an article about a few years ago talking about Baylor in student programme,

183
00:12:53,232 --> 00:12:55,377
once they admitted a bunch of students,

184
00:12:55,377 --> 00:12:58,171
they gave them a monetary incentive to take the SAT.

185
00:12:58,171 --> 00:13:02,126
Again and an even bigger monetary incentive if they improved their score and

186
00:13:02,126 --> 00:13:03,251
why did they do that?

187
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,797
But so for their college rankings, so

188
00:13:11,797 --> 00:13:16,880
now the rankings are supposed to measure the quality of the university.

189
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,337
Does the quality of the university change when you change or

190
00:13:20,337 --> 00:13:23,840
you're already admitted students SAT scores, no?

191
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:27,998
Alright, so there's actually a basic conceptual question to think about

192
00:13:27,998 --> 00:13:30,590
in measurement and what exactly are we doing?

193
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:36,001
Are we do we imagine that we have to do something to improve quality and

194
00:13:36,001 --> 00:13:40,575
then that will cause each of these indicators performance

195
00:13:40,575 --> 00:13:45,799
indicators to improve or do we actually think that if we change each

196
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:51,061
one of these indicators, we will have improved quality, right?

197
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,840
This is kinda pretty fundamental question.

198
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:59,932
And it's that you'd say well it's obvious it's, so for I mean I

199
00:13:59,932 --> 00:14:05,213
can tell you all of our measurements, all of measurement theory and

200
00:14:05,213 --> 00:14:11,740
all the way we design our measurement procedures are based on this premise.

201
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:15,761
All of the way we operationalize measurement is based on this.

202
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:22,440
So that's just on the face of it, that's a very basic problem.

203
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:27,118
We're operationalizing things based on one direction of causal arrows and we're

204
00:14:27,118 --> 00:14:31,751
measuring based on the other direction of causality and we got to figure that out.

205
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:37,530
So this is kinda an interesting area I've been trying to write about for

206
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:41,761
a while, been able to do it in a way that people really accepted.

207
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,506
But you know, come on.

208
00:14:45,506 --> 00:14:48,404
Because this is the teach to the test, right in this case,

209
00:14:48,404 --> 00:14:52,487
teaching to the test is okay, in this case it's not if you're an operationalized

210
00:14:52,487 --> 00:14:56,590
the measurement system here, you wouldn't use the same indicators every year.

211
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:59,836
You take a random sample of them the way they do under standardised

212
00:14:59,836 --> 00:15:02,494
testing because this is how standardised tests and so

213
00:15:02,494 --> 00:15:06,451
there's some very different implications for how you would design healthcare

214
00:15:06,451 --> 00:15:09,251
measurements based on which way the causal arrogance.

215
00:15:09,251 --> 00:15:12,077
And it's kinda weird that at this point in our lives we're not, yeah,

216
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,210
we're not don't even know which way the causal arrow
