1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,890
We are going to get started. You're missing a lot of the class today.

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:11,250
Seems like people didn't make it back, which is unfortunate. I think this is actually one of the best classes in the SEC.

3
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:19,990
So one really Katie's favorite topic, I think in 601 doubts or directed graphs,

4
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,190
of course, we've got over them some already through kind of throughout the course.

5
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:31,019
But the purpose of this today is for it to go back over those details, to do some more like advanced tags.

6
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:36,690
And we run it a little bit more like a workshop, so we should hand out the worksheet.

7
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:41,640
So there are worksheets that will give you some examples throughout the class.

8
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,090
It'll probably be a bit it'll be less than 2 hours. It normally is.

9
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:48,390
Anyways, it must be really good this discussion.

10
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:58,500
So and by the end of this class, hopefully you'll be very comfortable with that if you weren't already.

11
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:06,880
Uh, and of course it is completely free game now on the final for us to have more

12
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:15,390
reasonably complex that which we've avoided up until this point in the class.

13
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:38,760
All righty. And I just want to give a little credit to Boston boosters, who was a student that I worked at, I worked with at Berkeley.

14
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:45,730
He's now at the NIH because he did a lot of the diagrams that are used in this.

15
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:53,360
He was trying to convince me to finish editing one of his papers, actually.

16
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:56,940
So we had we worked out a trade a few years back.

17
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:09,599
So anyways, um, all right, so lecture outline, we're going to go over our review of DAG preliminaries go over a review of DAG rules.

18
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:17,310
You've seen this before, right? We're going to go through some DAG examples, a review of confounding and the selection bias on DAG.

19
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:25,590
You've seen a bit of this already, information bias on dogs, and then we'll talk about some dogs for advanced AP topics.

20
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:34,209
So the review of DAG preliminaries, remember we were just going to talk about this, right?

21
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:39,390
But the data driven approach regarding confounding can lead to errors, right?

22
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:51,810
So suppose you want here want to know the total, the total effect of and y and you do two by two tables, right?

23
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:54,510
That's kind of the data driven approach. We're going to do two by two tables,

24
00:02:54,810 --> 00:03:05,430
look for associations between A and C and Y and C and the data driven approach in that case with this particular DAG would say that,

25
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:14,490
yes, you know, C is a confounder you should control for C, but notice here there are no arrows, right?

26
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:23,610
So regardless of the direction of the arrows, you would get the same answer here if you do the data driven approach.

27
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:30,689
The problem is, though, that there's really three separate dags that you could have for that relationship.

28
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:41,430
So there's relationships, right? You can have here right where she is affecting a parent of a Y here.

29
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:46,440
Right. For here. And these are three different scenarios.

30
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:46,710
Right?

31
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:55,500
The first one, she is a confounder, you know, and so if you've done the data driven approach and this was truly the DAG, then you would be good.

32
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,530
You go, right, everything's fine. You should adjust for it.

33
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:04,440
What about the second one? What is this, a mediator?

34
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:09,540
Right. Do we want to adjust for mediators? No, we don't want to adjust for mediators.

35
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:13,499
Right. We can think about mediation analysis beyond the scope of six one.

36
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,709
No. All right. What about this one?

37
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:21,300
What is this, a collider? We want to adjust for colliders.

38
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:26,490
No, we don't want to adjust for colliders. Right. All right.

39
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:34,830
Quick question. Is the middle one functionally equivalent to if you drew the error from Y to see the C to A?

40
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:48,110
Yeah. It would be functionally equivalent. Okay.

41
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:57,980
So the conclusion here, though, is that the data driven approach. Right. Would lead to a correct analysis and one out of these three cases.

42
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:03,889
So you really need to have the structural information about the variables of interest in order

43
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:10,820
to prevent you from making an incorrect decision on the analysis carried by the students today.

44
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:20,100
Yeah. But it shouldn't you shouldn't go backwards in time like that.

45
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:24,749
But if it was like structurally, it would be the same.

46
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:29,670
But then you're setting your dog up wrong anyways, right? Essentially.

47
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:35,640
What do you. What do you think? I don't think you get fired or fired.

48
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,340
It wouldn't be. No, no, no, no. It's it's. But you're going in, like, as a mediator.

49
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:52,180
It's here. Yeah, I. But you should then have a at time point one at a time point to.

50
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:57,170
Right. And you would draw that down differently. Okay.

51
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:04,180
We got over the gnome creature before, but just to remind everybody is on the same page.

52
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:08,230
Right. A is going to be the exposure. Y is the outcome.

53
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:12,639
W is the measured variable. You as the unmeasured variable.

54
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:18,210
This is the most common nomenclature used for dags.

55
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:22,690
But if you go back particularly to some of the older papers, you will see other nomenclature being used.

56
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:29,140
So just don't be surprised. And remember, for dags, factors are going to be temporally ordered.

57
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:34,810
Right. So you've got a variable at time. Point one goes into a variable at time, point two and so on.

58
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,970
There are going to be no arrows from future factors back to past factors.

59
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:45,160
Right. Something that you can't go back in time. Okay.

60
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:54,510
The presence of an arrow between A and B denotes only denotes the possibility of its existence.

61
00:06:54,520 --> 00:07:01,990
It doesn't mean that it's there. Right. It's just if you think it's possible that is there an arrow from A to B,

62
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:09,850
therefore does not mean that A definitely Cosby, only that A may or could have cause to be right.

63
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:15,100
But if there's no arrow between A and B, then it does.

64
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:21,370
To note that there are assumption is that there is no relationship between those variables.

65
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:24,550
Right. That they are independent in our study population.

66
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,400
This is when there's no arrow between them.

67
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:34,860
This is also called exclusion restriction. Okay.

68
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,200
So here we have a DAG that you've seen before in the class, right?

69
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:50,370
So the lack of an arrow from you to a here implies that we have assumed that the arrow does not exist based on real causal knowledge.

70
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:56,429
Mother's genetic risk of diabetes does not have a direct effect on low income.

71
00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:00,090
It only works through the mother having diabetes.

72
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:11,680
Okay. So as we talked about before, right when we're thinking about dogs from dogs, you're going to use subject matter matter expertise,

73
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:19,930
you're going to talk to collaborators and hopefully in the end, you end up with a useful and correct tag.

74
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:26,650
Right. And remember, an incorrect dag is really meaningless because it's going to lead you down the wrong road for analysis.

75
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:38,229
Or at least so unmeasured variables that are common causes of your measured factors must be present in the DAG.

76
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:46,420
Remember, even if we're not going to be able to do anything about them with the information we have, we are going to draw them into our DAG.

77
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:56,950
So unmeasured confounding can lead to a spurious association even under the causal.

78
00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:00,070
No, no. Right. So this is the causal null.

79
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:03,130
Right? Meaning there was no error between A and Y.

80
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:15,040
Low income here is not causing diabetes here we have mother has diabetes is causing both low income and diabetes.

81
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:21,760
Father has diabetes also related to low income and diabetes.

82
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:30,560
Right. You're going to control for mother has diabetes control for her father has diabetes.

83
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:35,630
Now, if this is your dad, this is your complete dag. Is there a relationship between and why here?

84
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:44,240
No. Right. Because we've controlled for that you before. Yes, that would be right, because we've got that backdoor path.

85
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:52,610
All right. However, if we have this unmeasured variable, right, mother's underlying health status and behavior.

86
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:58,040
Right, you can still have a serious association.

87
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,910
And so here you would detect a relationship between A and Y.

88
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:08,660
Even though there's no causal relationship directly between them.

89
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:16,380
And of course, we can have father's underlying health status and behaviors as well in their.

90
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:31,780
Okay. So, um, number seven, we're usually going to draw Dags in such a way that we're like really considering the time flows, right?

91
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:38,350
So we're going to do time flows from north to south, so from top to bottom and then from left to right.

92
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:44,260
And that's just going to make it easier for it to be drawn.

93
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:58,300
So arrows pointing up and to the left or this right or in common, cause then you're going backwards in time, essentially.

94
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:12,709
All right. So the status of each factor is is really going to be is going to be considered on each path, right?

95
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:16,310
So each path is considered separately.

96
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:24,680
So here, right, we have our black path, right?

97
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:34,670
And we have mother has a diabetes. So here w which is mother has diabetes is a confounder because it's a common cause of a and Y.

98
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:43,190
And so you're going to want to condition on W, right, in order to close that path, this black path here.

99
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:48,710
However, we also have a red path here. Right.

100
00:11:50,900 --> 00:12:01,910
And in this red path, we go a to you, 1 to 2 to Y.

101
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:06,350
Right. W here is not a confounder right.

102
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:09,800
It's not a common cause of an Y in that pathway.

103
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:21,290
Instead, it's actually a collider. Right. So when we conditioned on W to close this pathway, we actually open a backdoor path here.

104
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:26,390
Right. So if these arrows were not here.

105
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:31,430
Right, we would not need a conditional w. Right. It's only because of the separate path.

106
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:45,860
So what you end up with is you conditional on w, but now you've got a selection bias being induced through this red pathway.

107
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:49,910
And does anybody know what this is called?

108
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:55,130
But the structure is called what type of bias? It's called M bias.

109
00:12:55,910 --> 00:13:04,610
Right. So you look at your the big one.

110
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,639
Why don't you go through for some of these all kind of lead you through them for others.

111
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:14,150
I'm going to have you try to do the DAG first and then we'll go walk through the slides to kind of explain it.

112
00:13:28,170 --> 00:14:30,340
You. Right.

113
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:39,990
So what is the name of the bias depicted in the dark? In in Biosphere one.

114
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:49,709
On what path is w a collider? So which one read path?

115
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:53,730
Right. This path from aid to you to w to you to y.

116
00:14:54,330 --> 00:15:02,879
You know, if it's not coded, color coded, you just draw like an A with the arrow and the you the arrow in the direction that it's going.

117
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,620
Right. So that's how that's the easiest way to indicate what path something is on.

118
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:12,060
If you don't have that color coded, we would not color coded for you on an exam.

119
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:17,070
Obviously, she's like, No, we would like.

120
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:24,510
So that's what she would do, right? So you would just like we just do it this way, right?

121
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:29,010
We got a new one.

122
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:38,790
All right. That's not very flexible w you to y okay.

123
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:46,990
That's how you would indicate that path. But in this case, yes, you can say the red path.

124
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:54,130
All right. So how do we intervene on DAG one to achieve exchange ability?

125
00:15:55,420 --> 00:16:03,460
What are we going to do for the stack? You two are both.

126
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:11,860
Yeah. Well, and. And let's pretend I don't have the box from W and W.

127
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:15,700
Right. Yeah. Yeah. So.

128
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:25,510
But the problem here, of course, is. So we would ideally like to conditional on W and either you one or you two or potentially both,

129
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:28,840
depending on how well we think these variables are measured.

130
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:37,930
Right. But of course, the issue here is that we don't have you one in YouTube, so we're not actually going to be able to achieve exchange ability one.

131
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,790
Would you want to finish on both sides, just one or the other? Kind of.

132
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:44,830
So you usually want to condition on the minimal set that you can possibly commission on.

133
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:52,719
Right. But if you know that they are imperfectly measured, which is often the case, and particularly for ones that might be really hard to measure,

134
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:58,890
like family income during childhood, that's going to be a hard one to measure.

135
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:06,459
Right? Like, you know, there are you could look at the number of years in poverty, you could look at the average income level.

136
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:11,620
You could just have them tell you what they think their income was.

137
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:21,430
Right. They might not really know that. That often tends to be very kind of related to the people around you, you know, base, you know, etc.

138
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:28,239
And then mother's genetic diabetes risk. I don't believe that we know all everything that goes into the genetics of diabetes.

139
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:33,910
So even if you had all of their genetic information right, it's probably going to be incomplete.

140
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,360
I have a question. Let's say that you want to do to our zone.

141
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:48,130
You suspect that the effects through one of the arms is much stronger than the other?

142
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,610
I would say that, like, because it doesn't matter.

143
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:59,530
I would I would go with the one that you think is best measured, easiest to measure, and only do one.

144
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:05,170
It doesn't really matter. Like the strength probably doesn't matter that much.

145
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:09,680
Okay. Like if one is really easy to measure and another one's difficult to measure.

146
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,980
Like, I always go with one. And a lot of times, like income or.

147
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:22,540
Yes, like that's a proxy for other things. Right. So if you have something other than that proxy to use and usually use that other thing.

148
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:35,309
Right. So. But of course, everything is probably mixed measure to some if there's some chance of this measurement to some degree.

149
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:43,080
Right. All right. So nine a dog is a simplified way of diagraming the relevant factors.

150
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,290
So remember, we're not going to put irrelevant factors into the dog.

151
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:54,690
So that means that we should not include factors that are only related to A or Y here.

152
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,550
Right. Or unrelated to our scientific question of interest.

153
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:09,899
So this example here, we've got a metro strike leading to a bike crash, in part also because of the metro strike,

154
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:16,650
the person decided to ride to work, which you know is part of why their bike crashed.

155
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:22,580
Maybe there was also more. You're you're wondering what's the drift outside of riding the bike?

156
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:29,360
Well, maybe there's a lot more traffic on the road because there's a metro strike rage and other things going on.

157
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:35,070
So, yes, if you didn't ride your bike to work, then you couldn't get into the bike crash for sure.

158
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:44,280
But there might be other effects of metro strike that that contribute to the bike crash outside of you just deciding to activate.

159
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:54,330
But, you know, it was also probably the fact that you that it was raining certainly contributed you think contributed to your bike crash,

160
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,290
but it did not contribute to the metro strike.

161
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:01,800
It only contributed to the bike crash. So we would not include that in our.

162
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:07,260
I would say, though, when you're thinking through these, you would you would write right down there.

163
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:12,990
You would draw it, draw the air to the bike crash. And then you'd think about the other factors that you're including.

164
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:19,140
Right. Your question, your main scientific question of interest, figure out if there is another area that should be there.

165
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:25,230
If there is not, then you know your race that we are bringing here.

166
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:32,010
But, you know, if for whatever reason rain is related to the scientific question, then you would keep it in the back.

167
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:41,220
Okay. So a backdoor path is a pathway from exposure to the outcome, not including the direct path of interest.

168
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:47,070
Closing the backdoor path is the entire point of confounder controls, right?

169
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,400
If to see if a back to a path is open,

170
00:20:50,820 --> 00:21:01,440
it's usually kind of easier to assume the null that is kind of get rid of that arrow between A and Y and see if you can still get from A to Y, right.

171
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:12,420
If you cannot if you want to erase the direct arrow, if you can't get from A to Y, then you have some type of exchange ability.

172
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:25,890
To achieve conditional exchange ability, you must conditional on some set of factors so that you block all backdoor paths between A and Y.

173
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:30,330
That set of factors is going to be called an adjustment set.

174
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:36,960
A minimal adjustment set contains the fewest factors needed to block all backdoor paths.

175
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:45,510
Okay, so those are DAG preliminaries. They should sound familiar because we did that in the first class.

176
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:49,230
Second class we went through these.

177
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:53,220
Okay, so quick review of DAG rules.

178
00:21:54,660 --> 00:22:00,899
So to get from 8ay through a backdoor path, you can move along any path regardless of the arrows.

179
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:04,559
Directional directionality. Okay.

180
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:09,090
So we can go from aid W to W2 to Y, right? That is a back to a path there.

181
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:18,960
So here a back to a path is open through the red arrows and the effect of a on y is is not going to be identified.

182
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:25,110
I don't know why this is dotted. I should probably fix that.

183
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:33,390
All right. Conditioning on a common cause of the exposure and the outcome closes the backdoor path.

184
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:41,880
Right? So here we're going from A to Y, we've conditioned on W one mother has diabetes,

185
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:46,980
probably because it's a little bit easier to measure than W2, which is unhealthy nutrition.

186
00:22:47,760 --> 00:23:01,170
Right. So now we blocked that backdoor, backdoor path, that aid w one to W2 to Y and we're going to identify the the effect of A or Y.

187
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:11,660
But measured factors may still lead to confounding, right, even if you closed the backdoor path through those measured factors.

188
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:17,840
So here we're going to do see socioeconomic status as an unmeasured factor.

189
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:22,250
And now we once again have a backdoor path that is open.

190
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:25,640
Even though we've controlled one back for a half, the mother has diabetes.

191
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:32,240
So then the net result is the effect of A on Y is not identified.

192
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:43,400
Remember that the existence of a collider so we're not redrawing our or that little bit differently does block that fact or path.

193
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:47,540
Right. And so in this case, if this is your dog,

194
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:54,860
then the effect of A on Y is identified because w one is a collider and so you can't get through the back or path.

195
00:23:57,170 --> 00:24:00,260
Conditioning on a collider will open up that back door path.

196
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:09,320
Right. And so when you do that, then the effect of A on Y is no longer identified.

197
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:20,120
And to explain that, I think we talked about the Bell example before, but just kind of explaining Rule five,

198
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:29,210
because it's one that people tend to have a little bit of difficulty with is suppose we have a DAG here and we're looking at the sidewalk being wet.

199
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:39,380
Okay. And we know there's two ways the sidewalk there's only two ways the sidewalk can get what either the sprinklers turned on or it rained.

200
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:51,080
Okay. So if we condition on knowing that the sidewalk is what we know, it's wet and we know that the sprinklers weren't on, then what do we know?

201
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:55,280
It must have rained, right.

202
00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:05,180
Because the only way that the sidewalk could be wet if the sprinklers weren't on is that it rained okay and then vice versa.

203
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:12,590
Right. And so what happens then is by conditioning on the state of the sidewalk, the sidewalk being wet,

204
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:18,610
then we know and knowing something about D tells us something about it and vice versa.

205
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:33,220
Right? Thus conditioning on this collider, you're right, has induced an association between the sprinklers and rain that wasn't there before.

206
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:40,490
Gives us some information about the other variable. Okay.

207
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:52,370
So that's why we don't want a condition on a collider. So conditioning on a descendant of a collider also will open a backdoor path.

208
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:58,220
So here we've got medical care, right? Which is the descendant of this collider.

209
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:02,240
Mother has diabetes and we have conditioned on it.

210
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:09,590
So now we've opened up a backdoor path here.

211
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:15,660
And to kind of explain that. Right.

212
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:24,030
Suppose here, instead of conditioning on a sidewalk being wet, we're going to conditioned on sidewalk being slippery.

213
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:28,320
Right. But the only input into sidewalk being slippery here.

214
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:33,090
Right. Is sidewall being wet. Okay.

215
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:39,420
So still we didn't conditioned on sidewalk being wet, but we know the sidewalk is slippery.

216
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:44,490
Then we know the sidewalk was wet. And if we know the sprinklers weren't on, then we still know it rained.

217
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:52,170
Right. And vice versa. Okay.

218
00:26:52,830 --> 00:27:04,360
So once again, it means conditioning, knowing something conditioning on down here is then going to induce a relationship between and E here.

219
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:07,890
So it's it's opening up a pathway between them. Right.

220
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:12,270
So we didn't conditioned here on this collider sidewalk as wet.

221
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:16,050
Instead, we conditioned on the descendent of a collider.

222
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:21,450
All right. So those are our rules.

223
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:29,670
You seem actually relatively straightforward. And then you start looking at really complex dogs, and it gets this gets a little bit more complicated.

224
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:34,140
All right. So now we're going to go through some dog examples.

225
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:46,650
So here we have a dog tag, too, although I think on your sheet, it might have some more things drawn in.

226
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:55,920
And we're kind of thinking through so do we have marginal exchange ability here in this bag?

227
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:13,870
Our interest is mosquito bites on Zika. It's a little bit harder.

228
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:20,270
Uh, so we have. We have unmeasured confounding here by sex.

229
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:32,310
Because it's acting on the mediator so that it has a relationship with the outcome.

230
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:41,670
All right. But we'll go ahead and draw this whole thing in. So if we if we did this, this was our our our dag.

231
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:46,030
You know, we've we've put location and age here.

232
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:49,830
These are both kind of clear confounders. Right. We're going to adjust for them.

233
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:57,810
Right. The question.

234
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:08,020
So for you, it isn't just about not good.

235
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:15,950
It's just great, even if it has another. Yeah.

236
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:26,000
You're going to still have to try to figure out a way to get. I mean, sometimes sometimes you can never achieve the changeability, right?

237
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,390
Or traditional instinct at all.

238
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:36,090
But yeah, if you had another arrow coming in the G, it would still give you some information, would still induce some association between DNA.

239
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,660
Okay. All right.

240
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:43,859
So here we're going to adjust for location, right?

241
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:49,140
Because it's a clearer confounder.

242
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:54,720
Right. I'll ask you to Zika symptoms, a clear confounder.

243
00:29:56,820 --> 00:30:01,380
But we cannot achieve exchange ability because of the inability to control for you.

244
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:05,429
I would say that this is actually a slightly more complicated example.

245
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:10,680
You wouldn't want to just control for you here anyway. So but but there you go.

246
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:16,610
Meaning we will need to do more like a mediation analysis.

247
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:21,680
All right. What about DAG three?

248
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:52,830
What are we going to do on deck three? Who's controlling for what?

249
00:30:53,340 --> 00:31:17,989
You can talk to each other. I just fix the formula on the way I was, what I was.

250
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:21,260
Which the formula. There's no solution. Yeah, yeah. It's okay.

251
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:27,490
I have my own, so. Okay. Yeah. I used to not provide a solution page to English.

252
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:30,820
We did it up here. Maybe.

253
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:44,160
Maybe last year. Previously it was reliant on people coming to class to fill it out.

254
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:47,310
Otherwise they were just staring, but just trying to figure it out.

255
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:53,070
And so what are we. What are we going to do on Dec three?

256
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:58,260
Nothing. Nothing. Right. Why aren't we doing anything?

257
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:04,860
Because there's no back door. Why is there no open back door? Because queue is a collider, right?

258
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:13,620
So remember, if you kind of erase this area or imaginary erase this area, you can't get from A to Y because.

259
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:18,960
Q because there's a collider on that path. All right.

260
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:22,540
So exchange ability is attained in the crude analysis.

261
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:29,020
So no confounding should be done. What about?

262
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:39,850
What about this deck that poor. How would we intervene to achieve exchange ability?

263
00:32:39,940 --> 00:33:13,930
The same question. So what are, what are we going to conditioned on here.

264
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:21,010
Ah. Ah, yeah. So our other option would be R and Z.

265
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:26,130
Right. But we want that minimal set of factors.

266
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:30,310
So unless you had a really compelling reason to also conditional Z, which is conditional.

267
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:36,310
Ah, in this case what I don't want to hear is that you're conditioning on, on you one or you two.

268
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:42,340
Right. Because remember that is a signal for it being unmeasured and something that you can't actually conditional.

269
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:47,680
Plus you can go backwards in time and not remember to put that information into your survey

270
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:53,020
or collect that sample or whatever it is you need to actually measure that variable.

271
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:59,290
All right. So we've conditioned on, ah, so exchange ability is attained by conditioning on our alone.

272
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:07,660
So what about our next dag?

273
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:11,650
Dag five. This is the start of Dag five.

274
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:38,580
What would we want to condition on here? All that you have read through them.

275
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:43,860
So it is a little helpful to like imagine you being away, but you've also got the drawing of you.

276
00:34:43,860 --> 00:35:38,260
Obviously the question asked you with and without using their. All right.

277
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:46,150
So what would we want to condition on here if this was what we were looking at?

278
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:52,000
No, you. S s and P, right.

279
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:57,010
Um, in fact, you could do S and P, or you could do s and.

280
00:35:57,010 --> 00:36:01,090
Ah, right either way. Um.

281
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:13,510
So there we go. Now, if we have you here, now, what do we want to do?

282
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:31,750
How does that impact our analysis? We'll take our back away because regardless of whether it was there,

283
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:36,400
right the first one, we're going to want a condition on ASH because it's confounder.

284
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:44,620
Right. When you wasn't present, we already said we would do S and P or S and R, right.

285
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:49,540
You could really choose either one. What if you as present?

286
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:53,320
What do you need to condition on?

287
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:10,410
Oh, yeah. Definitely S P and P.

288
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:20,970
Yeah. Oh, I see. Yeah. So we're going to do S and we're going to do P and we're going to do that p r.

289
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:28,829
It's actually already up here on the slide. Anyways, um, we're going to do that to avoid a collider bias, right?

290
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:33,060
Because if we conditioned on our that more, then if we're inducing a collider bias there,

291
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:38,670
so the exchange ability then will be obtained after conditioning on S and P.

292
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:48,720
All right. So now we're going to go over a review and confounding of confounding and selection bias on does.

293
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:55,680
Right. So here is our causal structure example confounding right.

294
00:37:55,710 --> 00:38:00,330
W is a common cause of both A and Y, right.

295
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:07,680
Therefore it is a confounder. So a backdoor path is open from 8ay.

296
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:16,650
So we don't have any form of extreme stability. And because of this common cause of and why we have confounding.

297
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:27,660
Right that's the structural basis for confounding here is the causal structure for selection bias.

298
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:34,620
Here we've got is conditioned, so we've got our low income diabetes bias.

299
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:40,709
Well, part of the bias again, right, we're conditioning on mother has diabetes.

300
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:48,600
It's a selection bias, right? So we're opening up a back path for the Y so we don't have exchange ability.

301
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:57,930
Um, there's no confounding present because, and y have no common causes in this diagram.

302
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:07,690
Right. So this is back to that tag on the bias.

303
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:14,860
Right. So W is a common cause of both. And why we conditioned on it.

304
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:17,930
But the problem here is, of course, that it's also a collider.

305
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:19,940
Right. We've got that back path.

306
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:32,150
Um, so by conditioning on w um, we have induced selection bias, but this is a causal structure that has both confounding and selection bias in it.

307
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:39,980
Okay. So some of the commonalities between confounding and selection bias,

308
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:45,950
both are going to be problematic because both imply and open back to a path from A to Y.

309
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:51,860
Right. Hence, in the presence of either or both of these phenomena, we're going to lose exchange ability.

310
00:39:53,540 --> 00:40:00,170
Both are going to imply the need for modifications to the DAG in order to achieve exchange ability.

311
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:10,490
So examples of possible ways to modify a DAG and what people normally kind of think of as just, you know, statistical adjustment.

312
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:14,990
Right. But we can also modify that, DAG, by restricting the study population.

313
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:20,220
And you can do it by randomizing the treatment of interest.

314
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:25,670
So if it is something that you can minimize. All right.

315
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:33,190
So fundamentally, selection, bias and confounding arise from different causes, right?

316
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:37,610
Confounding is due to those common causes of A and Y.

317
00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:51,410
So in the example global view one here, family income during childhood and W are confounders because they are both common causes of A and y.

318
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:55,910
Right. You through that pathway and w directly to that one.

319
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:10,459
So selection bias, on the other hand, can be due to several different factors.

320
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:15,770
It could be due to conditioning on common effects of a Y, right?

321
00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:23,419
So here selection into the study is a common effect of both the exposure and the outcome, right?

322
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:30,740
So that's number one. Conditioning on the common effects can also be due to conditioning on common effects of causes of A and Y.

323
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:37,639
So here we're looking at a new drug and the relationship with heart disease got

324
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:52,100
Chagas disease in our eating habits here both common effects are causes of A and Y,

325
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:56,960
right. Or it is a common effect of causes of aging y, right.

326
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:02,300
So when we conditioned on this, we're once again inducing selection bias.

327
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:15,910
And then our third scenario here is when we're conditioning on the effect of either A or Y and the effect of the cause of the other.

328
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:19,120
Basically a combination of one and two, essentially.

329
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:25,060
Right. So here we've got our exposure, a outcome here, room status,

330
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:31,420
and then we've got pre disease symptoms leading to affecting our sensory status and the outcome.

331
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:39,600
So that's what that's a selection bias or where you would get selection bias occur.

332
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:48,990
Okay. So the next topic is information bias on drugs.

333
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:57,690
So information bias also called measurement bias or measurement error or it's result of measurement error occurs when

334
00:42:57,690 --> 00:43:04,860
the association between and Y is weakened or strengthened as a result of how variables in the study were measured.

335
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:13,109
That is, as a result of measurement error. It's important to remember that information bias can occur in all settings.

336
00:43:13,110 --> 00:43:17,440
Even in our case, people often think of our cases as being bias free.

337
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:26,670
Not the case, right? So it's important to understand the causes of information, bias and the effects when you're conducting a study.

338
00:43:29,370 --> 00:43:35,100
So if you have exchange, ability hold because you don't have selection bias dealt with confounding, right?

339
00:43:35,370 --> 00:43:42,060
But you still have information bias. It's going to be insufficient to get the causal factor on Y right.

340
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:46,710
So in short, even if you have exchange ability and even if you randomize,

341
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:52,799
you may still end up with mis measure variables and then computing the effect of miss measured

342
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:59,940
variables even after randomization or exchange ability will likely lead to an incorrect result.

343
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:05,820
And of course how measured they are will impact how incorrect that result is.

344
00:44:07,050 --> 00:44:11,970
Introducing information, bias and attacks allows us to identify how it will affect our estimate.

345
00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:22,620
So say we want to study the effect of cholesterol lowering drug A on the risk of liver disease.

346
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:28,950
Why? However, we know that A can be measured because some patients may not take the drug,

347
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:33,570
you know, so they get you're using a medical database, for example. So, you know, they got the prescription.

348
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:39,630
You don't know if they actually took it right. Or the doctor may forget to write down that the patient was prescribed the drug.

349
00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:50,730
We're going to represent the true exposure of interest, which is taking the drug as a and the measured exposure as a prime here.

350
00:44:51,510 --> 00:44:58,500
Right. Which will not necessarily equal the true A for a particular individual.

351
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:03,990
All right. So here we go.

352
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:10,020
Right. Got true drug use. Whether or not they actually took the drug on, whether or not they got liver disease.

353
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:19,890
But now we've got this measured drug use and there's some measurement error for a that is going into that.

354
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:31,740
So you a here are going to represent all the factors other than a which will determine the value of the drug is as measured in the study.

355
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:47,450
So in psychology a is called the construct and a prime abstracts is called the measure or the indicator.

356
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:57,560
The challenge is to use data on the measured indicator to derive inference on the effect of the unmeasured construct.

357
00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:05,830
A on your outcome line. All right.

358
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:13,490
So. Do you want to go ahead and look at that six?

359
00:46:23,770 --> 00:46:28,990
So in that six, right, we've got measurement error for our exposure, a drug.

360
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:33,100
We've also got measurement error for true liver disease.

361
00:46:51,820 --> 00:47:02,149
Simply. What do you mean by systematic?

362
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:05,800
I mean, if it's differential. Yes, but is it just like.

363
00:47:07,570 --> 00:47:19,420
Random variation versus. I don't think there's actually, like, a good way.

364
00:47:19,450 --> 00:47:22,689
I mean, you would think through that. You might write it on there.

365
00:47:22,690 --> 00:47:25,480
But I'm not thinking of a way.

366
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:35,390
I mean, you could say that, you know, unmeasured measurement error for you could indicate there that it's going to always overestimate potentially.

367
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:43,149
Right. The thing is, like, if it's always overestimating by £10, then it doesn't actually matter that much.

368
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:52,210
Rates are still attractive. Because it's going to be perfectly correlated or even like it sounds like.

369
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:57,750
There are six sizes and there's no differential.

370
00:47:59,510 --> 00:48:04,880
There's no way they are in place or this is not differential.

371
00:48:07,850 --> 00:48:18,140
Though you'll still see this through the season or you'll see at this stage you'll see an association.

372
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:26,910
I mean, if measurement error is extreme, you could actually see a very different association, in fact, because it does depend on where they are.

373
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:34,010
But this one. So that sense would still say you were not getting at the true effect of and why.

374
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:40,490
But how far off you are and in what direction does depend on as to the degree of measurement error.

375
00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:52,900
You kind of think back to the particularly like the clinical AP lecture where we said like,

376
00:48:53,350 --> 00:49:00,340
it's worse than this, like don't even bother using the test, right? Because you can really kind of invert your relationship.

377
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:14,140
All right. So and why are known as. What in psychology can structure and be a star and why should I call them?

378
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:21,040
Going forward, are known as a measure or an indicator.

379
00:49:21,230 --> 00:49:28,750
Right. Okay. So does does exchange ability hold in the stock exchange?

380
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:37,870
It already holds. But is exchange ability sufficient to identify the causal effect of interest?

381
00:49:37,870 --> 00:49:42,569
Why or why not? No, it's not sufficient.

382
00:49:42,570 --> 00:49:54,770
Right? We've got marginal and strange ability here, but we're interested in the effects of A on Y where we only have a star.

383
00:49:54,770 --> 00:49:59,790
And why star here? Because a star is not equal to a and y star is not equal to why?

384
00:49:59,790 --> 00:50:04,470
There's no guarantee that we will get at that true causal effect.

385
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:12,700
So here we've got a question for the causal bias difference.

386
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:16,020
The superscript three here are going to indicate the counterfactuals.

387
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:21,750
Um, but this is really what we are looking at, right?

388
00:50:23,070 --> 00:50:31,170
So since a star is not equal to a y, stars are equal to y, the causal risk difference and the association all risk difference.

389
00:50:31,170 --> 00:50:39,720
I should probably put it in the little cursive B letters J usually used for causal, but uh,

390
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:46,740
and so generally speaking, this will be true for all measured associations, hence the presence of information bias.

391
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:55,860
Hence in the presence of information bias exchange ability is insufficient for the identification of the causal effect of interest.

392
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:05,340
Right. So that's information bias on dags.

393
00:51:05,790 --> 00:51:10,020
Okay. So dags for advanced topics.

394
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:21,809
Just a quick summary though. Confounding arises because of common causes of and why selection bias arises because of

395
00:51:21,810 --> 00:51:29,760
investigator induced selection on common effects or common causes of common effects of a and why.

396
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,330
And remember, it can also be a combination of those two things.

397
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:39,770
So what about information bias?

398
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:48,960
So we know that measurement error gives rise to information bias, but there's actually no single structure for dogs to summarize measurement error.

399
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:57,809
But we can still classify measurement error into four broad structural types based on considerations of two properties.

400
00:51:57,810 --> 00:52:02,639
And so the two properties that will think about our independence and when we talk about independence,

401
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:12,990
we're talking about independence of you a the unmeasured the measurement error for A And you why the measurement error for why?

402
00:52:14,490 --> 00:52:18,660
And so here we're saying the measurement errors are independent and we call that independence.

403
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:22,440
And then we can talk about something being differential or non differential.

404
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:34,799
So if the measurement error of A is and why or independent then other is non differential,

405
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:46,350
we're perspective why and if the measurement error of you, of your outcome and a are independent, then why is non differential in perspective a.

406
00:52:51,380 --> 00:53:01,100
And we were going through. So here, tag six was an example of independence of measurement errors.

407
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:14,740
Right. And. And they're independent because we have colliders here which are blocking a backdoor pathway between the two.

408
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:23,830
All right, so why don't you look at that seven?

409
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:30,780
Can it get better? Go.

410
00:53:36,470 --> 00:53:44,610
No hustle, Mr. French, though. But they always catch those little things.

411
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:54,760
I try to be really consistent and then, like, you know, from the, I guess, thousands of slides that are 600 slides are in six oh yeah.

412
00:53:56,240 --> 00:54:02,030
So the numbers are all around like that much more complex than just certain numbers.

413
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:14,070
The first year I talked to someone, printed up the slides for all the students.

414
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:19,730
Like I thought, Oh God, what did you do?

415
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:22,780
Do you guys when people stop doing that, that.

416
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:33,960
Yeah, but I remember doing it. Yeah, I remember we had six, I think we had,

417
00:54:35,430 --> 00:54:45,390
we got big interactive things like I started making opportunities on screen and I'm like, okay, well, I'm I wasting my time.

418
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:50,370
People are getting more and more used to not having paper.

419
00:54:50,550 --> 00:54:54,690
Yeah. People just say on the computer. And so I was like, Have you ever heard outside maybe know what they're going to hear?

420
00:54:54,690 --> 00:55:02,190
But yeah, no, I didn't buy them. So they, they were the problem, even if you can't fix them.

421
00:55:03,690 --> 00:55:10,989
So I kind of. Okay.

422
00:55:10,990 --> 00:55:14,590
So what is DAG seven to pick that DAG six does not.

423
00:55:16,450 --> 00:55:24,480
What's the difference there? It's this UK y, right?

424
00:55:26,470 --> 00:55:32,110
It's imperfect. We're calling it a retrospective recall of patients medical history.

425
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:37,600
And so now there's a dependance of those two medical there's two measurement errors.

426
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:42,200
Right. So that's what tags six or seven depicts.

427
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:45,490
But that 6% is the dependance between the measurement errors.

428
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:50,980
Does DAG seven display recall bias?

429
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:58,930
Why or why not? It is not right.

430
00:56:01,110 --> 00:56:06,810
And that's because this is non differential, right? We call bias for the differential.

431
00:56:08,850 --> 00:56:13,020
All right. So how would we classify the information present in Deck seven?

432
00:56:17,050 --> 00:56:22,660
Remember, we're going to talk about whether it's differential or non differential and dependent or independent.

433
00:56:23,890 --> 00:56:28,720
So is it differential or non differential? Non differential?

434
00:56:30,250 --> 00:56:39,600
Is it dependent or independent? Dependent.

435
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:44,250
Right. So the measurement errors are related.

436
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:46,650
Right. So that's why it's not going to be independent.

437
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:56,460
But we don't have an arrow going from why here to a measurement error a or a to Y, and so thus it is non differential.

438
00:56:58,770 --> 00:57:07,600
All right. So in both Dec six and seven, UK is independent of the true.

439
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:13,120
Why? That's why and you why is independent of the true a right.

440
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:16,450
We don't have a error going here. We don't have an error going there.

441
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:19,900
And that's why it is non differential.

442
00:57:30,930 --> 00:57:33,660
All right. So how does independence differ from London?

443
00:57:33,690 --> 00:57:39,960
Differential independence is about whether or not you a and you y are independent of each other.

444
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:41,340
Okay.

445
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:50,940
Non differential is really looking at whether or not the measurement error of your treatment or outcome is independent of the outcome or treatment.

446
00:57:50,950 --> 00:57:54,510
So the measurement error of the treatment is that independent of the outcome?

447
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:59,940
Okay. And is the measurement error of the outcome independent of the treatment?

448
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:07,779
Okay. So we're going to be concerned with two properties,

449
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:16,740
three independence of why of the measurement error of the exposure and the measurement error of the outcome.

450
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:21,209
So at this point, we'll say that the measurement errors are independent.

451
00:58:21,210 --> 00:58:31,650
If you air and you wire independent and then for non differential, we'll look at is the measurement error of our exposure related to our outcome.

452
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:40,590
So it's independent if it isn't and we'll say is non differential with respect to why and then the independence

453
00:58:40,590 --> 00:58:48,270
of the measurement error for outcome and and our actual exposure with our true exposure that somebody got right.

454
00:58:48,750 --> 00:58:59,310
So if that holds, then we'll say that UI or the measurement error of our outcome is non differential with respect to our exposure.

455
00:58:59,550 --> 00:59:08,910
Or it could also be a treatment that. All right.

456
00:59:09,450 --> 00:59:22,710
Do you want to look at 8.1 and see if you can take a stab at looking at the next lecture slides at what kind of bias is depicted in 8.1?

457
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:27,780
Is there any one but people?

458
00:59:28,130 --> 00:59:31,960
Why is there? There's a point, but there's also an 8.2 as well.

459
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:38,250
Yeah. Yeah, it is. Because there's an 8.2 over.

460
00:59:38,310 --> 00:59:41,400
There's no 8.2 on your worksheet. There's an 8.2 in my slide.

461
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:58,340
There doesn't need to be an 8.2. I'm you know same that down.

462
00:59:59,010 --> 01:00:03,030
Mm hmm. I can't figure.

463
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:10,590
I have. I have the original version. Oh. I mean, I made it, so I had it somewhere.

464
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:32,310
They keep this for me. I've been looking at. Who can blame the prior GSA saw the original source supposed to be in the club.

465
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:41,189
Yeah. Just seems like it's really all my stuff. It's all the powerpoint is otherwise very pretty.

466
01:00:41,190 --> 01:00:46,670
Like, it was like, here's a flash drive. Everything is on it. I put them in the files like that.

467
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:50,130
They're supposed to be in the files, but somebody went through and cleaned out the files.

468
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:55,260
Yeah. And all the PowerPoint or like one file on their own, you know?

469
01:00:55,420 --> 01:01:05,040
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, really? Then maybe you could just keep the PowerPoint slides.

470
01:01:05,050 --> 01:01:09,210
Yeah. 2022 birthdays.

471
01:01:09,460 --> 01:01:15,750
Still in the old ones and. All right.

472
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:25,950
So what kind of bias is depicted in 8.1? I think I heard it.

473
01:01:26,610 --> 01:01:36,060
Recall? Yeah. And how would we classify the information bias in 8.1?

474
01:01:47,130 --> 01:01:53,220
Or is it okay? Is it independent or dependent?

475
01:01:55,030 --> 01:02:02,250
Is independent. Right. Is it differential or non differential?

476
01:02:04,170 --> 01:02:07,709
Differential, yes. So independent.

477
01:02:07,710 --> 01:02:12,540
But differential measurement error is the problem with these slides is it gives away to me.

478
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:21,360
Yes. Does it have to like I'm thinking, for example, this could be like if somebody has true dementia,

479
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:25,969
maybe they're more likely to have drug abuse recorded in their chart.

480
01:02:25,970 --> 01:02:32,250
So it's not necessarily color. It could.

481
01:02:32,670 --> 01:02:36,270
Yes. That is that is very true.

482
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:42,370
Be like a surveillance bias. All right. So if y.

483
01:02:43,530 --> 01:02:49,410
Here we go. Exposure, recall. So this is the causal this causal structure depicts recall bias.

484
01:02:49,650 --> 01:02:59,920
Um, uh, but you're right, actually, that that could be something other than recall back and think of a better example for that now.

485
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:06,100
So the structure in Doug eight is not unique to recall bias, which is what you were calling out there.

486
01:03:06,450 --> 01:03:15,120
Right. Depending on the study conditions and the variables, the same tag structure can be used to diagram other forms of information bias that

487
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:19,120
is going to apply to basically all the dogs that we cover for information bias.

488
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:27,720
So here we've got another, uh, dag, same dag 8.2 now.

489
01:03:27,990 --> 01:03:35,040
Right? We switch not the variables. And in this case, this causal structure is depicting reverse causation.

490
01:03:35,970 --> 01:03:41,520
So we're saying that that liver toxicity affects the amount of drug in the blood.

491
01:03:41,970 --> 01:03:46,980
And investigators used measured drug levels in their blood analysis.

492
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:55,230
Right. So liver damage is affecting the amount of the drug in the blood and therefore, liver damage is affecting the measurement error for a.

493
01:04:00,690 --> 01:04:04,200
There's this tedious thing about recoveries.

494
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:08,690
So when we talk about recoveries. Like you.

495
01:04:08,930 --> 01:04:12,050
Like, for example, in the deck seven.

496
01:04:14,890 --> 01:04:21,580
It is not a virtual recall, but the association is a firm.

497
01:04:21,580 --> 01:04:26,860
Why start huge? Because of the recall. Is it still required?

498
01:04:28,180 --> 01:04:31,079
No, because recall bias is always different.

499
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:41,230
So it's like it's always where having the condition or potentially not having the condition is causing you to be more or less likely specifically.

500
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:55,030
So it's always, always differential. In this time it's not differential. But this could be another bias.

501
01:04:55,270 --> 01:04:58,750
Right. What bias would you be proposing here?

502
01:04:59,780 --> 01:05:02,800
Because if it's if it's not recall bias.

503
01:05:06,340 --> 01:05:13,640
Without them having more guards there, they're more likely to have drug use record,

504
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:18,300
is what she's saying, because they have dementia in their medical chart.

505
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:23,660
So that would probably be like a medical surveillance bias, right?

506
01:05:23,660 --> 01:05:29,380
Like a bias for because people are going because this person is going into the.

507
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:30,920
I think that's what you were saying, right?

508
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:36,620
Because they're going into the doctor more so they're more likely to get that recorded into this medical chart.

509
01:05:39,850 --> 01:05:43,389
Yeah, it's definitely some form of information.

510
01:05:43,390 --> 01:05:50,920
Bias wouldn't be a detection bias, but I think it would be a surveillance bias as the possibility there.

511
01:05:51,370 --> 01:05:55,629
All right. So anyways, remember that these tags are not going to be specific.

512
01:05:55,630 --> 01:05:59,170
That's not you can't look at it. And they didn't tell you what the variables are.

513
01:05:59,170 --> 01:06:02,170
You couldn't say like, oh, that's the recall bias tag, right?

514
01:06:02,170 --> 01:06:08,200
You need to actually know what the the by what the variables are, what the scenario is to name the bias.

515
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:13,239
Otherwise you could just say that it's an information bias and you could tell me if it's dependent or independent.

516
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:18,160
Right. And differential or non differential. Something pointed out.

517
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:22,840
Okay, so we've got a Dagg nine.

518
01:06:27,250 --> 01:06:35,410
Right. So the answer to what other bias shares the same causal structure as DAG 8.1 Reverse causation bias shows the same structure.

519
01:06:38,710 --> 01:06:40,720
So here we have DAG nine.

520
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:48,430
So our situation here is we suppose that the doctors in an RCP believe that the assigned drug may actually be causing liver disease,

521
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:52,680
so they monitor the patients on the drug more closely than the placebo.

522
01:06:52,690 --> 01:06:56,710
This results in a medical surveillance or a detection bias.

523
01:06:57,580 --> 01:06:59,500
Right. So having the exposure here.

524
01:07:09,070 --> 01:07:23,110
So how would we classify the information bias detected and says dab nine but it should say dark very reverse causation of the cyclical.

525
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:35,300
Like in terms of life a. Nobody wants to.

526
01:07:37,910 --> 01:07:43,670
Yeah. I would still consider that a reverse causation bias because your outcome is still affecting your mood.

527
01:07:44,420 --> 01:07:52,250
I realize it's affecting your measurement, not actually affecting the true drug use, but yeah, it's a reverse causation.

528
01:07:57,550 --> 01:08:06,060
Oops. Okay. Four dead. Nine. How would we classify the information depicted on that?

529
01:08:06,070 --> 01:08:13,400
Nine. The differential or non differential.

530
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:19,890
I heard both answers. I think differential, right?

531
01:08:19,900 --> 01:08:28,600
This is because that our outcome, our exposure to drug use is having an effect on the measurement error for our outcome.

532
01:08:28,810 --> 01:08:34,000
Why? So that's it is differential. Is it independent or dependent?

533
01:08:35,860 --> 01:08:44,290
Independent, right. Because there is no direct pathway from the measurement error of a measurement error.

534
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:49,659
Why? You know, because we've got a collider right here as your drug is right.

535
01:08:49,660 --> 01:08:54,760
There is a collider. Right. We don't have the errors up here letting the two.

536
01:09:01,820 --> 01:09:09,309
All right. So why don't you go ahead and look at the Big Ten and write down what the what the

537
01:09:09,310 --> 01:09:16,480
distinction between that 8.1 or 8.2 in death and ten is and then classify God ten.

538
01:09:44,920 --> 01:10:19,760
So. So what's the difference between 8.1 plus two and Doug ten?

539
01:10:31,470 --> 01:10:35,310
That's fair. Yep. Yeah. The measurement errors are correlated.

540
01:10:35,670 --> 01:10:42,780
Right. So 8.18.2 were independent. Whereas in dark ten, it's not dependent.

541
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:50,150
So how would we classify the measurement error for the type of information bias depicted in data?

542
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:59,360
Differential or non differential? Differential and independent or dependent.

543
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:02,320
Dependent. Yeah. So here it is. Right.

544
01:11:02,330 --> 01:11:12,530
So it's dependent because of this, the measurement errors are dependent upon one of each other and it's differential because our outcome,

545
01:11:12,530 --> 01:11:20,940
true dementia is affecting our measurement error. So this is supposed to depict both imperfect recall.

546
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:26,810
Right. Which is this up here and recall bias occurring.

547
01:11:31,890 --> 01:11:41,710
Or. So what's the distinction between Dag nine and DAG 11?

548
01:11:48,990 --> 01:11:59,299
Same thing, right? Like nine independent or that 11 now is dependent because we've basically added this on this imperfect retrospective recall,

549
01:11:59,300 --> 01:12:07,470
the patient's medical history. So here we have both imperfect recall and medical surveillance bias operating.

550
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:24,380
And how would we classify the information bias in DAC 11 differential non differential differential and dependent or non independent?

551
01:12:26,580 --> 01:12:33,299
Dependent. Yeah. All right. So, summary deck six is independent.

552
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:39,330
Non differential fact seven is dependent on differential drag.

553
01:12:39,330 --> 01:12:42,470
Eight and nine are independent differential and drag.

554
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:48,000
Ten and 11 independent differential. Um, why does it matter?

555
01:12:48,180 --> 01:12:55,050
What? What do we care about this classification scheme? The structure of the measurement error determines the methods that are used to overcome it.

556
01:12:55,530 --> 01:12:58,590
Independent non differential is really going to be the easiest to fix.

557
01:12:58,860 --> 01:13:01,560
Independent differential is just the most difficult to measure.

558
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:14,970
So in addition to measuring our outcome in our exposure, of course we can also measure our confounders and our other variables.

559
01:13:15,660 --> 01:13:22,650
Um, so here we've gone back, we've got a lack of health insurance leading to diabetes, and then we've got this confounder.

560
01:13:24,030 --> 01:13:27,810
Yes. Um, let's say we don't have.

561
01:13:28,930 --> 01:13:32,409
Oops. Expert.

562
01:13:32,410 --> 01:13:44,890
Instead, we have parental educational attainment and it's being used here, as you could call it, either a surrogate confounder or as a proxy.

563
01:13:46,030 --> 01:13:50,530
Right. SRS is already kind of a proxy so that we can have a proxy of a proxy.

564
01:13:51,130 --> 01:14:06,880
But there you go. Okay. So should w start here, parental education attainment be adjusted for even though it's not on the causal path?

565
01:14:08,970 --> 01:14:19,560
What do we think? Can we just for parental educational attainment or not for something that's assuming we don't have as yes.

566
01:14:19,570 --> 01:14:36,170
As this is unmeasured. I'm sorry. That should have a you. But we just thought, yeah, we would adjust for the term we'd use to describe Debbie here.

567
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:40,980
Parental education attainment, as I already said, surrogate confounder or a proxy.

568
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:48,100
So here we go. We're going to adjust for Star.

569
01:14:52,020 --> 01:14:55,320
What can this be thought of? This is an information bias.

570
01:14:58,710 --> 01:15:03,570
But what does it result in? Yeah. You have residual confounding, right?

571
01:15:03,570 --> 01:15:09,660
Because we've only adjusted for part of the effect of X. So if we had W, we conditioned on it.

572
01:15:10,110 --> 01:15:17,400
But in this particular example, all we have is w start a mis measured version or partial measure of w.

573
01:15:17,820 --> 01:15:23,850
So conditioning on w star does not solve our problem or lead to marginal exchange ability.

574
01:15:24,660 --> 01:15:30,600
We still have suffer from some measurement or information bias and really kind of results in residual confounding here.

575
01:15:34,870 --> 01:15:42,040
So this research, you can also view it as a problem of residual compounding due to having W star as a surrogate.

576
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:51,370
Confounder doesn't really make a practical difference as both cases still lead to a information bias.

577
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:59,730
So for surrogate confounders. Proxies for hard to measure variables like sex or called surrogates.

578
01:16:00,630 --> 01:16:02,520
The question always comes up should we adjust for them?

579
01:16:03,990 --> 01:16:09,150
We have a star here is not on the causal pathway so there's no confounding in that example by W Star.

580
01:16:09,930 --> 01:16:14,180
However, since W and W Star are clearly associated,

581
01:16:15,030 --> 01:16:25,320
adjusting for W Star may partially or indirectly adjust for the confounding effect of W and the way,

582
01:16:25,350 --> 01:16:28,709
you know, the way I would think of this is kind of by adjusting for W Star,

583
01:16:28,710 --> 01:16:36,870
you're adjusting for part of the effect of w how much of the effect of W really depends on how closely related those two variables are,

584
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:49,690
how closely correlated they're for that world. I'm unclear why the error doesn't go from w star to us and doesn't matter.

585
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:57,720
Um. It doesn't really matter.

586
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:09,090
So I guess it depends on when what when you're looking at sex versus parental education attainment.

587
01:17:09,310 --> 01:17:12,930
Uh huh. Um. I think that part is.

588
01:17:12,930 --> 01:17:23,430
Always has to be. Yeah.

589
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:32,530
This whole discussion. Uh huh. So that's the version of the Prop zero.

590
01:17:32,740 --> 01:17:39,790
Mm hmm. But, yeah, I don't think they always have to be sentenced, but let me think about that a little bit more.

591
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:40,840
But, yeah, I agree.

592
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:52,090
The the arrow probably should be parental education attainment going into um, ex we were talking about how it's wrong to adjust for that.

593
01:17:53,650 --> 01:17:57,460
Wonder if you can adjust for the of collider.

594
01:17:58,030 --> 01:18:02,859
So like it's not technically off but this isn't a collider.

595
01:18:02,860 --> 01:18:14,130
This is a confounder. Right? Right. But the idea of why we should adjust to this was like this.

596
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:24,230
Before I start, because it's about the. Yes.

597
01:18:24,830 --> 01:18:30,340
Right. So it was instead that we started closing.

598
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:39,880
You know, you just heard w I mean, when you adjust for something that happens before, it doesn't actually.

599
01:18:42,450 --> 01:18:50,580
I was still adjusting for I would say it would still be adjusting for part of what happened after.

600
01:18:53,940 --> 01:18:57,360
But you're right. Yeah. The will change.

601
01:18:57,360 --> 01:19:02,130
This will fix the error so that it is downward. And I'm going to think about the conversation a little bit more.

602
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:07,340
Right. You have it coming up?

603
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:12,110
Mm hmm. So.

604
01:19:12,650 --> 01:19:21,290
Okay, we're saying. Okay, okay. But you're saying if parental educational attainment came before determining X,

605
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:27,450
then you wouldn't adjust for parental education attainment, but it would be really closely correlated.

606
01:19:27,450 --> 01:19:36,990
So with that, yes. Yeah. So I don't know all of these percentages of whatever you're trying to get us.

607
01:19:38,390 --> 01:19:42,740
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So, yeah. So this is correct. We won't we will leave it.

608
01:19:42,740 --> 01:19:50,270
But I, I'm going to I'm going to think about that one a little bit more because I still think technically you would still be adjusting for part of it.

609
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:54,860
But maybe it's a no. No, I was saying. But you had a whole thing about this.

610
01:19:55,720 --> 01:20:04,260
I think it's very. So they were it apart on the other side.

611
01:20:04,470 --> 01:20:08,120
Well, the doors taken apart inside side, but they said they should be done.

612
01:20:08,730 --> 01:20:13,260
Okay. Um. Okay.

613
01:20:17,780 --> 01:20:21,020
Okay. So sorry, confounders.

614
01:20:21,350 --> 01:20:28,470
So if we imagine a situation where w star is equal to w minus one, so they are perfectly correlated, right?

615
01:20:29,540 --> 01:20:36,589
They're not equal to each other, but perfectly correlated. The same degree of variation exists in W also exists in W as stars.

616
01:20:36,590 --> 01:20:45,680
So therefore conditioning on W star is as if we had conditioned on W, which is kind of what I was mentioning a little bit like if it's perfectly,

617
01:20:45,680 --> 01:20:53,690
if it's, if it's measurement error, but it's the perfect kind of same measurement error shouldn't matter.

618
01:20:53,690 --> 01:21:01,700
It does depend on what sort of analysis you're doing a little bit though. But can you think about like like a play that a 2 to 1?

619
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:10,870
Mm hmm. Like this is like the scenario of not being just for a year left with association presented y so it doesn't actually just write.

620
01:21:12,150 --> 01:21:19,980
Right. It doesn't matter at all because families will process and is usually a mediator.

621
01:21:20,490 --> 01:21:25,500
Right. I'm going to look. I think we would to do it.

622
01:21:26,250 --> 01:21:33,090
So we're talking about at least that is what you're saying, is that we saw opponents of you saying,

623
01:21:33,090 --> 01:21:41,550
but what if you think about it and why does a single dad aim to provide evidence for a witness?

624
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:43,690
No, I agree with you on that. Yeah. Yeah.

625
01:21:44,550 --> 01:21:54,840
So and the reason is because like the I mean, put it into a reflection and you put a is further away from trying.

626
01:21:55,140 --> 01:22:03,299
You're left with the relationship between them and why, whereas it's never I agree with you on that.

627
01:22:03,300 --> 01:22:06,810
But like, I'm still not convinced. You're still up with that sort of fact.

628
01:22:06,850 --> 01:22:12,899
Right. I, I agree. But would it I guess the question is whether we can call it possibly.

629
01:22:12,900 --> 01:22:15,360
But would it be better to address for it or not at all?

630
01:22:16,290 --> 01:22:22,050
If there's solid if it's still there's a good amount of correlation and you don't have that variable that you would like to do,

631
01:22:22,530 --> 01:22:24,389
is it the different like for the proxy variables?

632
01:22:24,390 --> 01:22:31,070
We're just measuring another variables, but I'm saying cause each other we're just saying the correlated so it doesn't normally.

633
01:22:31,070 --> 01:22:40,530
Yes but she but but we are saying for the for the gag rule and eight or this wasn't really tornado we

634
01:22:40,530 --> 01:22:47,320
were just we were all the same just I have some of the same guys like why is it wrong why do you like.

635
01:22:47,340 --> 01:22:56,250
I don't yeah. I don't think it's wrong, but. I'm going to read a few people, go back and read a few papers.

636
01:22:56,260 --> 01:23:00,640
I still think they still think it's just that it's correlated and it doesn't matter.

637
01:23:00,790 --> 01:23:03,850
And in a way, I mean, it matters a bit, I think.

638
01:23:04,270 --> 01:23:09,129
I think it's still going to matter a little bit like how much how far away from

639
01:23:09,130 --> 01:23:13,630
the true causal relationship are going to be potentially if it's a descendant or.

640
01:23:14,770 --> 01:23:20,319
Yeah, or a parent. But I still think you're better off measuring it.

641
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:24,070
I would still call it a proxy, but this is the we start with one.

642
01:23:24,580 --> 01:23:36,070
Yes, in the dog involved. Then adjusting for it will be the exact same as like getting the direct association between W and Y N.W.A.

643
01:23:36,490 --> 01:23:39,690
Right. Like it would still have a confounding relationship with him.

644
01:23:41,380 --> 01:23:49,490
Because, I mean. No, because you're partially adjusting for W so you don't have a name for like and Y, right?

645
01:23:49,510 --> 01:23:56,170
The same. It's like if you does for a and y situation, you're not in the air at all.

646
01:23:56,590 --> 01:24:04,620
We're just you're just saying no. Agreed. But it's this is a mediator and it determines if like you may be adjusting.

647
01:24:04,630 --> 01:24:15,220
Like, I mean, it depends on what else is going into that mediator or what cause it is, you know, like there are other ones.

648
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:21,880
So these are important, you know, even that we would be easier in this scenario between them and y, right?

649
01:24:22,450 --> 01:24:27,950
So. It's not saying that parental education causes this.

650
01:24:27,950 --> 01:24:34,010
Yes, it's just saying it's proxy for speech and causing a proxy.

651
01:24:34,190 --> 01:24:39,210
You'll still have a residual confounding for sure, but that's just like the is likely to measure.

652
01:24:40,010 --> 01:24:45,500
No, I agree. I mean, it is possible that all the proxy.

653
01:24:45,620 --> 01:24:51,290
So I think you can like write the same thing.

654
01:24:51,290 --> 01:24:57,269
But instead of having us there, yes, you're going to say it's parental education attainment because that's just like how you're measuring essays,

655
01:24:57,270 --> 01:25:01,090
which was just like showing you that like to measure assessment.

656
01:25:01,370 --> 01:25:03,230
But. But you would. But you wouldn't. Yeah. No.

657
01:25:03,650 --> 01:25:11,450
Yeah, but you would still you would still want to put X like what you're really wanting to measure, which is still like a proxy for many other things.

658
01:25:11,450 --> 01:25:21,050
Right? Like, so there's that as well. Like, like you want to think about what the effect of you not actually having the measurement that you want has.

659
01:25:21,350 --> 01:25:25,580
So when you draw the dag of what you did, yes, you're going to put parental education there.

660
01:25:25,880 --> 01:25:38,120
But when you're thinking about the information bias that you're going to have, you you want to have your unmeasured SS here.

661
01:25:38,270 --> 01:25:49,190
Right. As well as I have one slightly different question, which is if we understand parental education to be a proxy of us,

662
01:25:49,610 --> 01:25:59,210
why are there no arrows from the proxy to the exposure outcome like we're where we don't think that parental education

663
01:25:59,270 --> 01:26:06,230
attainment I guess you could argue that it does cause a lack of health insurance directly based on the on the job.

664
01:26:06,950 --> 01:26:11,480
Right. But we don't have that in this, Dag. It's not in the the example.

665
01:26:13,250 --> 01:26:17,270
I mean, I also try to make these examples a little bit simpler.

666
01:26:17,290 --> 01:26:23,029
Like, I mean, most of the time dogs have they get quite complicated, right, a lot of the time.

667
01:26:23,030 --> 01:26:28,430
So it does depend on your question, though. I actually find that often people make them more complicated than they need to be.

668
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:37,340
So, yeah, you're you're you're nodding. You're like, but yeah, but yeah, I mean, you could certainly like yeah.

669
01:26:37,340 --> 01:26:40,400
Then you would have a direct impact on.

670
01:26:44,470 --> 01:26:49,840
On lack of health insurance, assuming that parental educational attainment happened here first.

671
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:57,880
All right. So proxies for hard to measure variables like this are called surrogates.

672
01:26:58,630 --> 01:27:02,680
Should we adjust for them? We're saying yes, we should adjust for them.

673
01:27:02,680 --> 01:27:12,370
But when we adjust for them, we have to be extremely aware of the fact that we are not adjusting for that actual measurement, right.

674
01:27:12,370 --> 01:27:18,610
Where we're adjusting for some part of what we truly like to adjust for.

675
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:25,540
Okay. I should have probably had to take a break.

676
01:27:25,560 --> 01:27:31,200
I thought we were going to finish a little earlier. At this point, we are almost done, so I'm just going to continue to power through.

677
01:27:31,290 --> 01:27:35,400
But it lets people. Does anybody really need a break? We could take like a five minute break.

678
01:27:36,420 --> 01:27:42,090
Okay. Confounding measurement, error and unmeasured factors.

679
01:27:43,350 --> 01:27:49,590
So here we've got symptoms causing us to take a drug, and then we have side effects.

680
01:27:50,430 --> 01:27:55,680
Right? And then we have the symptoms that the patients report to the doctor.

681
01:27:56,550 --> 01:27:59,550
Right? Because you don't always remember to report all your symptoms.

682
01:28:00,460 --> 01:28:07,950
Um, and we have underlying genetics.

683
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:13,080
Underlying genetics will be related to symptoms and also to side effects here.

684
01:28:14,850 --> 01:28:19,559
So the question is here, what do we want to adjust for?

685
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:29,010
S star the symptoms reported to the patients if s is not a confounder.

686
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:55,340
So what do you think? I remember wanting to go look at the effects of the drug.

687
01:28:55,590 --> 01:29:43,650
On why. Right.

688
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:49,670
So se here is not a confounder, but it's part of you's confounding path.

689
01:29:49,680 --> 01:29:54,600
It does depend a little bit on this situation. I will admit what you would end up doing in the end.

690
01:29:56,820 --> 01:30:00,480
But here it's not a confounder right.

691
01:30:04,350 --> 01:30:09,390
But it is you can get through a backdoor path here. So you would want to adjust for that.

692
01:30:09,690 --> 01:30:12,569
There is a little bit of a question which I think is going to come up of like, well,

693
01:30:12,570 --> 01:30:16,710
what if this is like an asthma drug and you're only taking the drug when you have the symptoms, right?

694
01:30:17,970 --> 01:30:25,680
Then it gets a lot more complicated with the type of analysis that you would end up doing to deal with it.

695
01:30:25,680 --> 01:30:30,540
But I'll assume that is that is not the case here for this step.

696
01:30:32,970 --> 01:30:37,050
Or would you still want to commission on a star for that?

697
01:30:38,490 --> 01:30:41,850
So you're going to have to be I mean,

698
01:30:43,050 --> 01:30:48,720
you'd probably do some sort of like some sort of causal analysis or IPG w because what

699
01:30:48,720 --> 01:30:53,140
you want to do is like it depends on like you're looking at like this asthma drug.

700
01:30:53,140 --> 01:30:54,680
What does it really improve?

701
01:30:54,690 --> 01:31:03,870
It's a little bit related to your question, I think, that you were interested in as well with suicide and taking particular drugs.

702
01:31:03,870 --> 01:31:12,270
Right. But anyways, for at for asthma, what you could do is like sometimes people would use their inhalers even if they don't have the symptoms.

703
01:31:12,570 --> 01:31:19,440
So there are ways to do a causal analysis and we would turn to a causal analysis for that.

704
01:31:19,530 --> 01:31:25,530
But this this DAG could represent that, but it's not what it's meant to represent.

705
01:31:25,530 --> 01:31:31,920
Here you have the symptoms and symptoms patients on those measures.

706
01:31:33,090 --> 01:31:39,720
In this particular case, we don't have symptoms. And in each case, when we're looking at this kind of like this se or whatever star,

707
01:31:39,930 --> 01:31:43,110
we're saying that we don't have the real measurement that we'd like to have.

708
01:31:44,220 --> 01:31:50,820
And, and so we only have this other measurement, which is a proxy or a surrogate for.

709
01:31:51,240 --> 01:31:56,910
So when you say your conditioning chart that we would condition on s star.

710
01:31:57,200 --> 01:32:00,410
Okay. Sorry, I thought we said sorry.

711
01:32:00,420 --> 01:32:03,630
I might have said conditional on, but I'm a conditional star.

712
01:32:04,440 --> 01:32:09,450
But it does depend a little bit on what drug this is and what symptoms they are

713
01:32:09,450 --> 01:32:12,810
and whether the symptoms how the symptoms are causing you to take the drug.

714
01:32:13,680 --> 01:32:17,640
And if it's something that is more time limited than it gets, it gets more complicated.

715
01:32:18,090 --> 01:32:25,440
All right. But in this case, we would condition it because it's part of U.S. compounding path.

716
01:32:26,580 --> 01:32:31,620
All right. So Miss Measure, Ms. Measured colliders can also be an issue, right?

717
01:32:32,070 --> 01:32:37,530
So here we've got a key.

718
01:32:37,530 --> 01:32:41,880
Here is a collider. Probably draw that one a little bit better.

719
01:32:42,540 --> 01:32:48,660
But and we're going to condition on his star which is a miss measured.

720
01:32:49,390 --> 01:32:52,590
Collider So conditioning on a miss measure.

721
01:32:52,590 --> 01:33:03,690
Collider still leads to selection bias because see Star is a descendant of C diagonal six which means see stars is a common effect of and Y.

722
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:11,220
So here we'll have both selection bias and information bias present,

723
01:33:13,830 --> 01:33:20,730
although one would note that even if these are perfectly correlated and then you conditioned on it, you would still be inducing selection bias.

724
01:33:20,740 --> 01:33:29,130
Right? We don't want to condition on a collider. All right.

725
01:33:30,440 --> 01:33:35,910
So that was actually the end of the dog lecture.

726
01:33:35,930 --> 01:33:40,550
Are there any questions other than the proxy question, which I'm going to look up?

727
01:33:42,740 --> 01:33:43,390
Later.

728
01:33:44,150 --> 01:33:53,660
The last slide here has all of the kind of different sources for a bunch of those tags if you want to kind of dig into them in more more detail.

729
01:33:57,890 --> 01:34:00,260
Right. If there are no questions, then.
