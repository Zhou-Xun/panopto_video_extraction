00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:11,550
Can you remember the last time you were thirsty? What do you have to drink?

2
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:17,970
For many of the more fortunate among us, these thoughts do not matter much beyond taste or dietary considerations.

3
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:23,730
But for those impacted by drought, there is anxiety about where that water will come from.

4
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:33,930
This has impacted South Africa as a whole. More than four in the past decades, there have been multi-year drops throughout regions of the country,

5
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:42,150
with dam levels below 50 percent in the Eastern Cape and the dreaded day zero facing Cape Town in 2018.

6
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,010
Climate change is estimated to tripling.

7
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:55,050
The likelihood of drought to occur in the coming decades are predicted to become hotter and likely drier and will be.

8
00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:00,750
Climate change will be an increasingly important factor in water governance in Cape Town.

9
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:08,940
The recent drought threaten the water supply of four million residents, with many of whom lived, many of whom live within the city's sprawling,

10
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:15,840
informal settlements, where access to water services is much more unreliable than in more affluent areas.

11
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:24,570
The recent drought affected some communities in the province so badly that they resorted to buying water or drinking it with animals of rivers.

12
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:30,600
This is an issue of environmental justice, as these informal settlements are built on the legacy of apartheid,

13
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,500
which moved hundreds of thousands of colored and black kryptonians to inferior

14
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:39,630
housing in low lying areas prone to flooding and with limited access to water,

15
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:49,230
sanitation and other services. Since the political reformation of 1994, policies have aimed to promote water justice for all citizens.

16
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:58,050
But municipalities such as Cape Town have struggled with implementation, especially in rapidly growing informal settlements.

17
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:04,500
Water scarcity is an issue causes people to go hungry, to be unable to watch or to feed crops.

18
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:09,510
Inadequate sanitation is a problem that can lead to deadly diarrheal diseases,

19
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:18,210
including cholera and typhoid fever and other water borne illnesses in developing resilience towards climate change and future impending droughts.

20
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:26,640
South African government needs to work hand-in-hand with these townships and informal communities to ensure equitable access to water.

21
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:36,510
The issue of surface water has been known for years, and steps moving forward need to evaluate the potential crisis of future water scarcity and

22
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:42,180
include investing in infrastructure for groundwater or even investing in desalination.

23
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:48,030
So this latter option is cost prohibitive. We need to begin taking these steps.

24
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:55,470
Moreover, water access can be improved through programs that convert these informal settlements into regular homes,

25
00:02:55,470 --> 00:03:01,350
which requires both funding mechanisms and technical innovations in the area.

26
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:15,712
However, working together and working with these communities is goals and trajectories are possible to ensure a future with water justice.
