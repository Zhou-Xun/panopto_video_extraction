1
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:16,170
And so I started using it.

2
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:23,190
Everyone is doing it. You go to the opaque names on some names.

3
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:30,089
Now I decided that the weather is pretty nice.

4
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:35,070
And there's no sun, but no great hope.

5
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,240
You had a good time. Great.

6
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:50,670
Sorry. That's coming up. I wish I was there, but I have the flu shot at the start of both shots.

7
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,060
I didn't with it. No, no, I got to find out.

8
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:02,280
Okay, so let's get started before class. Just want to mention that the study group has been on.

9
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:13,310
So if you are signed up for a study group or you should or you will be contacted by the facilitator, so you have a chance.

10
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:23,639
Many of you have sign up, which is good. So if you don't receive email from your facilitator, make sure you email Nicole or no, the facilitator.

11
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,510
Just email the facilitator, direct the scheduling meetings.

12
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:33,480
Hopefully you will provide for help for your homework questions.

13
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:40,890
Thank you. Homework? Who is you on Thursday?

14
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:48,280
Yeah. What is the quarterly? Yeah.

15
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:52,200
So last time we talk about a conditional probability on independence.

16
00:01:52,200 --> 00:02:02,009
So today, let's start with a couple of examples and then talk about the conditional independence and then start a new topic on rhinovirus,

17
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:05,310
which is going to be the foundation of the remaining of the semester.

18
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:13,270
So let's first look at this breast cancer screening example,

19
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:23,280
which is a very typical example where you can say how it's used and there's in all probability, you got some useful information from this stuff.

20
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:35,740
Is that a problem? So the set up is as follows A women aged 40 to 65, the prominence rate of breast cancer is one 6 to 7 out of ten per 100,000.

21
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:42,580
Suppose a woman receive a mammogram and a physical exam if the task is positive.

22
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:47,410
How does this change the probability of having cancer?

23
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:56,950
By other words, what is the probability of this particular woman who has a positive result having breast cancer?

24
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:01,630
Similarly, we can ask the question of if the test is negative.

25
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:06,760
Now, what is the probability of the particular individual having breast cancer?

26
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:16,210
So we need to make a few more assumptions before we can actually calculate this probability.

27
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,820
To make this clearer, let's make some notations first.

28
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:29,050
Let's then know this C as the event of cancer and the state bar to be the complement of that event.

29
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:37,090
The other words, the event of no cancer and the positive and active means the outcome of the of the exam.

30
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:43,180
And furthermore, with this notations, we can then note the sensitivity and specificity of the test.

31
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:50,560
In other words, if an individual has cancer, what is the probability that the task will be positive?

32
00:03:51,250 --> 00:04:11,000
That's called the sensitivity. If you're familiar with the hypothesis testing, then you know that in practice, what do we care about?

33
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:18,050
You typically put in the alternative hypotheses and what we do.

34
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:21,950
What we want to reject is in the null hypothesis.

35
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:30,090
So if you want to test whether a particular individual has cancer or not, typically where within node are the events of node cancer,

36
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:36,830
the null hypothesis and the event of cancer as the alternative hypothesis.

37
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:45,260
So essentially what this tells us is the probability of having a positive test under the.

38
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:55,150
Under the alternative hypothesis, which is also known as the one minus the time to error.

39
00:04:55,690 --> 00:05:08,670
By other words, the power of the past. But this is equivalent to the sensitivity of this specific city, given the individual does not have cancer.

40
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:18,120
What's the probability of having a negative result? That's the probability of a negative result, given it's under the null hypothesis.

41
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:22,850
And that's caused one type one error to one minus the type one our.

42
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:28,030
Right, because type one remains under the null hypothesis.

43
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:34,510
What's the probability that the original the null hypothesis is rejected?

44
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:42,990
The words under the null. What's the probability of a positive result so that the result is this one minus the top?

45
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:49,960
Whatever. You will learn more about this when you learn about this task.

46
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:58,660
But just to put this in perspective, so assume this two numbers, one nine for sensitivity and point 99 for specificity.

47
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:03,310
Now, the question is, did an individual has positive results?

48
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:07,600
What is the probability of having cancer? Who's our notation?

49
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:12,190
We want to know what is the probability of C given positive.

50
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:17,890
And we also want to know if the individual have negative results.

51
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:21,460
What is the probability of having of not having cancer?

52
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:25,640
In other words, the probability of this CFR event inactive.

53
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:36,160
So why don't we take a few minutes, maybe 2 minutes, using what you have learned from last class and the conditional probability that there are?

54
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:43,270
Try to use the information that you have from this problem to calculate this two quantities.

55
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:51,580
I need to write down the formulas used to calculate response by yourself.

56
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:38,730
All right. So let's look at this problem together. I hope you have already at least write down the formula for this calculation.

57
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:43,530
So first of all, let's look kind of what do we know from this question?

58
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:49,580
There are three numbers that really matters in this calculation, right?

59
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,030
Of course, the first two, the sensitivity and specifically specificity,

60
00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:01,380
which tells us the probability of having a positive or negative result given cancer or no cancer.

61
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:08,610
But those two are not really useful for me. I need to come up with a probability of interest know.

62
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:13,800
So we need to know what is that? How do we translate this?

63
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,220
The prevalence rate of breast cancer be this number.

64
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:25,030
What is that? What is the prevalence rate of breast cancer in terms of our notation?

65
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:37,890
Yeah, it's probably very good that the marginal probability of to see this event rate in the general population,

66
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:40,390
what is the probability of having breast cancer?

67
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:49,090
Or in other words, in this particular population, women aged 40 to 65, what is the probability of having cancer?

68
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:58,000
So that's exactly possible. So with those three numbers, now we can use the bathroom.

69
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:03,250
The reason why we want to use Bayes theorem is if you look at what's inside this parentheses,

70
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:06,880
it's essentially a switch of order between the two sets of events.

71
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:16,030
Right. We know the positive or not, they've given us the r c complement and we really after is cause they complement have a positive or inactive.

72
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:24,069
So it's really a switch of order. And we have talk about if we want to calculate the probability of a conditional probability by switching,

73
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:28,180
the order based theorem is the one that we need to use.

74
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:36,219
Okay. So let's take a look at the conditional probability of cancer given positive task.

75
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:50,950
First, by being there, we know that's equal to a positive given cancer times, you know, as divided by the positive test.

76
00:10:52,060 --> 00:11:03,700
Right. And the more we can rewrite the bottom part using the total probability neurons which give us the positive cancer and the.

77
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:24,350
I hope you all got here. And now we can take a look at this formula and see whether we do have these numbers or not.

78
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:29,200
So the first quantitate, the P positive given cancer.

79
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:34,460
In other words, the probability of having a positive result given that subject has cancer.

80
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:39,530
We know that. Right? That's exactly our sensitivity.

81
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:45,110
So this number we do have and these probability of cancer is the just the prevalence rate.

82
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:50,090
We also have that number. What about this one?

83
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:54,560
The probability of a positive result given there's no cancer.

84
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:12,800
We know this number. Not directly, but we do know is complement because we know the probability of maximum result given there's no cancer,

85
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,500
which is our sensitivity and specificity.

86
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:28,430
So as say these quantity P positive given C bar is essentially just one of the complement of inactive given C bar.

87
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:34,550
They can gain this number by doing one minus this conditional probability.

88
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:42,100
And then you also have this number. Similarly, PC bar is just a one minus p c because the ANSI bar, they are complementary.

89
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:48,800
But the now we have all these numbers and all we need to do is to plug in those numbers and to calculate it.

90
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:54,440
And I gave you the probability of cancer, given it's a positive test.

91
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:59,450
Okay. After the calculation, you can end up with the number being.

92
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:10,510
.194. Similarly, you can calculate the probability of an event.

93
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:16,740
There is a negative test which is 0.000.

94
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:29,140
To clarify this result afterwards, so just tells us the conditional probability of actually having cancer given the test result,

95
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:38,020
whether it's positive or negative. Apparently, if it's positive as a result, you've got a higher chance of actually having cancer.

96
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:43,110
But the number itself is not that high.

97
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:46,739
The other words, even if you got a positive result in this particular scenario,

98
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:51,870
it means even if you got a positive result, there's still a good chance that you don't actually have cancer.

99
00:13:53,070 --> 00:14:02,570
Right. So. The probability of having cancer with the positive result is only 19.4%.

100
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:09,410
And if you get a negative result, then most likely that you don't have cancer.

101
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:17,150
That's what this has is particularly designed this way so that we won't have a lot of false positives.

102
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:25,580
Because if I don't, especially in this scenario, if I don't want to receive a lot of false alarm statements, just make people anxious.

103
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:31,610
So people particularly design the testing this way so that it has the control.

104
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:38,030
Disperse efficiency in control, false positive risk. So.

105
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:44,609
This particular this particular setting is very common in practice,

106
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:50,520
and it's actually associated with the literature on the theory of screening for chronic disease.

107
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:59,640
So using these quantities, you can calculate the prevalence rate of a particular disease, which typically is considered as a prior inflammation.

108
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:06,210
I got that from either your view or from the large survey for the general population.

109
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:10,850
And what we are very interested in is, given the data right,

110
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:17,580
this task result is essentially our data or a particular individual or a particular group.

111
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,060
What is the probability of that event? So that's exactly the utility of the.

112
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:31,200
And we know the prior we know under the prior ANR that no matter the alternative, what is the probability of the data?

113
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:41,400
But what we're really interested in is, given the data, what is the probability of the event as exactly the setting for the patient statistics and.

114
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:54,740
Any question. So let's look at another example lung cancer and smoking.

115
00:15:55,670 --> 00:16:04,790
Consider a hypothetical experiment where subjects are randomized into two groups one that smoked heavily daily, and the other that's a normal.

116
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:10,160
And the subjects are randomly assigned into these two groups.

117
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:19,580
But this is a hypothetical experiment and notation wise, we use E to denote the group that is smoking.

118
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,940
And you complimented, you know, the group that is not smoking.

119
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:33,320
And we follow up with this with these two groups of individuals and see whether they develop lung cancer or not in the end.

120
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:40,430
In particular, we use these, as we know, lung cancer and the bar to denote no lung cancer.

121
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:50,030
Then the question of interest is whether they are independent, whether smoking is independent of developing lung cancer.

122
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:58,560
So that's the way this is. This is a plausible design, right?

123
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:07,460
We randomize people into these two groups, heavy smokers and non smokers, and then follow up to say whether they develop lung cancer,

124
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:16,460
if a lot of the smokers actually do about lung cancer and very few nonsmokers develop lung cancer,

125
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:20,540
we know there is a association between those two events.

126
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:32,260
Otherwise maybe they are independent. So it's a obviously conceptually it's a plausible dialog design, right,

127
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:37,280
to put it mathematically, essentially, in order to test whether these two are independent.

128
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:45,980
We can follow the definition. We can verify whether the conditional probability of lung cancer giving smoking

129
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:51,830
is equal to the general probability or marginal probability of a lung cancer.

130
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:58,580
If this equality hosted, then we can conclude the two are independent.

131
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:06,800
That's our definition of independence, and that's the idea behind this hypothetical experiment.

132
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:11,620
Practical way to think of this experiment is if.

133
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:21,930
Is that good design or bad design? Yes.

134
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:26,390
It's just collecting data because we don't have the true probabilities.

135
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,760
You don't have true probabilities. We only have our estimates from the data.

136
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,840
We're not going to see independence without hypothesis testing.

137
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:45,450
You know, we we all have observed data, but the statistics is all about, you know, making an inference from this observed data.

138
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:52,110
So even without the actual the true probability, we can still use the observed data to make the numbers.

139
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:58,010
That's why we need to do all this testing. And haphazard testing is not always 100% sure.

140
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:02,340
We always allow some degree of time, one hour and 2 hours.

141
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:06,540
So that that part is fine. So we can use data.

142
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:12,750
Use observed data. Use a small sample to make sure that part is fine.

143
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:18,060
But in general, about this study design, about randomizing patients into two groups.

144
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:24,090
Follow up with them and say, why did they develop cancer? To test this this independent.

145
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:29,300
Is it a good design or a bad design? Yes, I don't think it is.

146
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:32,850
But you can't randomly assign people to a smoking group in a nonsmoker.

147
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:40,830
That's a good point. So first. Well, I think we can agree that this is not may not be the best design.

148
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:44,490
So why reason is that you cannot force people to smoke.

149
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:50,670
Right. So that apparently is not a practical way to design our experiment.

150
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:54,570
So that's one thing that doesn't really work well.

151
00:19:55,410 --> 00:20:00,990
Are there any other things that may go wrong in this experiment design?

152
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:21,480
So the first drawback is that the randomization may not work, right?

153
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:30,390
Yes. In the real world, you talk to all these patients for like 50 years to see if they develop lung cancer.

154
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:36,010
Very good. So lung cancer does not develop in days.

155
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,380
It may take years, even tens of years to develop lung cancer.

156
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:50,080
So if you want to study this, you probably have to wait 20, 30, 50 years in order to have your final results.

157
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:57,450
That's just way too long for a simple experimental design like this.

158
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:03,770
So it's impractical. All right. Very good.

159
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:15,460
Lung cancer. Takes years to develop and fails.

160
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:20,590
Guess what? Just decided to fire.

161
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:27,900
Very, very much. We're about to sign a waiver.

162
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:39,390
That's a good point. The lung cancer may be caused by other factors, not just the smoking versus non smoking,

163
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:45,360
but that is sort of not directly related to this experiment design.

164
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:48,510
Mainly because we randomized the patients in the first place.

165
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:53,180
The reason why we want to randomize is to take care of those our major components.

166
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:57,720
So that part of that equation should have already been taken into account.

167
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:02,729
That is not already a valid reason why this is our view.

168
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:05,910
It is not and other thoughts why this is not a good design.

169
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:15,810
This is the first reason equivalent to like more against the principle of morality.

170
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:23,580
This sort of, yes. So you would not want people to smoke then present and other thoughts.

171
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:35,930
What about the event rate? So lung cancer is not like getting code or something that happens to quite a lot.

172
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:41,450
Right. You make like 100 people. 50 assigned to the smoking group.

173
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:48,140
If they assign to the nonsmoking group. There's a very good chance that nobody asked for it going on cancer.

174
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:58,850
You may you follow up until they all die. The event rate of lung cancer or any type of cancer in the general population actually is extremely low.

175
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:05,950
Right. So that actually is another reason why this is not a good design.

176
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:16,870
If you are experimenting something that has a extremely low event rate,

177
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:22,750
then you are at a very high risk of not observing any event at the end of the study.

178
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:29,120
If no event happens, how could you make inference of whether these two are independent?

179
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:33,230
You don't really observe any event, right?

180
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:36,800
So that's another very major reason why this is not good design.

181
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:47,500
So in order to make it work, you have to maybe like tens of thousands of people and follow them, follow up with them tens of thousands of years.

182
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:51,430
Figure this out. But that's apparently impractical.

183
00:23:51,700 --> 00:24:01,300
So that's why this is definitely not a good design. So is there any other ways to actually study this without going through all this hassle?

184
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:09,150
Yes. Sorry. Is there like a proof of how the event rate being low will occur?

185
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,750
That's more of a prior knowledge.

186
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:24,680
So it's it's not like with the problem, as with the previous example, we know the problem is rate in an advance like the breast cancer.

187
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:32,140
We need to know that information from the literature or from some failed survey in the first place.

188
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:39,220
So we consider that as prior knowledge. Okay. So any thoughts on how to improve this design?

189
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:49,980
So our central goal here is still testing. One of these two are independent and there are other ways to test it.

190
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:58,410
Yes. So I think you start out observing lung cancer from smoking or not smoking.

191
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:08,850
People would select a group of people who are already have and calculate the proper ratio of smokers.

192
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:15,300
Very good. That's essentially what what's called the retrospective study.

193
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:20,760
You will learn more about it in, I believe, 6051 next semester.

194
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:25,440
And here, let's just take a look at why that's the case, why they can also help us.

195
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:30,320
Understand this particular relation between the two.

196
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:38,010
So conceptually, the reason why you can switch the heart between this two is really if you want to, if you forget about the context,

197
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:45,000
just consider these two events, the DNA you are, the two tasks that you order to show that they are independent.

198
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:49,800
Either you can show that p e equal to PD or equivalent.

199
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:55,740
You can show p gave and D is equal to P.

200
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:02,930
It's the same thing, right? Independence does not come in order, so they are interchangeable.

201
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:07,830
And that actually motivates us to think about the alternative design.

202
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,920
Plotting randomly connecting to a group of people, one actually having this condition.

203
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:23,620
In other words, lung cancer. The other do not have. And a retrospective look at their smoking history, whether they are smokers or non smokers.

204
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:30,300
Conceptually, at least at this point, they should also tells us the information that we want to know.

205
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:36,130
Okay. So more specifically, let's take a look at why that's the case.

206
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:43,690
First, let's make some definitions. We define the odds of disease with exposure.

207
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:50,950
So here, exposure means smoking. And disease in our case is just lung cancer.

208
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:58,090
And we define the odds to be that ratio between these two conditional probabilities.

209
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:08,950
In general, all this means if you use high to denote the probability of an event like the probability of an event,

210
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:15,940
then pi over one minus pi, it is typically called the odds.

211
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:24,790
For example, winning the lottery. If your chances y in 100 then y and 100 over nine and I over 100.

212
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:29,500
Now that was one over 99 is called the odds of winning the lottery.

213
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:33,940
So that's just a convention of what?

214
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:39,530
Another way to represent chances or probability of an event.

215
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:47,170
And that's the odds. So the odds of disease given exposure is just the probability of the disease.

216
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:51,670
Given exposure are divided by one minus the probability of disease given exposure.

217
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:56,770
So the denominator can be rewritten as probability.

218
00:27:56,770 --> 00:28:04,640
Now, no disease given the exposure. Then we can plug in the definition or these conditional probabilities.

219
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:14,900
And in particular, if we apply this ban theorem, we can switch the order of this to and it turns out the corresponding terms.

220
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:21,050
We end up with this formula for this odds of disease given exposure.

221
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:35,460
And. So it's the numerator is just that this to the ratio of this to the denominator is the problem that is the ratio of another to probabilities.

222
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:42,300
Similarly, we can define the of disease without exposure in a similar way.

223
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:47,880
So we some calculation you can end up with the formula in the bottom.

224
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:59,130
So now we can take a look at this two quantities. Now we just define because of disease given exposure and the hours of disease without exposure,

225
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:07,770
they are very similar except that the numerator is slightly different, the denominator is the same.

226
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:15,420
So in clinical research, one thing that most clinicians are familiar with is the odds ratio.

227
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:22,980
So again, in 651, you would be about you would learn logistic regression and you will learn what all the ratio is.

228
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:26,790
So all the ratio of the name suggests the ratio of the odds.

229
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:34,050
It tells you something about the probability of event and there's one case versus another case.

230
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:45,010
So in this case and we can calculate the all odds ratio, the O r, the all the ratio of disease with versus without exposure should.

231
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:53,290
If we calculate the odds ratio, then the denominator of the common denominator just cancels out and ends up with this formula.

232
00:29:54,610 --> 00:30:06,580
And so the odds ratio of disease, which is the ratio of lung cancer with or without smoking, is expressed using this formula.

233
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:16,720
And if we take a look at this right hand side, it's the probability of event of exposure, which is smoking.

234
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:29,469
Right. Even lung cancer divided by the probability of nonsmoking given lung cancer divided by the denominator is the probability of smoking,

235
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:33,610
given no lung cancer divided by the probability of non smoking.

236
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,520
No lung cancer. Okay.

237
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:43,800
So this is the odds ratio that we can calculate for disease with or without exposure.

238
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:52,890
So similarly, we can do the other calculation, the odds ratio of smoking with or without disease.

239
00:30:55,170 --> 00:31:02,610
So what do we kind of find? So I'll leave the detailed calculation to you, which should be pretty straightforward.

240
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:11,190
Essentially, just applying this theorem, I wish you can find it's going to be exactly the same as this observation.

241
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:21,930
Okay. So now the ratio of exposure with all without disease is exactly the same as the odds ratio of disease without always without exposure.

242
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:33,090
So what that means is that you can switch the order of these two events, disease versus snow events, disease versus no disease.

243
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:43,709
Exposure versus no exposure without actually changing the quantity of interest with all the ratio and is all the ratio.

244
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:51,330
If it's equal to one, then we can we can show that it actually means these two quantities are independent.

245
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:59,430
So we can show that in a minute. But just want to give you the conclusion first.

246
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:06,420
If they are equal to one, if the ratio is equal to one, that is equivalent to say the two events are independent.

247
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:13,410
So the two arteries are equal. It means you can either pursue from one direction.

248
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:22,410
Namely, you have an exposure. You have a no exposure. Observe whether the subject has disease or not, or you can pursue it from the other direction.

249
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:30,000
Given they have disease, given they do not have disease, whether they have exposure or not, it's the same.

250
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:38,830
But. So that just tells us that we can pursue this problem from a totally different direction.

251
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:52,480
So now let's take a look at why they odds the ratio equal to equal to one means the two events are independent.

252
00:32:55,250 --> 00:33:04,460
Recall that if the exposure which is E and this disease, they are independent.

253
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:12,560
Now we know the probability of the disease given exposure is equal to the probability of the disease

254
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:18,620
and the probability of the disease given no exposure also equal to the probability of the disease.

255
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:23,990
With these two equations, we now we can calculate the ratio.

256
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:37,770
Using the formula from the previous page, you can see that all the ratio is operability.

257
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:42,340
Also on the previous page.

258
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:35,430
So the alteration that we we know from the previous page this p of a given the going to be exactly equal

259
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:42,300
to PRB right and pub bar and given DD is also going to be equal to PRB bar because they are independent.

260
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:50,520
So the denominator is also going to be the same. So the alteration going to be equal to one.

261
00:34:51,360 --> 00:35:01,500
So we have through one direction, namely, if indeed they are independent, then we can conclude they all the ratio is equal to one.

262
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:07,050
All right, the B's complete this direction.

263
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:12,150
Now we have to show the other direction in order to show the prevalence.

264
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:19,230
In other words, we need to show if now is a ratio equal to one, then E is independent of the.

265
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:29,720
So if the odds ratio is equal to one, if you look at again how the ratio is defined,

266
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:35,450
what that means is the numerator is equal to the denominator, right?

267
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:38,450
So if all the ratio equal to one,

268
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:56,630
then we know this ap of e given de divided by p of e bar even p is equal to p of e given the bar divided by P of e bar.

269
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:14,220
Even the bar. What I wrote is just a direct translation of observation to one and one, what they would call this the left hand side.

270
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:25,500
That's the horse, right? That's how we define horse. So they say the odds of each event.

271
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:30,720
Given all of the exposure, given the disease.

272
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:37,230
Right. The right hand side is the odds of exposure given.

273
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:43,440
Nobody thinks of a two horse is equal.

274
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:51,250
Also exposure given disease is equal to the odds of exposure given no disease.

275
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:03,550
But then you need to observe a poverty of the RS function.

276
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:10,480
Recall that all implies a probability as is defined as pi over one minus.

277
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:15,460
Right. Either probability is pi over one minus pi.

278
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:20,890
If you think about this function as a function of the probability,

279
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:36,070
it's essentially a monitored function or any probability from 0 to 1 and translate this are always going to be from from 0 to 1 to infinity.

280
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:41,640
And it's going to be a monotone, 1 to 1 transformation.

281
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:48,440
And it's monotone increasing. In other words, a higher probability always leads to higher odds.

282
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:54,020
There's a 1 to 1 relation between that original probability and this function.

283
00:37:54,440 --> 00:38:03,110
So that tells us if the two all are equal, it means that a line probability that induced those odds are also equal.

284
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:08,240
So that gives us the probability of exposure.

285
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:13,550
Activity is equal to the probability of exposure given the bar.

286
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:27,560
Similarly, you can show that the probability of the given year is equal to the probability of the given bar.

287
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:38,700
All right. And then from there, with some additional stops, you can end up with this independent group.

288
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:43,550
So the gap between here and here, I'll leave it to you.

289
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:49,850
You can try to using what I have learned to show that this actually induce independence.

290
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:58,610
Really? This is the hardest step. And let's start from the RS equal to this probability.

291
00:38:58,610 --> 00:39:05,330
Equal. And that is really because of this that 1 to 1 ratio between a probability and the function.

292
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:12,980
And once you go from the odds to the original probability, the remaining, it's just that we'll follow through.

293
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:18,440
Right. This is incomplete.

294
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:29,000
Okay, so from here to here, I put a question mark here, and I'll help you to fill in the gaps between days after class.

295
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:38,330
So what this tells us is that now we can study this problem from a totally different perspective.

296
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:46,640
Instead of collecting, randomly collecting patients and send them to a smoking group, nonsmoking group and follow up with them.

297
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:52,910
Now we can randomly collect lung cancer patients and know lung cancer.

298
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:58,790
And how is it sometimes and retrospectively look at whether they smoke or not by

299
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:03,650
comparing the proportion of smokers in the lung cancer group and the healthy group.

300
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:16,850
We can make a statistical inference or do a hypothesis testing for this particular hypothesis that smoking and lung cancer are they independent?

301
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:21,740
So that's called the Rachel Spafford study.

302
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:34,910
Any question about this? This example. All right.

303
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:42,200
So the last example that I want to I want to talk about is is about a conditional probability.

304
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,430
And independence is pretty straightforward.

305
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:54,140
Assume that I have two kids. The first question is, if the first one is a girl, what is the probability of the second one being out there on?

306
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:10,240
Yes. Because they're independent.

307
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:16,080
Very good. So they're probably going to be my hope, right?

308
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:26,140
Because conceptually, these two events, the first one being a girl and the second one being a girl should be independent procedures.

309
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:34,840
But of course, if you want to formally test this or if you want to formally justify this, you'll have to go from that definition.

310
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:43,570
Well, there were that in the second record that if we want to say something, something is independent of something else.

311
00:41:43,930 --> 00:41:50,050
We need to follow that definition. We need to calculate the probability of the drawn distribution.

312
00:41:51,010 --> 00:42:01,570
All right. The probability of the intersection of these two events equal to the product of the two separate probabilities only, not those.

313
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:05,830
We can conclude these two are independent. So we're going to do that in a second.

314
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:15,160
So let's take a look at the second question. If one is a girl, what is the probability of the other one?

315
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:19,540
The girl is this girl one one half.

316
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:34,660
Yes. Why? No. Why not? And it's not.

317
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:45,820
I think we'll see after the war. We're still a divided country.

318
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:52,120
First of all, we can give a very long girl English to people.

319
00:42:52,690 --> 00:43:01,110
There's a lot we need to connect, predicts the productivity of the community.

320
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:10,460
It's quite a difference. Well, of course, the other one find those sort of answers.

321
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:21,340
One couple is very good. So this one, the answer is going to be one over three and it's not going to be one over two, and it's one over three.

322
00:43:21,610 --> 00:43:32,920
And now let's take a look at why that's the case. So before we talk about this, we need to write out the sample space before this particular set up.

323
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:36,190
If you have two kids, then there are only four possible ones.

324
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:41,950
All right. Hi there. It's boy. Oh, boy, boy, girl, girl, girl or girl?

325
00:43:41,950 --> 00:43:50,410
Boy. And those four events, those four outcomes, they have equal probability, each one being one over four.

326
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:56,890
So that's the basic setup. So now let's take a take a look at the first question.

327
00:43:57,340 --> 00:44:02,470
Given one girl and the first one is a girl. The probability of a second one.

328
00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:13,960
Once we gave them this event, the original sample space now becomes a much smaller sample space because we already given some condition.

329
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:20,170
Once we gave them this, now the sample space that's denoted by us prime becomes.

330
00:44:22,070 --> 00:44:29,750
Girl, boy and girl girl, because we know the first one has to be a girl.

331
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:38,270
And then from this small space, these two again, this two event, this two outcomes, they have equal probability.

332
00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:46,970
They can take a look at the probability of interest, which is the second one being our girl, which is exactly one case out of these two cases.

333
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:50,270
So that gave you a conditional probability being one.

334
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:58,550
Alternatively, you can also calculate this conditional probability by writing out by using the definition.

335
00:44:58,850 --> 00:45:13,640
Right? So the probability of. Even the first one is a girl.

336
00:45:13,910 --> 00:45:20,950
What's the probability? The second one is a girl. That's equal to the probability of the intersection of this two event.

337
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:25,170
Right. And that means girl.

338
00:45:25,170 --> 00:45:30,829
Girl divided by the probability of this condition.

339
00:45:30,830 --> 00:45:34,730
Which is the first is. Okay.

340
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:39,010
Okay. And now we can calculate the numerator and denominator separately.

341
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:48,950
So the numerator is one over four and the denominator is two over four or one.

342
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:52,140
Hot. All right. That also gave you one.

343
00:45:53,720 --> 00:46:00,830
And in fact, you can calculate the probability of the first being a girl and the second being a girl, both equal to one half.

344
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:10,850
Right. So by definition, these two events should be because of the probability of second being a girl given first,

345
00:46:10,850 --> 00:46:16,340
being a girl is exactly equal to the probability of second child is a girl.

346
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:22,850
So that's the definition. And that's why you have one half in the first problem.

347
00:46:23,410 --> 00:46:30,260
And the second problem is slightly different. Now, if you look at the condition, the condition is a what is a girl?

348
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,020
And we didn't specify which one is it.

349
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:43,700
So if you want to restrict your assemble space or assemble space, it would become we have three possible outcomes by girl or boy.

350
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:52,010
And. Each one of the three possible outcomes all satisfy this condition.

351
00:46:53,450 --> 00:46:57,170
Now, out of these three possible outcomes, the probability,

352
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:04,250
the conditional probability of the other one being a girl, it's just the one event out of the three.

353
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:08,960
That's why you have a probability of one over three, one over three.

354
00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:17,630
Alternatively, again, you can follow that definition and calculate the conditional probability being.

355
00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:26,140
Now there. Well, even one.

356
00:47:28,570 --> 00:47:34,780
It's a girl. So again, the numerator is the intersection of these two events.

357
00:47:36,010 --> 00:47:40,330
The intersection, again, is both our girl. Both are girls.

358
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:47,080
One is a girl. The other is a girl. Being a section is both are girls and the denominator.

359
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:58,160
It's one of the two case. Is a girl.

360
00:47:59,030 --> 00:48:05,600
And that from the original small space, you know, there are three possible outcomes that satisfy that constraint.

361
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:10,610
Right. So that gave you one over four over three or four.

362
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:14,120
Again, one over three. So in a way, you got the same.

363
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:20,600
So we calculate this type of conditional probability. You can go either way.

364
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:24,320
Either you restrict the sample space and do the, you know,

365
00:48:24,650 --> 00:48:31,520
directly counting how many events you have satisfy your condition or you follow

366
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:36,080
the definition and clearly specify what is the intersection of these two events?

367
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:40,790
What is the margin of that of marginal probability of instrument?

368
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:48,110
You should be able to verify that the solution to be the same calculated in both ways.

369
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:54,650
Yes. Question for the second question, why does the border matter?

370
00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:57,290
So like, why is boy girl different from girl?

371
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:08,600
So recall that in our original setup having two ks, not twins, there is a natural order between this two events.

372
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:13,880
So you have this equal probability outcomes for equal probability outcomes.

373
00:49:15,650 --> 00:49:21,470
So is it's a boy girl and a girl boy. They are two events with equal probability.

374
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:25,970
They have the same probability of, you know, girl girl or boy boy.

375
00:49:28,370 --> 00:49:31,970
So those are four possible outcomes of having two kids.

376
00:49:34,410 --> 00:49:42,210
So when you restrict your sample space to one of them being a girl, then you just throw out one positive outcome, which is by a boy.

377
00:49:42,810 --> 00:49:45,510
You still have three possible outcomes.

378
00:49:46,330 --> 00:49:54,120
But since we don't care about the order, they just end up with two piles of outcome either two girls or one boy and one girl.

379
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:59,340
But they do not have equal probability anymore because two, one,

380
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:06,150
two boy only have one third of a probability and a boy and a girl have two thirds of a probability.

381
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:16,320
So in our original setup, when you order these two outcomes, they have equal probability.

382
00:50:16,590 --> 00:50:19,750
When you forget about the order, they do not have equal probabilities.

383
00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:26,070
Okay. And that's the reason why you have a one third of the second problem.

384
00:50:26,370 --> 00:50:30,909
And another question. Okay.

385
00:50:30,910 --> 00:50:42,470
So let's take a break and come back to you.

386
00:50:48,810 --> 00:51:08,650
So we want to take the challenge of preparing like quarterback because it's like, here's another order matter that you didn't like.

387
00:51:09,890 --> 00:51:20,300
And I feel like these students should be like they aren't the same thing as like they're not counted as separate events.

388
00:51:21,070 --> 00:51:25,420
Yeah, you can consider them because that's the case.

389
00:51:26,530 --> 00:51:37,660
You perform with them. And the only reason why I want to write it based on my writing,

390
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:49,090
these are the probabilities on how many possible outcomes and I outcome divided by the total number of outcome.

391
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:55,240
That's the only reason why I write these things.

392
00:51:55,240 --> 00:52:19,840
Doesn't matter is the fact that I think I'm like, I'm not going to make it so you want 60, 76 should be true.

393
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:32,049
67. But you haven't been doing that either.

394
00:52:32,050 --> 00:53:02,730
Not enough to make sure that you're trying to tell me like this because it is monitoring the increase in ideology equal to this count.

395
00:53:03,670 --> 00:53:10,490
Don't think about what you're looking for.

396
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:22,910
And you know what she looks like.

397
00:53:23,470 --> 00:53:37,320
Yeah, that's all it is.

398
00:53:40,850 --> 00:53:45,120
So, I don't know.

399
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:52,600
Think of 330.

400
00:53:59,950 --> 00:54:14,730
He was always hot.

401
00:54:17,990 --> 00:54:29,390
Zero three for the the original the original for Warner Bros.

402
00:54:29,810 --> 00:54:47,670
You're going to have to show you a little bit of your cooking about this date.

403
00:54:49,940 --> 00:55:18,320
These are all things that all the if you apply your function on both sides of the screen, attorneys look at me sympathetically.

404
00:55:25,100 --> 00:56:15,560
You should be surprised to see and this is just I mean, this is a average of six on old and young men don't really want to show you what's going on.

405
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:28,100
You should take a long time.

406
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:34,020
I don't like that.

407
00:56:35,990 --> 00:56:42,960
So that's the issue.

408
00:56:47,150 --> 00:58:00,190
I want to get it's something that we could have just heard about here today, but not all of them.

409
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:16,100
Do you want to tell us about it?

410
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:51,530
I think I should say you because I don't want to make.

411
00:59:00,650 --> 00:59:48,480
When you look at the roughly 75,000 people who joined the beaches.

412
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:57,830
Thank you so much for having me.

413
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:14,090
I think what I'm trying to address tonight is the human condition all in attendance.

414
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:17,540
Listen, I independence.

415
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:26,840
It's very similar to independence in terms of the domination, just with additional constraint, with additional conditions defined as follows.

416
01:00:27,110 --> 01:00:30,439
Two events highly conditional independent of events.

417
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:33,950
See if satisfy the following relationship.

418
01:00:34,370 --> 01:00:42,710
That is, the conditional probability of a intersect with B is equal to the product of this two conditional probabilities.

419
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:47,570
Probability of a given C times. The probability of being given c.

420
01:00:48,230 --> 01:00:59,990
The other word you always conditional upon C and otherwise is exactly the same as how we define independent independence between A and B.

421
01:01:01,340 --> 01:01:04,940
The only difference is you always conditional. All right.

422
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:14,630
So it plays an important role in survival analysis and many applied study, especially if you have heard about graphical models.

423
01:01:15,110 --> 01:01:19,550
When people try to draw the network between a bunch of variables,

424
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:26,300
the one we really care about is not a marginal dependency between features, but rather conditional dependency.

425
01:01:26,690 --> 01:01:33,020
The other word we want to control all the confounding factors that leads to that dependance between two variables.

426
01:01:33,470 --> 01:01:38,720
After controlling everything else, while there are two variables are still still dependent.

427
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:48,890
Not when we care about so there's only independence is very important in practice and the definition is surprisingly very,

428
01:01:50,870 --> 01:01:58,310
very centered, very straightforward, similar to the standard independence.

429
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:09,300
We can also have a equivalent definition for conditional independence similar to the state, or independence namely the probability.

430
01:02:09,810 --> 01:02:18,340
Conditional probability of A, given B and C is equal to the conditional probability of a given C again.

431
01:02:18,370 --> 01:02:19,770
If you forget about this C,

432
01:02:20,490 --> 01:02:30,570
it's the exactly the equivalent definition for independence between the B so all of that matters as we put additional constraint.

433
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:34,860
That is a conditional C, what is the relation between A and B?

434
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:47,910
So two questions, some food for thought. One question is, does independence imply conditional independence to events?

435
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:59,910
And B, if they are independent, marginally independent, can we conclude that they are conditional, conditional, independent given some other events?

436
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:09,680
We always have that conclusion if Amby are independent.

437
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:15,350
What do you think of independence?

438
01:03:16,070 --> 01:03:31,510
Margin of independence imply conditional independence. Yes.

439
01:03:32,550 --> 01:03:38,620
You know, because outside of that sense, see, they could be doing what you want.

440
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:44,580
It's not a statement about any of that. Unconditionally independence.

441
01:03:45,570 --> 01:03:49,140
Yes, very good. So the answer is no.

442
01:03:49,320 --> 01:04:01,710
And the reason? Well, technically speaking, you cannot derive this conditional independence from independence throughout.

443
01:04:02,820 --> 01:04:07,650
Right. Because this additional constraint, additional condition actually makes a difference.

444
01:04:08,430 --> 01:04:26,669
But give me a simple example. Not just consider a very you know, I think in every example where every conditional A, class B,

445
01:04:26,670 --> 01:04:32,940
so later on you will say that if A and B they are random variables, you can always do this type of calculation.

446
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:37,410
That's that's consider a real application.

447
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:44,580
So consider the salary for the husband, a salary if on the line they are mutually independent.

448
01:04:45,060 --> 01:04:53,910
And hypothetically, given the total salary for the household, apparently this still won't be and it won't be independent any more.

449
01:04:55,890 --> 01:05:03,150
Right. So with some constraint, with some additional condition, the two events.

450
01:05:03,180 --> 01:05:06,390
Now originally independent may not be independent anymore.

451
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:16,120
So graphically what that means if you have two events that are separate, but both events contribute to some other event.

452
01:05:16,150 --> 01:05:30,840
See? So this arrow means a modulates C or A, affects the B, affects C, then given C most likely and B won't be any won't be independent anymore.

453
01:05:32,490 --> 01:05:37,500
Like the example that I mentioned as a salary for the husband being the salary for the wife.

454
01:05:37,980 --> 01:05:44,310
C The total salary for the household. The salary for a wife and husband.

455
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:50,490
They can be independent, but given the total salary for the household, they can no longer be independent.

456
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:55,710
That's a that condition. That makes sense.

457
01:05:56,670 --> 01:06:00,630
So that means independence does not imply conditional.

458
01:06:01,770 --> 01:06:05,490
On the other hand, does conditional independence imply independent independence?

459
01:06:09,420 --> 01:06:21,510
Well, the answer is also no. And again, graphically, you can consider the scenario where the same events C of fact both A and B,

460
01:06:22,050 --> 01:06:30,960
so given the C, f, c is given, C is not a event anymore c the sample space then,

461
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:44,340
and B they can be independent, but without a conditional C and B apparently they are dependent because they are affected by the same analog event.

462
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:50,370
So that's why we need to do randomization in and out of experiment to controlling for this

463
01:06:50,370 --> 01:06:57,150
additional all major confounders that there may be components that affect both A and B.

464
01:06:58,590 --> 01:07:09,720
Right now, weather may affect both the temperature and the perceived for the patient.

465
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:16,380
Right. So these two are no longer independent given the event.

466
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:20,760
So conditional independence does not imply independence either.

467
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:27,690
The basis to our important conclusion that I hope you can keep in mind.

468
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:31,980
So independence means very different thing from conditional independence.

469
01:07:32,070 --> 01:07:38,000
They are not equivalent. Okay. Yes.

470
01:07:38,470 --> 01:07:53,650
So there is a there is a, B and C to be independent or pairwise independent because I think the like the mutually independence specified,

471
01:07:53,650 --> 01:07:58,930
like the conditional independence. Pairwise.

472
01:07:59,570 --> 01:08:06,430
Not so sure. Yeah. So previously we have talked about the four more than three events.

473
01:08:06,460 --> 01:08:10,450
Right. What it what it means to be mutually independent.

474
01:08:10,450 --> 01:08:12,670
What it means to be pairwise independent.

475
01:08:13,060 --> 01:08:24,340
So here you can similarly define those definitions for conditional, conditionally pairwise independent and mutual independence.

476
01:08:24,850 --> 01:08:30,999
But it's a it's it's beyond the focus of this of this course, mainly because in practice,

477
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:37,590
when people talk about conditional independence is rarely go beyond the second order array.

478
01:08:37,750 --> 01:08:46,120
You rarely look at more than two events or two random marbles under this condition because it quickly becomes very messy.

479
01:08:46,890 --> 01:08:49,959
So, I mean, A, B and C maybe.

480
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:57,850
And see, they just falls back to the original mistakes, independence and paralyzing dependance scenario.

481
01:09:00,210 --> 01:09:02,370
So if you consider them to be three events,

482
01:09:03,090 --> 01:09:09,490
so you can just follow the original definition to define whether they are pairwise independent or mutually independent.

483
01:09:11,740 --> 01:09:15,580
Yes. I mean, here we only discuss the independence between A and B.

484
01:09:15,820 --> 01:09:20,830
Yes. Here we condition on C, we condition on some events.

485
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:28,180
And we talk about the condition. Independence versus not independence between another two events.

486
01:09:29,870 --> 01:09:38,990
So the notation ABC doesn't really matter. So what we are trying to say is that we can define the independence between two events given another one.

487
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:47,240
Maybe we can discuss afterwards again. Any other question?

488
01:09:51,490 --> 01:09:54,910
All right. So that's about it for the independents next.

489
01:09:55,090 --> 01:10:01,360
Let's talk about a random variable, which really is the foundation of the romance of the course.

490
01:10:01,750 --> 01:10:03,970
So we need to know what a random variable is.

491
01:10:04,180 --> 01:10:13,479
And from then on, we're going to always talk about random variable since that of the origin of events and some of space that is like that.

492
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:20,260
Because as you can as you will say that the random variable putting everything in the same perspective,

493
01:10:21,490 --> 01:10:30,220
mapping the original symbol space always to the real space so we can always talk about, you know, numbers and distributions on the real space.

494
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:34,480
So it makes our notation and our interpretation much easier.

495
01:10:35,620 --> 01:10:38,050
So first, let's again to give some definitions.

496
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:46,860
Recall that for probability space, we may have three components a sample space which is denoted by has.

497
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:57,670
Let's think of a field which is denoted by this a letter A and the probability function which satisfy three axioms.

498
01:10:58,630 --> 01:11:07,690
Right? Probability has to be known, has to be non-active has to be the probability for the sum of space,

499
01:11:07,690 --> 01:11:11,560
has to be one, and has to satisfy this carnival and activity.

500
01:11:12,370 --> 01:11:16,420
So then it is a probability function.

501
01:11:16,540 --> 01:11:21,579
With these three components, we can define a probability space. Now is that over?

502
01:11:21,580 --> 01:11:27,730
Referring to the outcomes and events observed from the sample space as it's very convenient

503
01:11:28,210 --> 01:11:33,880
to assign a number to each possible outcome and record that it's that yellow words.

504
01:11:34,060 --> 01:11:38,440
We map the original probability space to the real space.

505
01:11:39,910 --> 01:11:43,360
By establishing this connection, we need a function.

506
01:11:43,810 --> 01:11:50,590
We need a real value add function or sets on sets or denoted by Y.

507
01:11:50,980 --> 01:11:54,290
And we call that function the random variable.

508
01:11:54,970 --> 01:12:01,660
In particular, a random variable Y is a real out of function that is defined on the probability space.

509
01:12:02,050 --> 01:12:15,910
So in the symbol space as to the real space, R and every member point omega in this symbol space is mapped to a point in this real space,

510
01:12:16,300 --> 01:12:21,430
and that is denoted as this a y prime, as is omega.

511
01:12:22,570 --> 01:12:30,250
And sometimes we can, we can make this this argument omega just for simplicity.

512
01:12:30,550 --> 01:12:33,730
If it's if it doesn't cause any confusion.

513
01:12:36,130 --> 01:12:45,760
And conversely, we can also define the inverse image of Y of a subset B for the real space to be.

514
01:12:46,030 --> 01:12:56,050
All of this symbol points in the original symbol space, such that while Omega belongs to this to this parallel set in the real.

515
01:12:58,210 --> 01:13:07,320
So this why it's just a map. It's just a mapping from the sum of space as to the real space from this events.

516
01:13:08,700 --> 01:13:14,120
Some of the points, the real numbers. But it's just a function.

517
01:13:17,590 --> 01:13:23,320
And that function, this real value function, we call it the random barrel which choose.

518
01:13:26,790 --> 01:13:36,340
So so far with this stuff in Asia, we actually map this two things right from us to our end from this end.

519
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:44,550
So essentially all the formal sets in the real space on there are still one thing that we need to take care of, which is a probability function.

520
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:49,260
We haven't defined probability on the real space yet,

521
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:59,609
so that's what are we going to do next based on examination where you can we know this universe image has explicit meaning in our

522
01:13:59,610 --> 01:14:11,310
original symbol space or any theorem or else that the inverse image of this spiral site is essentially an event in our original symbols.

523
01:14:12,900 --> 01:14:18,210
So this is an event in the original sample space. We can define the probability for that event.

524
01:14:19,260 --> 01:14:27,150
That's how we define the probability for this random variable and for anybody else that be in the real space.

525
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:34,620
We define the probability of this random variable Y MP to be equal to the probability

526
01:14:34,860 --> 01:14:41,730
of this y inverse of B and this y imus will be this map this or else that.

527
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:48,090
Back to the original sample space. And in our ensemble space, this piece well defined.

528
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:55,900
So the right hand side is well defined. That is that that gave us the probability of this minor variable at.

529
01:14:57,810 --> 01:15:02,490
Sir. Yes. Sorry. Could you just say what the definition of A is again?

530
01:15:03,260 --> 01:15:09,570
And is that A is the is the stigma filled in the original sample size?

531
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:16,350
Okay. But one of the components part of this probability is it's a collection of events.

532
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:22,700
So that's why Imus. B b is the moral sunny.

533
01:15:22,700 --> 01:15:27,710
R Why Imus speed is in this segment.

534
01:15:29,150 --> 01:15:37,730
So you this Imus original probability space for any subset in this segment found a we have a probability.

535
01:15:38,030 --> 01:15:42,180
All right. That's how we define probability. So the right hand side is well-defined.

536
01:15:44,700 --> 01:15:49,939
And so now with this, all of these components, we know this mapping,

537
01:15:49,940 --> 01:16:00,200
this this function Y essentially transform the original probability space as a and P to this new real space.

538
01:16:00,770 --> 01:16:09,370
R B Again, we use that notation p x and map the original sample space to this space.

539
01:16:12,980 --> 01:16:24,140
So the red marble is a set function because it takes asset mapping to another site which takes values on the rail line and map it to the which,

540
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:28,730
map the original events to the values on the real line.

541
01:16:29,930 --> 01:16:38,360
Oftentimes the argument is automated as a convention, so we only ride the random parallel to be y instead of y of Omega.

542
01:16:38,450 --> 01:16:48,670
But what it really means is, y'know, omega, what it really means when I write about what really means is always a mapping convention.

543
01:16:48,700 --> 01:16:59,810
Like we just to write it as a, as a letter Y, as a capital letter Y or accept a letter or some other capital letters to represent the random variable.

544
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:09,260
But you think you need to know that at the end, you know, in the bottom, what it really means is a mapping is a function.

545
01:17:10,970 --> 01:17:14,570
Maps now a regional sample space to the relevance.

546
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:23,060
The values can take the values that are right about where you want to take.

547
01:17:23,660 --> 01:17:28,250
We also assign it a lowercase letter just as a notation.

548
01:17:29,390 --> 01:17:34,280
So we want to represent something as a random variable. Typically, we use capital letters.

549
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:39,590
And if you want to denote the actual value used alone, that's just a convention.

550
01:17:43,890 --> 01:17:55,440
All right. Always helpful to look at a few examples to solidify this abstract definition, but consider the case where we call this coin toss coin.

551
01:17:56,460 --> 01:18:02,610
If you just toss in one time and there are only two possible outcomes at our table.

552
01:18:03,810 --> 01:18:07,350
So this is our original sample space expressing words.

553
01:18:07,620 --> 01:18:15,210
All right? But it's not very convenient to do a calculation just to carry these words forward.

554
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:26,790
So instead of we can use the random variable, we can define a mapping to map this our original semicolons to the real space so that we can,

555
01:18:26,790 --> 01:18:31,350
you know, make the notation and the computation more convenient.

556
01:18:32,250 --> 01:18:40,560
For example, we can define a function, then map this hard to one and map the tail to zero.

557
01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:47,880
That's a map, right? We map the original sample points, hat and tail to two numbers, one and zero.

558
01:18:49,530 --> 01:18:54,210
All right. And then you can check this mapping is a valid mapping.

559
01:18:54,570 --> 01:19:00,000
So it map all the events in the original space, two of the moral sites in the real space.

560
01:19:01,380 --> 01:19:08,250
Correspondingly, you can calculate the probability of the random variable taken by one are taken out of zero.

561
01:19:08,970 --> 01:19:16,110
Essentially what that means is all the events such that are all outcomes such that.

562
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:27,800
Why of omega equal to one. And we know in this set of.

563
01:19:29,530 --> 01:19:37,599
All the events are the outcomes such that while omega one and just the had this particular outcome

564
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:45,660
itself so the probability of that of y y equal to one is equal to the probability of hat is income.

565
01:19:45,670 --> 01:19:56,970
2.5. But in practice as as I said, we do not typically write why promises Omega because that's just tedious.

566
01:19:58,110 --> 01:20:03,360
All we need to do is just the right line. But again, we need to know this.

567
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:10,769
Why actually represent a map? It's not it's not just a letter.

568
01:20:10,770 --> 01:20:20,310
It's a map. But this is just one way of mapping this original sample space to the real space.

569
01:20:20,460 --> 01:20:26,670
Of course, you can design another mapping, for example, by prime a map h two.

570
01:20:27,750 --> 01:20:32,460
I don't know any number that you like 15 and not t to a thousand.

571
01:20:32,910 --> 01:20:37,350
You can do whatever mapping that is one that's also a valid random variable.

572
01:20:39,330 --> 01:20:46,620
But rarely you would say mapping like this because it's really make no sense to mapping to this number.

573
01:20:46,620 --> 01:20:52,680
So zero and one is just the more conventional and the easier to use later on,

574
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:59,700
especially when we want to think about cases where we cost the coin multiple times.

575
01:21:00,270 --> 01:21:06,820
This is zero and a actually can make additional sense in subsequent calculations.

576
01:21:06,850 --> 01:21:11,680
So it's easier to use. So some mappings may be better, some mappings may be worse.

577
01:21:12,060 --> 01:21:17,760
But after all of this, why prime defining this way is a valid random variable.

578
01:21:22,100 --> 01:21:25,140
Question. All right.

579
01:21:25,320 --> 01:21:34,530
Another example, the role of a paradise. Again, the possible outcomes of the original small space is this six numbers, one, two, six.

580
01:21:35,490 --> 01:21:46,110
Okay. And that actually directly, you know, induced a random variable because these are numbers.

581
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:54,540
So the most straightforward random variable that we can come up with is directly mapping the original sample point to itself,

582
01:21:55,890 --> 01:21:59,190
because originally some of that is number is already in the real space.

583
01:21:59,740 --> 01:22:03,870
Right. We don't don't we don't really need to do additional transformation.

584
01:22:05,070 --> 01:22:08,370
Of course, if you want, you can do it, but there's no need.

585
01:22:08,850 --> 01:22:13,200
So we can simply define the mapping to be identity.

586
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:18,690
Identity mapping while Omega is just equal to Omega itself.

587
01:22:19,410 --> 01:22:30,480
And then the original sample space is now mapped to the real space and again, only map to six points and each point have probability one over six.

588
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:38,940
So that's another example of random animal.

589
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:48,000
But again, as I said, you can you can set this map and to be an item that you like as long as it's a valid mapping is a random variable.

590
01:22:48,210 --> 01:22:51,390
For example, I can assign this 1 to 3.

591
01:22:54,060 --> 01:23:03,330
If I design a new round of arrow map, this one or three to number zero is four, five, six to number one.

592
01:23:03,660 --> 01:23:12,450
That's also a valid to run a variable if it satisfy your particular need for some subsequent calculation you can define or unavailable this way.

593
01:23:13,470 --> 01:23:19,500
Essentially, I want to why priming on a zero means your number is a small number one, two or three.

594
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:25,770
Right. A random variable y prime equal to one means it's a large number four or five or six.

595
01:23:26,580 --> 01:23:30,210
And what's the probability of y prime equals one?

596
01:23:33,720 --> 01:23:45,410
If I define the roundabout this way. What?

597
01:23:46,690 --> 01:23:52,390
No one has a right to know that again, with all of the nomination,

598
01:23:53,500 --> 01:23:59,680
my primary 4 to 1 recall that we prime the right about always imagine what that means and the

599
01:23:59,680 --> 01:24:09,430
probability of all of the omega in our original small space such that why prime omega equals one.

600
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:21,950
And why Prime I'm are you gonna want me as the Omega has to be four or five or six that's equal to the probability of four,

601
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:26,210
five, six in our original seminal series.

602
01:24:26,570 --> 01:24:29,630
And that is three over six, which is why.

603
01:24:30,890 --> 01:24:36,020
Okay. So that's why a probability of y priming r one in my definition is one.

604
01:24:39,080 --> 01:24:42,140
So that's another example.

605
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:48,620
Any questions over? All right.

606
01:24:48,620 --> 01:24:55,880
So here is another example. Suppose we have a sample space of the all the invaders.

607
01:24:56,300 --> 01:25:00,080
Zero positive, exactly one positive, negative two so on, so forth.

608
01:25:00,860 --> 01:25:10,639
If we define the run variable y to be for any omega last r equal to zero, we map it to a number.

609
01:25:10,640 --> 01:25:25,910
A If omega is greater than zero, we map to number B So then this y is a well-defined random variable with two possible outcomes,

610
01:25:26,090 --> 01:25:38,240
with two possible values, and b the original sample space has probably infinite values, the new random variable.

611
01:25:40,270 --> 01:25:45,370
In defining this, we only have two possible values A and B, and in particular,

612
01:25:45,370 --> 01:25:54,610
we can calculate the probability of life of the aim to be all the original outcome by while omega equal to.

613
01:25:57,070 --> 01:26:03,560
And that gave us the summation of I goes from that same infinity to zero p alive.

614
01:26:04,090 --> 01:26:07,560
The probability of omega equal to I.

615
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:17,140
All the not to back zeros. And. And similarly the probability of y for the p and the summation of pi i want to infinity.

616
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:22,060
This is another example of the random variable.

617
01:26:23,410 --> 01:26:34,180
So the bottom line is you can define a random variable at a in any fashion that fits, you are drawn back as long as a map's.

618
01:26:34,180 --> 01:26:39,070
The original sent my original sample space to the real space.

619
01:26:39,970 --> 01:26:45,970
Okay. And you can define probability on the overall side by doing this inverse map.

620
01:26:46,420 --> 01:26:52,870
As long as those are satisfied or none of our values is, is, is clearly defined.

621
01:26:54,940 --> 01:27:00,730
There is no unique way of defining a variable. It's just a need to define random variable based on our need.

622
01:27:08,350 --> 01:27:14,170
Okay. Now we have defined amount of variable. The very narrow band that we need to talk about is the distribution.

623
01:27:14,650 --> 01:27:19,270
You probably have already heard this word many times distribution.

624
01:27:19,750 --> 01:27:24,280
When we talk about the distribution is actually it tells us everything about a random variable.

625
01:27:24,550 --> 01:27:34,160
So the distribution is more specifically the cumulative distribution function or the other words known as setting up of a random variable.

626
01:27:34,180 --> 01:27:36,870
What is a function? Okay.

627
01:27:37,510 --> 01:27:48,610
It's a function that is defining the following way of why this capital is a common notation or CDF cumulative distribution function.

628
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:53,860
The small. I recall that we use a small letter to represent the actual value.

629
01:27:54,010 --> 01:28:01,329
Right. So I have y this function evaluated out of this small on a small y is defined as

630
01:28:01,330 --> 01:28:07,180
the probability of the random arable title one last or equal to this small one.

631
01:28:10,070 --> 01:28:17,480
By definition, that means the probability of all these events or these sample points in our ensemble space,

632
01:28:17,780 --> 01:28:21,410
such that while Bhumi got last article too smaller,

633
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:33,920
that is called a city at the cumulative distribution function, and this function is defined on real space for any small Y in real space.

634
01:28:34,760 --> 01:28:42,270
Anyway, in the real space you can always follow this definition to get a value for that city.

635
01:28:43,470 --> 01:28:52,790
Okay. So I mean, any number can always follow this definition to get a value for this city and all

636
01:28:52,790 --> 01:28:58,280
the probability questions about Iran available can be answered beyond this city.

637
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:07,130
So that's a very strong conclusion. And it basically just tells you everything you need to know about this random variable.

638
01:29:07,850 --> 01:29:17,630
You can tell it from this Sydney out function as long as you know the city, our function, you know everything about, that's how you need to know.

639
01:29:18,110 --> 01:29:22,450
It's a uniquely defined by this city and strong conclusion.

640
01:29:26,450 --> 01:29:28,490
Some property of this city are functional.

641
01:29:29,510 --> 01:29:38,650
So if you look at this, how this city, our function is defined is essentially a probability, probability evaluated at different values.

642
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:47,960
The probability of this random variable loss are equal to this small value y with different small.

643
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:55,620
At Y you got a different number. And in particular, recall that this y goes to infinity and it goes to infinity.

644
01:29:55,950 --> 01:30:04,050
And think about what this probability is going to become or if this small y goes to the maximum infinity.

645
01:30:06,540 --> 01:30:09,960
One would that tells us about this set.

646
01:30:14,840 --> 01:30:19,010
If this small line is cut off goes the maximum infinity.

647
01:30:20,900 --> 01:30:32,780
With this to become a larger or smaller. Getting larger or smaller?

648
01:30:34,220 --> 01:30:38,270
Yes. So it's going to get smaller. It's going to get smaller, right.

649
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:49,640
Very good. Because what we're talking about is the Omega says that while Omega last all clear, what if you are bound or you cut off?

650
01:30:49,730 --> 01:31:01,130
It's kind of smaller and smaller. Of course, the qualified events, the qualified outcome does become fewer and fewer, but is is strictly decreasing.

651
01:31:01,940 --> 01:31:09,680
And it's gotten smaller and smaller. And to the extreme, if y goes to negative infinity, this should be a anticipate.

652
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:14,290
Right after this. The probability is always zero.

653
01:31:14,890 --> 01:31:19,870
So that tells us what's going to happen if this small line goes to negative infinity.

654
01:31:20,380 --> 01:31:24,460
Based upon why, by definition should be conversion to zero.

655
01:31:25,660 --> 01:31:34,180
On the other hand, if y goes to positive infinity, by the same logic, it should be the entire entire sample space.

656
01:31:35,020 --> 01:31:38,380
And we know the probability of the entire sample space is one.

657
01:31:39,220 --> 01:31:44,470
So that tells us the other. Extreme Y goes to positive infinity.

658
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:50,500
This about one should be equal to one. That is actually the first property.

659
01:31:50,830 --> 01:31:56,200
For this city, our function. So it's always Barnett and it's bounded by zero and one.

660
01:31:57,070 --> 01:32:01,780
And also, if y goes to in that same infinity, this function goes to zero.

661
01:32:02,140 --> 01:32:06,280
Y goes to positive infinity, it goes to one. Okay.

662
01:32:07,090 --> 01:32:10,570
And by definition it should be a non decreasing function.

663
01:32:12,100 --> 01:32:23,530
In other words, if a is the last, straightway last and B then above a should be last are equal to B is now decreasing and may be flat.

664
01:32:24,370 --> 01:32:27,490
I never go that. Okay. It could go up.

665
01:32:27,580 --> 01:32:32,530
It could stay flat and never goes down. It's nothing crazy.

666
01:32:37,480 --> 01:32:41,380
And again, to formally prove this now, is it crazy?

667
01:32:42,700 --> 01:32:51,909
We need to use that definition, right? For any or article to be the definition of this about a is the probability of y last.

668
01:32:51,910 --> 01:33:04,020
Are you going to a? Which is the probability of an event such that omega y of omega last are equal to a threat.

669
01:33:04,530 --> 01:33:11,870
And this apple B is the probability of another event where Y of Omega plus are equal to be.

670
01:33:12,870 --> 01:33:16,990
So now we have to look at these two events. One is, oh, there we go.

671
01:33:17,020 --> 01:33:26,639
That's about why Omega alongside A, the other is why all the omega says that while Omega at some point would be a a is strictly and last and

672
01:33:26,640 --> 01:33:37,230
B we know this two events meaning actually one glance to the other night if we do this by A is by B,

673
01:33:37,320 --> 01:33:46,710
which one is bigger, a bigger or be bigger? A implies B or B implies A.

674
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:58,940
A B is small, B is larger. So is this camp to be this event is what?

675
01:34:00,910 --> 01:34:05,860
It's bigger, right? So graphically it should look like this.

676
01:34:06,490 --> 01:34:14,080
A should be contend in this event. Be if a is satisfied, then be must satisfy.

677
01:34:15,220 --> 01:34:18,190
In other words, he implies being right about it.

678
01:34:18,190 --> 01:34:28,030
We know the left hand side is always less or equal to a right hand side, and that's by the one of the properties for probability function.

679
01:34:28,840 --> 01:34:35,680
If the events A is content in B, then the probability of A must be loss are equal to the probability of B.

680
01:34:36,610 --> 01:34:47,559
We can return to our previous lecture notes for this property for probability function so that give us this non

681
01:34:47,560 --> 01:34:55,870
decrease in property for the CDF function and another property for this function is it's always right contained if.

682
01:34:57,360 --> 01:35:05,470
And what I mean by Ryan continuous is that if you have a sequence, a decrease in the sequence approaching a particular number, right,

683
01:35:05,820 --> 01:35:15,780
or any number B and any decrease in the sequence key and not approaching B from the right hand side on the real space,

684
01:35:16,200 --> 01:35:20,400
then we can always have this equation.

685
01:35:20,970 --> 01:35:26,340
The limit angle you've been added I've been is equal to Apple B.

686
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:39,960
Okay. So graphically what that means is that this function is kind of a breaking point, but it always has to be right, continuous.

687
01:35:40,350 --> 01:35:55,290
And so if you if this is your B point and so this is the CDF function, and if you have a sequence B one, B to all the way to the end,

688
01:35:55,830 --> 01:36:07,860
that is approaching B from the right hand side, b1, B2 all the way to B then the functional value of B1, b1, B2 all the way to us.

689
01:36:08,220 --> 01:36:18,980
B should approaching half of b. It's been a sequence approaching B from the right hand side.

690
01:36:19,550 --> 01:36:24,110
And we do not know anything about the sequence approaching me from the left hand side.

691
01:36:24,890 --> 01:36:31,340
That's why we care about a continuous continuity on the right hand side.

692
01:36:32,660 --> 01:36:38,290
Again, that is because of how we define this senior function recall.

693
01:36:38,340 --> 01:36:42,440
The definition is the probability of event available,

694
01:36:42,440 --> 01:36:55,010
less or equal to this small lie that gave us this right continuity as equal sign essentially gave us the right continuity.

695
01:36:55,370 --> 01:37:09,780
If you have a sequence that is approaching this, why from above they can prove that the limit of that sets is essentially this set or half of life.

696
01:37:10,040 --> 01:37:14,510
That's why you have a right continuity. But if you do not have that continuity.

697
01:37:14,990 --> 01:37:21,910
So let's say the function is always right continuous. Sometimes it can be continuous in both directions.

698
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:26,240
But at least we know that for NASA the app is always right continuously.

699
01:37:30,180 --> 01:37:42,060
And the final property is that the probability of this rhinovirus will be greater than or equal to b is equal to the difference between FP and.

700
01:37:43,890 --> 01:37:49,830
And again, by definition, how is the probability of y?

701
01:37:49,830 --> 01:37:53,610
And that's how it could be. And this is the probability of Y.

702
01:37:53,610 --> 01:37:57,570
And that's how a if you take the difference between these two sets.

703
01:37:58,170 --> 01:38:01,980
Recall that the R A is containing B, right?

704
01:38:02,310 --> 01:38:09,810
So if you take the difference between the two sides, that's just going to be this part and the probability of the difference.

705
01:38:10,380 --> 01:38:15,510
So that's the probability of a random variable greater than a that's likely to be.

706
01:38:16,950 --> 01:38:20,220
To pay attention to this, to inequality, science.

707
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:27,770
One has an equation, the other one doesn't have. Equation is a straight line greater than eight and allows already four to be at.

708
01:38:29,460 --> 01:38:32,610
So these are the properties for a CDO.

709
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:43,440
And the theorem apparently in the book actually says if these conditions two, three,

710
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:55,320
four and five holds these four holds, if a function then sets by these four properties, then it is actually a CDO.

711
01:38:56,970 --> 01:39:05,210
So this is a two way equivalence. A function is a city that is equivalent to, say, a function,

712
01:39:05,220 --> 01:39:11,400
satisfy this form constraint and a function that is found to satisfy this four conditions and must be a CDO.

713
01:39:13,240 --> 01:39:17,040
And for any city out, it must satisfy all of its conditions.

714
01:39:17,400 --> 01:39:33,040
1 to 6. And the rigorous proof you need to use some pretty tedious, you know, really real analysis technique to actually prove this.

715
01:39:33,650 --> 01:39:39,640
Well, not in this course, but the conclusion is pretty important.

716
01:39:40,820 --> 01:39:48,309
So anything can be you can show that they satisfy all of these conditions and any kind of function.

717
01:39:48,310 --> 01:39:54,370
That sense by 2 to 5 is a severe pressure.

718
01:40:02,550 --> 01:40:08,310
All right. So then so there was another example.

719
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:12,570
So the example in the in the textbook all things three points.

720
01:40:13,380 --> 01:40:19,950
So the right. So the setup is like this.

721
01:40:19,960 --> 01:40:25,180
We toss three coins and record. How many hands do we get from this?

722
01:40:25,570 --> 01:40:34,870
Three. And our original sample space is zero one, two and three.

723
01:40:35,740 --> 01:40:42,220
But we toss the coins three times and record how many has to account on all three deposits.

724
01:40:42,670 --> 01:40:47,170
So the original sample says some space is there one, two and three.

725
01:40:47,500 --> 01:40:51,190
And we define the run of our hope to be identity mapping.

726
01:40:51,430 --> 01:40:55,900
In other words, we map zero two with 0121, two, two, two, three, two, three.

727
01:40:56,500 --> 01:41:00,290
That's how we define this run America line, right?

728
01:41:00,760 --> 01:41:04,300
So it's essentially defined as the number of parts.

729
01:41:07,130 --> 01:41:13,030
In three causes. That's how we define this random variable.

730
01:41:13,510 --> 01:41:17,860
Okay. Now, the problem is, what is the city of.

731
01:41:21,430 --> 01:41:27,120
Or this random variable. This is a well-defined one available.

732
01:41:27,570 --> 01:41:34,800
So as we said, antiretroviral. We can always derive Cydia and the city tells us everything about the rhinovirus.

733
01:41:35,700 --> 01:41:38,940
Now the problem is what is the problem?

734
01:41:39,240 --> 01:41:43,480
What is the cydia for this rhinovirus? This out of wash?

735
01:41:44,280 --> 01:42:00,530
Any why in the real space? So I'll give you 2 minutes and you can make a stop on this problem and see whether you can.

736
01:42:02,700 --> 01:42:06,720
Find out the CDF for this random error of a line defining this way.

737
01:42:08,160 --> 01:44:01,890
And then we can look at this problem together. All right.

738
01:44:01,900 --> 01:44:03,430
So let's look at this together.

739
01:44:03,490 --> 01:44:15,070
So in order to calculate or to define Syria for this fight tomorrow, first we need to notice that the sample space is not.

740
01:44:16,980 --> 01:44:22,500
Arbitron numbers. It only has four calls, by all accounts zero, one, two and three.

741
01:44:23,100 --> 01:44:31,890
That essentially defines where we should consider as nuts or breaking points for this our function,

742
01:44:32,880 --> 01:44:40,050
tumor type distribution function or anyone, for example, for anyone less than zero.

743
01:44:40,620 --> 01:44:50,610
What do we know about this city? Any small moai less than zero.

744
01:44:51,510 --> 01:44:57,900
This alpha line, by definition, is the probability of this random variable, last or equal to this small one.

745
01:44:58,410 --> 01:45:01,550
And what is that? It's always zero, right?

746
01:45:01,590 --> 01:45:07,229
Because it never happens. This random variable never takes mathematics.

747
01:45:07,230 --> 01:45:12,450
So the probability of this y last are equal to some negative number should always be zero.

748
01:45:12,930 --> 01:45:19,260
So the first breaking point or not should be exactly at y equal to zero.

749
01:45:19,710 --> 01:45:26,670
If Y is equal to zero, half of y is equal to the probability of this y equal.

750
01:45:26,730 --> 01:45:28,140
That's an equal to zero.

751
01:45:31,660 --> 01:45:42,880
Is what is essentially equal to the probability of this random rotating binary zero, because that's the only possible outcome for this event.

752
01:45:45,590 --> 01:45:49,870
Right. That's exactly t of y equals zero.

753
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:54,830
And once the probability of you got zero hat out of 3000.

754
01:46:00,850 --> 01:46:04,390
What's the probability of having zero hat out of three tosses?

755
01:46:06,040 --> 01:46:13,900
In 8.8. Right. That's a lot of sampling with replacement.

756
01:46:17,430 --> 01:46:28,590
We have a different outcomes. Each have equal probability and we're just talking about one particular outcome out of this eight outcomes.

757
01:46:29,100 --> 01:46:37,420
So that's why this probability is. One over eight.

758
01:46:37,870 --> 01:46:43,000
If you don't know how to calculate this, make sure that it go back to the original lecture notes,

759
01:46:43,060 --> 01:46:46,389
previous lecture knows and figure out why this is one.

760
01:46:46,390 --> 01:46:54,330
Okay. And for any Y that's greater than zero less than one, what's the probability?

761
01:46:54,940 --> 01:47:01,220
I thought why you wondered zero again.

762
01:47:01,240 --> 01:47:10,990
Let's take a look at the definition. All right. So that says if that is defined by probability of this random out of a line last cycle to small,

763
01:47:10,990 --> 01:47:18,700
what is the smallest number between zero and one now taking zero or one?

764
01:47:21,520 --> 01:47:28,690
This event is y is still y zero.

765
01:47:30,100 --> 01:47:34,749
Right, for any y and a small y matter between zero and one.

766
01:47:34,750 --> 01:47:44,920
For example, y taking point five or point three. If you plug it in, you can always find this event is essentially still this y equal to zero.

767
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:52,360
So that still gave us one over and the next breaking point is Y equal to one.

768
01:47:55,070 --> 01:47:59,810
By definition, that is probability of y last are equal to one.

769
01:48:00,320 --> 01:48:06,560
Which is a probability a y or a zero or y equal to one.

770
01:48:09,530 --> 01:48:16,610
Whereas why 2 hours to zero and one and not?

771
01:48:17,030 --> 01:48:23,270
You also need to calculate the probability of having one or zero had out of three tosses.

772
01:48:24,050 --> 01:48:27,380
Only some calculation should be about the count that is.

773
01:48:33,390 --> 01:48:45,480
Wow. And similarly you can calculate it for the other animals y between one and two by 4 to 2.

774
01:48:45,630 --> 01:48:54,480
Y Between two and three, maybe 4 to 3 and y greater than strings and see all the scenarios.

775
01:48:55,180 --> 01:48:59,760
So let's take a look at the last one. Y equals y greater than three.

776
01:49:00,840 --> 01:49:05,790
If Y is a number that's greater than three. What do we know about this CDF?

777
01:49:10,580 --> 01:49:17,870
What's the probability of a grandma rebel taking a loss or equal to a number greater than one?

778
01:49:18,320 --> 01:49:23,330
It's always one. Right. Very good. Because that's our entire small space.

779
01:49:24,110 --> 01:49:28,070
Around a barrel of the maximum value, that random barrel today in three.

780
01:49:29,090 --> 01:49:34,070
So the probability of the random variable taking the last or equal to a value greater than three.

781
01:49:34,460 --> 01:49:37,670
It's just the entire space that is always one.

782
01:49:38,300 --> 01:49:49,640
And if you draw this city out, once you calculate going, this is something like before life on a one all the way to y greater than three.

783
01:49:50,030 --> 01:49:55,010
You can actually draw the entire C function.

784
01:49:55,640 --> 01:49:58,160
Right. So this is the.
