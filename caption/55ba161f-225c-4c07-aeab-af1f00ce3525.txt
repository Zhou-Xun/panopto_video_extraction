1
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:07,530
All right. Hello, everybody. How's it going this morning?

2
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:16,730
Again, it's almost the spooky season is upon us.

3
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:21,200
Almost. How many of you have been to an orchard or a cider mill yet?

4
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:26,030
A couple of you. Yeah, I usually go, but I haven't.

5
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:34,010
As of this year, I usually get pumpkins and stuff too, you know? Like, I like those little decorative baby pumpkins.

6
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:38,210
Just haven't gotten it yet, but, you know, another time.

7
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:45,240
Okay. All right.

8
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:49,980
So we're going to pick up where we left off last week.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,160
Tuesday, it's still the same week that we're going to pick up where we left off on Tuesday.

10
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:05,520
So we talked about Hurricane Katrina. But specific infectious diseases that we're concerned about, post flooding.

11
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:14,159
So usually, you know, post flooding, people think about things like obviously electrical hazards, electrocution, those kinds of things.

12
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:22,320
But generally, a lot of potential diseases can crop up just because of the contaminated water or lack of water.

13
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:30,300
So after Katrina in particular, there were a couple illnesses from that came from the Big Brother family,

14
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:38,159
and they suspected that there were 22 cases and five deaths, although this is likely to be an undercounting.

15
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:48,840
Let me just mention a recording of that recording. So in particular, these Vibrio illnesses, these are organisms that are water borne.

16
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:53,700
But when you get it, it's unlikely to cause person to person transmission,

17
00:01:53,700 --> 00:02:00,990
like how norovirus can transmit from person to person in like buffets and on cruise ships and things like that.

18
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:11,440
So Vibrio Vulnificus in particular can start wound infections that can cause redness and swelling at the site and if not treated,

19
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:15,060
can progress to systemic illness causing sepsis.

20
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:23,130
The Paro hemolytic case causes gastrointestinal symptoms after consumption of contaminated water,

21
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:31,440
and it can be fatal for those with liver disease or any type of chronic hepatitis or if they're immunocompromised.

22
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:37,770
And then cholera, which is the most common one, is a nontoxic janick mostly causes diarrhea,

23
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:42,660
but those who are immuno compromised can experience more severe issues.

24
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:49,739
We also do have to worry about sporadic non typhoid or salmonella again.

25
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:55,920
That again can cause diarrhea, upper respiratory infections and pneumonias among evacuees.

26
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:04,200
So if you remember in that video where they showed where everybody was evacuating at the convention center, highly dense populations.

27
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:14,250
That is prime time for upper respiratory infections and pneumonia to potentially spread, in particular, tuberculosis as well.

28
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:20,400
After Katrina, there were 27 known patients in Alabama, 21 in Mississippi,

29
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:30,600
and nearly 150 in Louisiana who got tuberculosis as a result of evacuating and having to shelter in close proximity with one another.

30
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:35,580
Then there is dermatologic conditions.

31
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:43,890
This one is the one of the least fine ones methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus or Mersa.

32
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:48,660
And this happened in about 30 pediatric adult evacuees.

33
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:52,770
How many of you are familiar with Mersa or has known someone who's gotten worse?

34
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,540
Yeah. You know, you're not in because you're familiar. He knows someone who?

35
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,839
That mersa. Okay. Yeah.

36
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:10,170
And it's all here. Yeah. Yeah. So this one in particular, Mersa, is actually pretty common, and it thrives in, like, moist environment.

37
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:16,560
So a lot of times people were actually get them from, like, jam maps or like foam or padding.

38
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:20,669
That's why, like, when people are gross and like don't sanitize and stuff like that.

39
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:25,800
So when I was working in between college at a math learning center,

40
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:33,090
one of my students was like this 15 year old girl who did gymnastics, and she happened to get Marissa from her training gym.

41
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:38,160
And Marissa, if you're up, if you can stomach it at this hour and look up to Google Images,

42
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:48,750
it kind of eats away at your skin and takes out like large chunks, like, like a like a like a like a velociraptor, just like, you know.

43
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:52,300
And so she had got it on her thigh and then her back as well.

44
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,380
And because it is resistant to methicillin, a lot of antibiotic treatment,

45
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:04,499
it's very difficult to treat and it can cause more systemic issues as well there.

46
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:10,020
You know, if you don't get Mersa in terms of like coming into contact with contaminated water,

47
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:14,580
you can get skin lesions like popular rashes, pustular rashes.

48
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:20,790
Folliculitis was very common among military personnel who responded and then noninfectious

49
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:26,850
rashes like prickly heat syndrome and then saw circumferential lesions as well.

50
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:37,740
But one of the big perpetrators of illness in the short term and then in the long term was mold.

51
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:42,720
Okay. So after Hurricane Katrina, the CDC found visible.

52
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:56,799
Mold growth and at least 46% of the houses surveyed and heavy mold growth and at least 17% of the houses with a visit with ranges of up to 700,000,

53
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,360
with visible mold grow. And it doesn't have to be visible for it to be there.

54
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:07,629
And this is also not taking into account those not surveyed or those without visible mold growth.

55
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:09,310
So this is likely an underestimate.

56
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:19,600
And generally you'll only get your house surveyed by, like FEMA if you request it and if they're willing to essentially give you that request.

57
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:26,829
And in a lot of like the communities of color generally FEMA dial answer those requests or people

58
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:34,059
don't like even like process the paperwork rate and mold loves moisture they need a food source.

59
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:39,820
Ideally something starchy drywall is their favorite to just chew on.

60
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:40,330
Right.

61
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:53,260
And yes, but the thing with mold growth in particular, as you can imagine, a lot of these communities are already like socioeconomically depressed.

62
00:06:53,680 --> 00:07:02,590
Right. So the way you treat mold, yes, you can like spray it with bleach and it visibly it seems to go away.

63
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:10,420
But so long as there are still mold spores within that same area, it can always come back.

64
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:17,860
So truly, the only way to remediate your house from mold is to cut out the drywall or cut

65
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:23,260
out sections of the drywall down to the studs and then put up new drywall,

66
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:31,750
rip out the carpeting, put in new carpeting. You can't really just let it dry because underneath the carpeting, generally, you have padding as well.

67
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:38,080
So, you know, because a lot of these people didn't have the knowledge or the financial resources,

68
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:43,030
they come back, they try to remediate their home themselves or wait until they can return.

69
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:51,970
And they're living in a home with potentially heavy mold or black mold, which is extremely toxic for years and years and years.

70
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:56,050
And what do we know are the long term health effects of mold?

71
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:08,589
Anyone? I don't know specifically, but respiratory issues for sure.

72
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:11,650
It can exacerbate asthma. Anything else?

73
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:24,880
No neurocognitive issues that can cause brain fogginess.

74
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:33,100
It can cause, for example, just general malaise and fatigue.

75
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:38,950
Just like an unspecified, like, feeling of, you know,

76
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:43,360
like when you're you ever get that feeling when they are sick, but you can't put your finger on it.

77
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:46,540
And also depresses your immune system as well.

78
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:54,400
And some people for years and years and years live like this and they can't figure out what the source actually is.

79
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:03,339
When I was when I was working at Indiana University in a lot of the dorms, they found black mold.

80
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:08,919
And there was like a huge class action lawsuit from the students and the parents.

81
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:16,020
Just because the students were chronically getting sick, it was difficult for them to, like, focus on their studies.

82
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:20,800
And you can imagine, like the number of accommodations that came through that is pre-COVID.

83
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:30,760
But the interesting thing there was there was no central air circulation in the lot of the dorms because they're super old.

84
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:34,480
But you also weren't allowed to open the windows, right?

85
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,900
Because students can't necessarily control the humidity and moisture.

86
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:46,210
So essentially they had to move all the students out of those dorms into temporary dorms and like remediate, remediate, remediate.

87
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:52,110
But the thing is that they didn't rather them like tearing like like I said, tearing out sections of drywall.

88
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:55,080
They just tried to spot treat and that kept coming back.

89
00:09:55,090 --> 00:10:03,129
So a lot of times, you know, if you're trying to remediate more, do you want to get professionals to do it costs more,

90
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:08,980
but you want to make sure you do it once and the job is done rather than having to come back and do it over and over and over again.

91
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:15,820
I'm sure you see it here. I mean, on our ceiling tiles in particular, we just generally not in this classroom, but as much.

92
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:21,940
But if you walk in the hallways, you'll see like a lot of water damage and some of them do have mold in particular,

93
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:28,510
but they'll just like replace the ceiling tile. So but this is a huge issue.

94
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:32,020
This is this is an issue after every hurricane.

95
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:35,410
And I'm sure we're going to see this after Hurricane Ian,

96
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:45,069
although I have seen I was on watching some TikTok videos last night about people preparing in Florida and, you know, getting pretty creative,

97
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:52,600
like putting their table legs into buckets so that when the water comes, it doesn't like, you know,

98
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:57,400
damage the bottom of the furniture and like wrapping their furniture up and all of that.

99
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:04,360
But there is there is likely just constant mold growth in a lot of those homes in that area.

100
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,260
Yes. Okay. Here it is. Okay.

101
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:17,290
So sinus infection, respiratory symptoms, difficulty concentrating, depression, diarrhea, digestive health effects and then joint pain.

102
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:28,090
So these are all, you know, problematic, but also nonspecific enough where it's like if you can't put two and two together per se,

103
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:34,120
like you might feel chronically ill for years and not understand that it's coming from where you live.

104
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:42,040
Okay. So before we move on to Flint, any questions or comments about Katrina?

105
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:52,060
Okay. All right, Flynt. So I'm sure you've talked about this in your other classes to some degree.

106
00:11:52,880 --> 00:12:03,010
See, some had not. So just as a recap, this was a public health crisis that started in Flint, Michigan, in 2014, not too far from here, actually.

107
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:09,070
And it was officially declared over in 2019.

108
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:16,800
But some of this some of the problems that caused the water crisis there are still going on today.

109
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:23,080
And we still see some of those same issues in Benton Harbor on the west side.

110
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,850
Yes, the west side of the mitten.

111
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:36,900
So essentially how this all started was like due to a budget crisis in Flint, because Flint historically was like a big auto manufacturing city.

112
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:46,470
And as manufacturing moved abroad or closed down or moved elsewhere, the finances of the city started to get really stretched.

113
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:54,480
So in an attempt to change to save money, the primary water source was change from the Detroit River.

114
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:02,370
The Water and Sewage Department, which comes from Lake Huron and the Detroit River to the Flint River.

115
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:12,660
So if you live here in Ann Arbor, most of your water comes from.

116
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,830
Here. They here are. Yeah, I live in Ypsi. So sorry.

117
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:25,240
I had that. The other reason. So where I live in Ypsi. Half of this half.

118
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:31,180
I live in Superior Township, technically. Half of this half of the township gets their water from here on.

119
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:34,840
And I'm in the half that gets it from Detroit. Uh huh.

120
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:40,720
So Flint was getting theirs from Detroit, but they switch over to Flint.

121
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:46,000
So this is considered a huge environmental justice issues, though,

122
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,520
because of Flint's demographics, where nearly 60% are African-American, 40% are white.

123
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:59,740
Those who are white are still low. CISO, Benton Harbor is even more minority than this population.

124
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:10,680
And so with the water switched over, the water was contaminated heavily with lead and Legionella bacteria.

125
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:18,910
So if you can see in these images here, these are water samples pulled from Flint in January of 2015,

126
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:26,710
looking at the different gradients of the water color. If you look at pictures of Benton Harbor, the water is even darker than that.

127
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:36,910
So obviously, like I would notice and residents noticed a taste in change, a change in taste, smell and appearance of the water.

128
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:41,590
And they didn't allow you to put corrosion inhibitors.

129
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,160
They didn't apply corrosion inhibitors to the water.

130
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:52,480
So essentially this water coloration is from old that pipes just leaching water into the water supply.

131
00:14:53,190 --> 00:15:00,070
Okay. It exposed over 100,000 residents to elevated blood lead levels.

132
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:07,330
So in the short term, this causes things like abdominal pain, constipation, fatigue, irritability.

133
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:13,599
Maybe you have some neuropathy, which is pain and tingling in your hands.

134
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:24,010
But chronically for adults, you won't get depression, memory loss, high blood pressure, heart disease, kidney disease and then reduced fertility.

135
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:34,450
But it's extremely detrimental in terms of neurological effects in children because it can delay or negatively impact their brain development.

136
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:42,460
So as we know for the outcomes for specifically black children who generally have, you know,

137
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:47,590
black women, as we talked about with the weathering effect higher in info mortality rates,

138
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:54,490
lower gestational birth rates probably live in communities that don't have great access to health care,

139
00:15:54,500 --> 00:16:01,120
a ton of access to health care, live in districts where the school systems aren't necessarily the best.

140
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,809
Right. And now, because of systemic racism,

141
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:15,250
are being placed even further behind the starting line because of environmental racism and issues that manifest like the Flint water crisis.

142
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:23,620
But even though, like I said, this was a public health crisis that started in 2014,

143
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:32,380
a state of emergency for the county was not declared until two years later in 2016.

144
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:41,860
Okay. Government officials, though, in the city of Flint and the EPA did end up resigning, though, over mishandling of the situation.

145
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:52,450
And then some of them were actually fired. Right. Because, I mean, at this point, it's like it was like a huge national news thing, messy.

146
00:16:53,770 --> 00:17:00,250
Somebody has to pay the price. So they did fire a couple of people just to show like, you know, heads rolling or whatever.

147
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:02,860
But obviously that did not solve the issue.

148
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:12,250
And then criminal cases that have been filed against state and local officials, all but one charge was dismissed or dropped.

149
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:16,900
And then pipe replacement did begin in 2016.

150
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:25,989
But as of 2019, there is still 20 $500, 2500 lead service pipes in place.

151
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:28,240
So it's not been fully replaced.

152
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:37,120
There was a huge settlement with the people who live in Flint to give them like some financial compensation for this whole situation.

153
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:44,440
But the investment in essentially revamping the infrastructure still has not entirely happened.

154
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:52,750
So you can see like Michigan National Guard there providing water filters, cartridges, test kits, etc.

155
00:17:53,020 --> 00:18:01,239
And people who live there to this day still do not trust that the water sources clean or at, you know, safe drinking levels,

156
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:06,760
even though officials have declared it so and are still using like bottled water and these types of things.

157
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:17,040
How many of you remember Little Miss Bland? She's a grown adult now and this issue still hasn't been addressed.

158
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:22,470
But let's watch this. This video about five years into the water crisis.

159
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:32,830
I think she just went to college, actually. 2019, as we just saw with your meal, the mantra is, make your mess, your message.

160
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:38,650
And that's just what one young girl did for her hometown and on Earth Day.

161
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:43,629
You all know this is Earth Day to day. We are highlighting one of our favorite environmental activists.

162
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:48,070
Little Miss Flint is her name. We first met her at the beginning of the Flint water crisis.

163
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:55,120
Now almost five years. It's been five years, y'all. Here's a look at the huge impact 111 year old is having.

164
00:18:56,350 --> 00:19:04,389
My name is Mike Green. I'm let me go let me give you a little list which this bright and bubbly sixth grader from Flint,

165
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:07,540
Michigan, has a real thirst for environmental change.

166
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:13,180
I want to speak up and say, hey, the water is bad because someone please fix it.

167
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:19,630
But they never did fix it. I said, Well, listen to me, because I'm taking matters into her own hands.

168
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:23,140
Little Miss Flint did what I like to say and made her mess.

169
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:26,740
Her message. 150.

170
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:36,040
Putting on weekly water distribution events for thousands of Flint residents with limited access to clean water.

171
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:40,150
After nearly five years since the start of the water crisis,

172
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:46,480
people are still using bottled water and they're not drinking or using the water to do anything.

173
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:50,740
After Flint's water source was switched to the Flint River in 2014,

174
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:57,400
nearly 100 people were critically ill 12 losing their life after drinking the lead contaminated water.

175
00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:01,450
A lot of people think, oh, well, you know, we don't see it on the news anymore. So the water crisis must be done.

176
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:08,410
Their water must be better. Absolutely not. I'm definitely not ever drinking the water and I'm never going to let my son drink it again.

177
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,389
I just put it up at the mouth.

178
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:20,230
It just fell out with nearly 100,000 followers, Murray receiving global attention, reminding the world that they, too, can make a difference.

179
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:28,360
One person tweeting its support. Love this. I teach STEM and my students were in shock that the U.S. has places with poor water.

180
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:35,919
So inspired by Little Miss Flint, the impact she's having here within our organization and also in the city is just massive.

181
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:40,060
And it's really amazing to see an 11 year old just doing so much.

182
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:47,290
She does good things because I like to help her with it, like she gives water and she thinks about others and not just like yourself.

183
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:53,740
As we celebrate Earth Day to day. Mari reminds us that a clean earth is worth fighting for.

184
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:07,470
You know. Well, she's great, but a lot of reactions to that video.

185
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:15,530
One tweet. That kind of. Surprise.

186
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:20,280
Really? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Are there other parts or.

187
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:28,270
I think going quietly lose was not hard to teach.

188
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:33,840
I have thoughts, obviously, but you don't. Yes. I feel like it should be up to like.

189
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:41,919
I know she was ten when she started. Yes. Should be up to someone that young to like take on that much of a responsibility

190
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:46,660
or like something that the federal government could do a lot more easily.

191
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,989
Yes. Thank you. Yes, yes.

192
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:54,220
Yes. I didn't know. Another one and one. Another version when I taught this class.

193
00:21:54,660 --> 00:22:01,570
One person who didn't really get the message was like, Well, communities need to learn how to help themselves.

194
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:12,870
Like, Oh, we are missing the message, Fred. But yeah, it should the onus should not be on a child to solve a systemic issue or water crisis.

195
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:17,400
It should not be up to gratitude and berg to fix climate change.

196
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:22,870
It's great that there are these like young advocates out there putting attention on the issue,

197
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:26,890
but obviously this is, you know, an infrastructure issue. Like I showed you,

198
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:35,380
there's the slides from the American Society of Civil Engineering showing just how bad the infrastructure in this country is crumbling.

199
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:41,420
And obviously for these communities, like water is literally life.

200
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:50,229
Right. So in the back of my mind, I am thinking about all the plastic waste that's associated with this.

201
00:22:50,230 --> 00:23:01,510
And then these water bottles probably have BPA in them and all of these other things, but it's like which of the lesser of two evils will you take?

202
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:07,389
But really what they need to do is just tear out all the old pipes and put in new pipes.

203
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:12,549
Right. And so, you know, originally people were so optimistic about.

204
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:19,960
But you optimistic about like, you know, really rich people doing philanthropy, things like, you know,

205
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:30,820
how Elon Musk said like some of his Tesla energy sells to Puerto Rico to rebuild the energy grid.

206
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:37,030
And they were like, oh, my gosh, like, you know, Jeff Bezos now has this Amazon online pharmacy thing.

207
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:46,300
Like, he has so much money, like, is he going to solve like the hunger crisis in the United States or like give Flint clean water?

208
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:52,449
You know, he just almost bought Twitter and that and that fell through.

209
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:57,100
And now Twitter is trying to sue for some money back, so.

210
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:07,960
Oh, yes, yes. Burnley, when you declared a state of emergency, the money that comes from that was that paying for the water was just removed.

211
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:12,430
And that area, that state of emergency money, go to fixing the pipes.

212
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:20,290
Some of it did. Right. So when they declared the state of emergency, so at the local level that elevated to the state level,

213
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:23,530
which then you have to do that to like get the federal resources.

214
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:27,610
So as as we saw like in from Tuesday,

215
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:34,180
a lot of the local infrastructure repairs now fall in the budgets of like local and state governments rather than federal governments.

216
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:43,360
So they did prioritize, you know, getting the National Guard out there, getting water, trying to rebuild some things.

217
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:54,470
But a lot of the water that comes in is just like charitable, charitable donations and like nonprofits and like those kinds of places.

218
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:58,209
Right. Or people having to, like, go out and buy it themselves.

219
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:03,700
And I'm sure we will see the same thing happen in years to come.

220
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:09,040
And in Jackson, Mississippi, we didn't talk about it as much in this class.

221
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:16,710
I talked about more in my online class of a Jackson, there's was a water treatment facility that failed.

222
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:21,910
It wasn't necessarily the piping, which the piping is more problematic.

223
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:24,340
Right, because it runs into everybody's house.

224
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:30,340
But if you can address the point source, which is the water treatment plan, hopefully things kind of go back on the up and up.

225
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:36,879
But again, that's an infrastructure issue as well. Abbie, I read, but this is pretty good.

226
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:45,070
But the other part about the Flint water crisis, I think at the time they had implemented an emergency manager for the city,

227
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:50,920
not for like like for cities that were in financial financially struggling,

228
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:55,210
which was like a thing that was created in the Governor Snyder's administration.

229
00:25:55,220 --> 00:26:01,590
Yes. So like they weren't they were like under control of something that wasn't even like from the city or like

230
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:07,660
had literally been appointed to plan to run things because of their financial situation and the city.

231
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,980
And like that was the emergency manager at the time during the Flint water crisis.

232
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:24,040
Yeah. Yeah. Same thing going on in Benton Harbor where the person who's the emergency manager is kind of a do nothing person as well.

233
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:28,810
To Snyder still have his apartment here in Ann Arbor.

234
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:33,490
I don't know. He was out of here. I feel like I.

235
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:39,280
I come to state. Every time I come to us, I move to a state. It becomes destabilized.

236
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:44,440
Like. Like when I moved to Indiana. Like Pence became vice president.

237
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:49,770
And then when I moved here, they tried to murder Governor Whitmer anyway.

238
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:59,049
I don't know if it's me or just a timing. So Legionella is is is what causes Legionnaires disease.

239
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:09,310
And this is a type of pneumonia. Right. And the change in water supply in Flint, they suspected caused 87 cases and 12 deaths.

240
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:17,020
Right. But they never found the original source of the bacteria, but they suspect it came from three potential sources.

241
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:20,920
Now, Legionella usually breeds in water cooling towers.

242
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:25,059
That's like the most common place for it. Die.

243
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:30,280
Tell the story of legionella. I think I do water or they suspect it to be nosocomial.

244
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:37,419
Meaning that the infection spread within a health care facility or it started at the water in the homes.

245
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:43,930
But doing their contact tracing and their investigation, they can never figure out where the source of Legionella was in Flint.

246
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:53,800
So like I said, Legionella is naturally found in fresh water, but it can contaminate hot water, tanks, hot tubs, cooling towers.

247
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:56,649
The symptoms, again, are very nonspecific.

248
00:27:56,650 --> 00:28:04,780
So cough, shortness of breath, high fever, muscle pains, anything like that, we call it ill or influenza like.

249
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:13,360
And the incubation period for this is 2 to 10 days, but this is spread through mist and aerosols containing the bacteria.

250
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:19,180
So if you like, turn on water. Like every time you turn on water, there's some kind of Mr. Aerosol.

251
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:30,519
Generally not person to person, though. There is no vaccine available, but it can be treated with antibiotics if it is properly detected.

252
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:38,380
But hospitalizations often are required. So risk factors for this include old age history of smoking,

253
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:45,790
chronic lung disease or compromised immune system of about one in ten people who are healthy may die from it,

254
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:53,740
but one in four people who have underlying conditions are co-morbidities will die from Legionnaires disease.

255
00:28:54,460 --> 00:29:02,530
Recently, there was a mysterious outbreak in Argentina, which they were like, Oh my gosh, is this like another like pandemic thing coming?

256
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:08,740
But it turned out to be Legionnaires disease. What they figured it out to be, I think like 12, 11 or 12 people died.

257
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:16,870
So primary prevention is also key for preventing Legionnaires disease because there are a way

258
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:22,960
to keep cooling towers clean so that this bacteria doesn't have the opportunity to breed,

259
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:32,590
which, again, Flint officials failed to do. Comments or thoughts about Flint before we move on.

260
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:40,630
Okay. So structural racism in emergency response.

261
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:49,270
So with how emergency response in the United States is structured for major disasters,

262
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:53,679
we're going to assume most of the time the state of emergency is declared.

263
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:57,070
Right. So like with what's going on again with Hurricane Ian right now,

264
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:05,260
so allocation of resources and support is generally determined by the federal government and

265
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:11,330
those who are in leadership have the power to make sure something is urgently addressed or not.

266
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:24,370
Right. So we talked about how that leadership example said after Hurricane Sandy and they consider disasters to be the great leveler essentially

267
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:32,980
of these disaster events is what makes the health inequities and disparities in this country just stick out like a sore thumb.

268
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,620
So in this picture here,

269
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:46,930
we have Air National Guard members delivering water and food to people who are stranded after Katrina on the side of the highway.

270
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:56,050
So after Katrina, there was a lot of heat on FEMA, a lot of fallout.

271
00:30:57,070 --> 00:31:04,360
And they did do an internal study of FEMA to look at who's in charge.

272
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:13,540
And they did find that some of their standard operating procedures and the way that they're like who was in in these positions,

273
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:17,710
there was definitely racism in the mix.

274
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:25,749
And I think that, you know, I would say, like here at this institution,

275
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:31,930
we have the benefit to talk openly about these kinds of issues, because if we were like, you know,

276
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:34,450
in a different institution and a different place in the country,

277
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:40,269
I don't know that we would be able to speak so candidly about this or if it would be acknowledged even.

278
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:47,049
But I think in our own lives you have the ability to see how when certain people are in

279
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:53,170
positions in the federal government like that can really shape the outcomes and the policies.

280
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:59,520
Even like, you know, when you're the dean of your department chair or the chair of your department changes or the like,

281
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:03,909
the dean of the school changes, even like the president of a university changes, right.

282
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:10,060
Like that can lead to some very big differences. Yes.

283
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:21,340
But again, with this, like the disasters at the great as the great leveler underscores vulnerability of persons who have differences in income,

284
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:30,309
poverty, social class, race, ethnicity, physical ability, language, competency, their social capital, gender,

285
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:37,150
household makeup up, and then the intersectionality again of underrepresented communities.

286
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:51,190
This is of, again, the convention center in New Orleans, where people were evacuated, according to a legal analysis from the American Bar Association,

287
00:32:51,790 --> 00:33:00,760
most people, most black people in the United States live in these ten states that you see highlighted in blue.

288
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:09,220
And many of those states are coastal and super vulnerable to hurricanes and sea level rise from climate change.

289
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:13,210
But these ten states are also known as the cancer belt,

290
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:22,659
just because they tend to be more friendly to large corporations or businesses that manufacture like oil,

291
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:26,860
gas, DuPont, even that was like in West Virginia.

292
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:30,130
If you watch the movie Black Dark Waters, which was really good,

293
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:38,980
and that has led to higher chance of oil spills and these things in particular that generally hit black,

294
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:43,420
indigenous and persons of communities of color the hardest.

295
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:50,100
Have any of you ever lived in any of these states? I have not.

296
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:54,360
Oh, so I haven't I haven't lived there. But my mom did always stayed.

297
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:58,460
She lived in a couple of other states, live in North Carolina. In South Carolina.

298
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:01,319
She lived in New York, too. Okay. Yeah, they travel well when you're younger.

299
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:07,570
But something that stood out to me is that there was such a lack of awareness when she was younger, she told me, was from India.

300
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:10,860
No one had ever heard of it, no one knew about it.

301
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:15,630
So I think I feel like that in that area, even now, there's still a lack of awareness and a lot of things about it.

302
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:19,830
Was she in like a Raleigh-Durham or like a small town?

303
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:24,150
I think in a bigger city. Okay. Wow.

304
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:27,329
What was I mean, obviously, at that time,

305
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:35,290
I'm guessing when she was growing up not experiencing the same level of natural disasters as now, but like was it a pleasant experience?

306
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:39,090
I think so, yeah. She was good, decent in the South, which I think is interesting.

307
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:43,860
I wouldn't have expected that from her because she was in Wisconsin for the second half of like high school and stuff.

308
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:49,110
Okay. But you said, yeah, every state is different, but there were a lot of similarities in terms of like awareness,

309
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:51,120
what people knew about both their culture and like,

310
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:56,130
you know, a lot of things I thought was interesting that people don't know in cities and countries the way we do now.

311
00:34:56,580 --> 00:35:00,540
But it was baffling. Right. Right. Yeah, it is.

312
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:08,069
It's wild. My mom often fantasizes about a different life that she can have.

313
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:12,120
So she currently lives in Sacramento, California, which is like kind of like right here.

314
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:20,550
And she just like sometimes randomly watches YouTube videos and she was like, you know where I think I'd like to live Atlanta?

315
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:30,870
And I was like, Why would you want to do that? Number one, California, while hot and has its issues, is nice.

316
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:35,580
Like you live in a really big city with a huge Vietnamese community.

317
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,970
She has a phobia of driving on the freeway.

318
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:45,930
Okay, so I tell you, like if she accidentally gets on an on ramp, she will stop driving or like turn around.

319
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:49,230
And we are like, you literally cannot do that because you will, like, cause an accident.

320
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:56,399
Have any of you ever been in Atlanta? It is like exclusively freeways and people drive crazy.

321
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,970
There I was like, Hey, you stop watching T.V., okay?

322
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:08,460
Cause these are just like other Vietnamese people on YouTube. But, um, I while like a why do you think most black people live in these ten states?

323
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:15,060
Why? Swati. We're sorry.

324
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:21,030
Mira, sorry. I'm sorry. I think, like, especially in the coastal communities, a lot of good gentrification.

325
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:24,959
Some people are pushed to the edges and I think they probably have a lower cost of living.

326
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:31,390
And they grew up there because it's kind of where like we're like that's where people originate a lot.

327
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:35,920
And I feel like a lot of people settled down and didn't really move because there's obviously people in all the states know.

328
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:39,089
But I feel like that's still there's also effects from that.

329
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:40,710
And I just feel like also being on the coast,

330
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:46,560
more people are push their share of flooding and low incomes and no one knows like the rich people live there anyways.

331
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:50,610
Sure, sure. Burnley was the biggest thing I think is the slavery.

332
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:55,650
Yes. Yeah, that's what I'm sorry. Out of out of the South.

333
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:59,639
And there's actually a great book called the The Warmth of Other Suns.

334
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:05,390
And it's about this whole the saga of like going and the waves, the great migration to the north.

335
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:09,150
Um, but the, I mean, as we talked about,

336
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:15,180
I feel like in terms of evacuation that's like really hard to leave an area that you know and that

337
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:20,760
you were yeah you're kidnaped from continent brought over here then this is what you know so.

338
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:27,870
Right, right. Yeah. So like, like if we think about I don't have a map of the whole world here,

339
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:33,839
but just geographically, if you were to go from Europe across the Atlantic Ocean, right?

340
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:41,550
All the colonies originally settled in like Virginia and the original colonies, Virginia, the Carolinas, Georgia.

341
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:49,050
And during like, you know, the Civil War, these were the states that were in the Confederacy as well.

342
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:54,510
Lots of slave holding states, people generally.

343
00:37:54,540 --> 00:38:02,279
Yeah, like once they were emancipated there, sometimes they were granted land, sometimes they were not granted land.

344
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,640
But again, that's where they were brought and that's where their families were.

345
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:12,329
In the Carolinas, there's like a super rich culture of like the Gold Geechee and all of these

346
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:18,030
different racial ethnic groups that are really embedded in the community there.

347
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:25,230
There's this really good Netflix documentary docu series called High on the Hog.

348
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:35,879
Don't watch it when you're hungry, though. But it does talk about like essentially like African-American food culture in the South and why,

349
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:40,830
like, so many are still there and like the Carolina gold, rice and all that kind of stuff.

350
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:54,870
But unfortunately, these also happen to be now in predominantly Republican states where there isn't a lot of infrastructure funding for public health.

351
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:03,629
The joke in public health that Alabama and Mississippi have between themselves is like, at least we're not Mississippi, or at least we're not Alabama,

352
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:05,730
because generally out of the 50 states,

353
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:13,710
they have some of the lowest outcomes in terms of different health factors when you're looking at cardiovascular risk smoking, etc.

354
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:22,680
So again, yeah, historically this has environmental racism is nothing new.

355
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:30,659
During the great Mississippi flood of 1927, when they were able to be granted land,

356
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:37,680
black sharecroppers generally could only afford land that were closer to the river.

357
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:43,530
Right, because those property values were lower because they knew it was greater at risk for flooding.

358
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:52,139
And black survivors were often housed in segregated tent cities with little to no support from the government.

359
00:39:52,140 --> 00:40:01,530
And as we've seen here, even in like gentrification, suburban negotiation, whatever you want to call it, you know,

360
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:07,620
generally like the white flight, you know, further north, south, east or west, depending on the city that you live in.

361
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:15,989
In 1995, there was a super deadly heat wave in Chicago that resulted in almost 800 deaths.

362
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:21,510
And it was mostly elderly black people who were living in substandard housing that

363
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:26,550
weren't up to code and didn't have proper air conditioning and all that kind of stuff.

364
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:37,529
Yeah. So these are some examples, Hurricane Irma and Maria, and now that we'll see it with Fiona, there's this paper,

365
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:42,089
I believe I put it on canvas for you called Race and Racism as Structural Determinants for

366
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:47,970
Emergency Recovery Response in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria and Irma in Puerto Rico.

367
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:53,399
As I mentioned, for this class, I am a curator of your materials.

368
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:58,680
So generally I tried to pick pieces for you to read from scholars of color.

369
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:08,280
So if we recall, structural racism can also mean access to labor materials, symbolic resources, physical resources.

370
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:12,240
So because Puerto Rico is an unincorporated.

371
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,310
Rated territory of the United States.

372
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:21,390
There's a very complicated sociopolitical relationship right there trying they've been trying to get statehood for a while,

373
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:28,800
but don't want them to get statehood because then they'll be able to vote in elections and they're going to lean a certain way.

374
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:34,020
But they do contribute to the annual appropriation funding for FEMA.

375
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:39,510
FEMA gets hundreds of millions of dollars appropriated to them every year.

376
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:46,500
So because they are it's not like they're not feeding into these appropriation funds and therefore they shouldn't get it.

377
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:51,420
They totally are. But again, FEMA's response in Puerto Rico was totally limited.

378
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:56,970
Like, again, certain areas didn't have power for like 11, 12 months.

379
00:41:57,390 --> 00:42:01,430
Could you imagine living with power without power for 11 to 12 months?

380
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:06,190
Like, even like here. D t terrible.

381
00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:10,530
This is the worst power grid out of four states I've ever lived in.

382
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:14,820
Like a stiff breeze will take out my power.

383
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:20,490
It's crazy. But even, like, after 36 hours, I'm like, this sucks.

384
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:28,890
And now I have to throw away. I did have to do a grocery purge and the great power outage of summer 2021, if you all remember that one.

385
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:33,880
Yeah, yeah, that was a bummer. But 11 months.

386
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:39,360
Like, please, I would, you know. Try to go somewhere else if I could.

387
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:42,450
Whatever explorer turn it of options. I don't know.

388
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:51,600
So in this paper, they conducted 16 semi-structured interviews to better understand victim's perceptions of the hurricane.

389
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:59,850
So this was a qualitative study. So these people in particular contrasted the response in Puerto Rico to Hurricane Harvey,

390
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:07,860
which kind of happened around the same time, and natural disasters in Florida, where the populations were predominantly white.

391
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:15,390
And these Puerto Ricans noted differences in the level of response and the rapidity of response.

392
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:23,639
But colonialism is not sustainable because it is a barrier to federal and international aid.

393
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:31,400
And historically, throughout the world, like colonialism was like the main the main thing, right?

394
00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:35,310
So like, you know, Queen Elizabeth, the second recently passed away.

395
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:41,609
Now, you know, they they I was watching like this again to talk about like, oh, well,

396
00:43:41,610 --> 00:43:48,749
look at all the like colonies that she let be free during her her reign or whatever.

397
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:52,530
But it's like nobody enjoys colonization.

398
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:58,860
Even Vietnam was colonized by by the French and Portugal for some time.

399
00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:07,290
And it's a barrier to federal and international aid, because when you're under this assumption of colonialism,

400
00:44:07,650 --> 00:44:12,630
that's the country that owns you, so to speak, is expected to take care of you.

401
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:24,450
So, you know, if it was like truly a national crisis or whatever, where you might get mutual aid from people coming from Australia,

402
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:32,940
Switzerland, whatever, because you're a territory, because you're a colony, you can't necessarily expect those those possibilities.

403
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:40,889
Community for philanthropy is also inhibited by structural racism when provision of resources is dependent on governments,

404
00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:46,920
authorities and organizations. So it wasn't that nobody was trying to help Puerto Rico.

405
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:57,480
People were trying to help Puerto Rico, but it was just such a mess from the federal side and a hodgepodge of different groups trying to respond.

406
00:44:57,810 --> 00:45:03,870
There were literally pallets of food ships there just sitting for three weeks and

407
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:10,049
rotting because they didn't know how to organize it or process it or efficiently,

408
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:14,580
like unpack everything, right. So these are the kinds of issues that they have.

409
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:20,370
And again, 80% of the electrical grid was knocked out and took almost 11 months to restore power.

410
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:26,760
Now we're going to kind of see the same thing, Fiona, but you know, Hurricane Harvey.

411
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:33,089
So I will say for those of you, I don't think everybody has their computer in the announcements for the class.

412
00:45:33,090 --> 00:45:37,800
I did put a link to the jam board activity that we're going to work on in a second.

413
00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:48,090
But I will say Hurricane Harvey wasn't all beautiful and perfect and the response or whatever, because it is a super duper diverse city.

414
00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:55,740
Yes. Do people do white people live there? Yeah. But there's also a huge Hispanic Latino population.

415
00:45:56,070 --> 00:46:02,160
And one of the biggest Vietnamese populations in the United States lives in Houston.

416
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:12,750
So interestingly, like I don't think I show it in this class, but FEMA, in order to receive housing credits from FEMA.

417
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:13,979
So this is a fun fact.

418
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:28,770
If any of you own a home one day, if you live in a house and it floods your home, insurance doesn't cover flooding from a natural disaster.

419
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:36,930
So if your house floods cause like, I don't know, your water heater exploded or like something like that,

420
00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:40,560
you might you'll probably be able to claim it from insurance.

421
00:46:41,010 --> 00:46:49,500
But if you are live in Florida and you are prone to hurricanes, you have to buy specific flood insurance from FEMA.

422
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:52,800
Yeah, it's separate from your home insurance.

423
00:46:54,120 --> 00:47:02,129
Took that little nugget away in your brain, but also never waive a home inspection even if you really want a house.

424
00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:06,480
Because some of the important things is they'll look at how your land is graded.

425
00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:18,450
So if you live on a property that's super flat, if it even floods for a little bit and water moves towards your house, that's a big issue I live in.

426
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:23,459
I bought a new a brand new house because I had it when I was worried about those things.

427
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:28,260
But like Michael Scott says, I'm not superstitious, but I'm a little suspicious.

428
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:33,120
And because I couldn't see houses when I bought it, because it's the pandemic, I didn't want to live in a haunted house.

429
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:36,600
Okay. I'm not trying to live in a haunted house in Ann Arbor. So.

430
00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:42,230
My basement, luckily has a sump pump in case flooding happens.

431
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:45,530
But other people in my neighborhood, their houses and graded as high as mine.

432
00:47:45,830 --> 00:47:50,750
So when there was heavy rain last winter, some of their basements did get flood.

433
00:47:52,850 --> 00:47:54,470
But with FEMA,

434
00:47:54,770 --> 00:48:06,200
there is a New York Times article that you can look up where they looked at two families who made nearly identical claims to FEMA for housing damage.

435
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:10,550
They had nearly identical housing damage. Same zip code.

436
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:15,230
One guy was white, another couple was black.

437
00:48:15,950 --> 00:48:23,089
And the guy the white guy received almost $17,000 in credits from FEMA.

438
00:48:23,090 --> 00:48:27,320
And the white and the black couple received less than half of that.

439
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:33,170
There was also another recent article in The New York Times about this black

440
00:48:33,170 --> 00:48:37,400
faculty member who who was trying to sell his house and get his house appraised.

441
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:43,129
Right. And when he was there, it got appraised for much lower,

442
00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:50,510
whereas when he had his white colleague pretend to own the house and get it appraised, it came back in much higher.

443
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:56,690
Right. So these things are so very real. So, I mean, in this article here, we're not going to have to read through all of it.

444
00:48:56,700 --> 00:49:02,120
So this is a Hispanic family where they live on the northeast side of Houston.

445
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:09,310
This is five years after Hurricane Harvey and a lot of the city has not been rebuilt.

446
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:16,520
So the federal government budgeted $9.3 million so communities could rebuild and get ready for the next storm.

447
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:20,750
But city and regional governments delivered little of those funds,

448
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:32,300
and the state agency competition held back aid for the Department of Housing and Urban Development to upgrade things like drainage system.

449
00:49:32,310 --> 00:49:39,590
So as a result, many low income communities have not had their infrastructure upgraded.

450
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:47,510
Okay. I have a colleague who lives in Houston, but she lives in the Bel Air neighborhood near Uthealth, which is super nice.

451
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:55,610
She had enough money to get her house lifted and put on new concrete foundation that costs a lot of money.

452
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:58,190
Not everybody has the benefit of doing that.

453
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:08,330
So 2018, the year after Harvey HUD allocated $5 billion to Texas through a block grant for the disaster recovery program.

454
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:13,440
They sent money to the Texas General Land Office, etc., etc.

455
00:50:13,970 --> 00:50:18,800
2020 The feud ended with the state seizing control of the program.

456
00:50:20,030 --> 00:50:27,200
Only 297 of 8800 applicants received the funds for this build back.

457
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:33,360
And then in Harris County, again, ongoing kind of issues.

458
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:37,100
Instead, funds largely went to small, wider inland towns.

459
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:44,990
They went to drainage upgrades in Rockdale, a two hour drive northwest of Houston, sewage improvements in Nixon,

460
00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:54,350
a small town outside of San Antonio that emerged from Harvey unscathed and sheltered evacuees fleeing the storm.

461
00:50:54,380 --> 00:51:00,170
So they're giving them to inland counties rather than the city directly affected.

462
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:05,450
And so, yeah, a huge justice issue.

463
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:14,000
They're filing complaints against HUD. And essentially this falls not only to the federal government, but the state government in particular.

464
00:51:14,510 --> 00:51:18,620
And who is the current governor of Texas?

465
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:22,680
Greg Abbott. Greg Abbott. Ah ha.

466
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:26,930
So we'll see what is to unfold.

467
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:38,600
But for this activity here, because there is likely another one to come, how many of you use GM board before you know how to jam board?

468
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:43,230
Kind of. So Jan board. You should all be able to edit it.

469
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:46,490
So this is essentially kind of like a digital,

470
00:51:48,250 --> 00:51:59,190
like a like a white board or like one of those like big sticky things where you can put like a post-it note with like your comment, blah, blah, blah.

471
00:51:59,810 --> 00:52:09,799
And then you can change the color and then you can, you know, stick it on here or some people.

472
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:13,460
And then you can also upvote people's sticky notes as well.

473
00:52:15,110 --> 00:52:22,160
And then if you want to be really creative, I've had some classes where you can also have drawing capabilities if you have a tablet.

474
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:30,860
So people draw beautiful things on the GM board. So I'll put you in groups because I feel like it's so boring if you just like

475
00:52:31,430 --> 00:52:36,139
sit here on your laptop and I stare at you while you're thinking about this,

476
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:43,580
so. For Houston's next hurricane. I know we have one hitting Florida and up and down the East Coast right now,

477
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:54,940
but I want us to think about what can the local and state government feasibly do different to ensure a more equitable response?

478
00:52:54,950 --> 00:53:00,520
Right. So when we think about things, yes, you can say like upgrade infrastructure, right?

479
00:53:00,530 --> 00:53:04,760
But we know that apply take a couple of years to happen. That's still a very valid idea.

480
00:53:06,290 --> 00:53:11,659
You know, feasibly we can't see like move the entire city of Houston inland.

481
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:18,230
Right. But think about what you think would improve the situation, even just a little bit at the local level.

482
00:53:19,250 --> 00:53:25,760
So for groups, just I won't make a bunch of people move.

483
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:41,030
I'll put together Lexy, Swati and Mira and Adriana and Abby, and then I'll have Sal, you can see in Berkeley together.

484
00:53:42,890 --> 00:53:47,450
Or do you want to just stay with this? This friend, Rosario, know what you said?

485
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:50,690
Okay. All right. All right. Group yourselves.

486
00:53:54,140 --> 00:54:00,600
Oh, my name is Matt. Right. Let's say. Sorry, Carly.

487
00:54:01,370 --> 00:54:05,540
Lexie's up here. Sorry. Brain farts.

488
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:23,980
Okay, so one of the things that they can do is get these that are mostly here in New York.

489
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:28,250
Here. Oh, there's a link.

490
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:38,180
Yeah, I just have to get something on the line.

491
00:54:39,710 --> 00:54:39,950
Yeah,

492
00:54:41,330 --> 00:55:03,790
that makes sense to communicate with these people or with the areas that are probably going to be affected by sitting out here in which areas like,

493
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:11,940
you know, from lower level. So are you thinking like any more about us?

494
00:55:14,710 --> 00:55:18,310
Waiting for my way of understanding.

495
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:24,430
I don't feel thinking from like an evacuation standpoint, like in three years.

496
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:43,390
Infrastructure stuff. Again, we need to like consider I have my own budget constraints and I don't know, I've been there like with,

497
00:55:43,470 --> 00:55:51,850
like, you know, like responding or like acting on something like this way ahead of time.

498
00:55:53,140 --> 00:56:04,780
And again, I feel like the shift in strategy is that I don't want to be taught that this is the thing where they know how to do this ahead of time.

499
00:56:05,210 --> 00:56:15,830
Well, I guess natural disaster all because of some things like hurricanes, but they can predict at least I was your movie making reference.

500
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:26,320
And so I'm pretty sure that when you have emergency responders and emergency responders, U.S. military can pick someone.

501
00:56:29,690 --> 00:56:40,570
So they don't have like, you know, they don't have an air bag.

502
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:46,630
Yeah. Cause if they start budget.

503
00:56:51,710 --> 00:57:05,120
I think that becomes the things like shelters with institutions and other areas.

504
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:09,940
And that's obviously a public health emergencies.

505
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:26,080
Yes. Do you think something are the sorts of things that you have addressed over seven specific targeting communities before?

506
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:38,550
This is just, you know, the case in states where they grew up and in cases like this that it's usually the suspects have to be.

507
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:43,640
Yeah I idea the results think it is a concerted.

508
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:57,140
I mean it's a very different 73 I think that's pretty much what happened with the divorce

509
00:57:57,230 --> 00:58:02,720
really around what we have to do because they didn't have anything like it before.

510
00:58:03,470 --> 00:58:15,950
That was, you know, as business as it is at this point in time, it was used and you still can't blame.

511
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:34,190
Okay. No. Okay.

512
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:49,410
So at the moment, there's a lot of of you, but I'm not ready to play jazz, even though we need to.

513
00:58:49,580 --> 00:58:54,870
If that's the thing, if something does, I don't know if they have the standard.

514
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:58,020
Yeah, I think that's what I was saying.

515
00:58:58,830 --> 00:59:15,750
So there's a lot of people like I don't think it's some kind of users that like because I think we might meet again because like disasters,

516
00:59:15,750 --> 00:59:22,560
like hurricanes, you love these, know, you make dollars a week or two in advance that it is going to hit a certain area.

517
00:59:23,970 --> 00:59:27,810
So in terms of like a last minute response,

518
00:59:28,620 --> 00:59:35,999
they can at least come up with a strategy where you can reach out to these communities before you let them know.

519
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:44,830
Okay, so we. Okay, this is what. We can help you guys with that situation.

520
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:49,870
So do you want to notify them so that they believe that they're going to do more than they get?

521
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:55,270
Right. Like, buckle down, your friends with the list. And also a survey.

522
00:59:55,630 --> 00:59:58,690
What would you like?

523
00:59:59,020 --> 01:00:04,950
How can we help? Going to put out anything that could definitely be done right away.

524
01:00:05,050 --> 01:00:15,120
Like when there is an earthquake coming? Yeah. It's more about trying to improve.

525
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:21,060
There comes a situation where you have to evacuate. We have something as a backup.

526
01:00:21,820 --> 01:00:31,840
But that is something that that's entirely dependent on how much funding that the government actually has to be able to rely on this.

527
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:43,360
And I said before that again that, you know, from the community's point of view, it's not easy for them to leave behind their time.

528
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:47,240
And I think there's something after.

529
01:00:48,550 --> 01:00:53,020
It's difficult for them to get members. But for sure.

530
01:00:53,150 --> 01:01:00,640
Yeah. So think and think about. I think that's a good idea to think about how you might want to survey somebody around with the best approach.

531
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:09,590
Yeah, I definitely agree with that. They're going to be like, yeah, we're.

532
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:17,370
Side of the girl is.

533
01:01:24,730 --> 01:01:35,270
The two. Now, my friends and I would like to.

534
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:45,730
Or you don't like. She knows, you know?

535
01:01:49,110 --> 01:01:55,960
Obviously got a nice standing also. I have to be somewhere.

536
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:06,070
During the day and run of age, he said.

537
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:19,060
Have one day. You can certainly have communication regarding emergency response, but that's different languages sometimes and sometimes happens.

538
01:02:21,430 --> 01:02:25,440
There was no instructions from.

539
01:02:27,930 --> 01:02:33,790
For. Yeah.

540
01:02:51,010 --> 01:02:54,750
It was like we were talking to people who lived on the side of the mountain.

541
01:02:55,500 --> 01:03:07,110
Why didn't you let them so expensive?

542
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:16,010
He was going through some things. And so I thought it was a.

543
01:03:18,220 --> 01:03:23,020
It has risen a lot here and is.

544
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:33,800
Doing the other thing, even though I just live, let some disasters happen.

545
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:41,360
I do think about everything, especially they know.

546
01:03:42,380 --> 01:03:45,910
And then when you feel at that level. I think.

547
01:03:45,910 --> 01:03:52,830
What? Disorganization. And when I like in the private I can't if I don't know.

548
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:56,760
Let me give you an idea.

549
01:03:57,090 --> 01:04:01,980
Yeah, exactly. Because they were talking about Florida.

550
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:06,870
Yeah. I was following up on that yesterday.

551
01:04:07,620 --> 01:04:18,580
It's it's just like one of the things you can't really predict how bad it's going to be and how it's always best to consider.

552
01:04:18,610 --> 01:04:23,890
Ah, the one thing about the worst case scenario because as well as the system, you know, prepare for that.

553
01:04:24,490 --> 01:04:28,920
I know that some people are looking for legislators in their houses.

554
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:39,760
I know. And so. I believe that this will be a really, really, really good review.

555
01:04:40,930 --> 01:04:56,110
There's just so much suffering there. And then I think also, strangely enough, I think, yes, there's a lot of health information in the list.

556
01:04:56,120 --> 01:05:09,249
And I think that there's something there. That's why it's important to have some kind of data for each community or understand their culture better.

557
01:05:09,250 --> 01:05:15,120
So it's easy for them to get something else from them.

558
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:25,920
So I think it's great that there is a.

559
01:05:35,820 --> 01:05:45,720
I heard some of those wrapping up and maybe that's because of the crash or the flooding.

560
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:53,750
It's just kind of like one minute maybe.

561
01:05:53,770 --> 01:06:02,590
I like. I like to look at you, and I think there's something there that I didn't realize.

562
01:06:04,670 --> 01:06:13,790
Vaccines, tetanus shots, mainly because you are being exposed to be larger and you have a very hybrid car.

563
01:06:14,540 --> 01:06:20,110
I remember using humans. I remember using like one time with one problem with that.

564
01:06:21,740 --> 01:06:30,640
That. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

565
01:06:30,950 --> 01:06:36,920
Like, if you want things. If. Okay, let's regroup.

566
01:06:37,070 --> 01:06:45,710
I used to have that air horn app on my phone, but I took it off because, like, I used to teach undergrads.

567
01:06:46,490 --> 01:06:50,240
They didn't seem to like it very well. You know what it's like, man?

568
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:59,930
How about that one? Anyway, okay, so we've got some interesting posts on here.

569
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:08,360
I would point to what some are, call out some directly and see which group or the person that was wrote it.

570
01:07:09,020 --> 01:07:16,749
Maybe you can elaborate some more. Number one, work with EPA's Justice Department.

571
01:07:16,750 --> 01:07:21,020
Who put that? Okay. Go ahead. I'm just because I want to be here.

572
01:07:21,020 --> 01:07:27,799
So I know they have a Justice Department that works with community members and local governments specifically to ensure that in any efforts,

573
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:35,600
because obviously a lot of different things not just are in the group, but they don't have a specific supervised Justice Department, just all of EPA.

574
01:07:36,140 --> 01:07:42,660
And so they kind of get involved in a lot of communities and we're used to like an influence strategies that'll help them.

575
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:49,670
Sure. And I don't know how much we are in the Twittersphere, this fresh, fresh as in yesterday, fresh.

576
01:07:50,360 --> 01:08:00,560
The EPA create create officially a national office for Environmental Justice in Civil Rights in order that as of yesterday,

577
01:08:01,190 --> 01:08:10,970
the new EPA administrator, who is a black man, will distribute $3 billion in climate and environmental justice grants to underserved communities.

578
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:18,919
So this is hot off the press. They have three existing programs in the agency and it has more than two.

579
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:23,810
It will have more than 200 staff across the ten regions, an EPA headquarters.

580
01:08:24,770 --> 01:08:31,910
So they're moving towards, you know, trying to pass this with the passed a sweeping climate law.

581
01:08:31,940 --> 01:08:36,139
They're trying to get more hazardous waste sites cleaned up.

582
01:08:36,140 --> 01:08:43,219
They're trying to end discriminatory policies that have come out of redlining and all of this, of course, though, it is the government.

583
01:08:43,220 --> 01:08:51,000
So things will be slow to happen and who knows what if it'll still exist depending on what happens in 2020 or.

584
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:56,060
Oh, but I think it's a step in the right direction, at least some acknowledgment of it.

585
01:08:57,320 --> 01:09:05,790
Okay. Construct safe houses, places to keep people in emergency stadiums.

586
01:09:05,820 --> 01:09:09,090
Who put that? I think all of us.

587
01:09:09,110 --> 01:09:17,959
Yeah. So in the event of, uh, if communities have to evacuate from where they are, it's,

588
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:23,870
I think it's important for them to have, like at least a safe house or a large area where they can,

589
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:36,050
um, temporarily stay and hopefully be provided with enough resources and food supply until the situation kind of subsides, I think.

590
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:43,489
Yeah. Yeah. These, yeah, these places like that or like convention centers are definitely good options for the newer ones.

591
01:09:43,490 --> 01:09:48,319
They usually have these kinds of things in mind now in terms of like when they're building

592
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:52,479
them to be like hurricane proof or like anything that's built in the Bay Area in California,

593
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:58,790
it has to be earthquake proof, essentially. But I think in addition, if it's already constructed,

594
01:09:59,510 --> 01:10:08,629
actually thinking through what it would be like to convert that center into a makeshift emergency shelter so that people aren't

595
01:10:08,630 --> 01:10:17,420
just like sleeping on the floor or like parked camping out next to an elevator like that guy we saw who was a kid during Katrina.

596
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:25,640
Um, let's see. And then your group, we also talked about reach out to communities most affected and prepare them.

597
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:31,010
So how would you do that? What? Like because you wanted to survey these communities, right?

598
01:10:31,340 --> 01:10:35,300
What are we thinking? Door to door. Paper surveys, like a census kind of thing?

599
01:10:36,530 --> 01:10:44,960
Yeah, probably. Yeah. I think that would probably be most effective because telephone surveys probably wouldn't get very many answers.

600
01:10:45,230 --> 01:10:50,420
No. And now people had rarely does a house have a landline anymore.

601
01:10:50,420 --> 01:10:54,570
Everybody has a cell phone. I don't answer my phone if I don't know the number.

602
01:10:54,590 --> 01:11:00,860
Okay. But for these communities in particular, what might work are community health workers.

603
01:11:00,870 --> 01:11:04,930
Are you all familiar with C h W's? Huge part of public health.

604
01:11:04,940 --> 01:11:07,400
They're usually members of the community trusted.

605
01:11:07,850 --> 01:11:15,530
So it build off of your idea they might go door to door or even like hold local events on emergency preparedness.

606
01:11:15,530 --> 01:11:23,569
Kind of what you want to put in your to go kit or your bug out bag how to like properly board up your houses and windows if needed.

607
01:11:23,570 --> 01:11:29,320
Like what kind of supplies should you have on hand? Give out supplies if you don't have it.

608
01:11:29,340 --> 01:11:32,510
Like I've definitely had a few times where my power has been out.

609
01:11:32,810 --> 01:11:36,890
I have a flashlight. Does it work? No.

610
01:11:37,970 --> 01:11:46,640
Um. Okay. Who put? Emergency managers and local health departments should be headed by individuals who hail from the region.

611
01:11:47,090 --> 01:11:52,729
Okay. Yeah. So this is something similar to what I think Avi had mentioned with, like, the Flint emergency manager.

612
01:11:52,730 --> 01:11:56,240
So ideally, you should have the people in charge,

613
01:11:56,240 --> 01:12:00,950
whether that's like the emergency manager or the local health department has to be from the

614
01:12:00,950 --> 01:12:06,290
region because then they're able to identify the areas that are most at risk as well as,

615
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:14,329
you know, the social, cultural, political, economic factors that kind of result in these disparities.

616
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:20,360
So then they're able to more easily address those factors since they know the region.

617
01:12:21,050 --> 01:12:24,380
Right? Like if you lived there, you're invested in the community. Right.

618
01:12:25,100 --> 01:12:32,530
A great. Create backup plans for these emergencies.

619
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:43,970
The winner of that. And I didn't write that.

620
01:12:44,570 --> 01:12:54,680
Okay. You can go back to that. I was like, what do you mean? So so somebody said, perform community needs assessments.

621
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:59,810
Who's that? What do you what do you have in mind for your community needs assessment?

622
01:13:00,050 --> 01:13:06,710
Well, I think this kind of build off of what they were saying, but if you need to, like understand your communities beforehand,

623
01:13:06,830 --> 01:13:15,650
kind of like as a preventative measure before disasters happen, so then you can ensure a more equitable response after the disaster does occur.

624
01:13:16,550 --> 01:13:22,340
Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Focus on primary prevention methods, transportation for emergency response.

625
01:13:22,340 --> 01:13:25,580
Better nutritional options during after disaster.

626
01:13:27,540 --> 01:13:30,660
Your group. Okay. What do you mean? What do you mean?

627
01:13:31,230 --> 01:13:33,990
Transportation. What do you. What do you have in mind?

628
01:13:37,610 --> 01:13:49,180
So will be offered timewise because I think for a lot of like disaster response this the delay in an availability like.

629
01:13:52,010 --> 01:14:03,050
Or. So we're talking like busing people out, like getting big charter busses to bus people out or what are we thinking?

630
01:14:04,300 --> 01:14:15,350
Like, I'm also thinking like in terms of. The fundamental principles or other implication, because if you think, well, you know,

631
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:23,030
there could be problems in, you know, the busses getting out of this flooding event.

632
01:14:23,030 --> 01:14:27,979
And so this kind of like managing transportation, you know,

633
01:14:27,980 --> 01:14:34,190
based on what the situation is like in the moment, having that availability of various types of transport.

634
01:14:34,250 --> 01:14:41,629
Okay. Gotcha. Gotcha. Yeah. Like, for example, during Harvey, when my colleague who ended up elevating her house after the event,

635
01:14:41,630 --> 01:14:44,740
but during the event, her her house did actually flood.

636
01:14:44,750 --> 01:14:52,580
So that's why she raised it up later. But she had a a kayak, so she had a kayak and she would put her little dog.

637
01:14:52,640 --> 01:15:00,830
But she, who's a tiny terrier and a little wear a little life vest, and they would kayak one mile down the road to check on her,

638
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:05,450
her elderly mother, who lived by herself just to see what it was like.

639
01:15:05,450 --> 01:15:08,540
But not everybody has a kayak, right? So. Um.

640
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:13,370
Medical clinics for vaccines, mainly tetanus shots. Because that's what you're exposed to the most.

641
01:15:13,550 --> 01:15:18,000
Yeah, definitely. Who put that down? Okay.

642
01:15:18,350 --> 01:15:27,770
Yeah. So I feel like, um, one thing that we didn't really discuss was after effects of these natural disasters,

643
01:15:27,770 --> 01:15:34,430
how does lead to a lot of waterborne diseases? But I think one of the most important things is, uh,

644
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:43,790
is still like get tetanus shots because like if people tend to get injured really fast and if they're exposed to like dirty water.

645
01:15:45,260 --> 01:15:50,060
Right. Like that is something that everyone should get no matter what.

646
01:15:51,140 --> 01:15:54,200
Like if in the event of a natural disaster.

647
01:15:54,260 --> 01:15:59,570
Sure. And demand's probably going to be there with their deployable clinics and all of that kind of stuff.

648
01:16:00,530 --> 01:16:05,390
I think these are great points. Well, no one remembers that anyway.

649
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:10,610
Also, there's so many primary prevention things that can be happening in the meantime.

650
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:14,600
Houston is a huge city. It's built very weird.

651
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:18,829
It's it has loops rather than a grid. It's not built on a grid.

652
01:16:18,830 --> 01:16:23,600
So the city has now six outer loops on the city for the way the roads are built.

653
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:33,890
I never I never want to drive there. But thinking about in terms of infrastructure improvements, what can actually be feasibly fixed in the meantime?

654
01:16:33,890 --> 01:16:38,990
Again, like I said, a lot of these resources like we saw in that article five years after Harvey,

655
01:16:38,990 --> 01:16:43,399
where HUD is giving some of this financial resources to cities who weren't even

656
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:49,370
affected with like zero flooding and zero damage is is logically very baffling.

657
01:16:49,370 --> 01:16:52,700
But if you think about it, not entirely surprising.

658
01:16:53,960 --> 01:17:02,330
So even thinking like super duper d, super duper upstream, how can people make changes for themselves?

659
01:17:02,810 --> 01:17:06,470
The state of Texas has 254 counties.

660
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:16,040
It's very gerrymandered, right? So people have to exercise their right to vote within their power, to exercise their democracy,

661
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:25,370
to change who is in the federal and their local governments and their state governments, potentially in their federal government to see some changes.

662
01:17:26,630 --> 01:17:34,670
But again, we always see, like when people run on campaigns, they always save a lot of stuff that doesn't actually always happen.

663
01:17:34,730 --> 01:17:44,600
Right? Um, but I guess that's all we can do is just keep trying and hopefully maybe some of you eventually will get

664
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:50,509
into the realm in public health of emergency management or infectious disease response potentially.

665
01:17:50,510 --> 01:17:59,219
Apparently. You know, we give face now not for, you know, okay, the future is uncertain.

666
01:17:59,220 --> 01:18:04,390
And some of you may actually had to do all of this despite it not being part of your official job title.

667
01:18:05,230 --> 01:18:10,130
Um, so with that, that's all for today.
