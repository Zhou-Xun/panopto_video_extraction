1
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:09,190
Okay. Good morning, everybody. Morning.

2
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:20,960
Good morning. So I would just like to say so far the attendance has been very good for this class and I really appreciate that.

3
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:26,530
So thank you for getting here. I know that the expectation is that everybody comes in person.

4
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:31,560
That has not really been the case the past few years.

5
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:35,500
It kind of trickled off. So we're starting out strong. I appreciate that.

6
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:42,760
Did anybody have any issues or questions on the screening content from Tuesday?

7
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:49,080
Nothing that comes to mind. Did you watch the video?

8
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:55,530
Okay, helpful. What did you guys think? I think it's helpful.

9
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,930
So if you haven't watched it,

10
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:08,970
make sure you do watch it and just give some very practical and evidence based tools for really like physical assessment of our patients.

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,540
So I had a patient last Thursday.

12
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:20,339
All my visits are over video right now and I'm looking at his chart and, you know, looking at his weight and BMI.

13
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:26,819
And it's from several months ago. Just physically looking at him even over video and patients.

14
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,910
I mean, they walk around with their phone, they're doing whatever during the visit.

15
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:36,900
But I could really tell, you know, he looked very thin and not reflective of his what was in his chart.

16
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:45,889
Um, and we kind of did like a little bit of an SGA, like I could see here to take up and I could really tell really pronounced clavicles,

17
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:48,050
some squaring of the shoulders like this patient was.

18
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:54,770
Now there was a lot going on, but that kind of helped confirm not having a really accurate current weight.

19
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:58,880
He was able to do a weight at home, but again, that's the accuracy there.

20
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,780
So like I was thinking about that as I was looking at my patient over video.

21
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:09,660
Yes. Your question, when you start to investigate, do you have to tell what the patient or like?

22
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:14,240
Do you find that it's um. I don't know if you really get.

23
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:21,380
Answers from the Nation Fund. Would that be something that you.

24
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:26,650
Ask you to answer it. You tell them or. Oh, like I'm.

25
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:29,409
Yeah. Potentially.

26
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:39,310
There's always, like, some potential bias in an answer if they know you're kind of digging for some information, like for this patient.

27
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:47,530
I just, you know, I said, you know, I'm noticing you look really thin to me and that doesn't what is your current weight or what?

28
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:50,860
You know. And most patients are pretty receptive.

29
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:55,420
This was an adult patient, so sometimes younger.

30
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:00,760
But in my experience, I seem to get more.

31
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:09,940
Well, it's a mixed bag, people telling me maybe what I want to hear from young adults and then also like maybe more middle aged,

32
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,899
because I think they want to like present something to the dietitian.

33
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:21,910
But once we kind of break those barriers where they do feel like they can trust me and they don't have to like tell me that they have this

34
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:28,840
really good eating pattern or whatever when they're they they they don't you can you can build that rapport and get a little bit more honesty.

35
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:35,920
But that that can happen where you can get some biased answers. I think for some people just meeting with the dietitian is.

36
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:43,639
Nerve racking. They think you guys might see that even just from peers of people that you do that know you're going into nutrition,

37
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:48,560
they automatically like, oh, don't look at what I even place on my batch.

38
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,400
That's like, the last thing I'm worried about is what you're eating, you know?

39
00:03:53,480 --> 00:04:00,740
But people's perception sometimes at first of the dietitian can influence how they interact with us.

40
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,700
Any other questions or thoughts from our screening?

41
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:14,370
Yes, sir. 10206.

42
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:26,560
David, thank you so. I was four or something like that.

43
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:34,030
I was in the Minnesota. Yes. So I'm not following protocol, but they don't tell.

44
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:40,440
Doesn't that which you know, that's nice that they could control for that.

45
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:49,290
I believe that probably we do more randomized controlled trials with nutrition, which is very difficult to do.

46
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:53,380
Right. To have like a randomized controlled trial looking at randomized people.

47
00:04:55,420 --> 00:05:00,300
Those types of studies are really hard to do. So sometimes you can't always account for one.

48
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:07,060
So that's that's an interesting observation that it was such a tightly controlled experiment that they were able to do.

49
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:11,470
For better or for worse, exclude someone that wasn't maybe following the protocol.

50
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:21,220
That's not real world. Actually, they had the freedom to go shopping and stuff because they had to learn to walk from two levels and.

51
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,900
Grocery store, trash cans. They want to buy food for other people.

52
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:36,420
So they have a lot of feedback. Sure.

53
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:40,980
Yeah. There's a lot of questions that come about with that experiment.

54
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:45,510
Definitely. So, okay, so we talked about Tuesday.

55
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:53,070
Does anybody have any questions on the videos that you had to watch in preparation for today's class?

56
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:58,800
So you watched just some basic information on Anthropometric.

57
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:03,720
We will practice doing some basic calculations today.

58
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,580
Just you have to you'll eventually get like really good at just doing them quickly.

59
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:13,770
But we do have to practice them. And what about estimating energy needs?

60
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:20,010
You watch that video. We will practice that throughout the semester, next semester.

61
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:24,780
So this is just the beginning of that. There's various ways you can do it.

62
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:31,620
Obviously, there are some predictive equations. There's also more simplistic based methods to do it.

63
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:36,390
Does anybody have just any questions on that before we get started?

64
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:42,410
So we'll apply some of that today. But again, that will be kind of throughout the semester.

65
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:46,860
Today, we're really going to focus on estimation of protein and fluid needs.

66
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:53,960
We'll talk about that article that talks about older adults, why their protein needs may be different.

67
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:00,890
So we'll spend some time on that and then we'll do some in-class calculations together.

68
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:04,580
But in one of our videos, they do want to start.

69
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:11,210
You know, we use BMI a lot in the clinical setting, but also research setting and population based data.

70
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:19,880
You know, BMI is kind of everywhere. So obesity as measured by BMI, is associated with cardiometabolic risk.

71
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,560
We know that. That's probably why it hangs out so long.

72
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:33,290
So use it because we do see consistently that we have BMI being associated with different chronic diseases,

73
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:36,439
especially those that are of cardio metabolic nature.

74
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:41,990
So cardiovascular disease, type two diabetes. BMI definitely is an imperfect tool.

75
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:47,540
It is limited in its ability to differentiate body composition or body fat distribution.

76
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:59,390
Of course, we know that it is a relatively easy measurement to obtain, and we find that so far it does okay with predicting risk, as I discussed.

77
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:05,570
So I want us to consider, though, how our BMI classifications are applied.

78
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:11,270
So BMI classifications are based upon risk of cardiovascular disease.

79
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:19,430
The classification for BMI have been adopted by the NIH and the W.H.O. for people that self-identify as either white,

80
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:25,400
Hispanic or black or potentially other in terms of their self-identified ethnicity.

81
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,150
Can anybody. Does anybody know which population we're talking about?

82
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:38,000
Like an ethnic population has adopted different cutoffs then.

83
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,300
Kind of like our standard classification. Yeah.

84
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:46,020
Yes. The Asian population.

85
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:56,580
So this is this took a long time to actually get a different kind of set of BMI classifications for those who identify as Asian.

86
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:09,120
But the W.H.O. in the New Age guidelines for Asian individuals do define overweight as a BMI between 23 and under 25 in obesity as over 25.

87
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:16,229
Okay. So they've shifted the the those kind of classifications a little bit lower for the Asian population.

88
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:21,240
So let's talk about this a little bit. It'd take some time to come to a consensus on that.

89
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:29,629
So what I want to talk about now that we've kind of discussed, okay, this certain population,

90
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:36,230
we do apply lower cutoffs for for to define overweight and obesity.

91
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:43,970
Do you think BMI is a reliable indicator of cardiometabolic risk across various racial and ethnic groups?

92
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:58,640
I would say maybe the key word here is reliable. I see some people shaking their heads.

93
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,120
What do you think? Cross.

94
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:13,970
So one thing about this, our current BMI cutoffs that we applied to many heterogeneous population when we're thinking about ethnicity,

95
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:19,670
where what population do you think those cutoffs are primarily derived from?

96
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:23,980
Caucasian population, right?

97
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:32,690
So we have these classifications for normal weight and we're just supplying that to people of all different ethnic backgrounds.

98
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,970
Probably we have some different cutoffs for Asians.

99
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:43,790
Do you think that's reliable to do those studies that just for Asians and just for those are pretty good.

100
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:50,590
Here because honestly. But here is what they say.

101
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:55,650
It is not so. To compare apples to apples or this one.

102
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:59,650
Right. If we have a more homogenous product. That's right. That's what.

103
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,890
So it's it's not really reliable. Right.

104
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:14,290
If we're applying a tool that has been derived from one population that's a little bit more homogenous to a more heterogeneous population,

105
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:19,930
sometimes there's there's some problems there. So let's talk about what what we do see.

106
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:27,690
There have been studies and more and more have looked at this because this has been like a problem.

107
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:29,860
This has historically been a problem.

108
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:39,800
We derive our growth charts for pediatrics from, you know, the standards of normal growth charts is, again, primarily derived from a white population.

109
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:45,810
So, yes, no question. Do you have a different slide?

110
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:50,650
The next step for us is protein requirements. Okay, I.

111
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:58,919
Okay, maybe this I think I maybe have just an idea to get discussion, but I will post my slides for you guys.

112
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:03,510
So just follow along up here. These also have like the answers to the.

113
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:09,170
Stuff we'll do at the end. So I will post this after class. Sorry about that.

114
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,700
I thought this was going to be in there.

115
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:20,240
So the applicability of BMI as a disease risk indicator across different racial and ethnic groups is being more closely examined.

116
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:25,399
So there's this concept of metabolic abnormality, but normal weight.

117
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:30,830
Has anybody heard of this? So this is where we see different populations.

118
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:39,080
Technically, according to our current BMI categories would be at a normal weight, but we're still seeing metabolic abnormalities.

119
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:49,670
Why might this be a problem if we're using our current methods to classify someone in overweight or obese?

120
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:55,850
Yes. We're trying to.

121
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:05,950
Yes, Brad. Yeah, but I didn't hear that.

122
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:14,900
So they may not be captured if we're. Screening for metabolic risk, which we do do.

123
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:25,160
We screened and when we screened for type two diabetes and this is a little bit controversial, we don't really do like broad level screening.

124
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,790
Some physicians do like they wouldn't just check in anyone and everybody.

125
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:37,370
They do it according to BMI. So if you're at an overweight BMI, technically, then they might screen you for diabetes.

126
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:44,689
What happens if you are technically in a normal weight, but maybe you do have some risk factors for diabetes?

127
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:47,480
You may be next because you're not going to go through that screening.

128
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:55,909
Then you could develop disease and we know the burden of something like type two diabetes on morbidity, mortality, cardiovascular risk.

129
00:13:55,910 --> 00:14:00,590
I mean, there's a huge potential that we're missing a lot of people that are at risk that we

130
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:07,190
could identify and maybe prevent progression or onset of disease by just using BMI.

131
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:14,600
And we do use BMI for lack of screening. So we can see here, if you just look at this, I know this is a little fuzzy.

132
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:23,120
These are the BMI. We're in different ethnic groups where we see this metabolic abnormality, but at its normal weight.

133
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:31,430
And so we see in African-Americans, it's around 23 or just over 23, which that would still be considered normal weight.

134
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:38,030
So folks at 23 might not get screened for diabetes and yet they are at risk for it.

135
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:42,560
It's even lower for those of us who identify as Hispanic.

136
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:55,340
And then we've talked about the Asian group where there is lower BMI, where we see risk at much lower as compared to our current cutoffs.

137
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,120
Yes.

138
00:14:56,450 --> 00:15:05,749
Is there like like some kind of like insurance issue where people cause like, let's say someone, you know, isn't presenting in a certain BMI category,

139
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:12,290
but there are other risk factors that, you know, the doctor might be concerned about something, you know, for a different reason.

140
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:15,740
Like, is do they have does their BMI, like you have to think?

141
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,620
No, that is just like a quick screening tool over.

142
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:26,750
Like if we're going to face when we order certain labs or tests for people,

143
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:33,739
sometimes BMI is used for something like type two weight, but there's always going to be like if there's a family history,

144
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:37,129
if there's other risk factors, definitely just because they're at a normal weight,

145
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:43,010
they might not they still might get that that testing or screening or it may be delayed.

146
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:52,390
It is hard to sort of see people who, you know, potentially have a higher weight getting those like extra screenings it and then then finding out,

147
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,700
well, they're actually like fine at that weight, rather. Okay.

148
00:15:55,790 --> 00:16:01,940
Yeah. So it's not like it doesn't stop there, like, okay, not your normal weight.

149
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:06,820
You have nothing else going on. Hopefully we're doing much more comprehensive an assessment.

150
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:17,120
So what is in this great box? This is showing the different ethnic groups where we see the problem.

151
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:25,550
No, this is this is not the problem. This is where we have high rates of metabolic abnormalities, whether considered abnormal.

152
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:36,860
So these are these sessions. So like, for instance, our current, I believe over 25 is considered overweight as a BMI,

153
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:43,860
but we see metabolic abnormalities around starting at with 22.9.

154
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:53,990
This is just a sample. So for them, I want you to see that the African-Americans, when they're at 23 about in this category,

155
00:16:54,380 --> 00:17:03,860
they are already they would have the risk of metabolic abnormality as maybe a white population and 25.

156
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:08,510
So whenever you don't have the greatest that no less than.

157
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:12,360
But these just might be more precise.

158
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,610
I mean, these are just estimates. It's just a study that looked at this.

159
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:23,080
And this is what they've come to say. Swing one. One of them, for example, let's say number four.

160
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,020
What does that mean? Okay.

161
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:35,220
So for people that identify as South Asian, according to this study, they saw metabolic abnormalities starting at a BMI of like 19.

162
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,100
Now, this is one study. So it's a simple.

163
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:48,540
So they're just demonstrating that at much lower BMI as we see potential metabolic what's happening and what's happened.

164
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:58,450
What's it like? Why do we think that's happening? Cause that's that's, you know, 19.6 is it's a little lower compared to just like starvation.

165
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:06,389
18 and no. Well, so what this is demonstrating I wouldn't worry about the numbers that that is

166
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:14,100
that is wildly different than the potentially just using that 25 that I that.

167
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:17,760
Okay. We've talked about it.

168
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:26,040
How might BMI confound cardiometabolic screening if we're just using the screening of BMI to determine if somebody needs to go get anyone?

169
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:32,340
See that we're potentially missing a lot of people because those abnormalities could be happening at lower BMI.

170
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,860
So I don't have great answers for this. Neither did a lot of the authors.

171
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:43,139
But what metabolic differences could be hypothesized to account for some of these risk variations?

172
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:53,250
So they did adjust for demographics and behavioral measures, body fat measures, and that really didn't explain those differences we see.

173
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,300
Does anybody have some thoughts? Yeah, we're learning about.

174
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:18,110
Role of genetics and how different environmental exposures or health conditions

175
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:24,559
change genes over time or cause adaptation I think is really interesting.

176
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:27,730
So that's something that could be considered here.

177
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:32,930
So genetics, different environment, mental exposures, what about stress?

178
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:43,430
Like we, you know, when we adjust for things in our models, we really like controlled for X or stroke.

179
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:50,239
No. I mean, statistically, yes, we're controlling for that, but or adjusting for that.

180
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,020
But you can't really weed out those different factors.

181
00:19:54,380 --> 00:20:11,290
Yeah. Yeah.

182
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:16,200
Just physiological differences based on all these things.

183
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:25,240
You just talk about environment, diet, genetics, like do we see different thresholds of how their body responds to the post load or.

184
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:34,780
So there's lots of things that could happen. Also, you know, body fat distribution.

185
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:45,129
So we know that if you tend to carry more central adiposity, so more visceral fat surrounding the visceral or organs,

186
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:49,360
that puts you at an increased risk for some of these cardio metabolic conditions.

187
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:54,159
BMI doesn't do a good job of differentiating body fat distribution.

188
00:20:54,160 --> 00:21:03,730
Correct. So there could be lots of things in terms of why we see those differences that we really can't fully account for understand yet.

189
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:12,320
Okay. So how might these findings influence a clinician's ability to utilize BMI classification of overweight

190
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:19,220
and obesity to identify cardiometabolic risk in a racially and ethnically diverse population?

191
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:29,610
We've kind of talked about this, but maybe looking just beyond BMI alone and hopefully clinicians are doing that already.

192
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:32,010
But that seems to be essentially important,

193
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:43,980
especially because it takes so much time to get consensus within the scientific community to change things like a standardized BMI.

194
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:55,319
I mean, yeah, I know it would just take some time to get those adjusted or have one that we can apply to different ethnic groups,

195
00:21:55,320 --> 00:22:01,680
which is really how it should be if we're talking about precision medicine that we should be catering to the individual.

196
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:05,340
But all that stuff takes a long time to shift.

197
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:09,480
So looking beyond BMI for some of these things is kind of the point.

198
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,260
Okay. So let's keep moving.

199
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:18,740
Let's hopefully you guys have this protein requirement. Okay.

200
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:25,510
We talked about estimating calorie needs or energy needs part.

201
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:35,049
We also need to talk about protein needs. So as in a talked about in her lecture, we can certainly do nitrogen balance.

202
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:42,730
Studies don't do this, but that will compare intake and output with regard to nitrogen,

203
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:47,530
which is we can really kind of extract a good idea of protein requirements.

204
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:51,790
We don't do that. There's it's really difficult to quantify.

205
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:56,140
All routes of nitrogen intake and nitrogen loss can be inaccurate.

206
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:04,030
There's different underlying conditions that may influence or make that not as valid of a test.

207
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:07,120
So yes, we can do that, but we really don't.

208
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:14,740
So we just kind of do our best ability, given our clinical assessment and the patient situation, to estimate protein.

209
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:18,640
So this table, just use it as a guide.

210
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:26,650
You know, in Avanti this is not like set in stone and sometimes her patients will have

211
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:32,230
multiple things going on or maybe they don't really fit any of these categories.

212
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:36,490
So it's just like a general guide here. So when you look at this.

213
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:44,240
Besides heart disease specific states. What do you notice just from these first two categories?

214
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:48,670
So when we think of adult protein, it's like all of us here.

215
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:58,020
Maintenance kind of general meeting started about 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight and then depending on you know for.

216
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:06,860
Highly active in weight training or have some other things in it that we would have increased need for a lot.

217
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:17,120
You'll still see this kind of point 8 to 1 as a general recommendation for all adults.

218
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:24,860
Well, we're going to talk about, though, today is that you see these older adults, it starts at 1 to 1.2.

219
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:27,400
And of course, it would go up depending on what else is going on.

220
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:33,080
So really, the starting point is going to be higher than just regular adult maintenance needs.

221
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:37,040
And whether we talk about older adults, we usually are referring to those 65 and older.

222
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:45,550
So hopefully you read the the paper and we'll we'll discuss why we think that this requirement is higher.

223
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:51,220
Anything stick out? I'm here for you just in terms of these ranges.

224
00:24:54,640 --> 00:25:03,010
When you. Yeah.

225
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:07,829
So let's look at renal disease. And again, that's next semester.

226
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:09,600
We don't get into the disease.

227
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:16,410
This is like so if we talk about point eight, this is the one that we see, oh, there's even something a little bit lower than that.

228
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:25,250
This is kind of controversial that next semester. So it's funny, his kidneys that are failing, but they're not yet on a dialysis.

229
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:35,500
The theory behind lower protein is that the kidneys aren't able to remove the waste generated by protein as well,

230
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:39,350
so we'd want to potentially limit it.

231
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:44,520
That's a little bit low. But really the performance of these patients is to avoid excessive amounts of protein.

232
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:47,570
Still think that they get adequate protein. So that's why it's kind of low.

233
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:55,220
Once they're on dialysis, they actually have, you know, the dialysis is doing the work of the kidney.

234
00:25:55,220 --> 00:26:00,080
So they actually have increased clearance, more protein turnover.

235
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:07,670
So that's why their needs are a little bit higher than. So all kind of get into a whole discussion next semester, so.

236
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:21,420
Never. And this time you see the critical illness burned very high here, two grams plus per kilogram something.

237
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:27,459
Otherwise, you know, it's depending on what's going on. We just we always give a range.

238
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:39,210
That's what I would say to you. Like when I say estimate the calorie and protein needs, give a range, like, okay, I'm going to do 1200 to 1500.

239
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:46,990
You know, we'll do it based on evidence based practice. But to give one target, is it like realistic?

240
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:52,990
So always like put a pinch there. Yeah. Looking for bone marrow transplant doesn't have a range.

241
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:59,800
There I would so helpfully arrange for them. Okay, how about that?

242
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:04,450
Or I'll do that. Yeah, like that. They. They need protein.

243
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:08,890
We're just saying at least 1.5 grams per kilogram unless something else is going on.

244
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:12,550
But always give a range regardless of what this type of thing.

245
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:19,380
Just for your own, you know, ease of, like, trying to prescribe nutrition therapy.

246
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:27,460
We're never going to hit that. So we want to follow, like, with anything. Me, see if there's anything.

247
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:32,810
So in most cases we'll talk about when we might use a different body weight,

248
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:39,650
but we're going to use count or grams per kilogram of their actual or current body weight.

249
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:50,749
Okay. There are some scenarios where we do grams per kilogram of ideal body weight or cake health program of ideal body weight.

250
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:56,510
Sometimes that's in our morbidly obese patients that maybe are critically ill that we don't want to overfeed.

251
00:27:57,290 --> 00:28:02,570
So we use ideal body weight. But I will explain to you what those situations would be.

252
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:08,780
So when you see grams or a kilogram, it's their current body weight that we're using.

253
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:19,240
Okay. So let's talk about that paper. Why?

254
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:26,910
Let's start with why are the current recommendations 4.8 grams per kilogram of body weight for protein in adults.

255
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:33,810
Too low for older persons. Why do you think?

256
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:44,460
Yeah. I'm sure people raised their hand looking, right? Yeah, they.

257
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:56,750
Yes. So they be here that as we age we have like this protein anabolic resistance.

258
00:28:56,750 --> 00:29:00,460
So we have more difficulty synthesizing protein.

259
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:06,490
We're not as responsive. We might have a blunted hormone response to something like insulin.

260
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:13,780
All these things that help us build muscle mass is, I would say, kind of muted as we age.

261
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:20,780
Great. What else? So I've noticed that here plus.

262
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:41,470
Of course, responding to others. That's because the stress after we start having this group here and one over is used to do like all the.

263
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:52,620
To produce. And so when a dreamer was able to to work have over little, then you are nothing else.

264
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:59,310
I just. The communication here then.

265
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:04,459
What? Right after? I just stopped. Okay.

266
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:09,290
Yeah. So interesting. Yes, very interesting. You could use it just to push it through, I suppose.

267
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:12,800
Well, that would be a read.

268
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:21,290
Yes, that would be a reason why they need more, because they're not able to utilize as efficiently the protein that they can take then.

269
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:31,070
So what else did you guys read? Yes. Yeah.

270
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:34,650
So, like, if you want to make. Thank you.

271
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:41,680
BROWN It's probably more important. Yes, it did everybody hear that?

272
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:47,180
So we have just. With aging with decreased mobility.

273
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:52,250
Lots of reasons. We have loss of lean body mass.

274
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:59,330
So the amount of protein needed to maintain lean body mass is higher because of the decline.

275
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:05,270
Natural. So need to take more to keep up with what we maintain.

276
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:09,920
Lean body mass. Anything else you can think of?

277
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:15,590
Yes. That. Higher.

278
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:24,690
Exactly right. So what we this is consistent through all literature.

279
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:27,750
As we get older, our risk for chronic diseases goes up.

280
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:34,020
Right. The longer you live, the more likely you're going to get cardiovascular disease, cancer disease in chronic disease.

281
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:40,889
Um, there's a lot of them are pro-inflammatory to some degree in nature, in nature.

282
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:44,730
So that is going to be a little bit more of a catabolic state potentially.

283
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:50,850
So you're losing proteins in body mass because of these underlying conditions.

284
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:54,909
Okay.

285
00:31:54,910 --> 00:32:04,809
So let's go through these you guys hit on I think most of these so existing the guidelines for dietary protein intake do you specify the same RDA

286
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:14,020
for all adults so pointing and we have found of course that evidence has supported the concept that lean body mass can be better maintained.

287
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:20,710
We talked about that in older persons when they consume dietary protein at a higher level than that of the RDA.

288
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:32,350
So this this data from the RDA to get to that point, eight grams per kg is derived from nitrogen balance studies which you think would be really good,

289
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:38,290
but it doesn't really give a good picture of like long term protein turnover.

290
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,120
All of that is relatively cute.

291
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:48,790
And so it can't it's not really applicable to people of all ages and adults, even though that's what what they do with that data.

292
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:55,510
So we do see that actually in our older adults, they do need more to help maintain their lean body mass.

293
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:01,900
So they just talked about so using those nitrogen balance studies we think would be really good,

294
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:05,830
but there is relatively slower rate of protein turnover in muscle.

295
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:12,970
It's unlikely that significant changes in muscle mass could be detected in short term nitrogen balance studies

296
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:19,420
and these limitations underscore the challenges in determining protein intake requirements for all adults,

297
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:23,590
as well as the difficulty and differentiating needs of men versus women.

298
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:33,810
Older versus younger, so on and so forth. So what are some potential benefits of higher protein intake in the adult population?

299
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:43,240
We have just with our discussion, we just have to talk about some well, what have they point to a couple of times in the paper?

300
00:33:52,890 --> 00:34:00,300
So they they saw that older folks that have higher protein intake, we see higher bone mass density.

301
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:09,540
You know, this is really, I would say, hard to kind of weed out, but if you're maintaining lean body mass,

302
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:16,230
you can see how maybe you're less likely to experience a fall if you're just a little bit.

303
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:23,909
Your functional status is a little bit better. So you may maintain bone integrity, but we also see higher bone mass density.

304
00:34:23,910 --> 00:34:35,069
Protein does make up, you know, a good percentage of bone volume and bone protein does undergo continuous turnover and remodeling.

305
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:42,420
So we do need an adequate supply of amino acids and mineral substrates to support the formation and maintenance of formation.

306
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:47,969
All of us know our bone mass has already been set, right? What's that like in our teenage years?

307
00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:55,230
Which is kind of scary, but I use that for my like teenage males that drink and calcium containing stuff.

308
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:58,740
You tell them you are setting your bone mass for life right now.

309
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:04,770
So that is set. But maintenance of bone across the lifespan does require adequate protein.

310
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:08,550
So we do see a slower rate of bone loss.

311
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:16,680
When we have our older adults that have higher dietary protein intake, we see improved muscle mass and strength.

312
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,820
And they point to, you know,

313
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:24,490
I think there was just one study that shows fewer health problems in general in some older women when they had higher protein intake.

314
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:36,240
So that kind of the takeaway here is that evidence suggests older adults do need more dietary protein than younger adults to support good health,

315
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:45,390
promote recovery from illness and maintain functionality. And remember that loss of muscle mass or protein is a loss of functionality.

316
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:56,399
We're not storing protein. We start to lose, you know, muscle mass and these big muscles, it's harder to stand up, get up from a seated position.

317
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,740
All these things that some of us probably take for granted,

318
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:06,000
that can be difficult when you lose muscle mass as we age, and that can equate to a loss of function.

319
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:12,080
Older adults need to make up for age related changes in protein metabolism.

320
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:14,480
Talk about that in a little bit more detail.

321
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:23,360
And need more protein to offset the inflammatory and anabolic conditions associated with chronic and acute diseases that are more common with aging.

322
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:31,250
So our takeaway is that persons 65 years and older need at least 1 to 1.2 grams

323
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:36,139
of protein per kilogram of body weight to maintain and regain mass and function.

324
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:40,310
So that's the starting point. This would be the maintenance. This is where we would start.

325
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:49,610
Okay. So factors that influence protein use in individuals.

326
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:53,659
This graphic from the paper is helpful.

327
00:36:53,660 --> 00:37:02,330
So we didn't really touch on this, but sometimes we see inadequate intake of protein foods as we get older, as patients get older.

328
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:10,580
So I definitely see this in my older patients just appetite is just it's just kind of blunted

329
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:17,780
sometimes and with aging not as hungry so there can be what we call like some kind of massive aging.

330
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:21,620
That's not anorexia nervosa, that's just anorexia.

331
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:28,970
Sometimes we use that term is very poor appetite, limited intake for various reasons.

332
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:34,820
So that could happen. Reduced ability to use available protein.

333
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:48,130
We have discussed this. So we talked about, you know, some blunted response to hormones, protein, antibiotic resistance, high splint, neck extraction.

334
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:51,430
So what does this mean?

335
00:37:51,730 --> 00:38:01,630
Well, basically, the splenic extraction represents the fraction of ingested amino acid taken up by the gut and liver.

336
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:13,000
And so as we get older, we we see that they then gotten the liver take more of that protein to do its normal function.

337
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:19,060
So it's not leaving as much to the body to use for the body mass and all that.

338
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:31,470
Also in mobility. So people that maybe can't move around as well or more bedridden in mobility can lead to lots of muscle mass and function as well.

339
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:41,670
And then the greater need for protein because of inflammatory diseases and higher risk for catabolic conditions.

340
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:50,840
One thing that this does point out, this paper, there is no evidence that protein,

341
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:55,870
digestion and absorption capacities change significantly with aging.

342
00:38:57,020 --> 00:39:05,569
So although there may be situations where we're not able to use the protein that is consumed as efficiently,

343
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:08,870
that's probably due to the things in this middle box here.

344
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:12,170
It's not because we aren't necessarily digesting or absorbing.

345
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:18,410
It's just that other functions are maybe using more of it to do what they need to do.

346
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:25,010
That we might have just seen more muted response to hormone hormones that allow us to synthesize protein.

347
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:34,250
Okay. So let's just go through these recommendations. This is for healthy, older adults.

348
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,000
Are the adults we're going to see in the hospital healthy?

349
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:44,090
Probably not. They're sick. They're there for they're in the hospital for a reason.

350
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:49,560
So think about that as we apply, you know, these recommendations for healthy older adults.

351
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:58,650
We want to maintain and regain muscle. Older people need more dietary protein than younger people do to avoid that.

352
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:04,410
We've talked about this. We're going to start at 1 to 1.2 grams per kilogram of body weight per day.

353
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:09,520
The permeable anabolic threshold of dietary protein.

354
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:13,600
Amino acid intake is higher in older individuals.

355
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:21,370
So in compared with young adults, we don't need to get into the protein source and timing of intake if you're interested in that.

356
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:23,980
This paper does reference some studies.

357
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:32,020
There is some evidence that suggests benefits to more even distribution of protein at breakfast, lunch and dinner,

358
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:39,999
or even some that where the mid meal has like the highest amount of protein that might be beneficial.

359
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,860
So there's some, some evidence for protein source timing of intake,

360
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:52,090
amino acid supplementation when we're making recommendations for our for older adults.

361
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:57,430
But I would maybe just make sure that this is like really evidence based.

362
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:00,460
I think we have some preliminary good evidence for that.

363
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:07,660
And then more research studies with better methodologies to fine tune our recommendations is always going to be needed.

364
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:15,990
So let's talk about their recommendations for protein levels in geriatric patients with specific or chronic diseases.

365
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:25,680
The amount of additional protein. So again, healthy older adults, we start at the one one gram per kilogram.

366
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:32,790
Most of our patients have other things going on that might influence where we would recommend their protein to be.

367
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:37,840
So it will depend on their disease and severity, their nutritional status,

368
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:43,360
all these things, as well as the disease impact on the patient's nutritional status.

369
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:49,330
So we've had we have an older adult with a aggressive cancer.

370
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:53,910
They're going to need higher protein than one gram per kilogram of body.

371
00:41:55,820 --> 00:42:06,710
Most older adults who have an acute or chronic disease will need probably somewhere between 1.2 to 1.5 grams per kilogram of protein a day.

372
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:16,720
Maybe some cases go a little bit higher. Those with severe kidney disease who are not on dialysis would be the exception.

373
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:21,290
We don't want to do excessive amounts of protein that would be problematic for them.

374
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:27,490
So I would maybe caution against limiting protein.

375
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:36,390
We just want to avoid excessive protein. Does anybody have any questions on some of this?

376
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:39,530
I know. It's just like words and more. Apply it more.

377
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:46,729
The main point here is that our older dogs need more protein for a variety of reasons.

378
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:54,350
So always consider that when you're doing a case study or seeing a patient and these ranges are not set in stone,

379
00:42:54,350 --> 00:42:59,900
you can kind of fine tune them based on the patient's presentation and your clinical judgment.

380
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:05,810
Okay. Let's talk about now.

381
00:43:05,910 --> 00:43:15,510
Kind of moving away from just older adults or just talking in general if you want to spend a little bit time was so people with wounds

382
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:26,100
whether it's a lot of wounds or more commonly we'll see some older adults that have to cubits ulcers or pressure ulcers that they may.

383
00:43:26,610 --> 00:43:32,010
Have you heard of these terms that sores? Have you heard do you know that's the same thing?

384
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:49,940
What is that? Yeah pressure always on it's usually right around the the just above or the lower back just above kind of the rear

385
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:56,960
end is where a lot of the pressures of patients are written and they can get what we call pressure ulcers there.

386
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:05,209
So they get ones they're they're very difficult to heal. You'll see, like if you do a location,

387
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:13,990
you will do a rotation in long term care facilities that there's nursing staff and medical assistant staff have, like turning schedules.

388
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:17,540
So they turn the patients to get them off of that pressure point.

389
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:26,900
But sometimes these are kind of unavoidable if you think about the integrity of the skin, the poor nutrition, the limited mobility.

390
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:32,510
So, um, we see patients at risk or patients that have pressure ulcers.

391
00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:38,330
Me to recommend higher protein would be as high as 1.5 to 2 grams per kilogram per day.

392
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:45,290
Just to try and help heal with that rapid cellular turnover, improve the integrity of the skin.

393
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:53,840
The European pressure also advisory panel recommends 1 to 1.5 trillion ranges there.

394
00:44:55,310 --> 00:44:57,940
We do want to avoid excessive dietary protein.

395
00:44:57,950 --> 00:45:08,300
So for most people, most people, there are definitely situations that will require more going beyond the two grams per kilogram body weight per day.

396
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:16,700
It's not going to be utilized in the way that we would intend can put people at risk for dehydration, especially in our elderly population.

397
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:30,769
So although I think our society is kind of like protein cream focused, like more protein powder, lean protein protein with a protein, we need protein.

398
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:34,070
But we also we do want to avoid excessive protein.

399
00:45:34,550 --> 00:45:42,080
Hey, hey. It's just not going to be utilized usually beyond the mouth and it can increase risk for dehydration.

400
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:48,530
So increase ammonia levels, which is a byproduct of protein metabolism, is converted to Rio.

401
00:45:48,530 --> 00:45:54,919
If people have healthy kidneys and that's collected in the kidneys and removed through the body yards,

402
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:59,120
we can have increased fluid losses, very high protein that can.

403
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:08,089
That's why due to dehydration in our elderly population, we're going back there already, I'd say at risk for dehydration.

404
00:46:08,090 --> 00:46:13,600
We see lots of issues with that. Okay.

405
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:19,000
Let's talk about fluid requirements. It's a good segway from protein.

406
00:46:19,030 --> 00:46:26,229
We need to make sure we're also staying hydrated, especially for our patients have wounds that's important for for good skin

407
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:31,150
integrity but also fluid management include maintenance of adequate hydration,

408
00:46:31,390 --> 00:46:32,980
tissue perfusion. So again,

409
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:43,210
our patients post surgery or that have wounds adequate hydration is really important for for tissue perfusion and healing also electrolyte balance.

410
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:46,659
So fluid requirements really depend on many things, of course.

411
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:54,100
So we have insensible losses. All of us do fluid loss from our lungs, just from breathing respiration.

412
00:46:55,180 --> 00:47:01,749
We lose fluid through the skin with sweat and then respiratory tract, GI tract.

413
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:08,049
So stool urine, if patient does have larger wounds, they lose fluid through the wounds.

414
00:47:08,050 --> 00:47:15,040
If they have an ostomy. You talk about a little bit later on, that's kind of a external.

415
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,309
You're tested basically as is connected to a bag.

416
00:47:20,310 --> 00:47:25,049
So you're not for some reason we can't go into the normal route through the GI tract.

417
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:33,780
There's lots of potential classes that way. In our patients with asthma and alterations in fluid balance can be due to metabolic changes.

418
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:38,160
So if a patient is febrile, maybe there's underlying hypothyroidism.

419
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:44,400
Different medications. I just lost one here. Does anybody know what a diuretic is?

420
00:47:45,690 --> 00:47:52,100
What is a diuretic do? Yeah.

421
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:58,799
I really feel that. Right. So a diuretic is used to help control fluids.

422
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,970
And so people that tend to retain a lot of fluid make the kidney disease.

423
00:48:02,970 --> 00:48:06,780
Maybe they have heart failure. They're trying to get rid of the excess fluid.

424
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:16,620
Certainly to have to pee. Sometimes people can get dehydrated quickly if they're on a high dose of diuretics and it's not monitored.

425
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:22,240
So how do we estimate who it needs? There are different methods.

426
00:48:24,190 --> 00:48:27,880
We tend to always use the milliliter per kilogram method.

427
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,300
So it looks kind of like confusing here.

428
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:38,380
So basically what it is, is you take the patient's weight in kilograms, their current weight.

429
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:45,610
Subtract 20, then you're going to multiply by either 20 or 15, depending on how old they are.

430
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:54,100
If they're over 50, you'll do their weight in KG -20 times 15, and then you'll add 1500 milliliters on to that.

431
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:04,900
Okay. And you have an example here. You'll also see a method of one milliliter of fluid per calorie of estimated needs.

432
00:49:06,490 --> 00:49:15,100
When might this be helpful? Does anybody know a situation where we would we would use maybe one ml per cow that we're feeding the patient?

433
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:27,980
Same concern. Like if a patient has something in the way of.

434
00:49:31,530 --> 00:49:34,560
Yeah. It could be that we didn't feel we had an accurate weight.

435
00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:46,200
We might use that method. Might also use this if we are prescribing nutrition support so we know exactly how many calories we're giving a patient.

436
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:47,970
We could probably use this.

437
00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:55,590
Most patients, we don't really know how much they're eating because we're not going to a calorie count every day, which will pop out.

438
00:49:55,630 --> 00:50:09,160
But this is a method you could use. I think it makes sense for us to make the food, but I think I think the top one there's also age related methods,

439
00:50:10,450 --> 00:50:15,340
fluid balance methods where you have their urine output and then we add 500 milliliters to that.

440
00:50:15,670 --> 00:50:22,600
We will use this next semester. You're talking about our patients on dialysis that maybe aren't making a lot of urine.

441
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:33,400
So we use that to prevent over giving too many fluids, but we don't really use it like our general population.

442
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:39,290
And then this body surface method, probably more so than like the trauma burn unit.

443
00:50:40,930 --> 00:50:47,650
Don't use this, but I think stick with this one would be my advice because it's it's what we use most often.

444
00:50:51,110 --> 00:50:58,970
Okay, let's do a little bit of practice. So I would pull up your slides from Tuesday, so you have all those calculations.

445
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:04,370
We're going to do some just some basic calculations together.

446
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:07,700
Okay. So we have a patient.

447
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:16,430
MH He's a 76 year old woman with a medical history significant for hypertension, admitted to the hospital after tripping and flying at home.

448
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:21,530
She's admitted with a femur fracture. She's currently confined to her bed.

449
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:26,450
Her appetite has been decreased since the loss of her husband six months ago.

450
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:30,850
So we have her height here. We see her admission weight.

451
00:51:31,210 --> 00:51:36,340
And then she tells us that her usual weight, this was her usual weight six months ago.

452
00:51:38,950 --> 00:51:42,420
So the calculate the following for this patient,

453
00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:50,800
I want you to do her ideal body weight her percent ideal body weight, her percentage of her usual weight, her BMI.

454
00:51:51,130 --> 00:51:56,709
And then I want you to spend some time estimating her energy needs, protein needs and food needs.

455
00:51:56,710 --> 00:52:06,640
So I want you to do it both ways. So estimate using that Mifflin equation, I can pull that up if it's helpful to have it up here,

456
00:52:07,210 --> 00:52:11,920
estimate it using Kels per kilogram method and then do the protein and fluid.

457
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:17,080
So we'll take like probably a good 10 minutes to do this.

458
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:24,340
Ten, 15 minutes. So practice all these calculations and then we'll kind of see where we're at with these.

459
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:33,430
We might have really different answers, hopefully not some calories and protein, but that's okay if we have several different answers here.

460
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:40,650
Yeah. Let me pull them up so you guys can see them.

461
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:24,660
Yeah. I should say the slides from the recorded lectures for that you've watched before today would be helpful.

462
00:53:25,530 --> 00:55:35,710
Not. So you'll have to do some converting.

463
00:55:36,730 --> 00:55:40,990
Five kilograms, £2 centimeters, ten inches.

464
00:56:34,980 --> 00:58:38,270
Oh one. Oh I said did met with.

465
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:46,270
Percentage of ideal. As usual, the answers.

466
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:52,540
Yeah. That would be preferable. Yeah.

467
00:58:52,550 --> 00:59:55,500
But then the next. The next version. Usually when.

468
01:03:29,790 --> 01:03:35,130
We'll do like five more minutes. If you haven't started on like the calorie needs, move on to that part.

469
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:57,600
All right. I know you're still working, but let's we'll take a look at things together if you get on.

470
01:08:18,070 --> 01:08:25,970
Okay. What did we get for her ideal body weight? 61.36 kilograms.

471
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:31,760
61.3. Everybody get that. If you get something like totally different.

472
01:08:31,940 --> 01:08:36,890
Just check. They've probably just either something in your conversion.

473
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:42,379
So that's why I just look at it and you're not missing something.

474
01:08:42,380 --> 01:08:48,380
It's probably just an error in your calculation. So then what is her percentage of her ideal body weight?

475
01:08:48,950 --> 01:09:03,419
How do we calculate that? So how would if we want to know what percent of her ideal body weight she is will take her current weight?

476
01:09:03,420 --> 01:09:08,910
Or usually that's going to be the admission weight and divide that by her ideal body.

477
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:14,550
So she's just a little bit above it, right. But she's right about her ideal body weight.

478
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:18,480
The percentage of her usual body weight is just going to be her current weight

479
01:09:19,410 --> 01:09:24,389
divided by her usual weight or the weight we have from like six months ago.

480
01:09:24,390 --> 01:09:27,690
So she's 88% of her ideal or her usual body weight.

481
01:09:27,690 --> 01:09:32,579
So we know she has lost weight and her BMI.

482
01:09:32,580 --> 01:09:40,850
What did you guys get for her BMI? 1.9.

483
01:09:41,420 --> 01:09:46,150
Yeah. Yes, 21.9. You can certainly round I always round to like one decimal.

484
01:09:48,730 --> 01:09:54,730
Again, if yours is like off, it's probably just just go back and make sure you plugged in the numbers.

485
01:09:54,730 --> 01:10:00,430
Right. Okay. So using the Mifflin equation, that's essentially a regression equation.

486
01:10:01,780 --> 01:10:06,009
You can do this online if you you know, you can always find these online.

487
01:10:06,010 --> 01:10:12,850
But, you know, we're kind of doing it by hand. What did you get for just her r e from the Mifflin equation?

488
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:20,800
There might be some differences with rounding. Anybody get an answer?

489
01:10:25,660 --> 01:10:28,660
Okay. So close to this, right? 1159.

490
01:10:28,670 --> 01:10:33,670
Did you get somewhere close to that? Yes. Okay. So for the fifth one, do we stop here?

491
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:43,089
No. What do we have to do? We have to add a stress factor or activity factor, whatever we want to call it.

492
01:10:43,090 --> 01:10:48,970
Remember, with the Mifflin are those are derived from healthy populations.

493
01:10:49,330 --> 01:10:55,450
Our population that we're seeing usually is not healthy. So we have to add a factor on to that.

494
01:10:55,870 --> 01:10:59,740
So what you may have chosen could be different.

495
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:05,470
She has this femur fracture. She's lost weight, hasn't been eating well.

496
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:09,820
So she has some reasons why we would maybe want to give her a little bit more nutrition.

497
01:11:11,230 --> 01:11:14,740
I did like 1.25 to 1.4.

498
01:11:15,550 --> 01:11:23,650
Usually I do a range like that. I don't know why, but one way to find that like 1.2 to 1.4, did anybody go higher than that or lower?

499
01:11:25,060 --> 01:11:29,030
Yeah. I just don't want. On the slide.

500
01:11:29,540 --> 01:11:33,530
Mild stress. Sure. A minor injury?

501
01:11:34,670 --> 01:11:38,540
Yeah. So you might be a little bit lower. Might be a little bit higher.

502
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:44,750
But that's why we kind of do this this range, just to give yourself some some room to work with.

503
01:11:45,320 --> 01:11:55,540
So kind of close to that, we think she needs maybe, you know, over 1400 calories, up to maybe 16, 1700 calories.

504
01:11:56,180 --> 01:12:00,920
That may sound reasonable. What about if we use cals per kilogram?

505
01:12:02,060 --> 01:12:07,010
Sometimes I do that as a or I use I tend to use K cals per kilogram.

506
01:12:07,010 --> 01:12:12,379
But if I'm like really not sure, then I might do what I would do for case counts per kilogram.

507
01:12:12,380 --> 01:12:16,910
And then also check to see if I'm like in the right vicinity.

508
01:12:18,170 --> 01:12:23,070
What range did you guys use? Yeah.

509
01:12:23,610 --> 01:12:27,799
1400. Yeah.

510
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:32,000
That's what I got too. I did 22 to 25 cals per kilogram.

511
01:12:36,450 --> 01:12:42,210
Usually like we think of like a starting place for healthy adults is around 25 for most people.

512
01:12:43,410 --> 01:12:51,540
And then we kind of go up or down, depending on the situation. Our older, our elderly patients there are easier, just a little bit lower.

513
01:12:51,550 --> 01:12:54,959
So their their need for calories is lower in general.

514
01:12:54,960 --> 01:13:02,670
So we don't want to overfeed our older patients. So we want to avoid excessive calories, but we want to make sure it's adequate.

515
01:13:02,670 --> 01:13:07,320
So that's kind of why it's a little bit lower there. You might have have a little bit higher as well.

516
01:13:07,380 --> 01:13:12,690
You go at 25, you might have had 25 to 30.

517
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:19,920
What I would say to you like this isn't you will get really good at doing this eventually.

518
01:13:20,310 --> 01:13:27,480
It may feel kind of boring, but as we practice more, you'll get to some like clinical judgment.

519
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:31,170
Everybody needs to still be a little bit different.

520
01:13:32,360 --> 01:13:41,310
If you look at somebody who's calorie needs to encapsulate and they just seem like this seems really low or this seems really high,

521
01:13:41,790 --> 01:13:45,449
don't just eat gut feeling like stuff yourself. Like this happens every year.

522
01:13:45,450 --> 01:13:51,989
Somebody'll submit something. Yeah, but that seems really low because it is like you maybe did a calculation error.

523
01:13:51,990 --> 01:13:58,229
You forgot to add an activity factor. Like, if it seems unreasonable, it probably is.

524
01:13:58,230 --> 01:14:02,190
So look at what you did. Okay.

525
01:14:02,260 --> 01:14:07,430
What about protein needs? Did you guys get that far?

526
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:14,340
What did you have? Yes. Okay.

527
01:14:14,340 --> 01:14:19,800
So what range of k grams per kg one gram one point.

528
01:14:20,430 --> 01:14:25,450
Okay. 1 to 1 point to just given her age.

529
01:14:25,450 --> 01:14:31,870
Did anybody else have something else? Yeah, I.

530
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:43,400
Yeah. So I also went a little bit higher. Given that this patient does have a fracture that's going to need healing.

531
01:14:43,900 --> 01:14:50,730
Um, we can talk about if this patient is malnourished or not given the weight loss, given that.

532
01:14:50,870 --> 01:14:55,249
But definitely at least we want to get adequate protein.

533
01:14:55,250 --> 01:15:01,130
But we could make a case that her needs are a little bit higher and then fluid needs.

534
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:12,650
Just practice that calculation. Okay. So we take her current admission weight, subtract 20, multiply by 15 because she's over 50 and add 1500 to that.

535
01:15:12,650 --> 01:15:18,230
So she needs about 20, 150 or 2.1 liters per day.

536
01:15:19,670 --> 01:15:23,200
Again, if your fluid needs seem really are like, oh, that's really high.

537
01:15:23,650 --> 01:15:27,140
Oh, you probably have something in the calculation. So yes.

538
01:15:34,510 --> 01:15:41,220
Those are the two the best the factor that we're adding on that this is a stress patients ESOP agreement.

539
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:49,180
So that that's that page where I give you a variety of things like activity factors stress factors because this is like.

540
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:53,709
Trips up students every year, like how do we decide on these?

541
01:15:53,710 --> 01:15:57,490
Or What's the difference? What if they're bedridden?

542
01:15:57,490 --> 01:16:03,260
So it's like they're not mobile, but they still might have increased needs because they're under some type of stress.

543
01:16:03,270 --> 01:16:11,530
So think of it less as an activity factor because both of our patients are in hospital, in the bed, and more of like a stress or injury type of thing.

544
01:16:12,130 --> 01:16:18,160
Just know that we have to be very rarely are we just going to stop at the health clinic already from the

545
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:24,490
month when we need to have half of that to account for why they're hospitalized and always give a rate.

546
01:16:24,730 --> 01:16:28,410
This is not only perfect for us to be a little bit different on what factors to.

547
01:16:30,670 --> 01:16:34,600
And that fly that has the variety. Those are just guides.

548
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:40,400
It doesn't have to be perfect. I just want to see that you thought about it.

549
01:16:40,540 --> 01:16:44,890
Okay. This patient has increased needs because they've had a bone fracture.

550
01:16:45,970 --> 01:16:52,990
Nutritional status is not great. So this is where I'm coming from with this, you know, as long as there's, like, some reason behind it.

551
01:16:59,020 --> 01:17:05,070
No, you don't. You don't have to memorize them. You'll have access, like when you do case studies, exams, your.

552
01:17:05,410 --> 01:17:08,650
You can use those slides as a kind of a reference.

553
01:17:10,090 --> 01:17:13,290
You don't have to memorize them. Eventually, you'll get a pretty good feel. For what?

554
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:17,050
What you want to do. Okay.

555
01:17:17,380 --> 01:17:26,440
So rationale for the calorie goal in the protein really she's lost weight secondary to her intake

556
01:17:26,440 --> 01:17:33,040
she's had likely has decreased protein stores also are older in age and now says post fracture.

557
01:17:35,260 --> 01:17:38,860
Okay. We're not going to have time to do this, but we'll just go through this would be another one.

558
01:17:38,860 --> 01:17:46,240
This is a 65 year, six year old male with hypertension admitted to the hospital after a hypertensive event.

559
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:51,009
So requiring monitoring and medication adjustment, yes,

560
01:17:51,010 --> 01:17:56,709
he's going to adjusted hypertension meds works at a sedentary sedentary desk job does

561
01:17:56,710 --> 01:18:02,230
not exercise regularly outside of walking his dog every morning for about 20 minutes.

562
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:08,110
And you can see here not a ton of information probably just needs an adjustment of his meds,

563
01:18:08,110 --> 01:18:18,130
but not like anything major going on in terms of an injury or inflammatory disease process happening here.

564
01:18:19,770 --> 01:18:23,260
So when we do this, we can see his ideal body weight.

565
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:26,550
You can always do these pat practices, one to just to get used to it.

566
01:18:27,420 --> 01:18:30,600
He is close to 150% of his ideal body weight.

567
01:18:30,870 --> 01:18:39,120
He's right around his usual body weight. He hasn't lost weight and he has BMI 34.6, which would put him at obese.

568
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:50,010
So what do we do for calculating his energy needs? This would be a situation where if you didn't use the next one, you probably could just stop there.

569
01:18:50,280 --> 01:18:58,739
This is a relatively non stress patient who is overweight and know we don't use BMI a lot to make a lot of decisions,

570
01:18:58,740 --> 01:19:02,940
but that might be an appropriate calorie level for this patient.

571
01:19:03,780 --> 01:19:07,890
Or you could do like a modest activity type of factor.

572
01:19:09,980 --> 01:19:16,040
But there's nothing in that presentation that says this guy needs a very, very high rate.

573
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:21,280
And you can see with Kels per kg because of his weight,

574
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:29,060
Sanofi did go a little bit lower on that simplistically based approach and this is probably a little too low.

575
01:19:29,070 --> 01:19:35,950
So would be maybe if this patient was trying to lose weight. Okay.

576
01:19:35,950 --> 01:19:41,850
Protein again, nothing like that makes me think this patient is overly stressed and needs really high protein and need.

577
01:19:41,890 --> 01:19:47,650
So I think feeding him right up to make up for his actual weight would be appropriate.

578
01:19:48,010 --> 01:19:51,280
You can see how that compares sometimes with patients that are obese.

579
01:19:51,730 --> 01:19:57,040
We do use ideal body weight and that would be 1.5 grams per kilogram of ideal body weight.

580
01:19:58,510 --> 01:20:03,910
So you could do that, but I would just stick for this class were usually always going to use actual weight.

581
01:20:05,930 --> 01:20:11,400
And then here's his. So that's like an example of like a non stress, just basic.

582
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:17,820
Adult patient. So I'll post these slides. You guys have access to them.

583
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:21,540
Does anybody have questions on these calculations?

584
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:27,059
Again, we'll we'll do lots of practice throughout the semester, a lot more next semester,

585
01:20:27,060 --> 01:20:30,870
because for a lot of patients, we don't have to estimate energy needs for.

586
01:20:31,290 --> 01:20:42,179
Right. If they're just on a diet eating, you know, unless we're like delivering a specific malnutrition threshold for nutritious meal situations,

587
01:20:42,180 --> 01:20:47,190
we don't have to put their estimated needs in their chart, but we do need to know how to go about that.

588
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:56,760
Okay, I'm a minute older, so let's stop there. I'll get all your readings and slides post for next week by tomorrow morning.

589
01:20:57,120 --> 01:21:01,410
Do you have a sign up for office hours? If you need that, it's on Mondays from 4 to 5.

590
01:21:02,070 --> 01:21:06,210
If you need a different time, just email me and I'll see you guys next week.
