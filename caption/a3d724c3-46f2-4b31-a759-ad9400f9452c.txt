00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:14,990
Welcome to Public Health two hundred, we are so glad you enrolled in our course and look forward to learning alongside of you this semester,

2
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:20,800
stay healthy and we'll see you during our first forum on Zoom.

3
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:28,380
My name is Dr. Emily Youatt and I'm a faculty member in the Department of Health, Behavior and Health Education.

4
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:38,190
I've been teaching public health two hundred for the past 10 years, teaching and learning from students is my favorite thing about being a professor.

5
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:42,600
I also serve as the assistant dean of the School of Public Health,

6
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:49,650
Office of Student Engagement and Practice, and as director of our Schools undergraduate program,

7
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:58,410
I look forward to introducing myself to you in greater detail when we meet via Assume for our first class forum.

8
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:07,750
Public health is an interdisciplinary field and a field so broad is best taught by including an array of perspectives.

9
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:15,490
In this spirit, there are two co instructors that lead this course, my colleague, Dr. Al Franzblau,

10
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:23,980
a medical doctor and faculty member in the Department of Environmental Health Sciences, teaches alongside of me this semester.

11
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:33,730
Al has worked in preventive and occupational medicine and has worked at the School of Public Health for more than 30 years.

12
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:40,630
Adding to the array of perspectives teaching this course our team of graduate student instructors,

13
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:47,230
our job is to represent a variety of the departments that comprise the School of Public Health.

14
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:57,170
Our guys are all doctoral students and bring with them years of classroom and professional experience in various public health settings.

15
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:07,520
Please take a moment to identify your section number and the GSCI, who will be leading your discussion section this semester?

16
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,110
Our team works closely together on all aspects of the course.

17
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:21,370
We meet weekly to talk about the course, the students and how emerging issues interact with what you're learning in the course.

18
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:24,820
All instructors hold weekly office hours,

19
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:34,490
please visit our course campsite to see when teaching team members are holding office hours and learn how you can meet with them.

20
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:36,350
Not listed on this slide,

21
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:46,690
but important to note is that many of the online lessons and forums you'll experience this semester are offered by expert guest lecturers.

22
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:55,000
We are fortunate to have so many extraordinary scientists and thought leaders here and our University of Michigan community,

23
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,690
and they have graciously offered their expertize to this course.

24
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:09,780
You'll have the opportunity to interact with several of these individuals in real time during our Synchronoss forum sessions throughout the semester.

25
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:15,990
I'll say more about guest lecturers in our forum sessions in just a few minutes.

26
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:20,140
So what will you be learning this semester in public health? Two hundred.

27
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:25,660
Let me begin by emphasizing that public health two hundred is an introductory course,

28
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:31,040
a good starting point or baseline for learning about the field of public health.

29
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:39,390
We cover a lot of different topics throughout the semester, but to do so, we cannot go into much depth on any one topic.

30
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:44,580
This may feel frustrating for some of you who want to learn more about a specific concept

31
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:50,700
or health challenge or feel as though we don't pay enough attention to other health issues.

32
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:58,550
We hope this is the first to public health class. You take not the only public health class you take.

33
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:08,510
The School of Public Health offers many elective public health courses that are open to all students, regardless of your school or major.

34
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:13,220
We hope that taking this class will spark your interest in learning more about public

35
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:20,010
health and that you will take more classes that focus on specific topics in public health.

36
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:27,150
I'll also mention here that while we will reference and discuss covid-19 at various times throughout the semester,

37
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:37,760
covid is not the focus of this course. Here are our goals for your learning during the semester, by the end of the semester,

38
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:42,890
you will be able to explain what public health is, what distinguishes it,

39
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:48,530
or makes it different from others health, science, disciplines like medicine or nursing,

40
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:54,300
and what unique contributions public health makes to population health.

41
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,360
Second, by the end of the semester,

42
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:08,100
students will understand our nation's major public health challenges and the underlying factors that determine or cause those health problems.

43
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:17,950
This will include looking at biological, environmental and social factors that all contribute to disease.

44
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:27,700
Finally, by the end of the semester, we hope that you will gain both understanding and empathy for the pervasive and long

45
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:34,550
standing inequities in health outcomes that many of our nation's citizens experience.

46
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:41,690
These inequities are well-documented, but not well understood by the general public,

47
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:48,410
through data, through personal narratives, and perhaps by examining your own experiences.

48
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:56,240
Our goal is for you to better understand why some people are less able to maintain their health and to

49
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:05,820
gain empathy for the challenges facing so many of us in our attempts to maintain or improve our health.

50
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:12,120
OK, those are some big goals, let's give you a few specific details on what we will cover.

51
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:18,240
We'll start the course by giving you some background on the field of public health, the history of the field,

52
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:28,420
an overview of the current state of the nation's health and some terms and definitions that will have specific meanings and uses in this course.

53
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:35,980
Next, you'll learn about the core sciences of public health epidemiology and biostatistics.

54
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:42,820
Will then explore some of the biological or biomedical factors that influence health,

55
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:49,760
examining too broad disease categories, infectious diseases and chronic diseases.

56
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:55,320
Next, we will look at social and behavioral factors that influence health.

57
00:06:55,320 --> 00:07:00,960
Followed by how our physical environment influences health and illness.

58
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:08,040
Next, we'll focus on some specific populations and their health challenges, and towards the end of the course,

59
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:16,570
you will learn about the US health care system and the Affordable Care Act, colloquially known as Obamacare.

60
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:25,660
To wrap up the semester, we'll look ahead to the future of public health and it's going to be a busy, dynamic semester.

61
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:29,260
Public health two hundred is being taught in a hybrid format,

62
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:36,640
given the large enrollment in this course and the ongoing need for extra precautions due to the Koban 19 pandemic,

63
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:41,180
we are unable to meet as a large class safely.

64
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:50,260
The School of Public Health is leading by example in teaching its largest courses remotely or in a hybrid format.

65
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:57,600
Like many of you, we are disappointed not to be able to teach and learn together fully in person.

66
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,310
But in our distance,

67
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:09,330
we are upholding one of public health's values that individual sacrifices are often required to promote and protect the public's health.

68
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:18,450
So each week, the lecture component of the course will be delivered via a number of online lessons, which include prerecorded lectures,

69
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:27,240
some assigned readings from your textbook or other sources, and brief knowledge checks to make sure you are grasping key concepts.

70
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:37,010
These online lessons are posted on campus. Small discussion sections will meet in person at the School of Public Health.

71
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:45,160
Discussion sections offer a chance to engage with your peers and go into greater depth on coarse concepts.

72
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:51,800
There are unique readings or other materials you'll need to prepare for discussion section.

73
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:56,330
Regular participation in discussion section is one of the best ways to connect

74
00:08:56,330 --> 00:09:01,430
with the material and to learn from the perspectives of your fellow classmates.

75
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:10,570
Lastly, throughout the semester, you'll have the opportunity to interact with course and guest lecturers via forums.

76
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:17,110
Some forums will offer help on class assessments, including writing sessions and exam previews,

77
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:25,710
while others will be conversations driven by student questions with experts on various public health topics.

78
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:33,030
Some forums will offer help on class assessments, including writing workshops and exam previews,

79
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:40,600
while others will be conversations driven by student questions with experts on various public health topics.

80
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:51,580
Forums will not take place every week, so please take some time now to examine the course schedule for when these synchronous sessions will be held.

81
00:09:51,580 --> 00:10:00,790
Note them in your calendars. Tuning in for forums is essential to performing well in this course.

82
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:08,020
This slide shows how our course campsite is organized on the top left, you'll see our course homepage.

83
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:13,020
If you scroll down, you'll see a link for each unit of the course.

84
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:18,420
The image on the bottom right shows you an example of how one unit is organized,

85
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:26,020
including links to the prerecorded lecture and assigned readings for one online lesson.

86
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:34,510
Within our course campsite, you will also navigate to your page to access content for discussion sections,

87
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:43,076
your GSCI maintains this page and during discussion section will describe how you can access their page.
