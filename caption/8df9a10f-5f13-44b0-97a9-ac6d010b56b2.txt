1
00:00:05,853 --> 00:00:13,853
in which we will introduce some basic concepts associated with interaction and effect modification.

2
00:00:13,853 --> 00:00:21,853
So first, a quick outline. We're going to define effect modification, which I will just refer to as E.M. on the slides to save a bit of space.

3
00:00:21,853 --> 00:00:26,853
We'll talk about whether there's a difference between effect modification and interaction,

4
00:00:26,853 --> 00:00:30,853
which is really important because these phrases are often used interchangeably.

5
00:00:30,853 --> 00:00:36,853
I'll show you how affect modification and interaction are typically depicted on a DAG.

6
00:00:36,853 --> 00:00:45,853
And then we'll go through some key concepts in interaction, namely, these are biological interaction, and interaction under the sufficient cause model.

7
00:00:45,853 --> 00:00:50,853
So these are the causal pies that we introduced in the first week of class.

8
00:00:50,853 --> 00:00:54,853
And these are sort of causal approaches to thinking about interaction.

9
00:00:54,853 --> 00:01:02,853
And then we'll talk about statistical interaction, which is what we actually study and are able to quantify in epidemiologic research.

10
00:01:02,853 --> 00:01:11,853
And then we'll talk about additive and multiplicative interaction as the two key types of statistical interaction that we can quantify in data.

11
00:01:11,853 --> 00:01:21,853
So, first, definitions. Effect modification is defined as occurring when two or more risk factors for an outcome.

12
00:01:21,853 --> 00:01:26,853
And here, when I say risk factor, I mean any variable that's associated with a relative risk,

13
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:31,853
risk difference or other measure of association that is not null.

14
00:01:31,853 --> 00:01:39,853
So, greater than one or less than one for a relative measure or greater or less than zero for an absolute measure.

15
00:01:39,853 --> 00:01:48,853
So when two or more risk factors modify the effect of each other with regard to the probability of a given outcome occurring.

16
00:01:48,853 --> 00:01:56,853
We say that effect modification occurs when the effect of the exposure of interest on the outcome differs,

17
00:01:56,853 --> 00:02:02,853
depending on whether another variable referred to as the effect modifier is present.

18
00:02:02,853 --> 00:02:10,853
Such a modification is also known as effect measure modification or EMM, because it refers to this observed

19
00:02:10,853 --> 00:02:19,853
modification of the observed measure of association or effect in the presence of the effect modifying variable.

20
00:02:19,853 --> 00:02:26,853
It's also referred to as interaction. And unlike confounding, effect

21
00:02:26,853 --> 00:02:37,853
modification and interaction are not biases. Effect modification describes how a true association is modified by the presence or absence of

22
00:02:37,853 --> 00:02:46,853
a third variable. Effect modification provides a more detailed description of the association between an exposure and an outcome.

23
00:02:46,853 --> 00:02:56,853
So, effect modification or interaction is a real phenomenon that must be described and presented in our data when it occurs.

24
00:02:56,853 --> 00:03:03,853
It is a finding to be reported, and not a bias to be removed or adjusted for like confounding

25
00:03:03,853 --> 00:03:09,853
bias or the other types of bias that we have recently covered in previous weeks of class.

26
00:03:09,853 --> 00:03:13,853
I'll be going through a lot of examples throughout this lecture session.

27
00:03:13,853 --> 00:03:18,853
And let's start with one here. And also, this is a real example from my own research.

28
00:03:18,853 --> 00:03:27,853
So in this example, if the exposure is household financial conditions, the outcome is nutrition and gender is the effect modifier,

29
00:03:27,853 --> 00:03:35,853
we might hypothesize that improving household financial conditions might improve nutrition for people in the household.

30
00:03:35,853 --> 00:03:46,853
But maybe this only occurs for men in the household, in contexts of gender inequity and gender bias, when resources are scarce,

31
00:03:46,853 --> 00:03:53,853
men are differentially likely to receive and benefit from resources that the household gains as opposed to women.

32
00:03:53,853 --> 00:04:06,853
So in this situation, gender would be an effect modifier of the effect of improving household financial conditions on nutrition of household members.

33
00:04:06,853 --> 00:04:12,853
Now, let's kind of expand this definition of effect modification to think about interaction.

34
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:20,853
And here's where things can get confusing, because these phrases are often used interchangeably and definitions slightly

35
00:04:20,853 --> 00:04:25,853
vary across different textbooks and different papers that you might read.

36
00:04:25,853 --> 00:04:29,853
But here are the definitions that we are going to use in this class. First,

37
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:34,853
effect modification is the situation where we are interested in knowing whether the

38
00:04:34,853 --> 00:04:41,853
effect of an intervention or exposure varies across strata of another variable,

39
00:04:41,853 --> 00:04:48,853
such as race or sex gender. So the example that I gave you on the previous slide is an example of effect modification.

40
00:04:48,853 --> 00:04:57,853
We're specifically interested in the effect of a certain exposure and then we are only interested in the effects of the effect modifier

41
00:04:57,853 --> 00:05:05,853
to the extent that they alter the association of the exposure of interest with the outcome.

42
00:05:05,853 --> 00:05:13,853
Interaction is the situation where we are interested in these separate and combined or joint effects of two interventions,

43
00:05:13,853 --> 00:05:21,853
treatments or exposures. Interactions are useful to think about in terms of counterfactuals,

44
00:05:21,853 --> 00:05:31,853
and the quantification of interactions often take on a more formal causal approach than the above definition of effect modification.

45
00:05:31,853 --> 00:05:37,853
Mathematically, effect modification and interaction are often similar,

46
00:05:37,853 --> 00:05:41,853
and so the phrases are used interchangeably in the Rothman textbook.

47
00:05:41,853 --> 00:05:49,853
You will notice that Rothman considers effect modification and interaction to be the same thing.

48
00:05:49,853 --> 00:05:58,853
You will also note that in Szklo that the author's note that effect modification should really technically be referred to as measure of

49
00:05:58,853 --> 00:06:07,853
association modification because we're not always measuring or evaluating causal effects when we investigate effect modification.

50
00:06:07,853 --> 00:06:13,853
But, effect modification has become a common shorthand as opposed to measure of association modification,

51
00:06:13,853 --> 00:06:19,853
because as I'm sure you can tell, it's a bit less of a mouthful.

52
00:06:19,853 --> 00:06:25,853
In this class will we will learn some methods to identifying effect modification

53
00:06:25,853 --> 00:06:30,853
and interaction that take on slightly different conceptual approaches,

54
00:06:30,853 --> 00:06:34,853
whether we are trying to identify affect modification versus interaction.

55
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:42,853
But they actually lead us to the same conclusions. And whether or not we're talking about effect modification versus interaction,

56
00:06:42,853 --> 00:06:47,853
I think really depends on the substantive research question of interest.

57
00:06:47,853 --> 00:06:55,853
And I think it's appropriate to refer to effect modification if your substantive interest is really with respect to the exposure of interest,

58
00:06:55,853 --> 00:07:04,853
and you want to know how that exposure outcome relationship varies across levels of the third variable or effect modifying variable.

59
00:07:04,853 --> 00:07:10,853
And you're not really worried about the effect of the effect modifying variable itself. Whereas with interaction,

60
00:07:10,853 --> 00:07:18,853
I think is appropriate to talk about when you really are interested in these separate and joint effects of two different exposures,

61
00:07:18,853 --> 00:07:23,853
treatments or interventions.

62
00:07:23,853 --> 00:07:33,853
It just depends from a substantive and conceptual perspective how you want to think about the effect modification or interaction that is happening.

63
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:39,853
But I will note, though, that in the literature and in textbooks, you will often see these phrases used interchangeably,

64
00:07:39,853 --> 00:07:49,853
because ultimately, mathematically, we do end up at the same quantification, whether or not we're talking about effect modification or interaction.

65
00:07:49,853 --> 00:07:53,853
OK, moving on. Because we've recently learned about DAGs

66
00:07:53,853 --> 00:07:58,853
I wanted to show you how effect modification and interaction are typically shown on DAGs.

67
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:04,853
And the first thing I'll say is that there's actually no good way to show effect, modification or interaction on a DAG.

68
00:08:04,853 --> 00:08:14,853
And people disagree about how to do it. And you probably won't see it terribly often in papers just because it's not very intuitive or easy to show.

69
00:08:14,853 --> 00:08:22,853
So you might see this example, which I've shown here on the slide where you have the typical exposure outcome relationship and then someone

70
00:08:22,853 --> 00:08:29,853
might take the effect modifier with an arrow pointing down into the arrow between the exposure and the outcome.

71
00:08:29,853 --> 00:08:35,853
And I will say I've used this before in, you know, grant proposals and in brainstorming.

72
00:08:35,853 --> 00:08:39,853
It's technically incorrect. We really shouldn't have one arrow going into another arrow.

73
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:47,853
But I think it's actually kind of intuitive for a mental model when graphically thinking about how effect modification works.

74
00:08:47,853 --> 00:08:52,853
Another thing you might see is this where we have the exposure outcome relationship

75
00:08:52,853 --> 00:08:57,853
and then we have the effect modifier with its own arrow going into the outcome.

76
00:08:57,853 --> 00:08:58,853
This is technically more correct,

77
00:08:58,853 --> 00:09:07,853
especially when thinking about interaction and the independent and joint effects of both the exposure and effect modifying variable.

78
00:09:07,853 --> 00:09:14,853
Although when we talk about interaction, we talk about them as two exposures that have independent versus joint effects.

79
00:09:14,853 --> 00:09:17,853
But I think this is actually not intuitive and many people find this confusing.

80
00:09:17,853 --> 00:09:21,853
So it's actually not used that often.

81
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:29,853
OK, so now that we've gone through the basic definition of effect modification and interaction and how they relate to each other.

82
00:09:29,853 --> 00:09:34,853
I want to move on to three key concepts in interaction.

83
00:09:34,853 --> 00:09:39,853
And namely, again, these are biological interaction and interaction under the sufficient cause model

84
00:09:39,853 --> 00:09:44,853
when thinking about causal forms of interaction and then statistical interaction,

85
00:09:44,853 --> 00:09:47,853
which is what we can actually observe and quantify in data.

86
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:56,853
And this part of the lecture maps on really well to the reading in Rothman, which I highly recommend.

87
00:09:56,853 --> 00:10:04,853
So traditionally, causal interactions in epidemiologic data are understood to have a biological basis.

88
00:10:04,853 --> 00:10:10,853
There should be some kind of biological or other form of plausibility that leads us to

89
00:10:10,853 --> 00:10:16,853
think that there might be a real causal interaction between two variables of interest.

90
00:10:16,853 --> 00:10:21,853
And for the for those of you who are astute in thinking about this in relation

91
00:10:21,853 --> 00:10:26,853
to the causality session we had at the very beginning of the of the semester.

92
00:10:26,853 --> 00:10:31,853
This maps onto Hills plausibility guideline. So here's an example.

93
00:10:31,853 --> 00:10:42,853
Cigarette smoking and asbestos exposure are actually known to have a biological interaction that has been observed statistically in epidemiologic data.

94
00:10:42,853 --> 00:10:47,853
So both smoking and asbestos exposure lead to lung cancer.

95
00:10:47,853 --> 00:10:51,853
And there is a biological mechanism for both of these. Asbestos fibers

96
00:10:51,853 --> 00:11:00,853
kill cells by inducing a process called programed cell necrosis, which ultimately leads to the promotion of tumor growth.

97
00:11:00,853 --> 00:11:06,853
Carcinogens in cigarette smoke cause DNA damage, and this DNA damage leads to tumor formation.

98
00:11:06,853 --> 00:11:14,853
And the combination of these biological mechanisms has led investigators to hypothesize that the combination of asbestos

99
00:11:14,853 --> 00:11:23,853
exposure and smoking might lead to disproportionately greater risk for lung cancer or more disease than would be expected

100
00:11:23,853 --> 00:11:28,853
on the basis of the independent effects of each of these exposures on their own.

101
00:11:28,853 --> 00:11:36,853
So I think this is a great example and thinking through the biological plausibility of interaction.

102
00:11:36,853 --> 00:11:44,853
Another way that we can think about interaction from a causal perspective is using causal pies or the sufficient cause model,

103
00:11:44,853 --> 00:11:51,853
and you might have intuited that sufficient causes are a direct representation of effect modification or interaction.

104
00:11:51,853 --> 00:11:57,853
And so you've all actually had practice and thinking through this. So here's an example.

105
00:11:57,853 --> 00:12:00,853
Smoking, radon and asbestos exposure all cause lung cancer.

106
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:06,853
But there are some individuals that would only get lung cancer with certain combinations of these exposures.

107
00:12:06,853 --> 00:12:13,853
And I've shown these here in the causal pies on this slide. Where S is smoking A is asbestos exposure.

108
00:12:13,853 --> 00:12:19,853
R is radon exposure. And U, of course, are these mixtures of unknown causes.

109
00:12:19,853 --> 00:12:24,853
And so when we've thought through causal pies earlier on in the semester,

110
00:12:24,853 --> 00:12:31,853
what we're actually showing is interactions between factors that lead certain individuals to develop a disease or not.

111
00:12:31,853 --> 00:12:35,853
And this was actually on the very first quiz that we had, if you recall,

112
00:12:35,853 --> 00:12:46,853
where that very final question was about the joint effect of the presence of one risk factor, but the absence of another factor.

113
00:12:46,853 --> 00:12:51,853
And so we can actually now make a logical step to thinking about interaction and causal types.

114
00:12:51,853 --> 00:12:55,853
And again, remember, we learned about this in the beginning of the semester.

115
00:12:55,853 --> 00:13:00,853
So in a given population, there are people who would have gotten lung cancer if they smoked,

116
00:13:00,853 --> 00:13:03,853
would have gotten lung cancer if they were exposed to asbestos,

117
00:13:03,853 --> 00:13:10,853
would have gotten lung cancer only if they were exposed to both exposed to asbestos and smoked.

118
00:13:10,853 --> 00:13:15,853
And then those who would not have gotten lung cancer even if they smoked or were exposed to asbestos.

119
00:13:15,853 --> 00:13:21,853
So if you remember, these are the causal types that we referred to as doomed, or immune.

120
00:13:21,853 --> 00:13:24,853
I haven't shown the preventive that could also theoretically be here.

121
00:13:24,853 --> 00:13:36,853
And then the causality of exposure and thinking about interactions actually complicates these causal types in terms of giving us more of them.

122
00:13:36,853 --> 00:13:40,853
So for a binary outcome and two binary risk factors,

123
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:47,853
there are 16 possible causal types where we have four exposure combinations of the two risk factors that interact.

124
00:13:47,853 --> 00:13:51,853
And then two possible causal outcomes for each exposure combination.

125
00:13:51,853 --> 00:13:57,853
And these are expanded and described really well in the Rothman textbook. So take a look.

126
00:13:57,853 --> 00:14:00,853
So moving on to statistical interaction.

127
00:14:00,853 --> 00:14:06,853
So I just showed you two ways of thinking about causal interactions from a more kind of theoretical framework.

128
00:14:06,853 --> 00:14:10,853
But what we do in data is we observe interactions statistically.

129
00:14:10,853 --> 00:14:19,853
And so moving on with the smoking and asbestos example, examining a statistical interaction might look something like this.

130
00:14:19,853 --> 00:14:29,853
So I've shown you on the x axis four different combinations of exposures or, you know, causal factors for lung cancer.

131
00:14:29,853 --> 00:14:34,853
So all four have an unknown component cause.

132
00:14:34,853 --> 00:14:44,853
Two has smoking as well as the unknown component, cause three has asbestos, and then four has smoking and asbestos.

133
00:14:44,853 --> 00:14:52,853
And then this additional joint attributable risk that is due to the combination of both smoking and asbestos.

134
00:14:52,853 --> 00:14:57,853
And then the Y axis can be any absolute or relative measure of association.

135
00:14:57,853 --> 00:15:04,853
We're interested in. So the Y axis could be the magnitude of the risk ratio or the risk difference or the odds ratio, for example.

136
00:15:04,853 --> 00:15:14,853
And this is an example of a statistical interaction. And so here the observed joint effect is greater than the expected joint effect, which would be,

137
00:15:14,853 --> 00:15:20,853
of course, simply the effect of smoking and asbestos when they are added together.

138
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:27,853
So here we have something that we call super additive, where we have this additional magnitude of risk that is attributable to this

139
00:15:27,853 --> 00:15:32,853
combination of smoking and asbestos into indicating a statistical interaction.

140
00:15:32,853 --> 00:15:37,853
We'll get into this in more depth later on in the session as well.

141
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:45,853
So when we observe a statistical interaction, whether or not this reflects a causal interaction depends on a few things.

142
00:15:45,853 --> 00:15:52,853
So one is the scale of the measure of association. And we'll get into this in a little bit more depth when we talk about identifying interactions.

143
00:15:52,853 --> 00:15:57,853
So whether or not the scale, the measure of association is on the absolute scale.

144
00:15:57,853 --> 00:16:00,853
So something like the risk difference or the attributable risk.

145
00:16:00,853 --> 00:16:07,853
Sorry, that's a typo. That should be AR not AD. Or on the relative scale, we might actually see something very,

146
00:16:07,853 --> 00:16:11,853
very different with respect to the magnitude and direction of the interaction that we observe.

147
00:16:11,853 --> 00:16:14,853
And sometimes it's just due to the scale that we're looking at,

148
00:16:14,853 --> 00:16:20,853
as well as assumptions made about the presence of different causal interaction types in a given population.

149
00:16:20,853 --> 00:16:27,853
So when we were looking at the causal pies and thinking about causal types, there might be a causal interaction.

150
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:35,853
But we might not actually observe it in the population under study, given the composition of causal types in the population that we have.

151
00:16:35,853 --> 00:16:41,853
So we have to understand who is in our study sample and who they might be representing with respect to causal types,

152
00:16:41,853 --> 00:16:44,853
given the interaction that we hypothesize.

153
00:16:44,853 --> 00:16:52,853
And then, of course, it's important to consider the biological or social plausibility of the interaction in question.

154
00:16:52,853 --> 00:17:00,853
And finally, types of statistical interaction. Namely, these are additive interaction and multiplicative interaction.

155
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:07,853
Additive interaction occurs on the absolute difference scale or is also known as the attributable risk model,

156
00:17:07,853 --> 00:17:13,853
multiplicative interaction occurs on the relative different scale or ratio model.

157
00:17:13,853 --> 00:17:24,853
And for both additive and multiplicative interaction, we can have antagonistic or negative interaction or synergistic or positive interaction.

158
00:17:24,853 --> 00:17:29,853
A antagonistic interaction is when the combination of the two exposures gives

159
00:17:29,853 --> 00:17:33,853
a joint effect that is less than the sum of the two exposures individually,

160
00:17:33,853 --> 00:17:38,853
assuming that they act independently of one another. In contrast,

161
00:17:38,853 --> 00:17:42,853
a synergistic interaction is when the combination of the two exposures gives a

162
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:46,853
joint effect that is greater than the sum of the two exposures individually,

163
00:17:46,853 --> 00:17:56,853
assuming that they act independently. And then finally, I want to make a really important point about the rule of scales.

164
00:17:56,853 --> 00:18:00,853
So when to risk two factors are both risk factors for a disease.

165
00:18:00,853 --> 00:18:05,853
There will be interaction on the multiplicative scale. If there is no interaction on the additive scale.

166
00:18:05,853 --> 00:18:11,853
In other words, this means that no modification of risk differences implies modification of risk ratios.

167
00:18:11,853 --> 00:18:17,853
On the other hand, there will be interaction on the additive scale if there is no interaction on the multiplicative scale.

168
00:18:17,853 --> 00:18:24,853
In other words, no modification of risk ratios implies modification of risk differences.

169
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:28,853
And mathematically this is demonstrated really nicely in Rothman.

170
00:18:28,853 --> 00:18:36,853
It's a long mathematical proof on page 73, I recommend taking a look because it will help make us a little bit more clear.

171
00:18:36,853 --> 00:18:44,853
And finally, I just wanted to reiterate again that we can see a different directions of interactions on the additive versus multiplicative scale,

172
00:18:44,853 --> 00:18:48,853
so often it's important to investigate both.

173
00:18:48,853 --> 00:18:56,853
And when we describe or interpret an interaction that we observed in data, it is important to describe the direction and scale.

174
00:18:56,853 --> 00:19:01,853
So, for example, it's important to describe whether we are observing an antagonistic or synergistic

175
00:19:01,853 --> 00:19:06,853
interaction and whether this is on the additive or multiplicative scale.

176
00:19:06,853 --> 00:19:11,853
And finally, just to make it visually clear what I've been talking about in the last couple of slides,

177
00:19:11,853 --> 00:19:17,853
this is a figure from the Szklo textbook that shows us what additive and multiplicative interaction look like.

178
00:19:17,853 --> 00:19:21,853
Let's focus on the top half of the figure to start with.

179
00:19:21,853 --> 00:19:28,853
So on the Y axis, we have the risk or the rate of outcome Y per 1000 population members.

180
00:19:28,853 --> 00:19:32,853
And then on the X axis, we have the absence of Y on the left hand side or sorry,

181
00:19:32,853 --> 00:19:39,853
the absence of A, the exposure, on the left hand side and the presence of A, the exposure on the right hand slide.

182
00:19:39,853 --> 00:19:51,853
And then we have two slopes shown in both of the top panels, one where Z, the effect modifier, is present and one where Z, the effect modifier, is absent.

183
00:19:51,853 --> 00:20:00,853
So when an additive interaction is absent, we would see two parallel lines because the risk difference or attributable risk

184
00:20:00,853 --> 00:20:09,853
in the presence of A is the same regardless of level of Z.

185
00:20:09,853 --> 00:20:20,853
Right. So we have a difference of 30 per 1000 population members associated with the presence versus absence of A, regardless of the level of Z.

186
00:20:20,853 --> 00:20:26,853
And then in the top right panel, when an additive interaction is present,

187
00:20:26,853 --> 00:20:33,853
we would see non parallel slopes because we see that the

188
00:20:33,853 --> 00:20:39,853
risk difference associated with A differs across levels of Z.

189
00:20:39,853 --> 00:20:50,853
We have a risk difference of 30 per per 1000 population numbers associated with the presence of A when Z is absent.

190
00:20:50,853 --> 00:21:02,853
But we have a risk difference of 60 per 1000 population numbers associated with the presence of A when Z is present.

191
00:21:02,853 --> 00:21:08,853
And similarly, when we have multiplicative interaction, we would expect to see parallel lines.

192
00:21:08,853 --> 00:21:16,853
Sorry, when evaluating multiplicative interaction, we would have parallel lines when multiplicative interaction is absent.

193
00:21:16,853 --> 00:21:21,853
But non parallel lines when multiplicative interaction is present.

194
00:21:21,853 --> 00:21:30,853
And the one key thing to note here is that the Y axis for multiplicative interaction is on the logarithmic scale.

195
00:21:30,853 --> 00:21:36,702
And that's all. The next is part two, identifying interaction and effect modification.
