1
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:08,710
Yes. Two guys I read about.

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,360
They do. So what you're hearing first glorious day.

3
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:23,800
So welcome to our story right inside 37 hours so that we can be here in person.

4
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:30,720
And before I introduce Katie, one of our alumni, so happy to have here and sharing with you.

5
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:36,419
I just want to let you know that this this is essentially part two of Dr. Sealy conversation.

6
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:43,620
So moving forward, all of our co-presenters are going to be in the room together or on zoom in the room together.

7
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,290
But for the first couple, because it's the beginning of the semester, we had two spaced out.

8
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:54,959
Katie was traveling and works in a clinic where you need seven weeks notice before you can cancel your patients, etc.

9
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:02,550
So but we're really glad that she was able to come so close to this presentation and to follow up on maybe what we

10
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:12,930
might consider some of the more practical clinical applications of of counseling a patient that is contemplating,

11
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:20,669
undergoing or post bariatric surgery. So with that being said, we are recording and I'm going to introduce Katie.

12
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:29,550
So Catherine, Katie is a registered dietitian nutritionist and she is one of our U of M SBA graduates.

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,350
So she completed the Dietetics program in 2020, which, as we know,

14
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:42,840
that was a really challenging time to enter into a dietetic internship and was what we call kind of like the college's class of dietetic interns.

15
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:49,860
As you're just saying, it was mostly hybrid, but the environment.

16
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:56,459
So after graduating from SBA and completing her internship at Michigan Medicine while you were actually in medicine.

17
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:06,010
So that's right. Yeah. So it was hybrid, right? She started working in Michigan Medicine Bariatric Surgery Clinic in September of 2021.

18
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:10,710
So her nutrition areas of interest include weight management and diabetes management.

19
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,919
And outside of her position with Michigan Medicine, she also works,

20
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:21,360
who also works with the American Diabetes Association as a seasonal camp director and lead dietician for camp.

21
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:26,129
It has a camp for children with diabetes.

22
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:33,060
So yeah, so we're happy to have you here. And as a follow up to Dr. Staley's presentation.

23
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:40,680
Well, thank you, everyone, for having me. I did realize this is what I haven't been at this building for two and a half years now,

24
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,889
which is crazy to think about it and had to leave unexpectedly.

25
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:48,600
Right, because it was like one day we were here and the next day it was your home for the rest of the semester.

26
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:54,330
So it's awesome to be back. And just I guess a couple of housekeeping things.

27
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,640
I am totally open to questions as we go through like you don't have to save them for the end.

28
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,599
And I know this is like yet another lecture on bariatric surgery,

29
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:08,970
but I'm hoping that it'll be kind of a nice compliment because this is what I see in clinic.

30
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,570
Like Susan said, I only started a little over a year ago,

31
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:20,760
so it's possible that there are questions you ask that I just don't know the answer yet because I'm newer in this career and in the specialty.

32
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:25,649
So if that's the case, I'm going to I got my paper, I'm going to write it down and then I'm going to find the answers for you.

33
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:29,250
And I will follow up with Susan. So I don't want to leave your questions unanswered.

34
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,560
So, yeah, this is basically what Susan just said.

35
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:40,260
This is this is my graduation picture because we have to, like, meet with social distancing.

36
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:45,569
But I had already got my cap and gown for prior to my unexpected virtual commencement.

37
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:52,860
So anyways, what my plan for today is, is I'm going to take you stepwise through what our patients go through,

38
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:58,740
because like in the space of people, we're trying to lose weight.

39
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,440
Bariatric surgery is thought of as like the easy way out.

40
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:08,670
And so I'm I hope is that after today, you realize that is certainly not an easy process, at least not how our clinic does it.

41
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:13,530
Every bariatric clinic is going to be different, and I can only speak for ours because it's the only one I've worked on.

42
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:19,739
And as we go through this, I'm going to present some different studies that either justify some of the things that

43
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:24,780
we do with our patients or perhaps don't actually support what we do with our patients.

44
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:28,110
And, and go through that, like I said, questions as we go.

45
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:34,649
So first, what happens when our patients are pursuing bariatric surgery with our program is they have to

46
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:41,220
go through three different evaluations before they're even considered admitted to our program.

47
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:49,470
So first step, they do a medical evaluation with a physician assistant and they come and see me or two of my coworkers who are also for grabs,

48
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:57,930
and they do a dietary evaluation. And then we send them on to do a psychological evaluation with psychologists.

49
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:05,410
So. Want to go through each of these and kind of interweave some pieces to consider what clinical applications.

50
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:13,260
In the medical evaluation, they have to get a referral. They can't just, like, call our clinic and say, hey, I want bariatric surgery.

51
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:21,360
So a lot of the reasons why we get referrals are general, like weight associated comorbidity management,

52
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:26,790
like diabetes, hypertension, potentially fatty liver disease and of course others.

53
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:31,230
But those are ones that I see over and over again with a lot of my patients.

54
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:38,850
We also get patients that are pursuing hernia repairs like a non-emergent repair.

55
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:43,080
So our surgeons are specialized in minimally invasive surgery.

56
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,920
They don't just do bariatric surgery. They'll do hernia repairs.

57
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:52,230
They'll do gallbladder removals, things like that. Anything that can be done laparoscopically, that's what they do.

58
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:59,910
So they'll get patients referred to them for a hernia repair as a kind of reminder of

59
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:05,280
what a hiatal hernia is specifically would be some kind of like hole in the diaphragm.

60
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,660
And then the stomach starts coming out where it's like up into the chest cavity where it's not supposed to be.

61
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:18,090
So that might be a sliding hiatal hernia, which is in the middle, or it could even be a Paris arpeggio one where it's like next to the esophagus.

62
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:23,520
And depending on the severity of the hernia, the stomach can, like, really make its way up there.

63
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:27,870
And these are some of the most common causes of hiatal hernias.

64
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:31,890
Specifically at the bottom as applicable to my patients is obesity.

65
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,339
So the idea being, especially if there's a lot of central adiposity,

66
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:42,240
there's just like a lot of stuff there that's putting pressure on the stomach and that can contribute.

67
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,420
Maybe not cause what contribute to having a hiatal hernia.

68
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:57,270
When our surgeons get these patients, they'll if they see that their BMI is like could qualify for bariatric surgery and I'll go through that.

69
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:02,940
But like 35 and over usually forties and fifties is what we see for these patients.

70
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:10,400
Of course, there's all the problems with BMI, which, you know, but using that is like a proxy for body size and body composition.

71
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:14,790
They'll say like, sure, we can do this, but we want to optimize surgical conditions.

72
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,150
And because we can only do the surgical repair so many times,

73
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:24,120
have you considered bariatric surgery to assist with weight loss so that this is less likely to come back?

74
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:28,560
And obviously, like our surgeons are biased because they also do bariatric surgery,

75
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:36,390
but they're also experts and professionals and see that this does help with minimizing recurrence of hiatal hernias.

76
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:44,220
So kind of moving out from there, we will also see patients who are trying to qualify for other types of surgeries.

77
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:50,070
So if someone wants a knee replacement or a hip replacement, there might be a weight loss requirement.

78
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,450
And if they can't meet that through nonsurgical methods, they might pursue bariatric surgery.

79
00:07:54,990 --> 00:08:01,559
We might also see this for kidney transplant patients, which is kind of a newer program that we're working on as well,

80
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,790
in combination with the kidney transplant dietitian and Michigan medicine.

81
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:14,009
But the idea is, you know, again, thinking central adiposity, especially intra dominant, that if you're trying to do a kidney transplant,

82
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:21,090
it can surgically be too risky and complicated to get to the kidneys if there's a lot of body fat in the weight.

83
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:29,940
So it's been recommended and is becoming more popular across the country for bariatric surgery to lose weight to then qualify for a kidney transplant.

84
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:35,310
And I know I watched Dr. Celia's lecture just to kind of know what's already been said.

85
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:43,440
And there was like a little bit of uncertainty what her insurance BMI standards are for qualifying for bariatric surgery.

86
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:48,030
And this is what it is right now, depending on the insurance policy.

87
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:56,380
If you have a BMI of 35 to 39.9, you may need one or two weight associated comorbidities,

88
00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:03,000
some of the most common ones being obstructive sleep apnea, hypertension, type two diabetes and dyslipidemia.

89
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:09,240
There can be more. It's just what qualifies is very insurance dependent.

90
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:18,720
But all of the insurance policies that we see will allow someone with a BMI of 40 or more to get bariatric surgery,

91
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:27,450
even if they have no weight associated comorbidities. And then our program has a limit of a BMI of 65.

92
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:31,469
If someone has a BMI of over 65, they're not ruled out of our program.

93
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:39,300
But they work with us on weight management, weight loss to get their body weight to a place that is at a BMI of less than 65.

94
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:44,850
Do you guys do adolescents in three or do you have like a BMI requirement for adolescents?

95
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:48,479
Because I know that's prior to. Yes. So we don't do any.

96
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,140
Well, I guess it depends on how you define adolescence. We won't do anyone.

97
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:56,819
We won't do surgery for anyone under 18. But I have had patients that are 18,

98
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:03,270
19 that's kind of like that tricky age because I know there's some pediatric physicians that will see patients into their early twenties.

99
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:14,540
But yes, we will look at the BMI requirement. Stay the same because in the guise of insurance there adults is the maximum BMI like the back 65

100
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:19,520
maximum before due to the risk of something going wrong with surgery increasing after that point.

101
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:27,680
Yeah. So I, I this is where again like research that may or may not support our guidelines.

102
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:35,660
What I was told because I've asked my supervisor about this and what I was told was research supports that if someone has a BMI over 65,

103
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:42,049
the long term benefits are not great in terms of like keeping weight off.

104
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:46,010
And all of that is what I was told in preparation and preparing for this.

105
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:49,400
I did try finding peer reviewed literature and could not.

106
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:53,510
And talking to a coworker yesterday because I thought this might come up.

107
00:10:53,810 --> 00:11:02,930
She said it was her understanding that a BMI of over 62 generally has complications later on can increase.

108
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:09,110
Kind of like risk benefit analysis reveals that it's more risky than it's worth.

109
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:17,720
I was able to find one study that kind of supported that for patients who have diabetes and have a BMI of over 62.

110
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:24,260
I don't have that data here because I literally just found it today, but I can share that link with Susan if that's something of interest.

111
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:34,940
But yeah, I, I honestly don't know for sure how we settled on 65, but probably taking into account the 62 idea.

112
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,530
And so I don't really have a great answer for that one. That's just kind of what I was told.

113
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:44,389
Question Yeah, I'm just out of curiosity now.

114
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:50,330
I need to know the statistics, but how often do you see a patient with a BMI greater than 40 who doesn't have?

115
00:11:51,530 --> 00:12:03,410
Not often. What I will see is more so like maybe like osteoarthritis, developing some more so structural issues.

116
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:10,100
So if I, if I have a patient coming in who's in the 35 to 40 range, obviously they have to have something going on.

117
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:14,240
I would say like 40 to 45.

118
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:22,969
It's hit or miss if they have like a metabolic co-morbidity, but they might have obstructive sleep apnea, they might have osteoarthritis.

119
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:27,200
Or even if they don't have that official diagnosis, they tell me they're feeling it in their joints.

120
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,580
But when patients start getting into BMI of like 45 and definitely above 50,

121
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:38,960
I it's a rare thing that I see someone who doesn't have at least one metabolic issue going on.

122
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:48,710
Hypertension probably being the most common and then pre-diabetes or progressing to diabetes being the next one.

123
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:55,130
Yeah. So all the numbers are based on what the insurance says now, copper,

124
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:59,690
because someone comes in and says, I don't have insurance, I can afford to pay for it.

125
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:10,240
Does that number somehow change? Our program will still go with the 35 minimum just because that's like semi.

126
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:16,580
So my evidence based. So this was all determined like 20 years ago by like it says an NIH consensus panel.

127
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:23,989
So as you're kind of thinking about methods like research and what super evidence base is like, this isn't evidence based,

128
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:30,050
but it's also not like in our case it was a bunch of experts got together and based on what they see in clinic, this is what they decided.

129
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:42,410
So there is a literature supporting doing bariatric surgery for 30 to 35 BMI to hopefully like prevent things happening later.

130
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:46,040
But our surgeons don't stick to the lower limit of 35.

131
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,360
But yeah, if someone can self-pay, then it changes the game.

132
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:56,570
Our program may still require certain things because we typically don't just take someone to be like, okay,

133
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:02,000
you're going to self-pay right on the surgery you go through to go through the best CAS line,

134
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:07,240
but it is a little less regulated or less requirement, right?

135
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:12,680
Yeah. I guess medical necessity is questioned in the lower like 30 to 35.

136
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:19,340
Yeah. Yeah. So our surgeons still take these kinds of things into account just because like we,

137
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:25,219
we don't want to do surgery for someone just because they want to be like a certain weight on the scale or certain pants size.

138
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:31,040
You know, it's not just a vanity thing because then there are complications after surgery and that we've like.

139
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:34,400
It's not possible for us to do that. So we will keep these kinds of things in mind.

140
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:40,790
But like, you know, perhaps, maybe they say, like, I just have pre-diabetes and, you know,

141
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:46,969
want surgery that wouldn't qualify if they had insurance because it has to be a full diabetes diagnosis.

142
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:51,350
But if they were self-pay, then that is something we would do because, you know.

143
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:56,049
How does someone even get it to like this medical evaluation?

144
00:14:56,050 --> 00:15:03,280
Like, are they going themselves thinking they want bariatric surgery or are they being like for like reference from like a PCP?

145
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:07,770
Like, how does that. All of those. So, so there's a variety of reasons.

146
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:14,290
Like, so in the instance of like the hernia, as I was talking about, I've gotten patients coming into like when they see me.

147
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:20,890
So they've done the medical, now they're doing dietary evaluation and they're like overwhelmed because they were never considering this before.

148
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:26,110
I had a lady who I worked very closely with is about to get surgery in three weeks,

149
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:30,700
but I worked with her for over the past year and she like broke down and was crying in my appointment.

150
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:40,140
I spent an hour and a half with her because she was like, I never wanted this, but she has one of these parasite fungal hernias and I'm not a surgeon.

151
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,440
I haven't seen any imaging,

152
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:47,890
but I can just tell from how her body is formed that there's something going on in her chest and her stomach is like up there.

153
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:54,760
And she was actually referred to a thoracic surgeon and they're like, you should get bariatric surgery to help with this.

154
00:15:55,930 --> 00:16:03,339
And she's she's done awesome. But yeah, so it will be some patients will maybe be seeing their primary care physician,

155
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:09,909
maybe they've been developing co-morbidities over time and then their primary care physician might suggest it.

156
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:17,680
It could be either party ologist, their endocrinologist, depending on who they're seeing, and then they can write a referral to our clinic.

157
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:22,149
And then once that referrals in our call center will call and say, Hey,

158
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:27,850
we received Dr. Smith's referral for bariatric surgery consultation and they'll schedule that first appointment,

159
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,610
whereas some people are kind of the opposite.

160
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:38,800
They've been considering it for years and maybe their PCP hasn't brought it up and then they discuss it with their PCP and decide to go for it.

161
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:42,740
So. Okay.

162
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:49,240
One other thing. One other thing that our peers talk about is the type of procedure we do send everyone an

163
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:53,229
educational video and we hope that they watch it before they come in so they know what's an option.

164
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:58,540
But we still get patients coming in saying, Oh, wait, you're not doing the band anymore.

165
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:04,690
And so these are the two procedures that we do. We do the sleeve gastrectomy and the ruin y gastric bypass.

166
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:15,490
80 to 90% of our cases are sleeved depending on the year, and 10 to 20% are the bypass in the medical evaluation.

167
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:22,660
The P.A. will also kind of figure out like, is there actually a medical indication to suggest doing the bypass?

168
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:29,200
It is more involved. There are more complications. But the biggest thing being if someone has like really, really bad GERD,

169
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:34,120
lots of reflux and it's not well controlled with meds, the sleeve can make that worse.

170
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:37,240
And so then they might suggest doing the bypass.

171
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:43,060
If there's not a medical indication, we leave it up to the patient, but they'll talk about the pros and cons of both.

172
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:50,320
And the patient can always change their mind. Really, the point when a patient has to commit to one or the other is when we're like literally blocking

173
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:55,629
the O.R. and even then it can still kind of like if someone says they want the bypass.

174
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:58,630
And then I literally had a patient like two weeks ago say, you know what?

175
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:00,100
I thought about it, I want the sleeve.

176
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:07,989
Well, the bypass requires more time in the O.R., so we had more time needed and more time needed so that if we change the procedure.

177
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:12,310
And so that was fine. But for the most part, it's when the case request goes in and the O.R. is booked.

178
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:17,200
But it is important to remember that there are going to be other types of surgeries out there.

179
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:23,830
So the the aigbe, the adjustable gastric banding, that one's not really done so much anymore.

180
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:27,460
And there's the sleeve gastrectomy, the ruin, my gastric bypass.

181
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:36,370
And then I think Dr. Seeley mentioned it, but the Ilio pancreatic diversion with a duodenal switch, that's the one in the bottom right hand corner.

182
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,930
We do not do that one.

183
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:50,290
This image here shows that it has the best outcomes as far as like improving excess weight loss, improving hypertension, diabetes.

184
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:56,319
But this image does not show the complications, the risk of malnutrition, everything like that.

185
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,770
So we don't do this one because of how severe that is.

186
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:05,080
But kind of thinking in terms of becoming a dietitian, even if you don't go into bariatric surgery,

187
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:11,080
but especially here in the outpatient world or in patient, you could see patients who have a medical history of this.

188
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:21,639
And I had a patient who had the duodenal switched on elsewhere like years ago, and I was like, haven't seen this one because we don't do this.

189
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:26,680
So I had to do some research. But knowing that these things are out there because we still get we get

190
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:32,380
patients like I talked to one today who she had an open gastric bypass in 1999.

191
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:37,030
So you can get patients who have decades old bariatric surgeries.

192
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:45,460
So how has that been your clinical experience with the merchant?

193
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:51,730
I've only had one patient and I like I said, I've also I've only been doing this a little over a year and a half, but.

194
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:56,440
I'm I'm tracking my hours so I can do specialty certification.

195
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:05,559
So I can say out of 700 hours, just literally the time I've spent in appointments, but I've counseling time of 700 hours.

196
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:09,100
I've literally only seen one patient who's had that. It is not common.

197
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,500
I don't even remember where she signed on,

198
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:21,489
but she lives up in the south of Michigan and she got referred to us because she was having, um, failure to thrive.

199
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:29,530
She's an older lady. She had it done a while back, and so she was like losing weight and can't really remember what else is happening there.

200
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:35,860
But so it's interesting to then have to work with a patient on weight gain because that's not usually what I do.

201
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:39,670
So it's like the opposite of everything I talk about with most patients.

202
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:46,170
Yeah. And I mean, we will see some patients who had the gastric band and then they're either like

203
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:50,380
going to have it removed or they are coming in for a console to get it adjusted.

204
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:53,200
But it's not common for us at this point.

205
00:20:55,330 --> 00:21:04,719
One thing the APA also does, which is I think a very cool thing, is they give a patient kind of like outcomes based on both procedures.

206
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,790
And we use this MVC outcomes calculator that BSD is the Michigan Bariatric Surgery

207
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:14,140
Collaborative and there's 41 bariatric centers in Michigan that are part of this.

208
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:18,100
So we pull data, we pull outcomes, and it's a great way to collaborate.

209
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:22,390
And actually the annual meetings are like literally today, tomorrow and Friday,

210
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:28,060
but it takes into account age, sex, race, BMI and weight associated comorbidities.

211
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:33,460
This is what the like a screenshot of what it looks like is but I'm not going to take the time to go through it.

212
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,969
There is the web, the URL if you want to play around with it just to kind of see.

213
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:46,930
But I am going to give an example. So comparing two different patients, we have a 35 year old female who identifies as white £225,

214
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:54,430
BMI of 37, compared to a 55 year old male who identifies as African-American and £375, BMI 62.

215
00:21:54,430 --> 00:22:02,500
So very different demographics. But they both have hyperlipidemia non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus,

216
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:06,400
type two diabetes, but they're not taking insulin yet and they both have sleep apnea.

217
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:12,490
So then we can put all that information into this calculator and then this gives a comparison of outcomes.

218
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:21,190
So the one year projected weight loss, like the weight to get down to for the female would be £163,

219
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:26,409
which would be £62 loss and 28% of her total body weight loss.

220
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:29,440
And you can see the middle section. This is for the sleep.

221
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:34,810
You can see the likelihood of resolving these comorbidities at one year after surgery.

222
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:41,650
So 75% for hyperlipidemia, 85% for diabetes, 74% for sleep apnea.

223
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:48,970
We also let them know the risk of complication, both like any kind of complication at all and then also severe.

224
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:53,650
So you can see that for severe complications, these are relatively small.

225
00:22:53,920 --> 00:23:00,340
If we do get a patient who has a risk of severe complication over 5%, it's a dealbreaker.

226
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:03,670
We don't proceed further because it's just too risky.

227
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:10,780
But that could be the difference between doing the bypass or the sleeve. Maybe the bypass is too risky, but the sleeve is safer.

228
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,530
And then you can see for this, for the guy on the right and then comparison to the bypass,

229
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:23,620
the numbers are all more so higher likelihood of resolving these comorbidities.

230
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:29,259
What's not shown in these slides, but what they do get is also their two and three year weight loss projections.

231
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:35,770
And there is typically at least a 5 to £10 regain depending on the person.

232
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:44,140
There can be substantially more than that. But even for the person who's like succeeded and has kept the weight off,

233
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:49,330
there's the lowest weight they get to is not typically going to be where their weight stabilizes.

234
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:51,370
It'll be a little bit higher than that.

235
00:23:51,700 --> 00:24:01,030
If not, more patients are also required if they have insurance and not self-pay to do medically supervised weight loss visits.

236
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:05,590
And then what they have to do is very insurance dependent.

237
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:09,429
So these are just some examples of some of the ones that I'll see.

238
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:12,339
And this is changing. Like I've just had to deal with this.

239
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:17,560
Yesterday a patient told me she called her insurance and was told because her BMI is over 50, she doesn't have to do these.

240
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:22,299
And I was like, Oh, I haven't heard that yet. And sure enough, that was the case.

241
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:25,660
And that was a new change as of July for her insurance this year.

242
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:31,600
Some of these can be pretty restrictive for patients though and can come to me anyways.

243
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,559
Feel kind of punitive.

244
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:41,560
So like honestly seeing it through a public health lens, some of the policies like 12 consecutive months of visits with consistent weight loss,

245
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:47,020
that's the most restrictive one that I see and that's honestly from one of the cheapest health insurance policies.

246
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:51,340
So kind of thinking about a patient population that might.

247
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:56,500
Need to go with a cheaper policy and statistically might have higher rates of these co-morbidities.

248
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:03,460
And, you know, going under the assumption that bariatric surgery will help if they have a higher likelihood of having these co-morbidities.

249
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,329
This would be even more helpful to them, but they're more financially dependent on their insurance to cover this.

250
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:15,730
They may not be able to afford self-pay, and so then they have to do 12 months of this.

251
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:20,080
And because we need consistent weight loss, we can't just do telehealth with them.

252
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:28,180
So as gas prices have gone up, we have had patients who can't afford to keep coming in to see us, and that's created barriers to for their care.

253
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,620
Patients can do these with their primary care physicians, but if they can't,

254
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:39,579
if their primary care physicians don't have the availability to see them monthly, it creates a barrier.

255
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:44,620
So it's been tricky since you brought up the income level.

256
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:50,970
I'm wondering if the requirements for supplementation through the surgery, how do those patients?

257
00:25:52,330 --> 00:26:01,600
Yeah. So one of the things that we ask about in the dietary evaluation is just kind of it's a general question and someone answers,

258
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:07,300
yes, I ask for more detail to like unofficially screen screening, food insecurity because someone can't afford food.

259
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:11,710
Then affording supplements is also a big concern.

260
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:17,589
But we have like this questionnaire we have them fill out and we have like common challenges to weight loss and audit.

261
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:22,600
We do have like difficulty affording healthy food or something like that.

262
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:28,750
But of course that can mean different things to different people. Like, I can't afford to eat organic food, but I can get non-organic.

263
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:34,149
So then I kind of ask like, Have you ever felt like your food is going to run out by the end of the month?

264
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:37,450
Do you like can you generally fit like non-organic things into your budget?

265
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:44,920
But if someone tells me that they can't like they do, they are running out of food by the end of the month.

266
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:51,460
Or I've had patients like, well recommend that they start the supplements before they have surgery.

267
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:58,690
And it's like nutritionally most of our patients don't need a multivitamin with iron and calcium citrate already,

268
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:01,510
but we want to see that they can consistently take them,

269
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:08,980
take them for compliance, that they can afford to purchase them, and that they are getting like the right types, like getting calcium citrate.

270
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:15,910
So calcium carbonate and also they're not having tolerance issues because if they are, we want to troubleshoot that before surgery.

271
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:21,820
But yeah, if someone tells me through multiple visits like, oh, I haven't started yet because it's just not in the budget,

272
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:29,710
then I do present that to the surgeons and I'm fortunate to work in a clinic where our surgeons very much value our expertize and opinions.

273
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:37,570
And if I feel strongly about it, I will say like we can't move forward until we see that this is happening.

274
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:46,160
Not that we want it to be punitive, but like. There are serious consequences later on if you're not taking these supplements and that's not ethical.

275
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:48,560
So it is worked into there.

276
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:56,660
And so I do think it is a benefit to our clinic that like me, Amy and Susanna, my dietician colleagues are all through trial,

277
00:27:56,660 --> 00:28:03,470
public health trained, and we're all very passionate about making sure people can afford what they need.

278
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:10,879
There are certain things that we can recommend, like if they get a prescription for like a B12 injection that insurance can pay for.

279
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:16,520
And if they do take a weekly vitamin D through prescription, that's a way to get insurance to pay.

280
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:24,080
Women of childbearing age can get a prenatal vitamin. So there's ways we can help, but it doesn't fix the whole issue.

281
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:32,330
Interestingly, though, so incorporating some research, this study is older.

282
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:41,300
It's from 2012. And like with insurance companies requiring this, like do these preoperative visits actually make any kind of difference?

283
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:49,550
So this is from 2012 and is a pilot study. So of course, pilot studies are meant to be expanded on and there's always limitations to things like that.

284
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:54,500
But what they did was they from this clinic,

285
00:28:54,500 --> 00:29:05,959
they found 55 patients and they ultimately tracked like if they were doing these visits before and they were randomized,

286
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:09,110
that they weren't required by insurance, they were randomized into two different groups,

287
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:15,020
the like MSW, a medically supervised weight management or usual care.

288
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:23,150
So they had 15 patients doing one treatment, the other ones doing the control usual care where they didn't get much preoperative counseling.

289
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:32,000
And then this is where the gastric band is a little older, but the idea being like, what's the effect of getting pre operative counseling?

290
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:37,650
And then they monitored outcomes up until six months after follow up are six months after surgery.

291
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:47,340
They did have a pretty homogenous group of people and so mean age 46 to 47 years old.

292
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:52,160
All of their patients were female, the majority identified as Hispanic or non-Hispanic black.

293
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:58,100
Most had a high school education or less, and most report an average income of less than 20,000.

294
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:07,650
So for reasons we just discussed, this is already maybe a population that could experience other barriers than so that can like adding,

295
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:11,690
you know, kind of some variables to actually assessing the effectiveness of this.

296
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:18,080
And they did find, at least for their patient population, that there was no significant difference in weight loss.

297
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:27,650
And most patient behaviors were found to be somewhere between the two treatments suggesting that these pre-op visits are pointless.

298
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:32,510
So, you know, that kind of made me feel like what's the point of my job, at least pre operatively.

299
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:38,540
But they did have a high dropout rate and and this was due to insurance issues, transportation, all that.

300
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:42,380
And like it says, indicative of numerous non-clinical challenges.

301
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:47,960
And there was also poor attendance at these pre-op visits. So it's like if someone's not coming, how well can you say that it works or not?

302
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:55,310
And I guess I would say to that with like, I mean, yeah,

303
00:30:55,310 --> 00:31:02,360
there's just other barriers that could be there that are beyond the control of the clinic because of the population they were looking at.

304
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:06,530
So on the flip side, this is a newer study from 2019.

305
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:10,970
They looked at an intensive multidisciplinary intervention.

306
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:15,590
So looking at if we adjusted this pre operatively, we just did this postoperatively,

307
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:20,030
and if we did it together, what effect would this have for our patients?

308
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:28,610
And so this was a systematic review and meta analysis is still not a, you know, in our city or anything like that,

309
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:39,110
but at least a little more inclusive than having a very homogenous group of people that could have like social determinants of health barriers.

310
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:45,740
And so ultimately they were able to look at over 1500 participants.

311
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:51,290
And they when they were looking at the studies that they wanted to include, they include of include a variety here,

312
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:57,890
but they excluded any reviews, observational studies, any pretest, post-test study designs and cross-sectional studies.

313
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:09,950
And so for a paper study or anything to be included in this this review, they had to have had interventions implemented by a multidisciplinary team,

314
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:15,440
and that had to include at least three health disciplines and had to include a surgeon, a nurse.

315
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:20,540
And any intervention had to be for at least a greater than two weeks of delivered

316
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:24,650
cre operatively and at least three months if delivered post operatively.

317
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:30,319
I will say this would not constitute my clinic with how it's set up.

318
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:40,550
We have definitely multidisciplinary intervention pre operatively, but to have an intensive intervention postoperatively we.

319
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:48,170
Are lacking there. Which is unfortunate, given that we are probably one of the more involved programs.

320
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:54,949
We are a lifelong follow up clinic. Some other ones will maybe follow their patients until two months or one year postoperatively.

321
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:59,030
And then you're done. You're on your own. But our patients have access to our program forever.

322
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:05,750
If they're lost to follow up, if they choose to stop coming to their appointments, then that's a personal decision.

323
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:11,300
But we're always here and they can always call back and be like, You know what? I'm five years out, but I'm having a hard time.

324
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:19,010
Can I see a dietician or an endocrinologist? So we do have that support for them and it's still not what was done here.

325
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:30,380
But they found that just doing preoperative intensive, multidisciplinary team interventions, it reduced the effect of weight loss.

326
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:38,449
So patients did not lose as much weight. It was more so when they did post-operative interventions that they saw a large significant effect.

327
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:46,130
And surprisingly, when they did pre-op, pre-op and post-op, they found like a small size effect.

328
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:52,220
There was still increased weight loss, but it wasn't as effective as just post-operative intervention, which was surprising to me.

329
00:33:54,140 --> 00:34:00,080
But either way, their recommendation, their conclusion from this was to recommend an intensive,

330
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:08,330
multidisciplinary team intervention and especially incorporate it postoperatively rather than putting that on pre operatively,

331
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:13,010
which is not how bariatric surgery is currently done with really anybody.

332
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:15,649
But this might be the way that it needs to go,

333
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:24,139
and especially with more of our insurance policies that we see being a lot less stringent in those pre-op things.

334
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:30,710
But we're limited in what we can do postoperatively with staffing and all of that.

335
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:37,100
Okay. So then they go to the dietary evaluation.

336
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:42,980
And so this is with me and we talk through some of the significant lifestyle changes that are required.

337
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:47,240
Patients have to eliminate carbonation and caffeine by the time of surgery.

338
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:52,430
Carbonation, that gas is not going to feel great in their stomach as it's healing can also make them feel full.

339
00:34:52,430 --> 00:34:58,430
And if they're filling up on carbonation and they're not eating food, that's risk of malnutrition.

340
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:08,329
And then the caffeine can act as a diuretic. And if someone's urinating more and they also are having difficulty drinking enough fluids after surgery,

341
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:12,500
especially like right after that, they're at risk of severe dehydration.

342
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:16,130
We don't have many patients that need IV fluids afterwards, but we have had a handful.

343
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:24,020
And the, you know, a little over a year that I've been, clinic patients do need to work on increasing protein.

344
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:29,450
A lot a lot of patients are like, oh, my gosh, how do I get to 70 grams a day?

345
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:32,990
But like, we talk through it and then it seems less daunting.

346
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:40,160
And we do tell them they need to work on getting at least 64 ounces of sugar free decaf non-carbonated fluid per day.

347
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:47,810
Because if they're only drinking like 20 ounces of fluid a day before surgery, it's not going to get better when they're kind of feeling crappy.

348
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:48,740
They just had surgery.

349
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:57,620
And then one of the biggest things that's hard is, well, asking them to do and what I personally don't like saying as a provider,

350
00:35:57,620 --> 00:36:02,689
but they do have to decrease grain based carbs sources like various breads, pasta,

351
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:06,890
rice and derivatives of those just decreasing it to one or two servings a week.

352
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:18,079
This is not because our you know, our programs that like carbs are bad, but with how those things are kind of like like absorb water,

353
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:24,170
absorb fluid in the stomach and then get bigger in a non, you know, in the non reduced stomach size.

354
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:31,610
There's space for that. But our concern is long term and they're, you know, literally like filling up by having too much bread.

355
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:37,910
There's literally not enough space for protein sources, fruits, vegetables, and then that can contribute to long term malnutrition.

356
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:49,219
I will say again, kind of like public health lens. It is one of my least favorite things to get like Central or South American patient or an

357
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:55,070
Asian patient or somebody where like rice and bread is very much like a cultural food base.

358
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:00,500
And then I have to tell them, like the reality of bariatric surgery, nutrition is you have to cut back on this.

359
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:09,080
And I mean, I explain the necessity, but it's one of those things right now, one of my favorite parts of my job, full transparency.

360
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:12,230
We also talk about the supplements that they'll need to take.

361
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:18,049
This is something that can sway patients to one procedure or another because ultimately someone who gets the

362
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:24,170
gastric bypass needs to take some kind of supplement five times a day or the sleeve is three times a day.

363
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:30,919
And the biggest difference being for the vertical sleeve gastrectomy is one multi vitamin a day for the bypass,

364
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:34,879
it's two for the sleeve, it's two calcium citrate doses per day.

365
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:40,550
And for the bypass it's three. I'm going back to the recommendation.

366
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:43,740
Or the lifestyle change to decrease the grain based carbs.

367
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:49,110
What happens if someone underreport how much of that they're actually eating?

368
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:55,780
Is there any way to kind of like measure without adherence? Because if they're not following that, what does that do to their risk?

369
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:58,630
Yeah, so it is all self-report.

370
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:06,640
I will say one of the things I've been surprised about is how honest I feel most patients are about their dietary recall.

371
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:12,370
Like even like I do not so much a 24 hour recall of a typical dietary intake.

372
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:17,379
And I'm surprised how many patients, patients will say like, oh, you know,

373
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:26,050
I'm still getting like a sausage Egg McMuffin each morning from McDonald's, things like that for the patients that like.

374
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,829
Come into this from the beginning.

375
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:35,120
And we see there's a lot of grain based carbs and lots of pasta, lots of variety, which is like typical American diet stuff too.

376
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:43,020
So totally understandable. You kind of start to get a feel for like, who could be lying to you?

377
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,360
Not that you can tell them that they're lying.

378
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:53,130
But then like my approach is if I have a feeling like after working with a patient a bit or collaborate with my coworkers,

379
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:58,950
if I have a feeling that maybe they're underreporting, I start to ask more detailed questions about their recall.

380
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:03,800
Because if someone's trying to just underreport, check something off their list,

381
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:12,210
get to surgery because surgery is the be all end all by asking more details that people start to stumble and then they'll kind of be like,

382
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:16,700
okay, well actually I'm eating like two cups of pasta or some kind of thing.

383
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:24,510
So unfortunately, though, if people could get away with underreporting and at the end of the day,

384
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:28,500
it's we can only do so much and it's certainly a limitation.

385
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:36,280
Do you do the education as well about alcohol and smoking cessation, or is that more of a medical evaluation?

386
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:44,639
We No. One in our program does a whole lot of education with that in the medical evaluation and then also in dietary evaluation,

387
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:55,260
we do ask about what your current and past tobacco habits are, alcohol consumption and drug use, including marijuana.

388
00:39:55,650 --> 00:40:01,980
That's also restricted you because like marijuana is legal in Michigan, but there are insurance policies that will require a negative drug screen.

389
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:07,620
And those are also the ones that are like the cheaper insurance policies.

390
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:15,030
So it feels like it penalizes people from lower socioeconomic brackets and stuff.

391
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:23,490
But anyways, so we do ask about that. If someone is having difficulty smoking, we can refer them to the Michigan Medicine Smoking Cessation Program.

392
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:26,970
And then we also have one for like alcohol of use.

393
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:32,880
What can also happen is we notify the neuropsychology team, which is the third evaluation,

394
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:36,270
and we say like, Hey, I'm really concerned about this patient's alcohol intake.

395
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:46,290
They also ask questions about it and that they can make it a requirement from like a psychological perspective that the patient has to work on,

396
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:52,380
like minimize, like assisting with alcohol, dependance and sobriety and all of that.

397
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:57,600
Our patients who are actively smoking when they come into our program are told

398
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:02,100
they need to have a negative nicotine screen before they can meet with a surgeon.

399
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:07,679
So we do need them to quit smoking at some point, which may or may not happen for some people.

400
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:15,059
It can be something that holds them up, but that's something our program feels strongly about with smoking marijuana.

401
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:20,310
Our surgeons are okay if they switch edibles as long as their insurance isn't opposed to it because

402
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:24,990
they just don't want anything to be inhaled into their lungs to potentially affect anesthesia.

403
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:28,890
But they're not selling edible marijuana products.

404
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:34,959
Yeah. All right? Yes. What is the time frame?

405
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:35,860
For the first time,

406
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:44,799
someone comes in for that first evaluation surgery and then from surgery to post-operative time that you're seeing them and there will be an effect.

407
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:52,870
So I have a nutritionist, so very patient dependent, which I feel like is my answer to all my patients to when they ask me questions.

408
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:58,810
It depends on where someone's at when they come in. Because I guess I didn't say this in the medical evaluation part.

409
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:03,490
It is a thorough medical evaluation and there can be specialty clearances that are required.

410
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:10,170
So if someone needs to get clearance from their cardiologist, their nephrologist there, and a chronology, well, that usually is under your knowledge,

411
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:16,690
referring some insurance policies will require patients with a BMI over 50 getting an EGD, all these kinds of things.

412
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:19,600
So if someone has a lot of those kinds of medical requirements,

413
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:25,300
regardless of how many times they see a dietician that can really slow them down based on appointment availability,

414
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:31,600
if someone is well, well for the sake of this question will pretend someone's very medically not complex.

415
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:36,909
That would also depend on how their like lifestyle is coming into things.

416
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:43,059
But I've had patients come in to it and they'd like well researched bariatric surgery, knew what they were going to have to do.

417
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:47,620
And by the time they like when they see me, they're already doing all the things I would ask them to do.

418
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:58,240
And so perhaps they could, from their medical evaluation to surgery, that could be like four or five months on the short end.

419
00:42:58,510 --> 00:43:01,510
That's like they fly through everything. They're already doing all the right things.

420
00:43:01,510 --> 00:43:07,870
We have nothing we require of them and they have a very loosey goosey insurance policy and they've already satisfied those

421
00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:15,370
like Blue Cross Blue Shield only requires patients to have a history of weight loss attempts in the past four years.

422
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:21,040
So if they've met with a dietician through their cardiology office and they, you know,

423
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:28,690
they have like three different weight management visits that's satisfied and then post operatively we see them.

424
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:36,909
This is later in my thing, but I'm to jump to it now. We see them at two weeks post-op, two months post-op, six months post-op, one year post-op,

425
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:41,739
and then annually after that, dietitians are at each of those points at two weeks post-op.

426
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:45,370
It's a dietician and their surgeon. At two months, it's just the dietician.

427
00:43:45,370 --> 00:43:53,170
At six months, they transfer from being a patient under the Department of Surgery to being a patient in the Metabolism Endocrinology Clinic.

428
00:43:53,770 --> 00:43:58,239
And so then they see a dietician and a technologist.

429
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:01,480
And then annually after that, it's a dietician and an endocrinologist.

430
00:44:02,530 --> 00:44:06,549
My coworkers, Amy and Susanna, work in the men's clinic. I do not.

431
00:44:06,550 --> 00:44:14,760
So it's it's not common for me to see patients past two months if they need extra assistance between those six months,

432
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:20,020
one year and then annual visits, I'm allowed to see them. But because I don't have an appointment in the men's clinic,

433
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:25,780
I don't see them for those like checkpoint visits because we don't want to mess with the terms of our accreditation.

434
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:31,390
And, and like Amy and Susanna work more closely with that different allergist because they're in that clinic.

435
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:39,549
But that's kind of the the short term or the shortest length of time, long term, like longer prospects.

436
00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:46,960
We do have patients that can take several years and medical evaluations expire after all, evaluations expire after a year.

437
00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:49,900
So, you know, everyone's in a different stage of readiness for change.

438
00:44:50,050 --> 00:44:57,130
So if patients are really having a hard time and they just keep moving forward and they don't want to like table the idea of bariatric surgery,

439
00:44:57,490 --> 00:45:02,049
they can keep having to repeat their evaluations. We can keep having to get more specialty clearances.

440
00:45:02,050 --> 00:45:03,250
So it can take a long time.

441
00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:14,350
I would say most people, though, on average are getting surgery within like a year or two, a year and a half of their first appointment with us.

442
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:29,650
Just in terms of micronutrient recommendations, these were updated guidelines in 2016 from the American Society of Metabolism and Bariatric Surgery.

443
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:41,530
And the whole idea is that they wanted to optimize post-op outcomes because of the idea that nutritional status begins pre operatively.

444
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:47,260
And most patients pursuing weight loss surgery or their acronym WLS,

445
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,940
tend to have at least one vitamin mineral deficiency or deficiency pre operatively.

446
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:59,350
The update prior to this was in 2008. So eight years later they made some changes.

447
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:04,870
And this is honestly like a really helpful document that I catch of reference

448
00:46:04,870 --> 00:46:09,970
because like the patient I said who had the ap d d as the duodenal switch.

449
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:13,630
I had no idea what supplement she was supposed to be taking because like,

450
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:20,920
I figured it'd be more important than the bypass, but I didn't know, like, what's more involved.

451
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:31,570
And so this has been a helpful document for me and ultimately they ended up making 92 recommendations and their update, 79 were new and.

452
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:35,700
They made an additional and then there was 13. That didn't change from 2008.

453
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:45,630
It's interesting to see how this has changed over time because the patient I saw today who had surgery in 1999, she was not taking it.

454
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:53,850
It's like she was kind of doing the supplements, but not quite and had no idea what was required of her because she had her surgery so long ago.

455
00:46:54,480 --> 00:47:04,410
So we talked through that a bit today. And then I, I had one patient who had an open bypass in 2000.

456
00:47:04,770 --> 00:47:10,560
And I don't I'm not familiar with what the recommendations were in 2000 or the 2008 set of guidelines.

457
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:14,759
But she was not taking any vitamin D was not taking any calcium citrate.

458
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:20,550
When I spoke with her and just in conversation, she's like saying how she's got really bad osteoporosis and how,

459
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:28,310
you know, for years she's been having like rib fractures from copping too hard, from getting hugged too hard.

460
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:35,820
I'm like, I'm thinking that not taking calcium citrate and vitamin D is contributing to this.

461
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:41,160
So I would say clinically, even if even if you're like, I don't want to go into clinical nutrition,

462
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:45,180
all of you are going to do some kind of clinical in your internship.

463
00:47:45,390 --> 00:47:51,060
So if you ever see that someone's had some kind of bariatric surgery as they're in their medical history,

464
00:47:51,210 --> 00:47:59,820
consider that because it's often it can be a piece that's overlooked and is contributions to nutrient deficiencies.

465
00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:05,790
I mean, it's less of a concern with someone who's had a sleeve, but still a concern.

466
00:48:06,030 --> 00:48:09,209
But again, we're getting patients who've had the trouble switch.

467
00:48:09,210 --> 00:48:11,790
We're getting patients who had five years ago.

468
00:48:11,790 --> 00:48:16,650
And because it's so long ago, if they haven't been following up and those patients are lost to follow up,

469
00:48:16,830 --> 00:48:21,420
especially if their clinic doesn't offer lifelong follow up, they're not getting updated recommendations.

470
00:48:23,190 --> 00:48:27,870
And a lot of patients also forget that these are lifelong supplement recommendations.

471
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,430
I get patients coming in six.

472
00:48:29,970 --> 00:48:36,930
I've done a handful of six month appointments and I talked to one yesterday and she's like, Oh, I didn't realize I still needed to be taking B12.

473
00:48:37,350 --> 00:48:39,450
So it doesn't matter how many times we say it.

474
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:45,300
So kind of thinking of that again, even if you never go into this at some point throughout your dietetic internship,

475
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:51,690
perhaps in practice afterwards, even just in your everyday life, you might encounter someone who says they've had bariatric surgery.

476
00:48:51,690 --> 00:48:58,440
And then you can say like, are you taking your supplements? Because regardless of what happens with their weight trajectory, this is forever.

477
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:01,649
And these deficiencies can be life changing.

478
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:12,510
And that's the last thing anyone wants. And so their conclusion from these updated guidelines is that the prevalence of my

479
00:49:12,510 --> 00:49:17,400
grade deficiencies is increasing while monitoring of patients at all is decreasing.

480
00:49:17,610 --> 00:49:23,520
My guess is this is in part because bariatric surgery is becoming more common, so there's more people doing it.

481
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:33,270
So that would increase, you know, prevalence of migraines, micronutrient deficiencies and the larger patient load that a clinic has.

482
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:37,130
The less appointment slots they have available to see patients postoperatively.

483
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:42,480
And if, you know, if the model doesn't switch to having more post-operative care,

484
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:48,060
then there's not really a justification to hiring more providers to offer those time slots.

485
00:49:51,570 --> 00:49:54,420
And then this is just I just threw this in here so you could have it as a reference.

486
00:49:54,420 --> 00:50:01,260
I'm not going through this, but if you do want this document, I can it's only available to people that have a membership through the Assembly.

487
00:50:01,650 --> 00:50:09,630
And so my clinic provided it to me. But if you want me to share the pdf, I can send it to Susan and she can put it on canvas so you have access to it.

488
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:13,920
It's also kind of helpful because it breaks down through the section that I didn't include in here,

489
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:21,719
but it talks about like what signs and symptoms to look for with different micronutrient deficiencies.

490
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:26,280
So that's always helpful for micronutrient metabolism at a semester.

491
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:30,870
But I can have that at to Susan if you want that.

492
00:50:32,370 --> 00:50:37,020
Yeah. Okay. And we also talk about common side effects after surgery.

493
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:41,579
And these are some of the ones I've kind of already touched on some of these,

494
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:46,970
but inadequate protein and or fluid intake, nausea and vomiting, that's more so.

495
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:54,090
And patients are eating too quickly, not chewing thoroughly enough, you know, all those like mindful eating habits,

496
00:50:54,090 --> 00:50:59,970
because then with their new GI anatomy, it's can make them noxious, it makes them throw up.

497
00:51:00,510 --> 00:51:08,069
Dumping syndrome is something associated with the bypass, and that's essentially having like a high osmotic load from a lot of simple sugars,

498
00:51:08,070 --> 00:51:13,170
potentially having very fatty foods or also drinking fluids with their food.

499
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:18,209
It causes everything to just flush out. But basically within like 30 to 60 minutes,

500
00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:24,030
they're having diarrhea after consuming anything and they can have changes in their blood sugar and all sorts of stuff.

501
00:51:24,030 --> 00:51:29,700
And it's one of the cons to the bypass and again, something that people consider when they're debating the two procedures.

502
00:51:31,030 --> 00:51:36,250
Food intolerances after bariatric surgery are somewhat common.

503
00:51:36,310 --> 00:51:41,140
I'd say not everyone, but certainly a large minority of people, especially lactose intolerance.

504
00:51:42,670 --> 00:51:46,660
And then, of course, like heartburn, gas, constipation is a GI surgery.

505
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:51,820
And there they have to follow preoperative diet. That's very high protein, very low fiber.

506
00:51:51,830 --> 00:51:55,700
That general anesthesia slows down everything if they're on narcotic painkillers.

507
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:59,740
Constipation is like pretty much all of my patients have that at some point.

508
00:52:01,030 --> 00:52:05,859
Hair loss from rapid weight loss. But typically that tends to be temporary.

509
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:09,610
As long as patients are getting enough protein and they're getting in their recommended supplements,

510
00:52:09,610 --> 00:52:16,210
it tends to level out and then start coming back as their weight stabilizes.

511
00:52:17,110 --> 00:52:20,520
Weight plateaus, weight regain. And we do time.

512
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:32,800
We do touch on change in alcohol tolerance. And then I can actually put some of that first bullet point.

513
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:35,950
So this is some of the things that the psychologist will talk about.

514
00:52:35,950 --> 00:52:38,919
I meant to pull more research, and I guess I overlooked that with everything.

515
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:45,400
But this is the area I know the least about because I'm really not involved in this process other than just like sending people on to the next step.

516
00:52:46,150 --> 00:52:50,870
But the psychologist will ask about like, you know,

517
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:57,100
do you feel like significant lifestyle change and everything could affect relationships and stuff in your life?

518
00:52:57,370 --> 00:53:04,240
They'll ask about any potential past of addiction or substance abuse they screen for binge eating disorder and food addiction.

519
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:13,570
They do a whole lot of things to look at reading comprehension because if we have patients that have like a lower reading level than us,

520
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:16,899
we need to make sure that we are kind of like doing like a teach vac method to make

521
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:20,410
sure they're understanding everything that we're saying and things like that.

522
00:53:20,410 --> 00:53:27,880
They'll kind of look at history of past trauma and potentially coming out of that psychological evaluation.

523
00:53:28,450 --> 00:53:31,780
Patients may not be required to see a therapist. It might just be a recommendation.

524
00:53:32,050 --> 00:53:37,120
They might be required to establish therapy and just provide a letter of initiation of treatment.

525
00:53:37,210 --> 00:53:40,720
So they're going to see a therapist and say, I therapist.

526
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:44,800
Susan, can I please have a letter to move on to bariatric surgery and then never see therapist Susan again?

527
00:53:45,190 --> 00:53:48,610
You know, and that would fulfill her requirement. Typically, that doesn't happen.

528
00:53:48,610 --> 00:53:52,239
But and they could also be required to establish therapy.

529
00:53:52,240 --> 00:54:03,010
And after a certain length of time, once they're in the mental health professional and the patient feels they've made significant progress,

530
00:54:03,010 --> 00:54:09,880
then that mental health provider and our neuropsychology team have to have a discussion and then they'll kind of reevaluate the situation from there.

531
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:13,480
This can be like issues with food. It could be mood stability.

532
00:54:13,630 --> 00:54:17,500
We've had some patients that haven't had stable housing. So you're not on stable housing.

533
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:22,570
Where are you going to simply recuperate after surgery, have consistent access to food, things like that?

534
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:32,770
Yeah. Okay. So it's either three medical evaluations or three evaluations, and then they get reviewed by our surgeons.

535
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:37,750
If they're medically reasonable, then and there's no major issues,

536
00:54:37,930 --> 00:54:43,510
then like my supervisor literally just glances through their chart and says, okay, you're admitted to the program.

537
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:49,000
It's possible that they'll be deemed not a candidate at all. But I will say this is rare.

538
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:53,649
I can think of two patients that have not been that they've been deemed not a candidate.

539
00:54:53,650 --> 00:54:59,080
We will never offer them surgery. It could be that they need to be re reviewed in the future.

540
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:03,040
Again, it is like mood stability, stable housing. We have had some patients like.

541
00:55:03,310 --> 00:55:07,600
So your question of how do you get adolescents? We have had some patients that have been like 18, 19,

542
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:11,680
and we could really tell there's like not mature enough to make this kind of medical decision right now.

543
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:20,050
There's just not enough compliance. And so we'll say like, let's be a review in like a year or something, but if they are admitted to the program,

544
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:27,370
sometimes they have to go to a complex case review if there's like a lot of things to take into account, and that can be a multidisciplinary review.

545
00:55:27,370 --> 00:55:34,530
I've been present on some of those. There's like, like I had one patient who had like a,

546
00:55:34,690 --> 00:55:40,450
she's like in her fifties and she had started having history of eating disorder issues when she was like ten

547
00:55:40,750 --> 00:55:48,100
and had been hospitalized and admitted to like an inpatient adult eating disorder clinic like three years ago.

548
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:54,040
So it's like this is still very relevant. And a lot of the things she was saying in her appointments with us were like really concerning.

549
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:57,100
And so I had a lot of like just lifestyle nutrition concerns.

550
00:55:57,100 --> 00:56:03,219
So I was she's one of the patients who was deemed to be not a candidate, but also because of surgical issues, too.

551
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:07,750
But I was in on that meeting just to be like, this is a bad idea regardless of anything else.

552
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:12,760
Like, I will not be seeing her again because I cannot be professionally involved in this.

553
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:17,410
But they were very supportive with that decision. So then they might see the surgeon.

554
00:56:17,710 --> 00:56:22,120
And during this whole process, they're also working out all of their program requirements,

555
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:29,440
their insurance requirements, and they won't get surgery until all the requirements are met for insurance and.

556
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:34,070
Our program. There could be overlap, but there can be like,

557
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:38,559
I definitely get patients that get mad at me that I'm still asking them to come back because they're like,

558
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:41,560
I already had all the insurance requirements. Why do I need to keep seeing you?

559
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:46,270
I know you're still drinking like regular pap every day and you're still not taking your supplements.

560
00:56:46,270 --> 00:56:49,419
And, you know, you're like a variety of things.

561
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:52,870
And so that's an attitude that I get sometimes.

562
00:56:54,670 --> 00:56:58,190
But once they have met all their requirements and they get a surgery date a month

563
00:56:58,330 --> 00:57:02,140
from the time of meeting all their requirements to literally getting in the o.R.

564
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:10,540
That can take anywhere from like 2 to 5 months, depending on the circumstances, depending on the surgeon that they're going to go with.

565
00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:17,230
Some of our surgeons are like pretty high up within our department. So then they have less O.R. time because they have more admin responsibilities.

566
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:21,250
If someone's having a bypass, it's a more complicated procedure.

567
00:57:21,250 --> 00:57:25,070
And because of medical complexity, they might need two surgeons present.

568
00:57:25,110 --> 00:57:29,920
So then you have to coordinate the schedules of two surgeons. So it just depends on the situation.

569
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:41,799
But they do meet with a physician assistant in our pre-op clinic and then they have to do a preoperative nutrition class with either Amy or myself.

570
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:45,670
We're the ones who teach it and then they go to surgery. So that's kind of the phase.

571
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:48,610
Like once they're approved and they've been given the thumbs up,

572
00:57:48,610 --> 00:57:55,750
that's what they're doing to literally get in the door of the O.R. in that pre-op class.

573
00:57:56,740 --> 00:58:05,980
It's reviewed preoperative diet guidelines. This varies from clinic to clinic, but pretty much every program has some type of liver reduction diet.

574
00:58:06,010 --> 00:58:09,760
The idea of reducing the size of the liver so the stomach is more accessible and

575
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:13,690
this can be a laparoscopic procedure rather than having to do an open procedure.

576
00:58:14,650 --> 00:58:18,910
Some clinics require it to be like just meal replacement shakes.

577
00:58:19,330 --> 00:58:25,060
That's all you drink for, like anywhere from 2 to 4 weeks. The length of the pre-op diet depends on the program.

578
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:35,140
Our newest surgeon did his fellowship at the Ohio State University, and and he said that they just did a straight, like, three weeks for everybody.

579
00:58:35,770 --> 00:58:40,930
We cater it to history of fatty liver disease and or BMI.

580
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:46,120
Again, BMI has issues, but the surgeons use it as a proxy for body size.

581
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:50,410
The idea being a larger body size could have a comparably larger liver.

582
00:58:50,770 --> 00:58:58,270
So it could take more time to reduce that size. But ultimately, our patients are eating about 1000 to 1200 calories a day.

583
00:58:58,270 --> 00:59:02,710
And this is a very rough outline of what they're having.

584
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:14,050
The guidelines we give to them say exactly like a cup of plain Cheerios or a half a quarter cup cooked plain oatmeal or whatever.

585
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:20,230
So it's more detailed than this, but it's fairly, fairly restrictive and not a fun experience.

586
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:26,740
I tried it. I lasted a day. But of course, there's not like the, you know, the motivation to need to do it.

587
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:29,740
It is possible that, a, patients don't do this.

588
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:34,960
Their surgery could be aborted if their liver is not small enough and the surgeon won't know that until they're on the table.

589
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:40,749
So how can you charge the thousand to 1200? I've seen other protocols with like 1400.

590
00:59:40,750 --> 00:59:46,810
So I'm wondering, honestly, this was apparently put into place before our dietitian was even working with the clinic.

591
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:51,370
So no clue why there are no vegetables.

592
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,060
There's actually no fruit either. Yeah. So the whole.

593
00:59:55,150 --> 01:00:01,990
So they can have raw non-starchy vegetables. I don't have it listed here, but it is a separate thing that they can do if they want.

594
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:08,800
This is what they're required to consume. And if someone has dietary restrictions or stuff, we do work on making an alternative thing.

595
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:18,640
But just for this purpose, we don't have them do fruit because of trying to reduce the carbon take to reduce the size of the liver.

596
01:00:19,070 --> 01:00:22,560
So. Carrots. Carrots, yes.

597
01:00:22,590 --> 01:00:27,990
Yeah. I have some patients who make, like a raw veggie salad because that's all, you know, they can do that.

598
01:00:29,010 --> 01:00:32,100
But yeah, it's just the raw non-starchy vegetables.

599
01:00:32,190 --> 01:00:35,790
Did they scandal over before and after the diet to see that it's reduced or it's

600
01:00:35,790 --> 01:00:38,790
just the presumption it's going to be large and we need to decrease deaths.

601
01:00:38,790 --> 01:00:42,420
But there's no data to show that this decreases that essentially that.

602
01:00:42,870 --> 01:00:45,899
Yeah it's yeah there is a lot of presumption.

603
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:53,550
And then there's like the conversation I had with our most recent surgeon, he and I got on board of the same month, and so he's like my buddy.

604
01:00:54,180 --> 01:01:02,399
But I asked him about it. He's like, Honestly, there is not good evidence based guidelines for this because again,

605
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:07,709
like even within our own surgeon pool, like he because of his experience,

606
01:01:07,710 --> 01:01:13,530
he said that like anyone who has a history of fatty liver disease, regardless of their BMI,

607
01:01:13,530 --> 01:01:16,290
I want them doing a four week pre-op diet because that's what I did.

608
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:23,190
Or because he well, he has the opportunity to have them do a four week one, whereas at LSU it was all just three weeks.

609
01:01:23,190 --> 01:01:27,450
But since we have that opportunity, he's like, Yeah, let's play it safe, let's have them do four weeks.

610
01:01:27,810 --> 01:01:35,550
And that anyone with a BMI over 50, he has to do four weeks and anyone else he has them do three.

611
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:40,440
But he's a huge surgeon, so I'm guessing he's like taking a more conservative approach.

612
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:43,079
Maybe [INAUDIBLE], like, loosen up as he gets more experience.

613
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:52,020
But like some of our other surgeons will say, like we have one surgeon who if someone has a BMI of like 35 to 40 and they have fatty liver disease,

614
01:01:52,020 --> 01:01:58,709
she's like, I'm cool with two weeks, but if someone but then she'll say, if someone has a BMI of 50 year over, it's four weeks.

615
01:01:58,710 --> 01:02:03,960
So like, it's like I have to know all the surgeons preference as when I tell patients how long their pre-op diets are.

616
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:09,330
And it is not evidence based like it's evidence based to do some kind of liver reduction diet.

617
01:02:09,330 --> 01:02:15,389
But how you go about doing it, what the calories are, what the macros are, the length of it, how you determine the length of it.

618
01:02:15,390 --> 01:02:24,000
That's not that super variable because some of the weight loss occurs during the student, or surprisingly, not all the time.

619
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:30,510
Now, patients don't lose any weight on the pre-op guys, but it does kind of make me a little suspicious how well they followed it.

620
01:02:31,650 --> 01:02:36,299
But like I said, it is rare that the surgery is like completely aborted because of the size of their liver.

621
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:39,510
Like I like Dr. O'Neal, the one that I mentioned.

622
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:47,700
He said that his mentor at OSU told him of one surgery that he chose to not do because of that.

623
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:54,060
And then I think pulling all of our surgeons together that like two cases.

624
01:02:54,330 --> 01:03:00,180
So it's rare, but then it also stands to reason like if this is so rare, do you really need someone doing this for four weeks?

625
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:03,840
But I'm not a surgeon, so I don't know. And I don't want the compliance part.

626
01:03:03,910 --> 01:03:13,170
Right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. It gets this is I would say this is the fourth quarter of the year is my least favorite time of this job because

627
01:03:13,170 --> 01:03:17,969
everyone's trying to get surgery by the end of the calendar year because they've met their deductible for the year.

628
01:03:17,970 --> 01:03:22,890
But our surgeons are also trying to take vacation time for Thanksgiving and Christmas because they're people, too.

629
01:03:23,130 --> 01:03:27,720
And then people start their pre-op diets and I get tons of messages saying, But it's Thanksgiving.

630
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:30,000
Can I just not do my pre-op diet for today?

631
01:03:30,090 --> 01:03:37,590
This Christmas kind of thing is like so least favorite time of the year does make some very interesting patient interactions,

632
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:45,000
but I definitely feel like the being mom, I don't have kids yet, but I feel like I'm taking a trip out all the time.

633
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:54,090
So then we also talk about in this their pre-op or their post-op diet progression, but they do get reminders of this as they go through.

634
01:03:54,390 --> 01:04:01,410
So again, this could vary from clinic to clinic a little bit, but they do if regardless of procedure,

635
01:04:01,410 --> 01:04:05,729
they do a full liquid diet for two weeks there on clear liquids when they're in the hospital,

636
01:04:05,730 --> 01:04:09,360
but they're only in the hospital for like 2 to 3 days, depending on the procedure.

637
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:12,959
So when they go home, they're on full liquids for the sleeve.

638
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:21,050
It is a period diet for two, four weeks or two week to two week for for the bypass, it's weeks, two weeks, six.

639
01:04:21,660 --> 01:04:26,460
And then they go to soft food. Obviously that's week for two weeks.

640
01:04:26,580 --> 01:04:29,760
So it's a four week duration. And then for bypass it's a two week duration.

641
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:33,870
But by eight weeks after surgery, everyone's back to a normal diet.

642
01:04:34,230 --> 01:04:39,180
Well, our bariatric regular diet. And then we also talk about post-op supplementation guidelines.

643
01:04:40,860 --> 01:04:44,910
But again, they have multiple check points where they're reviewed on these things, too.

644
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:47,130
So they know exactly what they need to be doing.

645
01:04:50,070 --> 01:04:56,400
Like I said, two week visit with the dietitian at the surgeon, two month follow up with the dietician.

646
01:04:56,790 --> 01:04:59,609
At two weeks after surgery, they're meeting with their surgeon.

647
01:04:59,610 --> 01:05:05,429
And honestly, like all of this is pretty much done as telehealth right now, which to me would be,

648
01:05:05,430 --> 01:05:12,149
you know, initially that was surprising, but they have so few complications at two weeks after surgery.

649
01:05:12,150 --> 01:05:20,340
If complications are going to happen, they tend to be later. And because it's laparoscopic, there's not major usually large incisions that.

650
01:05:20,380 --> 01:05:26,620
Need to be physically examined. But there will be patients who will like hold their smartphone and be like, look at my like check him out.

651
01:05:28,270 --> 01:05:33,010
But they'll talk about any complications. What kind of recommendations for returning to work?

652
01:05:33,610 --> 01:05:41,680
What their physical activity restrictions are. And what can be lifted depending on the patient and the surgeon's opinion and their dietitian visit.

653
01:05:42,010 --> 01:05:47,530
We talk about how they can progress from bullet wound to parade and then we give them the dates

654
01:05:47,530 --> 01:05:51,250
for when they can start their software diet and when they can start adding and reproduce.

655
01:05:51,550 --> 01:05:54,400
When you go through any GI symptoms and are having major issues,

656
01:05:54,400 --> 01:06:00,070
we kind of work through those together and then we talk about the supplements they should be taking.

657
01:06:00,460 --> 01:06:02,830
The calcium citrate pills are super large,

658
01:06:02,830 --> 01:06:10,059
so we do have them hold those for two weeks after surgery just so they can focus on getting used to drinking protein shakes,

659
01:06:10,060 --> 01:06:17,500
getting in their nutrition without having to worry about a giant spill or just six per day, depending on the person.

660
01:06:18,430 --> 01:06:24,400
And then we talk about making sure they're getting close to their protein goals, or at least working on it or working on their fluid goals.

661
01:06:25,570 --> 01:06:30,370
And then like some patients need to switch the kinds of products or using if they're having lactose intolerance.

662
01:06:30,370 --> 01:06:36,579
Some people have texture issues after surgery. So doing like like a thick protein shake isn't tolerated.

663
01:06:36,580 --> 01:06:42,150
So then, you know, there's I didn't even know these existed until I worked in this clinic, but there's like protein waters.

664
01:06:43,450 --> 01:06:48,189
Everyone's nodding their head. Okay, cool. So. So then we might recommend those.

665
01:06:48,190 --> 01:06:52,929
And I've had patients do really well with thin liquids, but can't really do the thick ones.

666
01:06:52,930 --> 01:06:58,030
I had one patient which was like super compliant the whole time, so I knew, like I said, I work with her a lot.

667
01:06:58,030 --> 01:07:01,020
So I trusted her when she said like, I can't get down.

668
01:07:01,030 --> 01:07:06,040
More than one protein shake per day from your protein is 30 grams of protein, so she's only gained 30 grams.

669
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:10,030
And I was like, well, how about you switch to like protein to try that?

670
01:07:10,330 --> 01:07:14,310
And she was within a week of surgery, she was getting like 60 grams of protein per day.

671
01:07:14,380 --> 01:07:18,160
She's like, Oh, this is tolerated so much better by comparison.

672
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:21,190
A different patient told me she could only get one protein shake per day.

673
01:07:21,190 --> 01:07:25,740
And then in questions she's like, it's like like what timeframe do you drink this then?

674
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:29,290
And she's like, Well, I can drink in about 4 hours. Okay.

675
01:07:29,290 --> 01:07:34,450
What about the rest of the day? Oh, I guess I could try drinking another protein shake, but I get, you know, gets warm.

676
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:38,920
Can you put it back in the fridge? I guess I could try that.

677
01:07:39,380 --> 01:07:42,310
And I'm like, okay, well let's see how that goes.

678
01:07:44,020 --> 01:07:49,870
And then at their two months dietitian visit, they don't see the surgeon again at all unless they're having issues.

679
01:07:50,110 --> 01:07:52,990
Everything's going okay. They don't see the surgeon again.

680
01:07:53,740 --> 01:07:58,750
But again, we revisit GI issues because those can develop between two weeks and eight weeks.

681
01:07:59,140 --> 01:08:03,010
We again review current supplementation because hopefully they're doing everything that they should.

682
01:08:03,010 --> 01:08:08,050
At that point, we revisit protein and fluid intake and then we talk about typical dietary intake.

683
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:13,690
We don't do that the two week point because they're on a full liquid diet and they pretty much know what they can be consuming.

684
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:20,380
And then we also ask some questions about long term outcomes just related to complications afterwards.

685
01:08:22,750 --> 01:08:31,930
And then, like I said, six months follow up with the dietitian and endocrinologists, one year follow ups and annually after that.

686
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:34,389
And like I said, long term follow up care.

687
01:08:34,390 --> 01:08:40,990
So we do tell patients that you need any additional assistance, anything at all, especially from the dietitians between six months and one year.

688
01:08:40,990 --> 01:08:44,170
And between those one, two, three year visits, you just have to let us know.

689
01:08:44,170 --> 01:08:50,770
You just have to ask for it. We don't have the capacity to see everyone's monthly forever, and a lot of patients don't need that level of follow up.

690
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:54,430
But but we just let them know, like, we're here for you.

691
01:08:54,460 --> 01:08:57,160
You just might have to let us know that you need us.

692
01:08:58,150 --> 01:09:09,820
And this is like sparse in what I have here because again, I'm not super involved in the long term follow up care, six months on.

693
01:09:10,090 --> 01:09:12,850
But from what I do know at the endocrinologist visit,

694
01:09:12,850 --> 01:09:19,660
they might assess the need for weight loss medications if the patient feels that they are not losing sufficient weight.

695
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:27,040
Typically, those aren't prescribed until one year after surgery, but it is possible it could be at six months depending on the patient,

696
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:33,549
and they might start the discussion about referrals for skin removal surgery, which isn't necessary.

697
01:09:33,550 --> 01:09:40,470
Well, I mean, it's, you know, for I guess it's like to say that it's necessary depends on the person, how they feel about it.

698
01:09:40,490 --> 01:09:48,370
But but, you know, too much access and skin can cause skin issues and then there'd be more medical necessity for that.

699
01:09:49,990 --> 01:09:54,670
We do we do have weekly support group meetings of various topics and we get different speakers.

700
01:09:54,670 --> 01:10:02,889
So I've heard our skin removal surgeon talk about how they won't consider doing skin removal surgery until patients have

701
01:10:02,890 --> 01:10:09,910
been weight stable and typically that they won't even consider it until a patient's at least one year after surgery,

702
01:10:09,910 --> 01:10:15,460
but more typically like 18 months to two years, just to make sure that their weight has in fact stabilized.

703
01:10:17,620 --> 01:10:25,630
And then also in the dietician, follow up visits. We talk about any current challenges, whether those are GI challenges or lifestyle challenges.

704
01:10:26,470 --> 01:10:28,160
Again, review current supplementation,

705
01:10:28,210 --> 01:10:34,360
always touching on that and then talking about typical dietary and fluid intake, physical activity and all of that.

706
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:45,300
I did throw in some research that I found just kind of again addressing like weight regain after surgery, this, you know,

707
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:51,310
a lot of factors and this but with this particular study they were looking at the weight loss

708
01:10:51,310 --> 01:10:55,480
and the occurrence of weight regain in patients who had the ruined wide gastric bypass.

709
01:10:55,870 --> 01:11:01,240
So obviously, that's not the whole patient population that we see. This was a retrospective cohort study.

710
01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:10,720
And so these they identified 705 patients who underwent this procedure at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in a ten year time frame or almost ten years,

711
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:15,670
and had post-operative follow up until at least two years.

712
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:19,660
And so here are some of their demographics for their patient population.

713
01:11:19,990 --> 01:11:26,979
And and then they what they ended up doing, which of course, there's know issues with this.

714
01:11:26,980 --> 01:11:35,139
But it was a self-report questionnaire that they developed and it was asking patients about what their post-operative weight was at year 1 to 3,

715
01:11:35,140 --> 01:11:39,880
all the way up to seven. They ended up getting 300 patients who responded to the survey.

716
01:11:40,510 --> 01:11:43,240
So about, you know, over half were lost to follow up.

717
01:11:43,660 --> 01:11:55,389
And they found that the mean weight loss in the first year after surgery was 20 to 47 kilograms or 33.1% of preoperative weight.

718
01:11:55,390 --> 01:12:04,060
And then overall mean percent weight regain from the moderate or the lowest rate they got to after surgery was 23.4%.

719
01:12:04,390 --> 01:12:13,150
So there's an okay amount regain. And then what they did was they took that and they kind of broke it up this way into a frequency diagram.

720
01:12:13,450 --> 01:12:22,989
And so what you can see here is 159 patients, 53.9% of their population,

721
01:12:22,990 --> 01:12:28,230
of their study population had the frequency, the percent of three that you can see here.

722
01:12:28,240 --> 01:12:30,400
So like 20%, 40% and all of that.

723
01:12:30,610 --> 01:12:38,080
So you can see most people have some regain up to 20% and then some people have regained up to 40% and so on and so forth.

724
01:12:40,410 --> 01:12:48,520
And we want to note that this was the mean weight regain, but they were looking at seven year time period, but it was all patient reported.

725
01:12:48,580 --> 01:12:51,160
So there's also issues with that, too.

726
01:12:51,460 --> 01:12:58,030
If you're getting patients who aren't tracking their weight, which is fine, I have patients that choose to not do that and like,

727
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:04,840
you know, are you doing at your home scale versus, you know, so like just for kind of some baseline and understanding.

728
01:13:05,470 --> 01:13:14,140
And then they took that and then they broke it up into patients who lost like or who regained less than 25% of their weight.

729
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:20,440
And they broke that down into frequency. And then patients regained 25 to just under 30% and broke it up that way.

730
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:23,620
And so you can kind of, you know, look at that.

731
01:13:23,620 --> 01:13:29,050
I'm trying to be mindful at times. I don't want to go to any. Yeah, no, we should probably need a few more minutes for you.

732
01:13:30,130 --> 01:13:33,220
I'm going to I'm going to go ahead and move on to another side.

733
01:13:33,220 --> 01:13:36,220
So I'm to cut it off. There you have my slides so you can read through this.

734
01:13:36,220 --> 01:13:44,060
I included the hyperlink so you can look at the studies if you want them. So with the time we have left, what other questions can I answer is yeah.

735
01:13:46,740 --> 01:13:54,450
Yes. I do think that patients that do surgery they should avoid thinking using is

736
01:13:54,450 --> 01:14:02,500
through things like you're thinking more around the size of a beautiful landscape.

737
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:10,140
I think it's possible. So, yeah, so we do recommend that patients don't drink with a stroke as it can cause heartburn for them.

738
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:12,270
So we do recommend that to some,

739
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:20,550
but it's an interesting kind of between a rock and a hard place because some people get in more fluid if they're drinking it through a stroke.

740
01:14:20,820 --> 01:14:24,020
And so some patients will be like, I'm really struggling to get in water.

741
01:14:24,030 --> 01:14:27,299
I was doing a lot of water with the straw before surgery, like, can I do this?

742
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:31,500
And if they're not well hydrated, that like, sure, I can go ahead.

743
01:14:31,890 --> 01:14:43,530
But so what we do as a general recommendation recommending don't use a straw in terms of the stomach size is one of the misconceptions.

744
01:14:43,530 --> 01:14:50,549
And a lot of patients might say to me is that like that if they eat too much food after surgery,

745
01:14:50,550 --> 01:14:57,510
they're going to stretch out their stomach and undo their surgery. And and it is a significant thing to have that misconception out there.

746
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:01,980
I've had patients come into their two week post-op point or even their two months and be like,

747
01:15:02,100 --> 01:15:07,160
I like I've had women in tears because they're like, I actually got too much food.

748
01:15:07,170 --> 01:15:10,379
I threw it all up. I feel like I've undone my surgery. I've stretched out my stomach.

749
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:21,270
That was too much. But the reality is, as stated by my surgeon forces, the stomach is not going to stretch back out to its original size.

750
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:27,360
The tissue, the muscle, the muscle, while the stomach is too dense for that to happen.

751
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:30,870
So kind of like what I tell my patients, this thinking is like a new pair of jeans.

752
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:35,340
Like it's a little snug when you put it on, but then the more you wear, it can kind of break them in.

753
01:15:35,340 --> 01:15:39,180
But like a size 18 pair of pants is not going to become a size 26. So.

754
01:15:40,530 --> 01:15:46,259
But yeah. So if you are drinking carbonation, if you're eating food to the point of nausea and vomiting,

755
01:15:46,260 --> 01:15:52,980
which is not great, but it's not going to cause your stomach to go back to the original size.

756
01:15:53,790 --> 01:15:57,150
Yeah. Yes. Why?

757
01:15:57,160 --> 01:16:00,270
Meeting with patients before they undergo surgery.

758
01:16:00,270 --> 01:16:04,000
What do they ever talk to you about? Like what they're like if they're scared at all.

759
01:16:04,020 --> 01:16:07,860
I know you mentioned one woman who kind of like was crying because she was really overwhelmed.

760
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:11,700
Is there a common fear that you see among patients who are going into this process?

761
01:16:13,290 --> 01:16:19,320
I would say fear of complications afterwards because it is an elective surgery.

762
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:22,890
Some patients, you know, like in her situation,

763
01:16:22,890 --> 01:16:28,590
she felt like it was less elective and more medically necessary because it was like because they'll do that.

764
01:16:28,590 --> 01:16:32,159
They'll do the hernia repair while they're doing the bariatric procedure.

765
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:38,880
So it's like two operations for the price of one. When it's something as serious as her esophageal hernia.

766
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:47,220
I also get patients concerned about the regain long term like was like am I really going to do the surgery?

767
01:16:47,220 --> 01:16:50,760
I'm going to put myself like under the knife, so to speak.

768
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:56,090
It's obviously not an open procedure anymore, but like, am I really going to choose to do this to myself only to regain the weight later?

769
01:16:56,100 --> 01:17:06,420
So that's a concern. Some Haitians already have an awareness of like nonsupport of significant others and family members.

770
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:12,390
And there so then there's concern for like sabotage and how this is going to affect their family.

771
01:17:12,750 --> 01:17:14,790
And that's certainly a thing.

772
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:24,060
I was talking to a lady today who like she has below the knee amputation and she's has difficulties with getting her prosthesis to fit properly.

773
01:17:24,060 --> 01:17:29,130
So she doesn't do a lot of walking, therefore doesn't go to the grocery store, her husband does the grocery shopping.

774
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:31,889
And I can't tell you, like I've met with her four times already.

775
01:17:31,890 --> 01:17:36,120
And every time there's some mention of how her husband doesn't get her the products that she asks for.

776
01:17:36,420 --> 01:17:39,930
And I'm like. Do you guys make the grocery list together?

777
01:17:40,050 --> 01:17:45,890
Yeah, I send it to him through a text message. Okay. So he knows what you want, but then doesn't get it.

778
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:49,200
So then I'm kind of like wondering, is this an issue of sabotage?

779
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:55,800
But but I'm also not a psychologist, so I'm like, I can't really overstep, but I'm trying to, like, kind of tiptoe around it.

780
01:17:55,810 --> 01:18:00,770
Like, can you do like an online grocery order? And she's like, Oh, my husband doesn't want to do that.

781
01:18:00,780 --> 01:18:04,290
And I'm like, Can you go with him and like Ride Scooter or something?

782
01:18:05,260 --> 01:18:14,870
So with that, if you ask me just suggesting everything and still there is no end solution to that disqualify them from getting the surgery.

783
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:24,960
If it was such a notable problem that I wanted to put my foot down and felt like this is this should be a deal breaker.

784
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:28,920
My surgeons I'm lucky my surgeons would back me on that.

785
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:34,950
There's like a nothings that are going for that, for that patient's particular, like there's nothing is going right.

786
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:41,639
And it's not like her husband is only getting her like cookies and ice cream and stuff, you know?

787
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:46,960
So it's. So I'm like, I don't feel like it's at that point, but it's still something to, like, kind of keep working on.

788
01:18:46,980 --> 01:18:47,760
I'm like, I don't know.

789
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:54,390
This is just a habit they've established as a couple that like, he's the grocery shopper, this is his job, and he's this is like his thing.

790
01:18:54,660 --> 01:18:58,210
So maybe it's not sabotage, but he's just kind of like set in his ways.

791
01:18:58,980 --> 01:19:02,970
So does he come in for the nutritional counseling as well as like he can here?

792
01:19:03,450 --> 01:19:08,579
He doesn't. And that's something this is also something hard to enforce.

793
01:19:08,580 --> 01:19:14,790
We will get sometimes the psychology team saying that like patient has to have support person present

794
01:19:14,790 --> 01:19:19,740
like potentially just at the nutrition education class before surgery or at all pre-op appointments.

795
01:19:20,670 --> 01:19:23,190
But then a lot of times it's happened.

796
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:31,200
And so we haven't had anyone, to my knowledge in the time I've been there, that we have prevented from getting surgery solely because of that,

797
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:42,330
because we were able to see like enough like changes being made and things being consistent without the patient needing their support person there.

798
01:19:42,330 --> 01:19:45,690
But it certainly can be a concern.

799
01:19:46,140 --> 01:19:49,410
Yeah. Give me one more question. This is for you.

800
01:19:49,410 --> 01:19:56,280
I think there are any other I mean, yeah, kind of like with the protein intake,

801
01:19:56,280 --> 01:20:02,159
like you mentioned, the shakes like the clinic that I was in was like ten grams per 100 calories.

802
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:08,819
Are there any like recommendations based on like the amount of calories rather than like overall like 70 grams of protein,

803
01:20:08,820 --> 01:20:13,950
but like more of like an MDR, like, oh, like making it.

804
01:20:13,950 --> 01:20:22,080
I'm like patient specific and yeah. Or just like making sure that they're like, yeah, have enough protein based on their overall calorie intake.

805
01:20:22,650 --> 01:20:29,700
Yeah, we do have general recommendations. Yeah, we don't, we honestly don't have any like patient specific things based on,

806
01:20:29,790 --> 01:20:33,120
like you said, like X amount of grams of protein per X amount of weight.

807
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:41,070
Just to keep it simple for our patients because we do get a fair amount of patients that have like low numeracy.

808
01:20:41,070 --> 01:20:45,420
And so we're like, you know, trying to like recalculate our like, here's the equation.

809
01:20:45,420 --> 01:20:48,900
So like as your weight changes, this is how you would readjust your protein needs.

810
01:20:49,380 --> 01:20:53,700
And just to keep it simple, we've gone for a minimum number.

811
01:20:54,310 --> 01:20:59,459
Um, but again, it's kind of like, here's what we would love to do.

812
01:20:59,460 --> 01:21:01,710
In theory, this would be like best, best practice.

813
01:21:01,710 --> 01:21:08,040
But here is what actually makes sense for our patient population and seems to be sufficient enough for their nutrient needs.

814
01:21:10,270 --> 01:21:18,749
I will take you back to the weight class. People are interested in learning more.

815
01:21:18,750 --> 01:21:24,490
If you're thinking about summer internships, this is mainly like this first year right now that maybe but not everybody's mph.

816
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:28,350
Okay, well, if you're mph and you have to do a little leadership, you may cover interns.

817
01:21:28,650 --> 01:21:32,350
If you're looking to learn more and practice out of California. Yeah.

818
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:37,360
And you hear something else.
