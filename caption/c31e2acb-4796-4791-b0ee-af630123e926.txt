1
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:33,010
Dr. Ford, thank you so much for being here with us today for this part of the move.

2
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:41,140
Really want to have a conversation. You and I want to help discuss what it means to build an anti-racist mindset.

3
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:48,070
And there have been some conversations around the concept of equity mindedness.

4
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:54,770
And what that does is refer to the perspective or mode of thinking accepted by practitioners

5
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:59,470
who call attention to the patterns of inequity in student outcomes in particular.

6
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:06,070
And these practitioners are willing to take personal and institutional responsibility for

7
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:11,680
the success of their students and critically reassess and assess their own practices.

8
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:16,959
And it just requires that these practitioners are race conscious and aware in

9
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:23,890
social historical context of exclusionary practices in American higher education.

10
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,840
And I would say society writ large.

11
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:43,520
And so I'm wondering. What you're how you conceptualize an anti-racist mindset for learners to begin to think about as they are

12
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:51,740
taking their own journey on this very long road towards anti-racism and anti-racism in the classroom.

13
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:59,370
Thank you for the question. That is a very difficult question and also a difficult practice.

14
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,230
I sit in California where the racial and ethnic makeup is extraordinarily diverse.

15
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:11,670
And I've learned over the years that each.

16
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:19,240
Each set of students as their own orientation to what counts as racially conscious.

17
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:30,850
And for me, racial consciousness is perhaps a cornerstone to being able to begin to think critically about.

18
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:37,660
How do I engage? How. How do I do anti-racism work?

19
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:43,480
What can I become? An anti-racist public health professional.

20
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:49,600
And so for me, I emphasize levels, just the personal level.

21
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:54,190
How do I, as a professor, try to model this?

22
00:02:54,280 --> 00:03:00,450
I try to model this in how I. Each hour I do my research.

23
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:08,910
I think aloud a lot in the classroom with my students so that they can hear the rationale.

24
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,170
Behind why I'm saying what I'm saying.

25
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:19,860
Now recognize that it may differ from what they would otherwise hear from their public health professionals.

26
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,070
And I'm I'm doing so intentionally.

27
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:35,340
I'm saying something that differs very intentionally, knowing that it might even challenge what they hear from their other.

28
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:44,080
Professors, for instance, in how to go into communities or how to think about global relationships.

29
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,120
But it's not a matter of simply having a different perspective.

30
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:59,050
It's a commitment to try to shift how we relate, both in how we think about our work personally, individually,

31
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:08,290
but also trying to be a little bit of a push on the field and help to try to shift the field toward thinking differently.

32
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:22,850
Also, so for me, an anti-racist mindset is one that is anchored in a critical orientation to oneself and to the work that one is doing.

33
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:32,710
And I find that in the classroom and in my teaching more broadly, not just in the classroom that

34
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:40,260
to try to convey an anti-racist orientation or an anti-racist mindset.

35
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:48,819
Requires not only teaching about it, but also trying to model that in in my teaching, in my work,

36
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:54,490
in my interpersonal relationships, and then also in the service and administrative work I do.

37
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:06,329
And so can you tell us how you might, as a professor or instructor in the classroom, faculty will be watching this.

38
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:09,360
Graduate student instructors will be watching this. How do you

39
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:12,840
translate that mindset specifically in the classroom?

40
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:21,430
I think it is a you know, teaching is very difficult for anyone who doesn't know.

41
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:27,520
It is an extraordinarily difficult thing to do very well.

42
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,570
And for me, it requires

43
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:36,820
a level of humility. In opening myself up

44
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:52,219
to reveal where I may not know everything, for one thing, and then also to be able to share ideas with students around critical race theory,

45
00:05:52,220 --> 00:06:00,110
for instance, that many may not have had before and that they challenge and are not fully comfortable with.

46
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:07,580
So. How do I get these students buy into

47
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,810
and not in a superficial way, but to be

48
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:27,040
truly critical when so much of the ways that we teach it, it seems, in our country these days, really does not teach them to be critical.

49
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:31,090
It teaches them to be almost consumerist about their education.

50
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,630
But yeah, teaching is super, super hard. And so I'm really curious, what about you?

51
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:47,710
How do you approach this? I agree with you that that teaching is hard.

52
00:06:47,730 --> 00:07:00,780
I think that I am on. So that junior spectrum where I've been in the classroom, you know, under ten years and I feel.

53
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,840
I feel that I still have a lot to learn.

54
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:16,400
And so not only am I trying to get better at being a professor in general, I'm also increasing

55
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,879
my anti-racist acumen as well, and they go hand in hand.

56
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,740
I think the longer that I'm in front of the classroom, the more that the students propel me

57
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:33,560
and my research propels me to being an anti-racist scholar and an anti-racist teacher.

58
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:48,980
And I think one of the key and it's for me as bringing this mindset to the classroom is really leaning into vulnerability.

59
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,450
I'm leaning into admitting to your classroom when you're wrong.

60
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:05,700
Giving everyone the space to kind of explore what the answers are because you might not know it and owning up to the fact that you might not know it.

61
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:14,460
I find it to be difficult, but I also try to model that in the classroom.

62
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:22,980
I, I also try to model a constant reflection that goes inward.

63
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:31,940
And by looking inward and given that trying to provide criticality of self,

64
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:43,040
that they will in turn think about the criticality of their their actions and how they form research questions,

65
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:49,790
how they interact with community, how they interact with potential research staff down the line,

66
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:58,399
how they may understand what it means to be someone sitting in privilege but still interested and invested in doing

67
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:06,680
work with and researching communities that may be more marginalized for them to really contend with that tension.

68
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:14,330
And and then in the classroom in particular, and there's some slippage between research and teaching.

69
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:20,660
I think for a lot of professors and GSIs who are on that track to be professors.

70
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:31,810
You know, there's a lot of anxiety when you step in the classroom in front of students,

71
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:39,640
when you hold all of this pressure and you have to know everything and you're you're purveying so much and you're delivering so much.

72
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:48,400
So I think stepping back and giving yourself permission to be vulnerable is really has got to be part of the mindset.

73
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:54,080
And. And I think there was a phrase.

74
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:59,730
That you have coined dynamic. Could you you say for me?

75
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:05,400
Dynamic decentering? Yes. Dynamic decentering.

76
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:17,940
So this idea of dynamic decentering of one's self, I think is so important and.

77
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:24,610
One of the things that I hope

78
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:35,160
students walk away from them when they're in my class is that they have a tool kit in which they feel more comfortable

79
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:45,630
talking about really hard things. So if they go back, they leave and they graduate and they go into a health care setting.

80
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:48,830
They go into a government setting. They go into a nonprofit setting.

81
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:54,830
They're eventually going to be on the board of something that they're going to remember.

82
00:10:55,640 --> 00:11:03,470
You know, this tool kit and be able to grab from it to to facilitate and to encourage

83
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:10,840
really hard conversations around disruption, around discomfort.

84
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:20,100
And I think that's tied back into this dynamic decentering that you have discussed in other spaces.

85
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:29,629
And. And really that is part of a general kind of mindset when you're trying to

86
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:34,940
be anti-racist in the classroom is this constant act of how do I disrupt,

87
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:44,809
how do I do decenter, how do I make myself more aware and the students more aware that we have to push against the status quo,

88
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:47,990
which is totally based on white supremacy.

89
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:55,160
And then how do we deal with the discomfort of that recognition for people which along the spectrum will vary.

90
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:05,650
And then how do we do it anyway? How do we continue to do it, even though it's hard from the instructor's point of view?

91
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:09,640
It's hard to hear it from from some students point of view.

92
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:20,589
And then how do you contend with that tension of understanding how harm gets done in certain ways and

93
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:28,760
the fact that some people will see the actual discussion of racism as a product of doing harm onto them.

94
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:32,860
So there's all this tension that you have to walk through.

95
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:38,679
And I think to have an anti-racist mindset is to understand that you're walking

96
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:42,520
through it and you're thinking about it with intention all of the time.

97
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:54,860
So what advice do you have for people who teach to bring an anti-racist mindset to their teaching practice?

98
00:12:56,180 --> 00:13:07,680
Hmm. I believe it's absolutely critical to be courageous because I really love what you what you closed

99
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:15,660
with when in this last question when you said that it's important to be intentional about it.

100
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:22,110
And the only way to do this anti-racist work with your eyes open is to be courageous,

101
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:28,140
because in a lot of ways it is not a pretty and enjoyable experience.

102
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:34,440
It's quite difficult. It engenders, all forms of hostility that one might imagine.

103
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:40,390
And so it takes a lot of courage without an investment.

104
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:51,810
At least this is how I see it. Without an investment in what the outcome would be, without an investment and having others agree or.

105
00:13:52,140 --> 00:14:02,440
Or like it. And so that might actually be why I find that courage to be probably the most important part of it.

106
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:12,190
Like courage to just do it based on a commitment to the work and the community, to the people and to the work.

107
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:16,450
You know, the work is war. And on behalf of and with the people.

108
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:21,320
And so. Yeah.

109
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:29,610
What about you? I would I would agree 100% in this acknowledgment.

110
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:34,440
There's advice for someone to come into this teaching practice.

111
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:38,160
The advice is eyes wide open that this is risky.

112
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:43,110
It's risky to the institution. It's risky to your evaluations.

113
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:59,340
It's risky, you know, in in every sense of putting one's self, because being anti-racist is also putting.

114
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:06,970
Your positionality out there, no matter what intersections of identities that you have.

115
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:20,480
Part of that vulnerability is about accepting that intersection of intersection of identities and how it's positioned within the spectrum of power.

116
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:29,020
And so whenever you have these conversations of power, whether you're a junior faculty, junior faculty of color,

117
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:35,840
a junior faculty of color who's a woman, a junior faculty of color who's a woman and a queer person.

118
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:42,230
There are all these levels that increase your risk or decrease your risk.

119
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:50,810
And so like this understanding that you inherently are walking into the classroom with this risk, hence the bravery and hence the courageousness needed,

120
00:15:51,410 --> 00:16:00,110
I think is really important to bring into the classroom with you as a tool for your own practice.

121
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:07,370
So I really think that walking in eyes wide open around the risk that you inhabit and

122
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:11,810
there's going to be a spectrum of risk depending on that intersection of identities,

123
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:21,290
but the acknowledgment upfront of knowing that there is inherent risk involved in being an anti-racist teacher,

124
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:27,710
I think that's that really is a tool for for any instructor to have in the classroom.

125
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:38,670
That's such an excellent point that you're making. And, you know, I've been teaching for well over a decade around racism and public health.

126
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:50,240
And in the last few years in particular. It's been a, you know, an enormous growth in the interest and racism and the health implications of racism.

127
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:58,730
And I don't hear a lot of people thinking about this risk piece, which concerns me for a number of reasons.

128
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:03,860
And so I really appreciate that you're drawing attention to it,

129
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:13,820
because if the anti-racist if the work we're doing in calling anti-racism work is easily absorbed by institutions,

130
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:20,540
it should make us concerned because our work is supposed to push back against the status quo.

131
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:24,140
It shouldn't feel comfortable to the status quo.
