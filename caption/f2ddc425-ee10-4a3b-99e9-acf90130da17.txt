1
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:08,850
Welcome back. This is our very last session and what I want to delve into now is careers in global health and integrating.

2
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:18,140
These are your diversity, equity, inclusion into your work. The reason why I have this session is because I want you to have an understanding

3
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:21,620
of the eco system or the landscape of opportunities available to you,

4
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:27,580
and to not limit yourself, would be to recognize that in whatever role you have,

5
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:33,980
you have an opportunity to implement a DEI approach or have a DEI lens in your work.

6
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:37,790
You are exploring your careers by virtue of your participation in its program,

7
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:41,990
and I want to support that opportunity to really provide you with information and resources in terms of

8
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:49,970
career opportunities. The two key takeaways I want you to have when you finish a session are one,

9
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:56,390
an overview of global health career opportunities, of course, but then be really, really, really,

10
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:01,130
really understanding how within these various roles that you may not think you

11
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:07,700
have the power, or the authority, or opportunity to integrate the DEI into them.

12
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:13,640
I really want to provide you with a framework of questions to think through and to ask as you're navigating your roles,

13
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,750
because by virtue of asking those questions amongst your colleagues,

14
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,300
amongst teens you're working with,

15
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:30,220
you may trigger some thinking and may support some thinking around DEI that may not have been previously introduced.

16
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:37,480
First, we'll talk about career opportunities. There are programmatic career opportunities, or technical.

17
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:42,890
You'll hear the word technical, or subject matter, or programmatic career opportunities, and then there's other areas.

18
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:51,460
There's administrative areas, there's also some areas that aren't really related to programs but that are significant to them, like advocacy,

19
00:01:51,460 --> 00:02:01,170
some digital career options, some related to finance and then some other areas related to finance and marketing in human resources.

20
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:06,250
So first, I'll talk about the programmatic ones. There are different areas that you can work in.

21
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:11,110
There is Reproductive and Sexual Health, and some organizations, it's also called Health Equity and

22
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:17,190
Rights. You'll see also SRHR, Sexual and Reproductive Health Rights.

23
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:27,270
So be comfortable with that terminology. You may even also see Maternal and Child Health or MNCH, Maternal Neonatal Child Health.

24
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:29,190
So as you see these terminologies, understand,

25
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:36,510
they're often grouped within Reproductive and Sexual Health or Health Equity and Rights, so things related to women's health,

26
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:39,170
and childhood, and family home.

27
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:45,920
There's also Food Security and also Food Security, Nutrition and Water Systems, depending on the organization you work with,

28
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:54,410
nutrition may be within the Health Team, or it may be part of the Food and Water Systems Team, but it just depends.

29
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:59,930
But I will share that food security, you know as we were talking about earlier about the significance of food and water,

30
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:09,980
It relates to not only access to food, but also of food that is safe and that is healthy to consume and also access to water systems.

31
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:16,520
Again, safe water systems that communities can have access to for agricultural purposes.

32
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:20,380
Again, the interplay of wash and food security to grow their own food,

33
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:25,340
to make sure that they have access to the meat and water, but then also nutrition at a household level,

34
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:34,820
nutritional intake and making sure that food that's grown is diverse, is nutritious, and provides what's needed for daily dietary nutritional needs.

35
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:39,290
You can also focus on really global education and workforce development often leads

36
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:44,020
to a group together because global education can relate to the school system,

37
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:48,290
particularly in making sure that girls have access to quality education, that

38
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:54,060
all children have access to quality education for teacher training, for curriculum development,

39
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,870
to working with what we call the Ministry of Education,

40
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:02,210
which is a division of the government that focuses on education like the Ministry of Health.

41
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:11,230
But really, you can focus on global education and workforce development and with the workforce development aspect relates to trade, then training,

42
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:16,530
then entrepreneurial training for kids that have either dropped out and don't want to re-enroll,

43
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:22,560
but also explore other routes for training and acquiring training so that they can have a livelihood.

44
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,430
So Global Education and Workforce Development is very expansive and relates to actually

45
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:30,690
addressing the system and working with the Ministry of Education in teacher capacity,

46
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:34,350
development and teacher training.

47
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:41,820
On down to really curriculum development and really having a close eye and making sure to provide incentives for bringing girls to school and

48
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:48,990
making sure that also food is provided; nutritious meals to encourage children to attend school and parents to send their children to school,

49
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:54,170
perhaps in communities where children need to work at a young age rather than pursue an education.

50
00:04:54,170 --> 00:05:00,960
So just wanted to share that the Global Education and Workforce Development, there's an interplay even with help.

51
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:09,210
Advocacy careers, so domestic and international advocacy, and that can look different in many organizations, there can be advocacy campaigns,

52
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:15,190
people advocate on the Hill for farm bills, for food security bills, for support and resources.

53
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:21,300
There are different ways, in terms of engaging with Congress people to make sure that those resources are received without

54
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:30,540
lobbying, but really exposing and providing information and an understanding of really the significance of certain policies.

55
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:35,980
Then there's of course, Humanitarian Aid or Crisis or Disaster Response.

56
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:40,400
Again, different context, you're looking at all these programatic areas,

57
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,680
you can be a Reproductive and Sexual Health Specialist, either clinical or social,

58
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:50,770
or you can be either in humanitarian context or in development ones.

59
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:55,450
So all those previous technical areas: Reproductive Health, Food Security, Global Education,

60
00:05:55,450 --> 00:06:01,390
Advocacy, that can be applied to development or crisis politic, and crisis response,

61
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:06,580
relates to the provision of food and resources for offset or protracted crisis.

62
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,350
It can involve civil society and

63
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:18,880
peace building programs, and diplomacy programs, and providing incentives and livelihoods to young people so that they aren't drawn into violent extremism.

64
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:27,780
It can involve helping to provide incentives to disarm armed groups and providing livelihood and other opportunities to encourage them to live on.

65
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:35,440
So Humanitarian Aid/Crisis or Disaster Response is emergency food distribution and resources, but then also for protracted crises.

66
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:42,260
So really programmatic and long term initiatives. Also, their careers in administrative services.

67
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:50,570
I have several colleagues who are procurement specialists, or small business specialists that bring in small businesses.

68
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:52,040
They are logistic specialists.

69
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:58,130
So thinking about and working with customs agencies and getting an understanding of that to make sure that resources are shipped

70
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:08,570
appropriately, are received. If you ship some commodities or food, that's critical to get to a certain location and then a climate issue hits.

71
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:16,280
How are you going to address that with the customs agent? And you really have to understand customs agents to really work through that.

72
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,980
And there's also logistics within an office setting.

73
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:27,200
But logistics are especially critical resources, it's significant in the global health sector and making sure that vaccines get to where they need to be,

74
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,450
they're the appropriate channels you're working through.

75
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:34,820
We call them, in the Humanitarian Aid Sector, clusters working through the appropriate cluster for health and food and shelter,

76
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:41,300
and there are actually, there's actually a well coordinated cluster system. You'll see them when you study the sphere, the global sphere standards.

77
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:47,740
But logistics careers are also interesting, so think about what you're studying and kind of where you fit, and what you would like to do,

78
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:54,110
but know that your role is critical. There's advocacy like government relations, as I mentioned, at care,

79
00:07:54,110 --> 00:08:00,200
one of my colleagues leads learning tours for policymakers, and very much partners with

80
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:05,670
community in coordinating those tours so that it's not really a fishbowl approach,

81
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:09,680
that there's really an approach where there's an engagement and the communities are really leading

82
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:15,380
that engagement and showing you and telling their story about their communities. Then there's digital.

83
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:19,850
You can have a traditional I.T. career to make sure that country offices are connected.

84
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:25,960
That's critical to make sure that contractors are connected, can engage, especially when there are political outbreaks,

85
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:31,520
making sure you have the resources to communicate with your team in your country office,

86
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,690
that, and make sure that they're up and running and pretty much are safe in their homes.

87
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:39,050
So an I.T. role within an INGO is pretty critical,

88
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:46,520
but even a local NGO is pretty critical to make sure your staff can communicate and  have the resources they need. You can focus on customer

89
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:53,990
relationship management, databases and managing that and helping to provide some analytics around customer relations management.

90
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:59,540
Why are we not winning awards from USAID, Australia Aid or the Gates Foundation?

91
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:06,680
What were some shortcomings historically,  in looking at that data? That's significant for operations and ensuring that the financial help of an

92
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:14,840
organization is significant enough or supportive enough to support the work and the impact that an organization wants to have. Quickly,

93
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:21,020
of course, you can have a finance and accounting career in Knowledge Management, Institutional Funding and Strategies/Business Development,

94
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:24,080
which is the area I work in,

95
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:31,130
particularly in the areas of business development and institutional funding for health and global education and gender focused opportunities.

96
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:38,540
That's my area, or those are my areas. And then separately, many organizations have separate corporate and foundation fundraising teams.

97
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,340
So typically your business development,

98
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:47,840
if you see that, and your institutional funding teams are typically focused on government funding, and that requires a really significant strategy.

99
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:52,010
So business skills come in, technical skills come in. My background is in public health.

100
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:56,690
So those skills come into play where you're strategizing, you're analyzing what the donor,

101
00:09:56,690 --> 00:10:03,440
USAID, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, what they're looking for. Do they want you to address health in a humanitarian setting?

102
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,960
What area of health, maternal and child health, nutrition?

103
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:11,510
You have to analyze, and study, and understand what are some of those dynamics and issues in emerging challenges that

104
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:18,750
aren't being brought to the surface yet, and engaging with your country office team who is really proximate to the issues.

105
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:23,760
So that's institutional funding and strategy where the corporate and foundation fundraising team,

106
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:29,100
which sometimes is separate, or often are separate with INGOs, really focus on selling an organization,

107
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:36,510
getting donor grants and funding, and sometimes even partner with donors for programmatic work, like I discussed earlier,

108
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:41,880
to support their CSR reporting and support them in ways so that their supply chain aren't in destress.

109
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,920
So tea companies, for example, have smallholder farmers in certain countries.

110
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:51,900
There's a lot of controversy around the cocoa industry, you can research a lot about that. The Shea industry.

111
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:56,550
A lot of actually, chocolates, and confectioneries, and beauty products are used from shea.

112
00:10:56,550 --> 00:11:04,980
There are women, especially in Ghana, that are paid by companies like Mars to pick shea nuts and to provide them.

113
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:08,670
So there are critical parts of the supply chain for that corporation.

114
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:13,740
So I encourage you to read about sort of the controversies, the issues with that,

115
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:18,210
but then also how they create markets in those communities and how they're trying,

116
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:21,960
efforts to address all of these challenges within global health because their livelihood,

117
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:25,930
again, relates to their global health. There is legal.

118
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:32,230
You can serve as legal counsel for INGOs or for local NGOs.

119
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:40,420
On the Marketing and Communications team, being able to direct or lead on the telling of stories of communities in a respectful way that engages

120
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:46,760
them and lets them lead on telling their stories in the way that they see fit for their community,

121
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:52,300
but also telling the truth. So it's a balance of making sure that you show the truth and how extreme it is,

122
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:56,410
but also that you're not feeding into a system or an industry that's showing extreme and not

123
00:11:56,410 --> 00:12:02,410
really the full truth of what a community looks like, and the resources and assets in a community.

124
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:04,300
And then, of course, people and culture and human resources,

125
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:10,840
then you'll start to see some INGOs are now bringing on DEI professionals. But DEI professionals

126
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:15,640
,within human resources, are not the only way to integrate DEI into your work.

127
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:23,490
We'll talk about that now. The integration of diversity, equity, inclusion in global health is currently being grappled with.

128
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:27,420
You may see some articles that talk about decolonizing global health.

129
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:32,490
The aid system is fractured. It was built on colonialism. It was built on racism.

130
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:38,530
We're starting to unpack that even more, and even more aggressively and courageously in this sector, and I encourage you as you're pursuing a career,

131
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:42,440
join in, start analyzing, start sharpening your analytical skills now.

132
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,280
I want to point to this picture.

133
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:52,230
I mentioned earlier that I would talk about local community organization, local community champions and investors.

134
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:58,680
This picture depicts pretty much what we call a Community Health Entrepreneur.

135
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:07,080
So she is selling an item to this couple, and it's likely a reproductive health or birthing kit, or some type of health related resource.

136
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,560
And you can see her backpack says Live Well.

137
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:18,210
CARE USA owns a company that we then where we grow several companies, small enterprises, essentially they're local companies.

138
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:26,400
We provide them with fundraising support, and after a period of seven years in five phases, they grow into their own enterprises.

139
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:33,990
So this is one of those that has received investment capital. When you receive investment capital, be it equity, be it convertible notes.

140
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:44,110
Some of you who are involved in finance may know there's a little bit. Be it loans or debt, that you, of course, have to be repaid.

141
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:49,580
The idea is to that, that type of capital will allow an enterprise to grow.

142
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,700
And, of course, your investor wants a return on the investment,

143
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:58,930
both social measurements against how community members are benefiting from these type of resources.

144
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:02,080
So they can report against that as well as the return of the investment, long term.

145
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:07,300
You know, typically 10 year investments before these investors typically start seeing a return on investment.

146
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:12,610
But this is an example, social enterprise. But understand that,

147
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:18,490
the woman that's holding this product that she's selling typically is a community health worker.

148
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:25,870
What Live Well does and what CARE does through Live Well, is really convert community health workers into community health entrepreneurs.

149
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:33,730
When we talk about stakeholders, we also need to recognize citizen champions who are sometimes working on behalf of the government.

150
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:37,690
But essentially, community health workers have always been a part of communities.

151
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:45,400
They are identified as resources, as champions by the community and pretty much sort of upheld as this is a community health worker.

152
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,490
I get my resources and information from this person.

153
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:53,380
If I didn't get this resource from this person, this community health worker, I would be at a loss.

154
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:57,760
So CARE has tapped into that system Live Well in Zambia.

155
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,840
It really converted and improved the livelihoods of community health workers by converting

156
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:06,670
them to community health entrepreneurs and pretty much teaching them business skills,

157
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:10,630
providing them with the wholesale resources and profit on what they sell.

158
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:18,220
So there's lamps, there's birthing kits, there's sexual reproductive health resources, like condoms and other contraception.

159
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:26,050
What they provide over the counter is numerous. And they reach really, really what we call "last mile" communities, communities that are beyond rural.

160
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,010
They're really remote, and kind of last mile,

161
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:36,640
we say last mile really kind of, communities that haven't been reached enough that would really help to advance achievement's towards global health goals.

162
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:45,360
So when you hear "last mile",  just know that there's rural, there's remote, remote is often used in exchange or in the same way as last mile.

163
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:51,790
Just know that this relates to DEI, because the global health sector is really an expansive developing

164
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:59,350
landscape and we all would think to recognize that there are assets in communities that we can partner with.

165
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:05,860
These communities have existed and have thrived without intervention, any collaboration.

166
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:11,590
They don't need, they don't need sort of Western imperialism, so to speak.

167
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:20,360
So let's delve into DEI a little bit more. Any type of global community development work, including global health,

168
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:26,680
see that part of the wide range expansive ecosystem of global community development work.

169
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:33,670
Let's specifically focus on global health. The aim of this type of work is to create improvements in people's quality of life

170
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:40,210
through the interrogation analysis and applied methods to address various social issues.

171
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:45,020
So always analyze what you're doing and how you're doing it.

172
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:49,560
So interrogate yourself, interrogate how you're going about your work, that's the only way it gets better.

173
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:56,130
That should be the purpose of monitoring evaluation that you really are interrogating yourself and analyzing yourself against indicated.

174
00:16:56,130 --> 00:17:02,430
And as you're falling short, really attacking and trying to understand where you fell short and why,

175
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:09,210
but also you want to do work that's impactful, restorative, transformative and sustainable.

176
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:13,590
So challenge yourself to do the following, specifically, these two things.

177
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:19,050
Number one, study the historical shortcomings of the industry.

178
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:23,780
If you're going to focus on finance, what have been some historical shortcomings?

179
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:29,680
You may want to be a finance operations officer. What if there's a shortcoming, there's an issue that you feel like you can address in your role?

180
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:36,720
Or you may be somebody who focuses on impact investing with your finance and economic settings.

181
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,880
So what if it's a shortcoming of micro-finance, what if it's some issues in Gap that you want to address

182
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,150
when you're working in your room. So that's just an example, of finance sector.

183
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:52,740
So study the historical historical shortcomings of the expansive industry, but also specifically the sector that you want to work in and how they persist today,

184
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:59,310
in the form of ineffective aid, aid that's not sustainable, aid that's not localized enough, aid

185
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:04,420
that's not really invested in local communities and assets and resources.

186
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:08,810
Next, also study adaptive management approaches, which is particularly important in

187
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:13,590
humanitarian response settings. Adaptive management relates to when there,

188
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:18,600
perhaps, you are working in a development setting and then all of a sudden there has been an outbreak,

189
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:26,350
and this is perhaps in a country like DRC, that has historically, in certain regions, has had violent outbreaks.

190
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:33,520
How are you going to ship resources? How are you going to responsibly plan for, at the project design stage, an adaptive management plan?

191
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:38,050
How are you going to build in maybe some cushion, or maybe a fund that will

192
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:42,490
allow me to transition resources into another region and keep your team safe,

193
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:46,150
keep your community safe, which you're working with, and monitor the situation?

194
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:50,080
So adaptive management approaches being agile. It's important to learn that.

195
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,970
So as you're going through your career, when there's an opportunity to maybe take a training or even online,

196
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:59,730
I think USAID has a free training, look and try to learn and understand adaptive management

197
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:04,460
approaches, that's significant, particularly in an ever evolving context.

198
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:10,440
But, I wanted to say, in addition to those two areas of study, the adaptive management approaches,

199
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:18,600
the historical shortcomings of the industry in your sector, be willing to specifically interrogate how this work is implemented

200
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:22,720
and that's not just why, but how? Ask yourself these questions.

201
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:29,400
These are some dying questions. Am I censoring the expressed needs of the communities I'm working to support?

202
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,300
Are you censoring them? What are their needs? Not what you read in a book.

203
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,310
Was there a recent assessment?

204
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:43,340
Because maybe what you've read was four or five years ago, but now the needs have changed and shifted and maybe related to global health,

205
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:51,960
they're more food security related vs. contraceptive distribution or reproductive health education resources.

206
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:57,480
Maybe there needs to be a balance or an increase in livelihood resources, the food resources, or nutrition.

207
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:05,050
So make sure that you're really, really trying to answer the question and have and work within communities to conduct assessments either

208
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:09,790
through your country office or through partner organizations and understanding what are the expressed needs of

209
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:15,840
the communities you work to support? Another question to ask is, have you taken the time?

210
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:21,330
Have you taken the time to understand existing resources and structures in a community?

211
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:31,080
I mentioned through this picture that community health workers, CHW, you'll see the term CHW as a community

212
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:36,570
health workers, sometimes are volunteer driven, sometimes they're paid stipends by the government.

213
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:37,590
When they're volunteer driven

214
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:43,140
sometimes they have historically just been real advocates, who have kept themselves informed on global health

215
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:50,790
issues to go report when there are health issues, and try to bring health practitioners into a community, but they're really health advocates.

216
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:52,530
Have you understood assets like that?

217
00:20:52,530 --> 00:21:00,050
Are you seeing them and not just seeing a community that lacks? So look for those structures that are already there, and

218
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:06,010
those resources that are already there. Take your time to understand that first and foremost.

219
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:11,260
Third, ask the question, what does this community know that I don't? And they always know something you don't.

220
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:16,820
What do they know about their community that I obviously don't? That relates to structures,

221
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:24,150
but that also relates to maybe even some influencers, maybe even some bias, maybe even some stigma.

222
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:30,460
What do they know that I don't, that impacts global health access and global health service delivery.

223
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:39,680
And how can we integrate what we've learned from them into the design of this initiative and ensure it remains throughout that implementation period?

224
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:49,700
How can we involve them in project design? Finally, I want to ask you to ask yourself, to interrogate yourself in this way to ask another question.

225
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:57,290
Have we designed the project and or if it's already a project, it's awarded and be implemented?

226
00:21:57,290 --> 00:22:01,810
How are we implemented in a way that ensures full local ownership?

227
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:10,730
So gradually, either from the beginning or either by the time the project is completed, USAID often funded five year cycle.

228
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:17,880
So by the end of that project period, how can we say that we've operated in a way that it's localizes that

229
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:22,580
you know, there's a social enterprise that will be run like Live Well in Zambia

230
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:29,270
by local community health entrepreneurs, that there are business skills that can't be unlearned, that really are sustainable,

231
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:32,600
that really are ensuring the provision of long term health care services.

232
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:37,050
Have we built up their revenue model enough to where it's a sustainable enterprise?

233
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:44,610
Or this initiative can really be sustained without external aid interventions, because those dollars tend to be cut yearly.

234
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:49,920
But a lot of the investments have actually remained in the West. We often, when we hire,

235
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:58,970
external or extra talent to work in local offices at significant levels and there's talent in country,

236
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:03,990
you know, we're contributing to the investment opportunities locally. So think through that.

237
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:15,510
In my line of work, in business development, I focus on multi-national funding for global health, education and gender projects,

238
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:21,200
and part of that also includes recruitment. When you're looking at a 20 million dollar and a 60 million dollar five year project,

239
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:29,610
there is, you have to recruit staff, you have to set up at times, sub country offices where if you're working in multiple regions and they aren't one.

240
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:37,570
So I work with my recruiters and say, "If I don't see enough candidates to interview that are women, why do we have no women in this talent pool?"

241
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:42,600
I ask myself those questions. Why do we not have enough local Africans?

242
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:46,470
Where do we post the applications? Have we posted them in local newspapers?

243
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:49,710
Have we worked with our country teams, our country office staff?

244
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:55,500
So there's always an opportunity to think through how you can address diversity, equity and inclusion.

245
00:23:55,500 --> 00:24:00,430
Have we had our country office staff review job descriptions? So maybe they may not be appropriate for the content

246
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:05,520
and we may need to tweak them and align them to align with sort of how hiring practices are done locally.

247
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:13,150
But always ask itself critical questions to ensure that you're integrating DEI into your global health work.

248
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:20,970
I'll share this last slide, these are just resources to further your learning, The Humanitarian Sphere Standard that I talked about earlier.

249
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:25,050
Here's the link. I encourage you to delve deeply into them.

250
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:28,800
You can read the standards book, the guidebook online for free.

251
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:33,150
There's AgriLinks if you want to learn more about agriculture and food security.

252
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:37,110
These are low cost agriculture, food security training.

253
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:43,170
And then there is the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, where you'll see the Sustainable Development Goals.

254
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:52,560
I encourage you to go look there. There's also a resource that's an organization, specifically that's called Popworks Africa.

255
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:59,170
It's run by a West African woman by the name of Stephanie Kimou Palladio,

256
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:04,280
which she has paid student-focused trainings on decolonizing the global aid sector.

257
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:08,160
There's starting to be more training, but she's been one of the earliest ones.

258
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:12,380
And her trainings, from what I understand, has been very effective. I have participated in some webinars, but

259
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:18,780
there are some distinct trainings that are student focused. If you have an opportunity, I encourage you to kind of look into them.

260
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:24,270
All right, and then I want to talk about job research resources. Different organizations focus in different contexts.

261
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:28,160
Some organizations have both humanitarian and development in Mexico.

262
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:34,200
programming like Care International or Care USA. Others focus more on development content.

263
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:43,860
But if you want to focus on really humanitarian crisis setting, humanitarian relief is really a key resource for those types of job opportunities.

264
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:52,350
There's also GlobalJobs.org, there's DevNetJobs.org that they primarily provide information on development jobs.

265
00:25:52,350 --> 00:26:01,410
There's some humanitarian jobs there, but you will find more on relief. Another one is Devex, which is primarily on development job as well.

266
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:06,420
But I just wanted to share those resources. There are a number of resources you can access.

267
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:12,070
These are just some key ones that I've seen that are being, that are used and that I have used in the past as

268
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:23,760
well. If you would like to contact me to ask any questions or maybe if I can host the Q&A session with you to answer some questions,

269
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:31,750
feel free to e-mail me, feel free to connect on LinkedIn. I'd love to see how you grow your careers, how you continue your learning,

270
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:39,140
and maybe just share your feedback in terms of how you're navigating different issues and just the eco system of global health,

271
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:42,620
but I welcome that. And I just want to thank you,

272
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:48,520
I'm excited for all of you, this opportunity through the Future Public Health Leaders

273
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:53,380
Program that you are all navigating and what it means for your future in public health,

274
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:56,960
and the exposure that you're getting, but then also what you are going to bring to this sector.

275
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,690
We need you. Please ask questions, raise your voices in meetings,

276
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:05,470
even if it's a question and you don't know the answer by virtue of you asking the

277
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:10,930
questions is very helpful because you are unique in your perspective and your background,

278
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:18,820
and you may ask a question in a way that really changes someone's thinking or trigger someone to start exploring a different direction.

279
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:23,860
So I look forward to having you join the global health sector and looking forward to work alongside you.

280
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:26,920
Thank you.
