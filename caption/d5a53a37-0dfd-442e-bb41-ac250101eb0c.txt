1
00:00:07,454 --> 00:00:16,454
First, we will do a brief recap on the concepts of individual and frequency matching, and then we will discuss how to analyze match data.

2
00:00:16,454 --> 00:00:17,454
Specifically,

3
00:00:17,454 --> 00:00:28,454
we will discuss how to estimate a matched odds ratio in a case control study and a matched risk ratio and risk difference in a cohort study.

4
00:00:28,454 --> 00:00:36,454
In the last lecture module, I introduced the methods of individual matching and frequency matching as methods to

5
00:00:36,454 --> 00:00:43,454
control for confounding at the design stage of an observational epidemiologic study.

6
00:00:43,454 --> 00:00:49,454
In individual or one to one matching, for each case who was recruited in a case

7
00:00:49,454 --> 00:00:55,454
control study or for each exposed person who was recruited in a cohort study,

8
00:00:55,454 --> 00:01:03,454
we then carefully select one or more control or unexposed person who match that case or exposed

9
00:01:03,454 --> 00:01:10,454
person on the basis of a confounding factor that we wish to control for through matching.

10
00:01:10,454 --> 00:01:19,454
Individual matching requires a special analysis to account for the matching that's been done, and we will discuss these methods now.

11
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:26,454
Frequency matching, on the other hand, aims to match the frequency of the confounding variable that we wish to control for

12
00:01:26,454 --> 00:01:36,454
through matching between the case and control groups in a case control study, or between the exposed and unexposed groups in a cohort study.

13
00:01:36,454 --> 00:01:45,454
As an example, if in a study where we think that marriage is an important confounder of a given exposure outcome relationship that we wish to study,

14
00:01:45,454 --> 00:01:51,454
if we recruit our cases or exposed group and we see that twenty five percent of them are married,

15
00:01:51,454 --> 00:01:57,454
we would then select our controls or unexposed group such that twenty five percent of

16
00:01:57,454 --> 00:02:05,454
them are also married and no special analysis is needed in frequency matched data.

17
00:02:05,454 --> 00:02:11,454
There are many ways to achieve one to one matching when we sample controls to match the cases.

18
00:02:11,454 --> 00:02:16,454
It depends how closely they need to match and the ratio of cases to controls that we want to achieve.

19
00:02:16,454 --> 00:02:19,454
It doesn't always need to be one to one. It could be one to two.

20
00:02:19,454 --> 00:02:24,454
For whatever reason, you don't need to know the details about these methods of individual matching.

21
00:02:24,454 --> 00:02:30,454
But I mention them here in case you hear about them.

22
00:02:30,454 --> 00:02:38,454
In a case control study, we need to do a special analysis to account for matching that was conducted at the design stage.

23
00:02:38,454 --> 00:02:49,454
When we have performed individual one to one matching, we achieve this through changing our two by two table to account for the matching.

24
00:02:49,454 --> 00:02:54,454
The two by two table that I show you here in this slide is a little bit different from

25
00:02:54,454 --> 00:02:59,454
the standard two by two table for case control studies that we have been looking at

26
00:02:59,454 --> 00:03:08,454
up until this point. What I've done here is I've shown the cases in the rows and the controls in the columns,

27
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:16,454
and then I have separate rows and columns for being exposed and being not exposed.

28
00:03:16,454 --> 00:03:26,454
So each of the cells in this table, as a result, represent a matched pair in our individually matched case control study.

29
00:03:26,454 --> 00:03:35,454
For example, Cell A would represent matched pairs where both the case and the control was exposed.

30
00:03:35,454 --> 00:03:42,454
This is what we call a concordant pair with respect to their exposure status.

31
00:03:42,454 --> 00:03:48,454
Cell D is another example of a concordant pair with respect to their exposure status.

32
00:03:48,454 --> 00:03:54,454
But now both the case and the control in the pair are not exposed.

33
00:03:54,454 --> 00:04:03,454
Cells B and D represent discordant pairs, with respect to their exposure status. In Cell B, the control is not exposed,

34
00:04:03,454 --> 00:04:08,454
but the case is exposed. And in cell C, the control is exposed,

35
00:04:08,454 --> 00:04:12,454
and the case is not exposed. As you can imagine,

36
00:04:12,454 --> 00:04:19,454
Cells A and D actually contribute nothing to our information about the odds of

37
00:04:19,454 --> 00:04:25,454
the outcome because both the case and control share the same exposure status.

38
00:04:25,454 --> 00:04:37,454
So they do not contribute any information. What we do then is we use the information from the discordant pairs to give us our odds ratio.

39
00:04:37,454 --> 00:04:47,454
All we simply do here is we take the ratio of cells B to C in calculating the matched pairs odds ratio.

40
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:57,454
So whenever you are presented data from an individually matched case control study, construct this odds ratio or sorry,

41
00:04:57,454 --> 00:05:07,454
construct this two by two table that I show you here and calculate the odds ratio as B divided by C.

42
00:05:07,454 --> 00:05:12,454
Here's an example. We have our case control pairs shown on the left hand side of the slide.

43
00:05:12,454 --> 00:05:23,454
And we see that there are five discordant pairs in total with four of them being discordant pair type B and one of them being discordant pair type C.

44
00:05:23,454 --> 00:05:33,454
We simply calculate the matched pairs odds ratio as B divided by C, which is four over one, which is four.

45
00:05:33,454 --> 00:05:36,454
Let's work through another example.

46
00:05:36,454 --> 00:05:46,454
Let's think about a matched pairs case control study about the association between dietary beta carotene and the incidence of lung cancer.

47
00:05:46,454 --> 00:05:50,454
This case control study recruits from a stable base population.

48
00:05:50,454 --> 00:05:58,454
So normally you would never have the information that I'm showing you here in this table when you actually conduct your case control study.

49
00:05:58,454 --> 00:06:07,454
But I'm showing you the associations as they would be in the in the stable base population as a learning example.

50
00:06:07,454 --> 00:06:15,454
We have beta, as the exposure is shown in the rose, where low beta carotene is indicated by E, which means the exposure is present.

51
00:06:15,454 --> 00:06:24,454
And high beta carotene is indicated by E with the bar on top of it, meaning the exposure is not present.

52
00:06:24,454 --> 00:06:30,454
We have our total two by two table shown on the far right hand side where we have

53
00:06:30,454 --> 00:06:35,454
lung cancer represented by D and then we have total person years of follow up,

54
00:06:35,454 --> 00:06:43,454
which we know hypothetically in this stable base population that the case control study will recruit from.

55
00:06:43,454 --> 00:06:50,454
The confounding variable that we wish to match on in our case control study is smoking status.

56
00:06:50,454 --> 00:06:58,454
So here I've hypothetically shown out the shown the two by two table stratified out by smoking status.

57
00:06:58,454 --> 00:07:05,454
We have an incidence density ratio of three across levels of smoking and a crude incidence density ratio,

58
00:07:05,454 --> 00:07:10,454
which does not account for the confounding by smoking a five point zero six.

59
00:07:10,454 --> 00:07:14,454
So now we know the truth. Which, again, we don't know in practice.

60
00:07:14,454 --> 00:07:20,454
But we know it here because this is a learning example. Let's conduct our case control study and see what we find.

61
00:07:20,454 --> 00:07:27,454
First, let's start by doing an unmatched case control study in this unmatched case control study.

62
00:07:27,454 --> 00:07:35,454
We recruit 52 cases and 52 controls randomly selected from the underlying base population that I've shown you above.

63
00:07:35,454 --> 00:07:44,454
And you can see this in the two by two table that is shown in the far right hand side of the table.

64
00:07:44,454 --> 00:07:52,454
We have also stratified out by smoking status and calculated the Mantel Haenszel odds ratio,

65
00:07:52,454 --> 00:08:03,454
which is based on the stratum-specific odds ratios according to values of smoking status.

66
00:08:03,454 --> 00:08:14,454
We can see here that we know we know that this is an unmatched case control study because the number of smokers is unequal between cases and controls.

67
00:08:14,454 --> 00:08:20,454
If this had been matched, we would have an equal number of smokers and nonsmokers between cases and controls,

68
00:08:20,454 --> 00:08:25,454
meaning that the distribution of smoking was the same between cases and controls.

69
00:08:25,454 --> 00:08:31,454
And thus, it is no longer a confounder because we have broken that confounder outcome link.

70
00:08:31,454 --> 00:08:38,454
Now, let's see what happens if we turn this unmatched case control study into a matched case control study.

71
00:08:38,454 --> 00:08:45,454
So we've recruited our cases and then rather than randomly selected 52 controls from the underlying base population,

72
00:08:45,454 --> 00:08:52,454
we would carefully select our controls to have the same smoking status as cases.

73
00:08:52,454 --> 00:08:59,454
So for each case that we recruit who is a smoker, we would also recruit a control who is a smoker.

74
00:08:59,454 --> 00:09:08,454
And you can see here that there are, in the smoking category for every case,

75
00:09:08,454 --> 00:09:12,454
for every 40 cases who are a smoker, there are 40 controls who are a smoker.

76
00:09:12,454 --> 00:09:22,454
And for every non smoker, well, there are twelve non smokers who are cases, there are also twelve non cases who are non smokers.

77
00:09:22,454 --> 00:09:33,454
And we've calculated out the matched pairs odds ratio here using the discordant cells, which are B and C within the strata of smoking.

78
00:09:33,454 --> 00:09:41,454
And we get an odds ratio of three for the matched pairs odds ratio.

79
00:09:41,454 --> 00:09:49,454
Now, let's compare the results from this matched case control study to the results that we had previously for the unmatched case control study.

80
00:09:49,454 --> 00:09:55,454
So I show I've shown the unmatched case control study on the top and the matched case control study on the bottom.

81
00:09:55,454 --> 00:10:00,454
Both have 52 cases and 52 controls in the unmatched case control study.

82
00:10:00,454 --> 00:10:04,454
The controls were randomly selected from the base population.

83
00:10:04,454 --> 00:10:12,454
And you can see that the distribution of smoking is not the same in the cases and controls in the matched case control study.

84
00:10:12,454 --> 00:10:18,454
I have carefully selected the controls so that they match the cases with respect to their smoking status.

85
00:10:18,454 --> 00:10:24,454
And you can see that there are equal numbers of smokers and nonsmokers between the cases and controls.

86
00:10:24,454 --> 00:10:30,454
A key point here is that the Mantel Haenszel odds ratio that was conducted for the unmatched case control study is

87
00:10:30,454 --> 00:10:38,454
the exact same as the matched pairs odds ratio that we can estimated in the matched pairs case control study.

88
00:10:38,454 --> 00:10:44,454
This is a hugely important point. These are two different methods of confounder control.

89
00:10:44,454 --> 00:10:50,454
The Mantel Haenszel odds ratio is simply a method of confounder control that we implement at the analysis stage.

90
00:10:50,454 --> 00:11:01,454
Whereas the matched pairs odds ratio is achieved through matching the cases and controls on the basis of the confounder at the design stage.

91
00:11:01,454 --> 00:11:10,454
However, one main difference between these two tables is in the crude odds ratio shown on the right hand side of each table.

92
00:11:10,454 --> 00:11:19,454
How we interpret the crude odds ratio differs in an unmatched versus a matched case control study in the unmatched case control study,

93
00:11:19,454 --> 00:11:28,454
the crude odds ratio is five point zero six. It is biased away from the null because it is confounded by smoking.

94
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:34,454
On the other hand, in the matched case control study, the crude's odds ratio is two point eight four.

95
00:11:34,454 --> 00:11:39,454
It is biased towards the null. And if you recall from the previous lecture module.

96
00:11:39,454 --> 00:11:48,454
This is because the effect of matching the cases and controls on their smoking status has also made the cases and controls look more similar

97
00:11:48,454 --> 00:11:52,454
with respect to the exposure, beta carotene.

98
00:11:52,454 --> 00:12:01,454
This is because smoking is related to beta-carotene as a confounder of the beta carotene lung cancer relationship.

99
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:11,454
When we make the cases and controls look more similar to each other with respect to the exposure status,

100
00:12:11,454 --> 00:12:18,454
we get a bias towards the null, which is reflected here in the crude odds ratio from the matched pairs study.

101
00:12:18,454 --> 00:12:24,454
However, when we account for the matching by stratifying out according to levels of the matching

102
00:12:24,454 --> 00:12:30,454
factor and calculating the matched pairs odds ratio using the discordant cells,

103
00:12:30,454 --> 00:12:37,454
we get the correct matched pairs odds ratio that accounts for matching.

104
00:12:37,454 --> 00:12:43,454
Here's an example that I'm not going to talk through, but again, this is a matched pairs case control study.

105
00:12:43,454 --> 00:12:51,454
I've estimated the matched pairs to buy to table as shown in the bottom left hand side of the slide.

106
00:12:51,454 --> 00:12:59,454
And then I've calculated the matched odds ratio by taking the ratio of the discordant pairs.

107
00:12:59,454 --> 00:13:02,454
Moving on to a matched pairs cohort study.

108
00:13:02,454 --> 00:13:12,454
So here's an example of a hypothetical cohort study where we've similarly only done individual one to one match.

109
00:13:12,454 --> 00:13:20,454
What this looks like is now, recall, we have taken the unexposed and exposed group and we have matched them on the basis of the

110
00:13:20,454 --> 00:13:27,454
confounder in order to break the link between the exposure and the confounding variable.

111
00:13:27,454 --> 00:13:33,454
This ultimately gives us four strata, so recall in the matched pairs case control study,

112
00:13:33,454 --> 00:13:38,454
we had two types of discordant pairs and two types of concordant pairs.

113
00:13:38,454 --> 00:13:41,454
And I've shown these here.

114
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:52,454
In the matched pairs two by two table for a cohort study, we collapse these four types of concordant and discordant pairs into these cells.

115
00:13:52,454 --> 00:13:59,454
And so if you look on the bottom left hand side of the slide, we have type one being cell A,

116
00:13:59,454 --> 00:14:06,454
Type two being cell B, type three being cell C and type D being cell four, sorry,

117
00:14:06,454 --> 00:14:14,454
type four being cell D, so similar to the two by two table for the matched case control study cells B and C,

118
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:25,454
which represent types two and three are the discordant pairs. And then we ultimately calculate what we call the Mantel Haenszel risk ratio,

119
00:14:25,454 --> 00:14:37,454
which is the exposed individuals who have the outcome divided by the unexposed individuals who have the outcome,

120
00:14:37,454 --> 00:14:46,454
as shown here. And in fact, in a cohort study,

121
00:14:46,454 --> 00:14:57,454
the crude risk ratio is actually the same as the Mantel Haenszel risk ratio that we estimate from the special two-by-two table for the matched pairs,

122
00:14:57,454 --> 00:15:04,454
which is shown on the left. So no bias is introduced by ignoring the match.

123
00:15:04,454 --> 00:15:11,454
If you want, you can sit down and you can look at the values in the crude table and the unexposed table and I've

124
00:15:11,454 --> 00:15:20,454
shown here the formula that shows how the crude risk ratio actually is equal to the Mantel Haenszel risk ratio.

125
00:15:20,454 --> 00:15:26,454
And this happens because we have fixed the ratio of unexposed to exposed subjects

126
00:15:26,454 --> 00:15:32,454
to eliminate the association between the matching variable and the exposure.

127
00:15:32,454 --> 00:15:39,454
We can also calculate the matched pairs cohort risk difference using the similar information.

128
00:15:39,454 --> 00:15:43,454
And I will actually just skip ahead to show you here.

129
00:15:43,454 --> 00:15:52,454
We just simply take the risk difference and it is equivalent in the matched pairs design as it is in the crude design.

130
00:15:52,454 --> 00:15:59,454
So we can simply calculate the risk difference in a matched pairs cohort study in the same way as I taught you before,

131
00:15:59,454 --> 00:16:04,454
using an unmatched cohort study. And that's the end of part two.

132
00:16:04,454 --> 00:16:10,454
The next is part three. And we are going to review all of these concepts again and in a bit more depth.

133
00:16:10,454 --> 00:16:16,387
That's happening in the Live Zoom lecture on Tuesday, October twenty seventh from ten thirty to twelve o'clock Eastern Time.
