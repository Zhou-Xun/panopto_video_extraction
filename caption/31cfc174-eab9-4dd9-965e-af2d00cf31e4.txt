1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,790
Good deal. All right. How you doing, folks? Yeah.

2
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:12,180
Yeah. Pretty nasty fall day. But I'm glad, everybody.

3
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:23,220
Well, a number of folks are here today. So were you promised you promised that you would watch these videos and start there, some of this information.

4
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:28,350
Now we're going to spend the bulk of the day doing is going through all of that information a little bit longer.

5
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:34,740
I'm going to ask you a whole bunch of questions about factor analysis. And I want to see how folks are doing, how they feel about this content.

6
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,900
I was very excited about the progress folks made with their regression assessment on Tuesday,

7
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,900
which to me makes me think we are ready for that midterm.

8
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,639
There is one big piece of it that's going to deal with kind of measurement and factor analysis.

9
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,100
So I was thinking I'd like to make it available today for everyone, two and a half to two weeks, everyone, folks, including me.

10
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:59,400
But I don't want you to freak out about factor analysis because it is it is a part of it.

11
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,340
I think it's an important part of what we do. The scale analysis in general,

12
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:06,330
it's been something that we've sort of implicitly done throughout the semester as we've

13
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:12,629
created mean scores and thought through how we could take a bunch of items together and say,

14
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:16,860
this is our construct for future annotation, or this is our construct for a peer influence or winner.

15
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:24,150
So making sure folks feel comfortable about that before I throw it actually as a kind of a formal assignment.

16
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:31,320
So that's why I want to spend some time today going through two of the main points around reliability and factor analysis.

17
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:35,010
If folks are interested, we can go through and at that second example,

18
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:37,860
I think in the first example, I go through it pretty thoroughly within the video.

19
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,670
So I don't want to there's I don't think we need to go through it again. I'm happy to have you on.

20
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:48,090
These are some of the pieces, factor scores in rotation to tend to get folks a little bit more trouble.

21
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,320
So if you want, we can touch on those and then lab homework.

22
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,670
I'm on the fence about whether we need to have a formal homework around vector analysis.

23
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:57,840
Happy to do it.

24
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:03,330
Happy to make it something that's optional that you can try if you want, so that you're not trying to factor analysis for the first time in midterm.

25
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:09,600
So that's kind of where I think we could spend the day. Again, if we're not making the progress that folks are feeling comfortable,

26
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,560
we can possibly slow things down a little bit and you'll fall breaks next week.

27
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:20,520
So there are a few different ways that we can move forward from today, but that's what I'm doing now.

28
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,230
That sounds pretty good. Competitive as well. All right.

29
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:29,670
Well, let's go ahead and move forward then, just as a reminder.

30
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,340
So factor analysis, what we're trying to do here is when you have a whole bunch of variables,

31
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:44,279
whether we can find clusters of those variables that tend to be more highly correlated or more related than others within.

32
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,839
That's all right. It's a dimension reduction technique.

33
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,610
So when you have a whole bunch of items, but you're looking for some of those underlying factors,

34
00:02:53,610 --> 00:03:00,540
some of these unobservable factors are constructs that kind of explain the variation in the items.

35
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,240
Now, for the example that I used in the video,

36
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:09,899
we had 12 items that talked about whether you're anxious or stressed or whether you're sad and feeling lonely or whether you don't

37
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:16,590
have interest in things or whether you're nervous and shaky if you start to think about those items and what they really mean.

38
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:22,890
Is there something that's kind of inherent within us that might be driving some of those responses?

39
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:31,650
Now, theoretically, that scale is around. It's a generalized symptom inventory that has sort of two factors.

40
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:35,730
One that's related to depression, one that's related to anxiety.

41
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,900
The thought is if you are higher or lower in depression,

42
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:48,000
you would respond to some of those specific items about feeling blue or that only or feeling like you have no interest in things in different ways.

43
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:54,210
Similarly, if you are higher or lower in anxiety, you would respond to those nervousness and shakiness items a little bit differently.

44
00:03:54,930 --> 00:04:00,659
The funny thing is here those are that's completely a theoretical distinction.

45
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:10,140
When we say we have six items that are depression, six items that are anxiety factor analysis, we can kind of use to add some empiricism to that work.

46
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:19,530
And we can say, yeah, sure enough, people tend to respond to the six items that are focused on feeling depressed differently.

47
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:28,890
The way you respond are more highly correlated across those six items, then the other six items in the scale and flip that for anxiety.

48
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,910
That's what factor analysis allows us to do.

49
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:38,250
You have a set of a whole bunch of items and if you believe that there are some underlying

50
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:43,080
dimensions to what that what's kind of explaining the way people respond to those items.

51
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:50,490
That's your job for factor analysis. And we use it all the time because typically we're interested in kind of these overarching constructs.

52
00:04:50,790 --> 00:05:00,600
And rather than having to include an analysis that has 12 individual items, we can now create two scores one for depression, one for anxiety.

53
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:08,980
You have a differentiator and they relate to an outcome. For example, questions about the purpose of factor analysis.

54
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:18,120
Do you see a reason why you want to use this in your own world? And it would be someone you want to share an example.

55
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:35,250
For identifying predictors of gun violence.

56
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:46,470
Okay. So tell me some of the items that you might have for predicting gun violence, community violence, delinquency, police involvement.

57
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,080
Great. Perfect. So I can ask you a whole bunch of questions about your experience.

58
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:56,370
Do you feel safe in your neighborhood? Do you feed you? Do you hear gunshots in your neighborhood?

59
00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:00,150
Do you see people dealing drugs in your neighborhood? All of those things might predict gun violence.

60
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:04,050
I might ask or ask more, but also ask you about your own personal experiences.

61
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:08,760
Do you have any have you ever behaved in an aggressive way?

62
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:12,540
How do you like to respond to conflict? Do you observe conflict within your home?

63
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:17,340
I might also ask about some of the individuals that are in your life.

64
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:21,720
Do you have interactions with the police? Do your friends stay out late?

65
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:26,430
Do they do drugs, etc.? All of those things might predict gun violence.

66
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:32,700
They're probably all associated in one way or another, whether or not someone's likely to a perpetrator be a victim of gun violence.

67
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:36,389
But what's your kind of what Heather sort of distinguishes?

68
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:40,530
Well, you have kind of like these community aims, but then you also have these kind of individual aims.

69
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:45,810
And then maybe there are also some that are related to kind of police engagement or some other sort of dimension.

70
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:50,010
That's what factor analysis can do for us. We have, let's say, 12 items.

71
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:56,340
We think that there are three kind of underlying facets of what might be predicting gun violence.

72
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:01,470
Can we use a factor analysis to say, yeah, it turns out that those items that are all about your neighborhood,

73
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:05,340
they tend to be a little bit more highly correlated. They represent a factor.

74
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:10,950
And then we also have some individual risk factors, and then we have some structural risk factors or whatever you want to say or interpersonal ones.

75
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:17,219
We can then instead of again using the 12 items or ten items or however many, we now have three constructs.

76
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:22,170
We create little mean scale. This is my mean score for community violence.

77
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,549
And does that predict gun violence a little bit better using, for example,

78
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:31,860
standardized regression coefficients than some of the individual predictors that we can give you here?

79
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:36,660
Yeah, let's let me just kind of like the big out of it.

80
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:44,250
Just from listening to this, it sounds like having a theory first is really helpful going into this factor analysis.

81
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:49,709
And it also sounds like you could do the factor analysis without theory, but is ultimately do you want theory before going to.

82
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:53,970
We need to know what that point and why. There are two different types of spectrum, as we talked about.

83
00:07:53,970 --> 00:08:01,680
Do you remember were there? I was not here. Last that I've seen in the video, it was in the video, if I remember two different types.

84
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:11,940
And they're really just different in name. Yes, a CFA exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis.

85
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:16,739
Literally just semantics. But the distinction is an exploratory factor.

86
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:22,799
Analysis is you have a bunch of items and we're trying to think, okay, do we see any dimensions or anything are pop out of this?

87
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,900
We're going to take an empirical approach. Let's just see what the data kind of tells us and then we're going to post-hoc

88
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:31,740
kind of make an idea or a decision about what those different factors represent.

89
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:36,750
Contrast that with Heather's example, where she has some very specific ideas about, well,

90
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:41,430
gun violence has community factors, it has individual factors, and it has some interpersonal factors.

91
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,839
So we're kind of flipping the script in terms of how we're testing things when we believe

92
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:52,500
we're trying to confirm a theory or versus when we're just trying to figure out first.

93
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,150
We have a whole ton of items.

94
00:08:54,390 --> 00:09:00,000
We think it's possible because a computer can find some of these correlations that we might not have otherwise recognize.

95
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:08,220
If you give somebody a battery of 55 items, it might be hard to think of a priority.

96
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,020
These are the ones that are going to group together.

97
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:18,540
But we could use a factor analysis to say, okay, well look, items one, 12, 15 and 22 or 328 all seem to group together.

98
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:23,429
Let's look at what those items are and figure out for any measuring something similar.

99
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:26,910
Are they measuring the same thing? That could be what we label as the factors.

100
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:36,990
So thank you for saying so then you're kind of like coding, you know, like qualitative methods to your coding themes with like people's answers.

101
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:41,940
Is that really similar? So this is great meeting you two questions here.

102
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:49,860
So these are just from a colleague of mine. I was no longer at the university, but she asked this question, are these questions?

103
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:54,329
How many are there? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. She has eight questions.

104
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:59,250
Do a whole bunch of people ten years. Students ten school up and around basic.

105
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:18,790
Okay. What does she measure? So for yeah ever since our self-worth in importance in environmental work I think it's.

106
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:34,840
You're in the ballpark, for sure. My. Do you see any distinctions between whatever Collins says, blue and purple, whatever color.

107
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:40,870
These are grapes. School Girls Union.

108
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:50,370
So, yes, you know, Amy, we had there is something about the sense of worth or what Karissa calls mattering.

109
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:55,440
Do you feel like you matter to the people in your respective communities?

110
00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:00,899
Heather noted that there do seem to be some items that are specifically focused on school

111
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:04,350
and whether you managed your school context and those that are focused on your community.

112
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:10,050
They would have never seen this kind of breakdown. They would have all been in kind of in a different sort of order.

113
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,520
They responded to them all.

114
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:20,490
And what Karissa was trying to figure out is go do these different items, break down into something that is kind of theoretically meaningful.

115
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:25,350
One you all 18 items seem to more or less correlate together.

116
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:29,760
Is the reliability for these 18 items sort of high?

117
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:35,970
Right. Reliability means my ringing bells here at least.

118
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:44,160
Right. That's like kind of inter item correlation. If you tend to say yes to some of these items, you tend to say yes to all the other ones, too.

119
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:47,970
I think he's meant to say no to some of these items. You tend to say no to all the other ones as well.

120
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:53,760
Right. That's a way to build a highly reliable scale, to use factor analysis, to figure out.

121
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:59,010
Not only do people kind of do deal all these mattering items sort of grouped together,

122
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:07,620
but can we find these underlying dimensions where people distinguish those which are about my school and those which are about my community,

123
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:13,320
which I think is kind of cool. And she completely made herself she completely made this up.

124
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:22,980
There was she took some of these mattering items from a scale that was developed for work, and she translated them to school community context.

125
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:30,270
So this was nothing. This was a whole bunch of items that she reworded to kind of put this where, you know, school and community in there.

126
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:36,000
And then she was seeing empirically from the data, do we in fact see these sort of things sort of a one?

127
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:44,180
Do we get nice high factor loadings for add one factor that's related to school, nice high loadings for another factor related to community.

128
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:49,140
And does does that map on to the way that we theoretically predicted things are going to happen?

129
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:54,420
Well, here it is. Here the results. So what I want you to do is turn to partner.

130
00:12:55,350 --> 00:13:04,530
Now, I want you take a nice, long, long look at this thing. And if you can enhance my favorite line from this class, if you can figure out this slide,

131
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,880
you know, actually this slide, we're going to need to shift.

132
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:13,950
So please turn on later her friend and just look through here.

133
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:20,230
You have an idea what factor analysis is helpful. You have an idea what reliability is and tell me what you see.

134
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:26,850
This data, there's a lot of important information here and I might ask you a bunch of questions about it to take a moment and talk to your friend.

135
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:55,080
There's good stuff right here. The measurement stuff. Made it up.

136
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:59,159
Just made this up. 400 kids. 400 kids.

137
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,230
And look at some of these results. This is this is impressive stuff.

138
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:06,570
Why is why do I think this is so impressive? Why was this a passable dissertation?

139
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:29,700
You know. For something.

140
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:44,220
What's happening is we're talking scale analysis today.

141
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:50,660
You know, you are finding a friend and we want you to look at a table that's like,

142
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:56,770
oh, I want to know more, which is the best perception for that sort of person.

143
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:23,990
But it's interesting, as soon as a draft offers that, it's just, you know, oh, I didn't know how to deal with that.

144
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:33,460
I've got to go. Seriously.

145
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:38,750
Health care.

146
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:49,870
Yeah. Has been.

147
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:03,879
And then. And this line is up on canvas.

148
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:08,280
If I call this the high energy.

149
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:46,290
So. She up these categories.

150
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,580
So. She just.

151
00:16:51,970 --> 00:17:02,660
So much of this type of. And that's a fairly distinct threat to.

152
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:15,630
That's wonderful. Is it just a good word for you?

153
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:23,740
Yeah. You know, one of the things that happened this morning with us.

154
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:29,250
We wanted to try something that I had, something I wanted to do.

155
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:47,720
So basically, it's be one of your ideas about some of the items in the monograph and.

156
00:17:49,120 --> 00:18:05,880
And so I think that I think that we need to begin to have also that impact because the correlation is so right.

157
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:10,450
And then the same thing in our oversight, because I think it's a serious.

158
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:19,400
And all the devices that challenge this relationship to create.

159
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:30,010
His business relationship to the Prime Minister, Mr. Ford.

160
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:38,590
So I think you will have 5 minutes. You want a little bit more time to the time.

161
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:42,040
We're ready. We're ready. One more time.

162
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:49,760
Hands up already to the right and have one more minute.

163
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:56,080
Then we want to. Last year, the U.S.

164
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:20,380
And. Okay.

165
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:23,670
That's not the kind of behavior we're.

166
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:48,040
This man. And for a third time.

167
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:53,829
All right. I'm very interested to see what people think about this data and what's going to be it just one more time.

168
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:59,200
If you saw all of these 18 items together, there's not a lot of games, you know,

169
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,790
I've broken this down into, you know, that I don't do any arrangement here.

170
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:11,170
There's a lot of similar wording in some of these items. Some of them some of it's based kind of on community, somewhat school.

171
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:15,100
But there's also even kind of between like, you know, this needs my community needs in my school.

172
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,490
How would you categorize all these different items? All right.

173
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:21,880
So who's up first? How many factors are there, first of all?

174
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:29,360
Everybody's going to get questions that raise your hands, dare you say, due to various idealistic factors.

175
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:34,140
Uh, there's like two different groupings of. Right.

176
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:40,460
Do we have to have two factors all the time? No, no.

177
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:42,800
We could try a lot of different factors solutions.

178
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:51,050
In fact, it's probably better to try more than just one solution, even though we might think that there is just two factors in our data.

179
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:56,989
One for school, one for community. It probably makes sense to test all factor like a single factor compared to one.

180
00:20:56,990 --> 00:21:00,640
That has two factors because there are some similarity between ideas.

181
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:06,800
I can say there there might be nine factors here. Right? One that's related to people my value.

182
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:10,220
One that's related to the needs in my community. Right.

183
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:13,579
Looking for that similar language so we can use factor analysis.

184
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:19,700
We can compare across models with different numbers of factors to see which fits the data that fits.

185
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:24,500
So don't just start with the one that you think is right. So you can start with that one.

186
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,560
But then think about some other conceptualizations to see and compare.

187
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:34,040
Excellent. Let's keep going. What items? One of the highest on factor one hands.

188
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:39,780
Nice. And I had a an important part of my.

189
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:46,160
How do you know that? Just like 944 plus the second time to one.

190
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:50,149
Yeah. And what how would you describe it? What does that mean?

191
00:21:50,150 --> 00:22:05,260
It's got a high loading, it's .94. Although it's not technically actually.

192
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:08,980
Do they buy one? How would you how would you kind of interpret that going on for.

193
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:23,120
It's easy for designed to do research on the correlation between that and climate variables like that.

194
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:29,660
Yeah, exactly. That that's not technically technically accurate, but it's that's the way I describe it, too.

195
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:35,810
You can kind of think of this as the correlation with this specific item, with this underlying factor.

196
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:40,070
Right. You can also think of it as anything that is going to be really higher.

197
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,240
Close to one is very representative of that underlying factor.

198
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:52,550
So but whatever we kind of want to call this factor, we have this item really kind of captures it.

199
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:56,550
Right. All of these items are kind of related to factor one.

200
00:22:57,110 --> 00:23:03,170
This one seems to be the most highly related general the that that one is.

201
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:08,840
But the point then for one is the most related to the other ones in the group.

202
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,270
Or is it just. Yeah.

203
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:19,800
I mean, what's really kind of happening behind the scenes here is we're looking at kind of the the the nature item correlation across all of these.

204
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:23,660
I guess would it be technically it's all 18, but it's really.

205
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:29,090
Yes. The kind of the interact and correlations across these and how closely they kind of tailor every cluster together.

206
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:36,140
So it's almost a measure of reliability if you were to take these these 1980s together.

207
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:49,690
Questions about that. One.

208
00:23:53,740 --> 00:24:04,100
Writer and do it and will load clearly on both ends up nice enough okay Katie so that I can

209
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:12,570
help move things in my school and and which way in which you might want to put this one right.

210
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:19,680
So ideally, we want to see items that load on all factor and a factor only.

211
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:24,149
Right. That this item is clearly representative of fact.

212
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:29,820
We want not so much a factor to this and I feel I help meet the needs of my school.

213
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:37,140
There's some ambiguity there because it's kind of related to or representative of both factors.

214
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:42,480
And so if I'm trying to figure out, like, what am I going to call factor one and what am I going to call factor two?

215
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:49,380
What do they really represent? An item like I feel I help meet the needs of my school doesn't discriminate very well.

216
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:53,040
We want an item to say clearly. Oh, wow. Yeah. Your factor.

217
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:58,290
One enough factor to your factor one definitely not a factor to you.

218
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:01,380
On the other hand, are definitely factor to not factor one.

219
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:06,900
Right? Those are the items we like because again, that helps us kind of group them together and say,

220
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:16,470
all right, what are we really talking about with Factor one here? I'm going to ask that question just as Jackie O.

221
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:40,530
Yeah. Is that his version? Only one percentage up there.

222
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:46,830
I suppose if you want to choose from what is the what percentage of the common factor variance factor to explain.

223
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,090
10.63. Yeah. So it's, it's it's this one right here.

224
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:08,110
So you can imagine that these items or any of these factors, if everybody kind of has a value of a factor kind of within them, right?

225
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:14,500
There's going to be some variability across people and there's going to be some variability in terms of how the items load on a given factor,

226
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:22,810
where these percentage of variance explain measure sort of mean is like how much of that total variability can a factor explain?

227
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:32,410
If we have a factor solution that explains 100% of the variability, that means we can kind of explain how all of these items are sort of interrelated.

228
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:36,970
Right? So what this is telling us is that a two factor solution,

229
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:44,200
just this first factor alone helps explain about 60% of the way that people respond across all these different items.

230
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:51,040
Right. By kind of having this entire kind of conceptualization or all these factor loadings,

231
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:57,250
we can explain about 60% of how people respond across these items.

232
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:06,850
By adding a second factor, we can explain an additional about 10% of the variability.

233
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:14,950
If we ran a single factor solution, this number might go up or down a little bit, but it would still probably hang around 60%.

234
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:22,840
Right. And the goal is to explain as much of the variability kind of across items as possible.

235
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:27,020
We want to understand how these items all sort of correlate together.

236
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:30,139
And if you watch that video, what this really boils down to,

237
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:39,969
which is really boils down to is a giant correlation matrix with 18 rows and 18 columns and all of those little correlations,

238
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:42,970
those bivariate correlations in between. Right.

239
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:50,170
It's looking for the patterns, it's looking for the clusters, and it's trying to explain as much of those patterns in clustering as possible.

240
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:56,049
And again, because we can choose to have one, two all the way up to 70.

241
00:27:56,050 --> 00:28:02,800
But yeah, depending on the kind of the approach you use all the way up to 17 factors,

242
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:14,260
we're trying to find a balance between the number of factors and kind of variability explained questions about that and that's a little trickier.

243
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:19,209
One more just the name of the game typically tends to be the more variance I can explain,

244
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:26,280
the better the the fewer number of factors in my solution to explain the most amount of variability the best, right?

245
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:30,100
So you're kind of maximizing the interpretable factors.

246
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:35,920
And clearly this is factor one. Clearly this is factor two relative to how much variability exponent I front.

247
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:43,960
So you said that the variance in the first factor should stay at around that 61%.

248
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:48,610
What happens if you're for some reason getting like a huge drop in variance?

249
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:53,840
Does that mean that the factor two is. I know you will.

250
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:59,540
It's like regression. Adding factors is only going to explain more variability.

251
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:05,360
What you might find is that you get a new factor that explains 1% of the variability or something like that.

252
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:10,250
So by default, you're you're going to be at the same level or more.

253
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:22,730
Shh. We've got.

254
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:31,960
Or saying, yes. Well, you know, that is that's a crime. Yeah.

255
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:35,360
Yeah. And we want it to be above 28.

256
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:39,140
Yeah, exactly. So based on this factor analysis,

257
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:44,899
we're kind of seeing that these nine items all load on that same first back these

258
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:49,160
bottom nine items to seem like they're more or less loading on this second factor.

259
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:53,090
I can use that to say I'm going to separate these two.

260
00:29:53,600 --> 00:30:00,590
Instead of thinking about all 18 items together, I'm going to take my nine items that are focused on these,

261
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:05,480
and I take my items that are here and I'm going to create scales.

262
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:09,470
And this is something that we do fairly frequently based on our factor analysis.

263
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:13,010
Can we create some form of summary measure based on this?

264
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:17,450
I get the results here. I'm going to create a mean score or some score, whatever else it is.

265
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:23,840
And once I have a new scale, instead of using all 18 items, I have one that just has nine items.

266
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:30,860
I can run my reliability analysis, and that's basically a measure of the average third item correlation.

267
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,290
Take every single item correlated with all the other nine or eight items in the scale.

268
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:41,000
And on average, is that is that a higher correlation or lower information?

269
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:49,670
That's what this measure this measure means, Claire, is interpretations even easier if this reliability measure is above point eight?

270
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:53,330
It means that these things tend to assess the same thing.

271
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:56,990
They tend to go together. That's what we want.

272
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:02,330
If we were using energy, Campbell, from earlier, we'd have those three or four community items.

273
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:03,950
We have those three or four individual items.

274
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:10,490
We can run a reliability analysis of those four community items, hoping to see a value like this or like this.

275
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,120
That tells us those four items kind of belong together. They travel together.

276
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:18,020
They're related to each other. Yeah.

277
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:34,900
This was up in Bay City. How about this question? We're not heard from here.

278
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:38,830
Amy, I'm guessing.

279
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:44,080
Yes. No, no. Reliability is sample specific.

280
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:46,599
I would just underscore that again and again, if you would,

281
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:53,590
if you took another 326 people or whatever it is from from bases, still rewriting reliability analysis.

282
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:57,700
Okay. It is sample specifics depending on who is responding to these items.

283
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:06,190
Evidence of factor rotation of the lake.

284
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:11,230
Could you share? I don't know. Do you remember what the rotation does or what it's for?

285
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,990
Katie does very, very well. Yes.

286
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:26,640
Oh, and I well, I kind of know is that it simplifies doesn't the rotation simplify data so it'll kind of reorient it in scale.

287
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:33,720
Yeah. So it's a bit of a sleight of hand without actually changing any sort of relationships across these different items.

288
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:38,130
It kind of changes the access to make things a little bit more interpretable.

289
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:43,980
So this has probably I am just kind of looking at it.

290
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:48,809
You can tell that there's probably been a rotation here because it's pretty clear that

291
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:53,730
we have these nine items that are all really highly low and loaded on one factor,

292
00:32:54,420 --> 00:33:00,450
but then not at all loaded on another factor. If you look at raw data and you run a factor analysis,

293
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:08,430
more often than not you get items like this that are loading on multiple factors because that's an issue.

294
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:12,780
We use different types of rotation orthogonal, horribly,

295
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:19,770
whether we think that there are factors or correlated with each other or not to make our results a little bit more interpretable.

296
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:24,750
And usually the goal is to have items load on one factor and one factor.

297
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:32,460
That's really been the benefit of rotating two things. Again, it doesn't change things like the variance explained.

298
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,170
That won't be any different.

299
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:41,130
It's really just for us to kind of get a cleaner view of, okay, when I'm talking about my ideas are valued by people in my community.

300
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:44,530
Am I talking about fact or what am I talking about? Factor to factor.

301
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:51,630
Factor one. Unambiguous. Right. I think that's what we're shooting for.

302
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:57,990
And we see something similar down here. The rotation happens across the entire data set.

303
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:02,460
Right? So every single one of these 18 items gets rotated.

304
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:04,440
If we had a four factor solution,

305
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:11,660
it would be doing the same thing with the hope that we'd have items that load on one of the four factors and not others.

306
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:20,180
Right. So it's just a it's just a tool for us to use to help make it a little more straightforward to interpret.

307
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:28,170
Questions about this. This is one of the sticking points. It's not something you have to do.

308
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:33,030
But the more you do this, it's going to be something that you wanted to because you'll see how much easier it is to work with.

309
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:39,920
Q Thank you. Have a question? I kind of do, and I'm sure you have more questions.

310
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:50,510
So basically you're seeing which factor has the highest value, and then any other factor that has a lower value,

311
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:57,570
you're just putting them side by side and being like, look, this like factor one has a really high quality value with this phrase.

312
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:02,129
So I put that language here. You're talking about the items in there, factor loadings.

313
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:08,760
Yes. Right. So we want factor loadings that are high on one factor only and then lower on any other factors.

314
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:11,370
Okay. Yeah. So that that's what we're trying to do.

315
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:16,650
I probably if I was smart enough, I would have put the on rotated solution on here and then the rotated one.

316
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:23,309
But again, if we saw an on rotate solution, you probably would see a lot more kind of mid-range values like point four,

317
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:27,870
2.7, and you'd see higher loadings on that second factor.

318
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,530
Actually, I think I do have an on rotating solution on the later in the slide.

319
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:40,760
So this is something that you do post hoc or you can build it right into your analysis.

320
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:45,560
And again, it's all hoping to get like, oh yeah, these nine items really do go here.

321
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:50,120
And these nine items don't answer. Forget that I've done this work for you.

322
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:56,690
If you ask these 18 items in different orders, you'd see all these factor loadings in a different order.

323
00:35:57,350 --> 00:36:03,200
And it might not be quite so clear to you that this belongs with this, which belongs with that, but not with that or something.

324
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:11,780
Right? So I've kind of put these all in a way that's kind of interpretable, but that's part of our job as we review some of these results.

325
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:20,420
These are pretty clean. They're not always going to be something extra credit for them, but it can answer this one.

326
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:41,240
So simplifying just a smidge. But imagine you responded to all these 18 items.

327
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:49,670
We can think about your factor to score this value, which we haven't we haven't named quite yet.

328
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:57,830
This last and I can take your score for each one of these items and multiply it by its factor loadings kind of across all 18.

329
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:08,660
Think about like a regression equation where f two is your outcome variable and these are all your predictor variables or your beta coefficients.

330
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:21,770
We multiply your score by its coefficient all the way down, we add it all up, and that gets your factor to score.

331
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:32,750
The reason why I think this is an important exercise to understand is that whether we're talking about your factor to score or your factor one,

332
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:37,760
we are taking information from all 18 items,

333
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:47,000
even though your Factor two has all these higher loadings with these nine items down here,

334
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:52,850
we still we still take this information into account as well.

335
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:56,840
But look at the weights when I multiply here.

336
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:00,590
I mean, one of these they're probably like, I agree to strongly disagree or whatever, right?

337
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:09,110
So it's like a scale of 1 to 5 or 1 to 7. If you say six to all of these items, you multiply six by .72.

338
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:15,590
That's a lot bigger than if we multiply six by negative point or one, right?

339
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:23,059
So when we're trying to assess or come up with this underlying thing about you and I bet you have an idea what Factor two represents,

340
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:33,590
I bet you to do whether it's intuitive or not, this item gets weighted way less, way less than this one.

341
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:37,490
It's not zero, but it's also quite a bit less.

342
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:42,980
So I think that's really important to remember that when we do a factor, solution like this,

343
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:47,780
even though we're trying to demarcate and say These belong to this factor and these belong to this factor,

344
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:51,920
we still take the entirety of the information into account. All right.

345
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:58,190
And so you can think about these again as kind of those beta weights that we multiply somebody's score by to calculate.

346
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:03,410
At the end of the day, somebody's expected to score. And if I calculated your factor to score, that also means you have to factor one score.

347
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:09,590
And we can use those two factor scores to predict things or to try to predict those things.

348
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:16,930
And now my last question, your question about that. Because I think we're at my last question.

349
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:22,030
This is cool. This is kind of made it up.

350
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:28,120
You made it up. Took some guidance from something about work at 363 students,

351
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:36,459
ran an analysis and now has a name for this that we can then multiply all these factor weights and get somebodies underlying dimension,

352
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:43,600
their construct, which we call. Huh?

353
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:48,319
I see what school mattering like. How much do it?

354
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,930
How much does know the people? My school community care about me.

355
00:39:51,950 --> 00:40:00,410
I can utilize this data in a way that's so different than if we just took these nine items that all have the name school in them,

356
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:05,570
added them all up and divided by nine, which is kind of what we did earlier in the semester.

357
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:12,440
And that's okay. We could take a mean score. That's a nice summary measure, but look at how much more nuance this one's going to be.

358
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:18,440
We now know that when we talk about how much might I mean to my school community,

359
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:31,160
answering this question has a little bit more import than answering this question to know whether or not I feel like I matter in my school.

360
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:39,020
But whatever it is you got to have is it is what this construct is tells us more about that construct, as you might imagine.

361
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:42,500
Then I feel I help meet the needs of people in my school,

362
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:50,000
and you can think through all of these different factor loadings to kind of look at their relative contribution to somebodies.

363
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:57,020
Does my school give a crap about me? And then because we part of me included as part of the analysis,

364
00:40:57,350 --> 00:41:03,049
we can see that there's just a minor contribution of how people feel about their broader

365
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:08,450
community that's still belongs or still contributes information to my school map.

366
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:17,600
That's cool stuff. I don't care who you are. I think that's pretty damn interesting and really applicable because you can start to tease out.

367
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:23,210
So if I had to ask five questions about whether you matter for your school, which five would you choose?

368
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:29,500
I heard what he said. And I said, well, all right.

369
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:33,340
You're talking just the ones that most. Absolutely.

370
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:36,729
So let's drop this one in this boat. I feel I meet the needs of people in my school.

371
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:40,510
That's not where our our effect is not capturing that particular data.

372
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:45,430
Well, but if we can ask this one and we can ask this one and this one.

373
00:41:45,610 --> 00:41:50,170
Right. Those are the ones that are really the essence of what this new factor is all about.

374
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:53,980
And if you wait, didn't even exist before we ran this analysis.

375
00:41:54,220 --> 00:42:07,180
What I say to you when you say drop the item, does that mean when you read in your analysis about,

376
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:12,129
yeah, we could do that, it it's completely appropriate to try it so we can say,

377
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:19,060
hey, look, based on my analysis, one, I'm drafting all nine of these things because that's not what school Mandarin is all about also.

378
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:23,560
Well, so this one, I'm not so sure it's what school Mandarin is all about either.

379
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:28,510
So what I'm gonna do is I'm going to drop it out of my analysis. I now have eight measures for school mattering.

380
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:33,700
I can either run to reliability and see how I'm doing right.

381
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:39,940
See if my if it's still high, if it's point nine, I have my eight ones that are kind of theoretically related to each other.

382
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:43,840
I now have some empirical evidence for I'm going to go with my my eight.

383
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:50,200
I could if I wanted to be really conservative, I could be run a factor analysis and see whether or not this is a one factor

384
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:54,189
solution with just those eight items or do are there actually is or even a little

385
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:58,120
sub construct in there that I have to worry about because maybe some of these

386
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:03,190
items that load pretty highly together cluster in their own unique way as well.

387
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:11,850
Like is it, you know, some of these are about like how did people perceive me and others are about how I feel I'm perceived right now.

388
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:16,030
I mean, just maybe that perspective makes a difference in terms of how the scale kind of manifests.

389
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:23,800
So that's completely up to you are kind of a great question because you have all the authority in the world to say,

390
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:27,400
I'm stopping here based on my data or I'm going to keep going.

391
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:31,180
So that's what's going to make it is it's really neat.

392
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:38,640
And you mentioned the fact that this just kind of appears I don't know where I love this and that's a new thing.

393
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:39,819
She actually uses it, right?

394
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:46,840
So you mean she ran as I wrote a whole paper trail replicated use these that use those specific skills to run some analysis and lo and behold,

395
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:50,470
they were related to some positive things or some negative things in the way that we might expect.

396
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:56,380
Very cool questions about all of this.

397
00:43:58,290 --> 00:44:04,010
Yeah. I'm sorry Speaker, but would you then do something with back to you're like, oh,

398
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:13,290
those tend to be grouped together and can I have some type of contraction instead of just the small stuff in your head, you know.

399
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:16,980
Yeah. What is factor one? Nice and loud. Yeah, that's community matter.

400
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:20,129
So what I would do, I would create a community matter scale.

401
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:24,090
I'd create a school mattering scale. I'd run my my office.

402
00:44:24,810 --> 00:44:27,840
I'd have to make a decision about this one down here.

403
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:32,430
But the alpha is already so, so high. I'm not too worried about it.

404
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:37,140
So I just go about my merry way, throw these these scales into my analysis.

405
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:40,590
Instead of having to have 18 separate regression coefficients.

406
00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:44,010
Remember those degrees of freedom? I just have to have two measures.

407
00:44:45,090 --> 00:44:48,090
They're nice and continuous now because instead of being like 1 to 5,

408
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:54,180
they now range anywhere from 1 to 5, but with a whole bunch of inner intermediate values.

409
00:44:55,320 --> 00:45:02,940
I can check the distribution of these. I could, uh, I could get correlations with the bivariate correlations.

410
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:07,710
I could treat this as an outcome. I could treat this as a, a predictor variable.

411
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:16,770
And that's if I take the items or if I take the items and I add them on average,

412
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:20,370
then together using these command or something like that, that's one way I can do it.

413
00:45:20,370 --> 00:45:22,080
And that's probably the way I do it the most.

414
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:29,460
Based on a result like this, if you wanted, and I think I can in the homework assignment, I think this is like a challenge problem.

415
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:35,160
When you run a factor analysis, it will save these factors scores for you.

416
00:45:35,610 --> 00:45:44,040
So it will calculate it, which is a just a I mean, a more nuanced way of integrating information across all of the items.

417
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:54,870
The reason I would maybe consider that is if you believe that there's this overarching what we'll call higher order construct of mattering,

418
00:45:55,800 --> 00:46:03,990
like how much you matter is something that we all have within insights, but that's subdivided into two different facets.

419
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:08,490
One, it's about how much you matter in your community. One, it's about how much you matter in your school.

420
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:16,170
If you still want to keep that higher order construct as part of your conceptual model or how you think things relate to each other,

421
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:24,300
that's when perhaps me using these factor scores makes a little bit more sense because it does contribute this information,

422
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:31,230
albeit just kind of a little bit. So that's also a decision that you get to make in thinking through.

423
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:34,380
Even then that factor structure mattering.

424
00:46:34,890 --> 00:46:36,060
How much I matter to people,

425
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:43,410
is it really just the community is really just the school or there are some domains or facets that are that are probably not captured.

426
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:49,709
Now, I couldn't test that because I don't have the data, but maybe the next time I also go to my work and I say,

427
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:55,500
how much do I matter to the people that I work with or how much do I matter to the people in my family life or something or to my friends?

428
00:46:56,070 --> 00:47:02,910
So this is just building blocks of evidence to take some of these ideas and seeing if they kind of pan out within our data.

429
00:47:07,330 --> 00:47:14,990
Questions. Comments. Concerns. Yeah.

430
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:21,720
For the alphas. If it's about me or feeling safe.

431
00:47:21,730 --> 00:47:28,990
But if. What? If it's like, right at 0.8 or maybe 0.1 or 0.79?

432
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:34,540
Are we is that when we're more concerned about removing that one item?

433
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:44,920
So the nice thing about some of the the alpha commands that we have, we can ask what happens to the different scales when items get removed.

434
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:53,860
So as part of the output, you can request, for example, if I run an alpha with these eight items, what happens when I remove a given item?

435
00:47:54,070 --> 00:47:57,940
It would be the same thing as actually just running an alpha with atoms instead of all nine.

436
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:02,770
And it just does this before you behind the scenes. It allows you to make some of those decisions.

437
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:07,149
And the big question would be, do we see either a big drop or a big gain?

438
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:14,410
And also, when we subtract one specific item now, all things being equal, if the core of the item correlation,

439
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:22,660
which again is what this reliability coefficient represents, if that stays the same, the more the items, the better off.

440
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:29,440
So if your scale with three items has a crappy alpha, one way to get around this would be to add two more ends.

441
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:34,450
And generally speaking, if they are kind of related to each other, your health is going to go up.

442
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:39,940
That's not always going to be possible, depending on what kind of data we've collected and how far along we are in the process.

443
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:48,850
But that's a good rule of thumb. If you, for whatever reason, don't want to have a nine item scale, that's a lot of things for people to respond to.

444
00:48:49,270 --> 00:48:56,980
You could look to see, Well, if I dropped three of them and my alpha goes from .89, 2.79, maybe that's close enough for you.

445
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:01,330
I'll tell you your little secret. I got a journal to accept, like a 0.65.

446
00:49:02,350 --> 00:49:05,830
It's not great. I think we made a case for why it was so low.

447
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:09,820
There's only two items, and if it had been friends or something, it would've been a lot higher.

448
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:17,530
We thought theoretically made sense. So it becomes more of a can you justify the decisions that you're making based on the values you have?

449
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:36,510
Other questions. Now I understand it's a bit of a leap to go from understanding this to actually running an ad practice.

450
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:46,020
But the running part isn't terrible because it follows a similar form of setup as we would do with the multiple regression.

451
00:49:46,770 --> 00:49:50,099
Okay. So I'm happy. I think we can definitely spend some time writing.

452
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:52,350
My folks do this on our own for the last 35 minutes.

453
00:49:52,950 --> 00:49:59,130
But if you can answer these questions and I know I asked everybody was our question, then I think we're in really good shape.

454
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:05,130
There it is that you're not quite as sure about. You know, as you know, we talked about after class, you can ask questions.

455
00:50:06,610 --> 00:50:13,740
I just I know that in the video you mentioned that you have your verbal selections for rotations.

456
00:50:14,370 --> 00:50:23,250
And I wasn't sure if that's something that eventually will make that call on our own what we like best or if you just find that.

457
00:50:23,490 --> 00:50:27,180
And so if you pick their max in Promax and you just find them less.

458
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:35,990
They're just the standard ones, the most popular. So the decisions that we make about factor analysis, starting with extraction,

459
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:43,580
they all have really the same purpose, but they are just kind of slightly different utilities.

460
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:50,390
So whether you use a different form of extraction should not change your results too much.

461
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:57,740
Similarly, when we get to the rotation piece, you shouldn't change your Twitter results too much if you choose a different form of rotation.

462
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:07,190
So if all of a sudden your crappy data turn into beautiful data because you selected a different form of rotation that scratch my right side,

463
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:09,860
I mean, you would ideally not see major, major changes.

464
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:16,970
But if you can make an argument about why you've approached your data, you know, following some of these guidelines,

465
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:20,930
I almost always use maximum likelihood just because I'm the more familiar with it.

466
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:23,179
But, you know,

467
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:30,610
you can make a case for why you feel this might be make more sense for you like you're trying to figure out like additional contributions.

468
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:34,970
Maybe that's the kind of question that you're asking as you either add users or something like that,

469
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:38,390
but it really becomes more of the analysts choice.

470
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:48,410
Yeah, about 35 minutes left. You want to go through an example with me or do you want to try to go through the lab example on your own?

471
00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:53,570
Where do folks feel would be the best use of your time? Yeah.

472
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:57,459
Yeah. All right. All right.

473
00:51:57,460 --> 00:52:00,760
Well, if anybody wants a deal out of going to do that, you're welcome to.

474
00:52:01,030 --> 00:52:06,860
But I will. Obviously, we'll go do this together. Um, I like this one because there's, like, tapes.

475
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:11,770
I mean, how am I going to make sense of 20 different items together? I can take a look at them.

476
00:52:11,770 --> 00:52:15,910
So they're all in the code book and I can try to figure out what they mean. They're all related to pure influence, right?

477
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:24,129
Or point. Sometimes I want to calculate my alpha because I don't have any idea about how these

478
00:52:24,130 --> 00:52:29,050
27 age group together I'm going to run what we call an exploratory factor analysis.

479
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:34,930
Same thing as a confirmatory vector analysis, but because I'm a little bit different and we're going to have those results go through.

480
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:44,050
All right, folks, this I am doing here just to make my correlation matrix a little bit easier.

481
00:52:44,590 --> 00:52:49,960
If you recall, this core command is going to want data set up in a specific way.

482
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:57,250
So all I'm doing up here and I am recording this, all I'm doing up here is taking with my first data set,

483
00:52:57,580 --> 00:53:02,430
make a data frame that has all 27 items that's on the right.

484
00:53:02,450 --> 00:53:07,260
You can have you can have subset it or selected rows any way or columns anywhere that you wanted.

485
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:15,639
But that's all I'm doing here is I want a new little mini data frame that has all my own ends together, and that's just me being lazy.

486
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:21,700
So then when I run my correlation command, I can take the little dataframe that has all 27 items.

487
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:28,360
I do want to use this pairwise complete observations because if there's missing data across any of these items,

488
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:39,100
it's going to like in your world, take this and all you have to do is substitute in your own data set and your own aims.

489
00:53:39,850 --> 00:53:42,940
Good. The rest of it just keep the same.

490
00:53:43,030 --> 00:53:50,080
No need to reinvent. Honestly, this is going to give you a correlation matrix with 27 columns, 27 rows.

491
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:59,590
You can ask questions like this, which is basically whether or not we feel that there is on average some correlation across these items.

492
00:54:00,130 --> 00:54:05,470
The null hypothesis here is that if I looked at my correlation measures, just closing your eyes right now,

493
00:54:05,470 --> 00:54:12,840
does everybody know what a correlation matrix looks like and you picture in your head? That's not it.

494
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:23,760
Visualize it in your head. If that correlation matrix, all those columns and rows and a whole bunch of zeros in them, this would be nothing.

495
00:54:25,090 --> 00:54:32,070
It's basically testing the null hypothesis that there's at least some correlation across these items for a dataset our size.

496
00:54:32,550 --> 00:54:35,660
Probably not a necessary step. Good for you to know about,

497
00:54:36,270 --> 00:54:45,520
but we're going to find correlations because even small correlations across items when you get big samples tend to be significant determinant.

498
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:53,280
And I really wouldn't worry about this too much, but these are just kind of initial checks to say, are my data appropriate for a factor analysis?

499
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:55,980
I visually examine the correlation matrix.

500
00:54:56,520 --> 00:55:02,910
I can run a Bartlet's test to say is there are there or is that correlation matrix really just populated with a bunch of zeros?

501
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:11,160
And there's the determinant, which is the way that we are going to restructure the data matrix to to relate the items to each other.

502
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:14,970
Is it greater than some very, very, very small that.

503
00:55:15,510 --> 00:55:26,370
Right. So if this was not significant, if this was below 0000.1, consider whether or not factor analysis is the right thing to do here.

504
00:55:26,970 --> 00:55:30,390
If the correlations are all over the place, most they're would kind of close to zero.

505
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:37,110
Also, maybe not a great use for factor analysis when alpha.

506
00:55:38,250 --> 00:55:43,920
One of the things that we need to be aware of is that all the items should be coded in the same direction.

507
00:55:44,470 --> 00:55:47,580
I will repeat that because folks will make that mistake.

508
00:55:48,150 --> 00:55:54,090
Your alpha is affected. If you have items that are some positively coded and some are negatively code.

509
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:59,970
All right. Factor analysis won't care. Reliability analysis very much does.

510
00:56:00,850 --> 00:56:05,550
So all these items are about my friends. Go out and have fun.

511
00:56:05,910 --> 00:56:09,900
Strongly agree. My friends like. Very strongly agree.

512
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:14,460
My friends do not like to have alcohol and other drugs.

513
00:56:16,170 --> 00:56:20,190
Strongly agree means something very different. So in that correlation matrix,

514
00:56:20,190 --> 00:56:28,340
you're looking for any clear negative associations and we want to recall the names that I run, my own reliability analysis.

515
00:56:28,350 --> 00:56:35,490
I mean, tell me, is my or my 27 items reliable? How do you know this situation is?

516
00:56:36,330 --> 00:56:47,400
What do you see? And we look at the 11 over 20 careful also tells us this was your question what happens to our alpha level if we drop a given name?

517
00:56:48,150 --> 00:56:54,780
Some of them are actually going to be a little bit higher. So .84. Are we going to drop by is based on these alpha does this output.

518
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:58,320
Probably not because we're all I don't run a factor analysis anyways,

519
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:02,490
but you can see that small changes to this scale could result in a better outcome.

520
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:08,850
What we're really looking for is if there's a big, big change, like if I drop one item, this goes way down,

521
00:57:08,850 --> 00:57:14,070
or if I drop one item, it goes way, way up because that probably means one of the items just doesn't belong here.

522
00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:24,300
Okay, now these 27 items, it looks like we could just ask them all together and call one big scale, maybe take a mean scale called peer influence.

523
00:57:25,410 --> 00:57:31,260
Right. It doesn't have to be 27 items in my regression equation because all of these kind of grouped together.

524
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:36,390
Why don't we just take a somber, a mean of all 27 items called peer influence and we don't.

525
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:41,830
We should be done in 20 minutes. Back during this.

526
00:57:46,030 --> 00:57:49,350
We could. Good.

527
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:54,590
We're good. I mean, we. Seriously, it could be done. That might be enough.

528
00:57:56,090 --> 00:58:03,200
But we are going to see whether or not, for example, there are some subscales within our analysis.

529
00:58:03,830 --> 00:58:10,100
So I'm going to use I think in the first example I used what's called factor analysis.

530
00:58:10,370 --> 00:58:14,300
Principal components analysis is just another form of extraction.

531
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:18,290
I do not care whether use factor analysis or principal component analysis.

532
00:58:18,890 --> 00:58:23,240
This is only for explication if you like one versus the other.

533
00:58:25,390 --> 00:58:27,910
They should give you the same result or something very, very similar.

534
00:58:28,930 --> 00:58:32,860
But as I showed you the extraction methods and some of the distinguishing factors,

535
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:42,490
it deals with kind of what's happening behind the scenes principal components actually starts out with the 27 factor solution and works backwards.

536
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:47,530
Factor analysis starts out with a one factor solution and works forward again.

537
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:54,730
What might happen is that somewhere in those margins you start to make different, slightly different decisions, but ideally nothing too crazy.

538
00:58:55,570 --> 00:58:59,260
So when we do a one factor solution here, you can think of this as factor one.

539
00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:03,070
This is just principal component one exact same thing. Analogous meaning.

540
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:10,390
These are a factor of. Right on rotated solution, I think, at this point.

541
00:59:12,130 --> 00:59:21,370
Right. So when we were looking at those items a few slides ago, remember how they were all clearly .8.9 and 8.7?

542
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:25,960
We didn't get .18, 7.28, 10.4, 17.6.

543
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:30,040
Those doesn't matter in this case because how many factors are we are we testing here?

544
00:59:33,430 --> 00:59:36,880
27. One fact, one guy.

545
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:44,950
We have 27 items. We have 27 factor loadings, but we do not have we only have one factor.

546
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:53,470
Okay. What are the other ones? So this is a uniqueness, is it?

547
00:59:53,580 --> 01:00:00,450
It's kind of how much of the the items own variability is kind of explained by the factor.

548
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:10,390
So we want to know, I mean, essentially 97% of this items variance is not explained by the factor.

549
01:00:11,380 --> 01:00:15,860
So this kind of correlates pretty well with the like.

550
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:21,220
This is basically one almost no variability in whatever this item is is explained by our knowing factor.

551
01:00:21,790 --> 01:00:25,890
It's kind of a it's going to be it's going to reflect the factor.

552
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:31,420
And then you to plus two should equal your commonality.

553
01:00:36,670 --> 01:00:42,010
Okay. Maybe not super, super helpful, but we kind of get a sense of how these ideas are related to each other.

554
01:00:43,570 --> 01:00:51,610
Just like before we can figure out whether or not this is explaining some of the variability across these ends were explained by 26%.

555
01:00:52,330 --> 01:00:57,549
We want we can do better than that. Right. Our our factor clearly doesn't describe all of these items.

556
01:00:57,550 --> 01:01:01,210
Well, for these items, don't all clearly load on The Factor one.

557
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:07,670
Question So Ferrari, are you kind of following how I'm approaching us?

558
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:14,610
I would suggest you're doing something similar if I give you ten items and then in the midterm you start.

559
01:01:14,630 --> 01:01:18,470
Okay, well, let's run a reliability analysis. Let's think about a one factor solution.

560
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:22,880
Okay, I'll look at those results. But let's test a few fracture solution just in case.

561
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:28,280
Let's see whether or not my my ten items kind of grouped together by themselves or whether there should be two factors.

562
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:33,860
Another way, instead of just working sequentially up by testing one factor, two factor, three factor, etc.,

563
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:39,620
you can use what's called a screen plot screen as just the I guess it's like the dirt at the bottom of a mountain.

564
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:45,860
I've never used this term outside of the statistics class. What you're kind of doing is looking for an inflection point.

565
01:01:46,490 --> 01:01:59,060
So if there's a clear kind of turn or inflection, that kind of gives you an idea of how many factors might be within the data.

566
01:01:59,780 --> 01:02:06,620
This is more of kind of a rounded one, but at the very least, it looks like we can maybe test a one, two, three factor solution.

567
01:02:07,310 --> 01:02:11,990
But what we can see from this big drop off is that any additional factors are probably

568
01:02:11,990 --> 01:02:15,680
going to be explaining a little bit less variability kind of across those items.

569
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:18,860
The other thing you can look at is eigenvalues.

570
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:24,290
So if you want to try to figure out whether or not there's kind of an influx of where you want to call here,

571
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:35,210
inflection point eigenvalues greater than one suggest a factor that's explaining more than just an individual item.

572
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:40,760
So in principle component analysis, every item has an own value of one to start.

573
01:02:41,780 --> 01:02:48,590
Factors that explain or have eigenvalues greater than one suggests that they're explaining more than just an item's variability.

574
01:02:50,210 --> 01:02:58,520
So this one here, 7 to 1.7, those are all probably good indications that we should test at least a two factor solution,

575
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:08,360
if not maybe a three perhaps all the way up to four, five, six factor solution because there's that many eigenvalues greater than one.

576
01:03:08,750 --> 01:03:18,860
So it's running kind of thinking behind the scenes. If I ran up to a 27 factor solution or whatever, what would my different factors kind of explain?

577
01:03:19,370 --> 01:03:30,469
Yeah, I'm pretty busy. Or rather, can you utilize this two ways looking at the plots and the eigenvalues just for the QCA,

578
01:03:30,470 --> 01:03:34,040
or can you do that, you know, factor analysis to them, that's for sure.

579
01:03:34,700 --> 01:03:42,320
And really, this is just two different ways of giving us some guidance about how many different models should I run,

580
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:45,559
because especially in an exploratory factor analysis,

581
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:50,120
when we don't know how many of these how many different underlying dimensions are going to be part of those 27 items.

582
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:57,380
That's why this could be helpful if you already had a pretty good idea that that 22 there's 27 items has three subscales,

583
01:03:57,770 --> 01:04:03,590
you're running a three factor solution and just seeing how things about maybe around two and three and four just to check

584
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:10,520
but basically you're trying to confirm what you already believe to be true because we approach this very differently.

585
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:14,450
We're saying we have no idea. That's why we might look at something like this.

586
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:21,470
Well, more subjectivity than we might think and some things.

587
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:26,270
Right. There's no guidance. You know, Heather might say two is good.

588
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:31,060
Clare might say, Well, I think we should test for Chris. You might say, No, no, no, no.

589
01:04:31,490 --> 01:04:36,020
We had six. Which test? All six. I'm inclined to agree.

590
01:04:36,350 --> 01:04:39,600
So we're going to assess this.

591
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:44,840
My friends still still are.

592
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:49,400
Our dataset with just the 27 items jumped all the way up to six factors.

593
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:55,940
Six factors. Six Underlying dimensions are facets that are explaining these items and how they're all kind of related together.

594
01:04:56,390 --> 01:05:01,000
Finally, finally, we're going to see why rotation is such a happy thing.

595
01:05:01,460 --> 01:05:04,550
Right. So we have no rotation at this point, right?

596
01:05:05,150 --> 01:05:08,809
You tell me if you can make sense of it. Yeah. Extra credit. Extra credit.

597
01:05:08,810 --> 01:05:12,140
If you can make any sense of which of these items are kind of grouped together.

598
01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:17,150
It's next to impossible. Maybe you can maybe see things that I don't.

599
01:05:17,690 --> 01:05:21,770
But these item loadings are all over the place. They're all over the place.

600
01:05:23,180 --> 01:05:29,360
This, by the way, is just a a decision you can use if you don't want to have a factor.

601
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:33,830
Loadings that are below 0.25 because they're really small. You can have them just drop out.

602
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:45,130
So you would just see spaces here. Yeah, exactly.

603
01:05:46,910 --> 01:05:53,330
How come there is no rotation added and anything I chose, I just.

604
01:05:53,610 --> 01:05:55,820
I figure let's throw that rotation first.

605
01:05:56,450 --> 01:06:06,529
Now when we get the rotation from if you remember from the videos two different times the rotation and I did a mask off when a series one is,

606
01:06:06,530 --> 01:06:13,150
is orthogonal, which means that the factors themselves are not related to each other.

607
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:16,639
They're independent. That means something very different.

608
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:23,780
They're uncorrelated then oblique rotations where we allow the factors to be correlated with each other.

609
01:06:24,770 --> 01:06:31,459
That's completely determined by whomever is running his analysis for that depression and anxiety.

610
01:06:31,460 --> 01:06:34,880
Those those measures when we had to factor solution one for depression,

611
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:43,540
one for anxiety rotating that obliquely made a lot more sense to me because depression and anxiety, I know are really highly related to each other.

612
01:06:43,570 --> 01:06:49,760
Right. Right. So it makes sense that those factors have that correlation built in, but we don't have to do it that way.

613
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:54,470
And it might ultimately make for more or less interpretability.

614
01:06:54,470 --> 01:06:59,630
But if you run one that allows for the factors to be correlated, you'll also get returned.

615
01:06:59,930 --> 01:07:05,990
Those correlations, how the factors, these underlying dimensions that we can't really see and touch, how to relate to each other.

616
01:07:06,710 --> 01:07:10,520
And that's really kind of hearkens to some of the structural equation modeling we're going to do in the semester.

617
01:07:10,930 --> 01:07:16,340
And that's exciting. And before I get that oh six factor solution,

618
01:07:16,580 --> 01:07:24,290
what we're ideally starting to see is that we're explaining more and more and more of the item variability all the way up to now.

619
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:29,450
By the time we run a six pack, the solution we are explaining about, oh,

620
01:07:29,690 --> 01:07:38,210
about 55% of the variability across all those items by knowing that there are these kind of factors that are grouping things together for us,

621
01:07:38,630 --> 01:07:44,690
we can explain about 55% of the way that people respond to these 27 items, not 100.

622
01:07:45,170 --> 01:07:49,850
But we're getting better. It's way better than we just had one section, which is only about a quarter of the variability.

623
01:07:50,930 --> 01:07:55,909
That's that's what these models are supposed to do. They're supposed to tell us how people are going to respond to these ideas

624
01:07:55,910 --> 01:08:01,910
together and try to apply this factor structure can help us to to get there.

625
01:08:07,670 --> 01:08:11,840
Now we're finally getting to the rotation multiple times,

626
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:19,430
probably about a half dozen forms of rotation for each, sort of, whether it's orthogonal or oblique.

627
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:25,340
I use very much almost exclusively personal preference of nickname.

628
01:08:25,910 --> 01:08:31,760
Again, personal preference. You can look at all the different options that they have one more time.

629
01:08:32,060 --> 01:08:36,200
If the choice you make here is resulting in drastically different results.

630
01:08:36,470 --> 01:08:42,170
That should be a red flag. Right now, each one has its own kind of rationale.

631
01:08:42,470 --> 01:08:48,180
Like Vera, Max's is designed to have as few factors as possible with as high as loads as fast as possible.

632
01:08:48,470 --> 01:08:53,270
And you can look at some of the little nuances. But what I care about is when as you rotate things.

633
01:08:58,530 --> 01:09:03,960
There are all the slides for if we go right back, as soon as you rotate things, it starts to look a lot cleaner.

634
01:09:04,530 --> 01:09:09,750
A lot cleaner. Remember those sticks that sticks out in solution when I challenge you here, here's your credit.

635
01:09:10,050 --> 01:09:13,110
Extra credit. I know we can have on extra credit.

636
01:09:13,140 --> 01:09:23,100
You already do. Is this it makes it so much easier when we rotate because now we are making a lot of those values really, really small.

637
01:09:23,550 --> 01:09:29,520
Those factor loans become really, really small. And it's a lot easier now to say, okay, oh my.

638
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:31,770
27 items and six factors.

639
01:09:32,070 --> 01:09:39,840
Which of those items load onto which factors without even knowing what these factors indicate and really without even knowing what these items are,

640
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:45,630
you can tell me which of these items belong to factor one and factor two and factor three.

641
01:09:46,050 --> 01:09:54,550
Factor for. Right. That's the power of rotation, and it's all in a need for interpretability.

642
01:09:55,000 --> 01:10:00,450
But this still explains 55% of the variability kind of across the zones.

643
01:10:00,910 --> 01:10:05,410
That's the key to the model. It doesn't change depending on your rotation decision.

644
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:10,870
So we have a fear factor for us up here.

645
01:10:11,110 --> 01:10:15,580
What three items belong to factor four are really indicative of a factor for.

646
01:10:22,390 --> 01:10:29,230
JJ Hey, George. Yeah, I didn't write this history.

647
01:10:29,230 --> 01:10:32,650
I draw very high loadings on that same factor.

648
01:10:32,950 --> 01:10:38,710
So whatever they are and if anybody wants to look at the FS code book for me while we're trying to walk into this example, that's great.

649
01:10:39,220 --> 01:10:44,470
But we can see what these items sort of indicate. What is h r j mean in our affinity set?

650
01:10:44,830 --> 01:10:53,140
Because clearly they grouped together. That's what we're going to call our new factor for based on our solution.

651
01:10:53,650 --> 01:11:04,750
Right? Neat. Now, not every one of these solutions is perfect, but druggies, drugs, heroin and morphine and PCP.

652
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:10,150
If I get my friends who are using drugs. Right, that's what these three items kind of say.

653
01:11:10,540 --> 01:11:13,510
Do you have kind of is that everywhere describing the influence of friends?

654
01:11:13,780 --> 01:11:18,340
At least one of those influences is best characterized by whether or not they're using drugs.

655
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:24,340
Right. And if we started to look through some of these other items, we hopefully find similar interpretations.

656
01:11:24,700 --> 01:11:27,040
Now, again, some of this gets a little bit messy.

657
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:36,910
Um, you know, this item here, you see, it's kind of got a little loaded here on number one, but probably belongs to number three here, here.

658
01:11:36,910 --> 01:11:42,280
And it's kind of a cross motif there. I mean, those are some decisions or calls that we kind of have to make.

659
01:11:42,700 --> 01:11:50,950
But ideally, again, if we looked at now factor two and it's what these four you guys are X, Y and Z,

660
01:11:51,370 --> 01:11:56,890
hopefully we see some sort of theme here that we can say, well, we're going to make another scale has four items.

661
01:11:57,160 --> 01:12:03,760
And that scale talked about what kind of influence of friends X, Y and Z.

662
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:09,490
Okay. V friends take part in school of athletics.

663
01:12:09,490 --> 01:12:14,140
Yeah. Why did you go to college?

664
01:12:14,230 --> 01:12:19,000
Okay. Or we see a theme here. X get A's and B's.

665
01:12:19,090 --> 01:12:23,200
Now we see a theme here, folks, and a over here. And I have this followed opposite direction.

666
01:12:25,930 --> 01:12:37,090
Y should be like go to church. Okay. Do we have a name for Factor two?

667
01:12:37,540 --> 01:12:43,740
That's a little distinct from Factor Rosario here. Before our decision was in, Jane was ready to call it a day.

668
01:12:43,750 --> 01:12:48,400
When I was in L.A., we had taken those 27 items, combine all that information together.

669
01:12:48,610 --> 01:12:52,450
Our reliability analysis was strong that very few of the friends were.

670
01:12:52,450 --> 01:12:58,420
Maybe we can think about a little more nuance here, and we create a new scale that calls Fred Thompson's use.

671
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:03,790
It's got three items in which you create another scale or another item that's got for another scale.

672
01:13:03,790 --> 01:13:05,469
It has four items, right?

673
01:13:05,470 --> 01:13:11,050
And that's where all those positive things that are related to friendships or something like that, like a future orientation or something.

674
01:13:11,390 --> 01:13:17,590
Right. Allows for just a different look at some of this data, which before was just 27 items.

675
01:13:17,590 --> 01:13:22,899
That was overwhelming. And even when we saw it like this, still overwhelming.

676
01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:28,620
I would have never known never known that some of these items were clustered just like we were talking about you.

677
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:33,549
Now, if you had gone and looked at the code work and looked at some of those items, you might have been able to do this naturally.

678
01:13:33,550 --> 01:13:36,879
You might have said, okay, these three items are related to substance use, but I don't.

679
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:41,920
My personal approach and advice included the alcohol use and some other forms of substance use.

680
01:13:42,130 --> 01:13:46,000
Not those three specific items and marijuana falls into that category.

681
01:13:46,060 --> 01:13:49,299
Interesting. Interesting. The marijuana might fall into a different one.

682
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:52,210
Right. So how do we kind of make some of those distinctions?

683
01:13:52,420 --> 01:14:00,670
We can allow our data to map on to our own interpretation or our own kind of conceptualization of how we think this is all going to play out.

684
01:14:00,970 --> 01:14:05,630
And we can see how close we are. We can see where we diverge from there.

685
01:14:05,700 --> 01:14:14,590
Yeah. So do we get the idea behind me if it's not the whole idea what the rotation can do for us through a jury,

686
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:19,150
can you kind of see how that can be helpful as with so many things?

687
01:14:19,270 --> 01:14:26,860
Just you could read these things if you care about it. Again, this is the one I almost always use, but really shouldn't make a whole big difference.

688
01:14:27,070 --> 01:14:35,260
And in this ledger up here. So don't feel like you have to read them real quick. It's a very simple going from none to two types of rotation.

689
01:14:35,300 --> 01:14:40,120
Right. This code is not not so clear.

690
01:14:40,900 --> 01:14:44,950
Okay. But I'm happy to work with folks, especially on the midterm,

691
01:14:44,950 --> 01:14:51,700
since we don't have time to time to do this together to help make sure that this is not the reason you can't get here,

692
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:59,320
because I really I can work through this at any point. What I care about is that you look at this and say, okay, how many factories do we have?

693
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:04,060
How would I create my scale based on what I understand here? What does factor two mean?

694
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:08,649
Can you can you make some of those can you make some of those those influences?

695
01:15:08,650 --> 01:15:09,100
Yeah. Okay.

696
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:18,680
So once we get this, we kind of determine that there are six factors and then are some of them we have three or four and some of them have a lot.

697
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:22,450
Yeah, and that's okay. That's okay because yeah.

698
01:15:22,450 --> 01:15:24,639
Our Factor one, it's got a good whopping seven,

699
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:31,120
eight items and we have to think about whether we'd want an item like this trying to factor one or factor three.

700
01:15:31,480 --> 01:15:36,430
That's a choice that we get to make. Maybe it belongs to both and we're creating our scale,

701
01:15:36,430 --> 01:15:40,930
but we have to acknowledge that redundancy or figure out whether we want to use factor scores

702
01:15:41,230 --> 01:15:45,580
because that would allow for those contributions of this item to both of the factors.

703
01:15:46,570 --> 01:15:51,760
So there's this that's what I like about this kind of work.

704
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:55,750
And we get to make some of these decisions which can have pretty big ramifications.

705
01:15:56,230 --> 01:15:59,410
So again, being also transparent about the decisions that we're making,

706
01:15:59,650 --> 01:16:06,700
why we chose a six factor solution versus one that had, you know, maybe five, that would have been easy.

707
01:16:06,700 --> 01:16:11,110
So going from 5 to 6 factors is all explained about 5% more variability.

708
01:16:11,410 --> 01:16:14,980
Maybe we test that five factor solution and see if we can make sense of it.

709
01:16:18,820 --> 01:16:23,920
Why are they? Yes, I am.

710
01:16:24,250 --> 01:16:28,209
But there's also been a point where you may be considered dropping.

711
01:16:28,210 --> 01:16:32,560
And I know for sure if it's like the ones that go across three.

712
01:16:32,650 --> 01:16:38,500
Yeah. If it's a problematic one like this s I don't know what else is s is giving me grief.

713
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:45,340
I don't know. I guess it's I can't figure out where it goes. It's not discriminate, which I have.

714
01:16:45,340 --> 01:16:49,899
Your friends carried a gun. Interesting. Never mind.

715
01:16:49,900 --> 01:16:56,630
I'm not dropping the name like that, but. I know we're pretty much out of time, but in this case, like what the next step is,

716
01:16:56,860 --> 01:17:01,520
looking at the luxury and things like we say for as many of your data set.

717
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:06,469
And then can you just like run the regression analysis with those are huge and how do

718
01:17:06,470 --> 01:17:12,379
you pick them if you want like one gram variable to variability in a specific scale,

719
01:17:12,380 --> 01:17:16,400
how do you put that? So where you kind of based on my solution,

720
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:23,030
this is just showing you what happens when we go from rotator on rotating to rotator and how much cleaner it gets based on a solution like this.

721
01:17:23,450 --> 01:17:35,149
I would take, for example, my new factor for anemia or whatever it is, drug use, peers use drugs and I would create either a three item scale meet,

722
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:40,640
I'm going to roll means command of these three items or if I wanted to save my factor scores,

723
01:17:41,900 --> 01:17:48,680
remember all of the different loadings for all 27 items would still go into that factor score.

724
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:57,080
Right, but saved within this new object PC three would be all my factor scores, which I can then use.

725
01:17:57,230 --> 01:18:05,240
So I'd have six of them and I could put those variables into an equation and do a regression equation that I see manually.

726
01:18:07,010 --> 01:18:11,300
Take the variables that you want and make something out because of the way that we make.

727
01:18:11,780 --> 01:18:21,920
Yeah. If, if we're doing this outside of kind of the, the PCA framework, you can take the three items based on your, based on your results here.

728
01:18:22,220 --> 01:18:27,260
I would run a reliability analysis with these three items. So you're going to create this just like we did before.

729
01:18:27,260 --> 01:18:32,630
You're going to create like a little mini scale, run your reliability analysis for just those three, hopefully 4.7 or above.

730
01:18:33,140 --> 01:18:40,730
If that's the case, then create a mean score or some score or however you want to combine that information through in the regression equation.

731
01:18:44,010 --> 01:18:46,130
Yeah, I have two questions.

732
01:18:46,250 --> 01:19:00,049
So the first one is why are all of our items on the left not in alphabetical order, such as the way we enter them into our into the computer or so?

733
01:19:00,050 --> 01:19:06,980
One of the nice things about this particular principle function is nice enough to put these in order of the,

734
01:19:06,980 --> 01:19:12,750
the, the side of the spectrum and then why doesn't it not all the numerical order.

735
01:19:13,610 --> 01:19:17,809
So I think it takes the one that explains the most variability. Second most variability.

736
01:19:17,810 --> 01:19:29,750
Third most variability. Yeah.

737
01:19:30,830 --> 01:19:40,460
Listen, I'm sorry you're doing this after your initial, like, whatever, regression analysis like that, and then then you're running.

738
01:19:41,630 --> 01:19:46,700
No, this I'm actually going to do this pre-work because this this is going to help me figure

739
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:52,609
out what variables I want in my regression analysis because I have a few options here.

740
01:19:52,610 --> 01:19:57,620
I could just include 20, sometimes 27 regression coefficients, all of which would need to be explained.

741
01:19:58,220 --> 01:20:01,970
I can combine them all into one big one. Or I could do something like this.

742
01:20:02,150 --> 01:20:05,480
What for me, at the end of the day, would this would be six different scales,

743
01:20:06,170 --> 01:20:10,040
six different scales that mean something slightly different, but are all related to peer influence.

744
01:20:10,490 --> 01:20:15,770
And I might use all six or I might just use a couple and I use the ones that only pertain to the negative things.

745
01:20:16,310 --> 01:20:19,610
Or I might see whether or not having a positive peer influence in your life,

746
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:28,520
moderates or in some way changes the relation or has had an effect on some some outcome or relative to a negative one.

747
01:20:28,610 --> 01:20:38,780
I don't know. Research question what you think about the sort of aberrations like rumor and I have I don't know if it was the midterm or not,

748
01:20:38,780 --> 01:20:45,790
but like on the midterm and you rather have a student factor analysis at the forefront or it's going to be a little more prescribed.

749
01:20:46,160 --> 01:20:49,610
So I'm going to tell you when I want you to do it. And.

750
01:20:53,020 --> 01:20:57,700
Yeah. I mean, there. There's. It's. Right. I want you to go from 80.

751
01:20:57,700 --> 01:21:00,020
I give you a lot of flexibility about C and D,

752
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:06,360
but I still there's there's a fair amount of scaffolding just so folks don't end up doing something completely off.

753
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:12,519
From what I'm hoping to see. Really, it's there there's going to be some opportunity for you to make a decision,

754
01:21:12,520 --> 01:21:16,299
for example, about running a fact analysis firm that they run three of them.

755
01:21:16,300 --> 01:21:20,860
But these these measures decide what you want to do in terms of creating a scale score

756
01:21:20,860 --> 01:21:26,650
related to positive influence or something based on how you decide to take this.

757
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:30,190
You can I mean, I still want you just to provide analysis,

758
01:21:30,190 --> 01:21:34,360
but we could have gone back to the default decision to take all 27 and create this together.

759
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:37,000
So w some decision making.

760
01:21:37,450 --> 01:21:43,750
Now to your question about had I paused the midterm, you know, but now it's time to ask you, are you ready for this midterm?

761
01:21:44,770 --> 01:21:54,370
The midterm covers kind of basic data management, bivariate analysis, running multiple regression, checking the assumptions.

762
01:21:55,090 --> 01:21:59,650
There is a little bit of factor analysis, reliability in the that I ask you to do.

763
01:22:00,010 --> 01:22:06,850
And I think there's a lot to be tested interaction to be operative like you want like all in one script.

764
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:16,240
Yeah. Okay so now as soon as we work together, I know that this business is there.

765
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:23,739
It is a I mean, this program makes you do summative assessments, but I really think of this midterm as formative.

766
01:22:23,740 --> 01:22:28,960
I want you to learn from what we're doing. The whole purpose of the midterm is to give you a real life problem.

767
01:22:29,290 --> 01:22:33,940
It's something that I had to do when I got my first job out of grad school. I was given a whole bunch of data.

768
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:37,600
I was given five broad questions and I would say, Go back to your merry way.

769
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:44,140
And I do something similar, but with a little bit more guidance where you can apply some of these ideas, what is the first data set?

770
01:22:44,440 --> 01:22:45,910
So that's something that you're familiar with.

771
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:56,110
The the coding and the data management piece is at the bottom of what I hear that you can demonstrate in terms of your understanding.

772
01:22:56,680 --> 01:23:01,210
So I will help folks get through that if you're having trouble, do not spend 4 hours trying to figure out a coding.

773
01:23:01,450 --> 01:23:04,870
Just do it. I will give you the data or I'll figure out a way to help you out.

774
01:23:05,710 --> 01:23:10,090
This is what I really care about is when you're faced with a table like this.

775
01:23:10,450 --> 01:23:15,730
Now, what do you do? I saw your question was important. Now that you have this result, what are you going to do?

776
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:20,590
How are you going to make a decision about regression analysis based on what you see up here?

777
01:23:21,250 --> 01:23:25,240
So what's the question we're trying to answer? Does this help us to get to that question?

778
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:32,680
If my question is whether or not friend peer influence is related to the likelihood that someone's drinking alcohol,

779
01:23:33,250 --> 01:23:35,470
what are these different scales that you want to include?

780
01:23:35,990 --> 01:23:41,920
You might be able to say something like, Yeah, when my peers are using alcohol and other drugs, positive associations,

781
01:23:42,340 --> 01:23:48,550
when they're doing positive things, negative associations and they're doing silly things like stealing and getting into trouble.

782
01:23:48,970 --> 01:23:54,700
Also a negative association, some say answer some of those questions that way based on how you slice this data.

783
01:23:55,990 --> 01:24:00,960
But there's not a right or wrong way per say to interpret this well as a consumer.

784
01:24:03,010 --> 01:24:07,390
So 2 minutes. So orientation.

785
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:10,690
Okay, one more question. Do you recommend we do it?

786
01:24:10,700 --> 01:24:18,890
Like to sit down and do it like on one chunk or since we have let's go on to we're going to want to make sense of it.

787
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:23,200
And I want the length of time to be a benefit or not something that's, you know,

788
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:26,860
it's still just going to be pushed off for two and a half weeks and you feel crunch time crunch at the end.

789
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:32,160
So I'll give you as much time as you need. I would say if you sit down and really kind of look at this, you know,

790
01:24:32,170 --> 01:24:37,300
kind of a concerted effort, if you would, involved with the homework assignments. It's really close to the homework assignments.

791
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:41,470
If you take my answer scripts, you can probably figure this out pretty quickly.

792
01:24:42,040 --> 01:24:44,350
Two and a half, 3 hours, maybe that's me.

793
01:24:44,590 --> 01:24:48,850
And that's also understanding that you can run into problems that just take you down a road for an hour and a half.

794
01:24:48,850 --> 01:24:55,930
I get that. That sucks. It's just part of what we have to deal with. But I think the the content should be pretty familiar at this point.

795
01:24:56,310 --> 01:25:00,400
The way that you're structured, the questions and answer the questions, you write up the questions.

796
01:25:00,610 --> 01:25:05,050
It could be a little different well, different from some of our assignments where if I've asked you to expand a little bit,

797
01:25:05,290 --> 01:25:13,300
interpret coefficient for me, tell me why you're doing some of these things that might be where this test or this midterm diverges a little bit.

798
01:25:13,990 --> 01:25:19,780
But again, what I care about is are you recognizing the major points of the output that you that you need to be able to tease out?

799
01:25:20,020 --> 01:25:24,670
Can you tell me what these things mean? And can you translate into a way that people outside of this class can understand?

800
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:30,099
Right. I know in our square it is, but I think most people outside this room might struggle with that.

801
01:25:30,100 --> 01:25:33,820
And, you know, if you just say, hey, around our square or points of right.

802
01:25:34,780 --> 01:25:37,870
That's that's where we need to kind of think through in terms of that piece. So.

803
01:25:40,910 --> 01:25:44,150
My birthday. Yeah.

804
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:47,360
All right, I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it. So seriously. Take.

805
01:25:47,390 --> 01:25:51,610
Take. I mean, I know you can fall break next week, you know, taking hours every day.

806
01:25:51,740 --> 01:25:55,730
They don't necessarily do it and just kind of see where you're feeling.

807
01:25:56,330 --> 01:26:01,549
If you have questions about it, we can bring a break because on Thursday we have a guest speaker that can talk about survival analysis,

808
01:26:01,550 --> 01:26:06,230
but we can also carve out a half an hour for folks to answer any questions they want about the midterm.

809
01:26:06,590 --> 01:26:11,750
If time at any point is going to be the limiting factor for issues, you know, that we can work through that.

810
01:26:12,470 --> 01:26:16,270
So it's more realistic in terms of how we actually work in the real world today,

811
01:26:16,310 --> 01:26:22,600
although I do have a great call break, will be a wonderful weekend as they travel to really reduce handle time.

812
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:30,020
I will see you next Thursday, but feel free to shoot me a note if you have any questions or comments or concerns.
