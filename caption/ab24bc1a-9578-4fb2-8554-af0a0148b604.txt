1
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:07,950
Those are just a few examples.

2
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:20,620
So yeah, it's a nice transition for 2007.

3
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:32,550
We're doing unusual things right now for me.

4
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:40,800
How hard was my dad talking about here?

5
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:48,330
You know, I'm still have to.

6
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:59,370
I forget at. That it's computer modeling.

7
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:08,700
But yeah, I mean, I felt like I would quit my job.

8
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:14,700
Okay, so you announcement.

9
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:20,370
So we're going to release number three today and that'll be due two weeks.

10
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:30,810
November 22nd should be the Wednesday as Thanksgiving. And then when?

11
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,660
Tomorrow, this Wednesday, we have a guest lecture.

12
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:41,549
We go on as the Southwestern professor and at the school sustainability and you'll be talking about disease,

13
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:44,580
ecology, conservation, biology perspective.

14
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:53,070
So it's like somewhat tightly to myself, migratory diseases.

15
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:02,730
There are a couple a number of questions about Jim Chancellor's lecture last week.

16
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:07,920
I just wanted to highlight a few thoughts on that.

17
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,559
There is a there is a lot of questions.

18
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:20,370
I think it was somewhat abstract for a lot of people to be talking about how to bring in social issues and processes into epidemiology.

19
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:24,090
And I think what he said are not as social.

20
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:33,239
It kind of reiterated I would they are not as social also, but in a different scale than what he was talking about.

21
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:39,360
But I've been talking about the contact patterns and ingestion rates.

22
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,100
And, you know, this bites are all those contact rates have a social component.

23
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:52,740
And Jim took it on another layer to talk about externality structures, social and political structures.

24
00:02:53,700 --> 00:03:03,690
And those are, you know, simple things that just bring into a as a covariate in a model to analyze,

25
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:11,100
you know, email to the way I think about how to bring in those ideas and concepts.

26
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:21,960
These are two two directions. One is in order to develop a survey that's providing you with answers that you expect there to be,

27
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:30,690
there can be a lot of ethnography that's done and how to phrase that question and how to talk about these concepts

28
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:36,960
in a way that the person that you're talking to understands and that that's true no matter where you're,

29
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:44,070
you know, where you're who you're talking to, the stakeholders are the part of the idea.

30
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:52,020
Participants are going to be having a different perception of what you are wanting than you do and understanding that is important.

31
00:03:52,020 --> 00:04:01,770
So on the front end, how to design an effective survey to collect data that you actually is actually what you expect it to be is important,

32
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,320
and the back end is the causal inference.

33
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:14,940
No matter how much statistics you do, you're only talking about associations and epidemiology struggles with this idea of causality.

34
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:20,910
And that's where ethnography can help. And you talked about and we had that one article about reducing the dimensions,

35
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:30,870
like there's infinite possibilities of permutations that could happen and a lot of, you know, interpret your associations.

36
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:36,779
But once you actually know a certain number of facts and it's I mean,

37
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:43,679
it is a great example and to reduce the possibilities and thereby you're able to better interpret your data.

38
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:53,310
So it's not as if ethnography is going to be allowing you to add, you know, a specific covariate that you can be able to analyze.

39
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:59,820
It's really two different disciplines and two different ways of understanding what's going on.

40
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:09,929
So it is abstract and it's something that you have to kind of delve into, do more and more to get a sense of how to do this.

41
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:15,240
And I don't think we as a field do it that well yet.

42
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,980
So it's really a work in progress in how we interpret.

43
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:29,640
Social data, how we incorporate social processes into epidemiology in a much more sophisticated way.

44
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:39,270
But in that article about the curse of dimensionality, I think that we we go into a lot of detail about that.

45
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:48,130
I think that's a useful it's only 1200 words short article, but hopefully that helps address some of those questions that you had.

46
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:55,610
Okay. Any other any thoughts or questions about that or anything?

47
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:12,749
Okay. So this is just roughly the last hour of the class we're starting with looking at emerging reemerging pathogens and disease ecology,

48
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:22,110
and they're going to be moving into talking about specific disease systems, airborne waterborne, vector borne, sexually transmitted.

49
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:33,360
In the next set of lectures. So key points again, out of this lecture, we're going to be defining emerging and reemerging infectious diseases,

50
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:40,380
looking into factors that can contribute to emergence as the bulk of really what we're going to be talking about here.

51
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:47,170
And then we're going to talk about prevention of emerging pathogens and how we need to be moving forward.

52
00:06:50,340 --> 00:07:05,930
So this is a. List that was that was put together like this is 2017 of examples of emerging pathogens just since 1980.

53
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:15,499
This gives you a step to the. A sense of the extent to which we are seeing a lot of pathogens emerging and reemerging.

54
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:21,290
Again, we're going to be defining what that actually means. Here we see HIV.

55
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:26,780
It's kind of the beginning of this list here in the early eighties emerging.

56
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:30,440
Again, we talked a lot about prior to the emergence of HIV,

57
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:37,940
many people in very high level people thought that infectious disease were going to be a thing of the past that we were going to.

58
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:42,079
We dealt with infectious diseases. We eradicated smallpox.

59
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:49,370
Polio was quickly going to follow and that it really was a discipline that we

60
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:54,019
weren't going to be meeting and can consider very seriously and moving forward.

61
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:58,490
And this map kind of shows you how long ago that was.

62
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:05,870
And we have examples, all these examples, many of which we've talked about, these arboviruses,

63
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:15,290
chikungunya, dengue, Zika, lots of hemorrhagic fevers, Ebola, Marburg is here.

64
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:24,410
We see SA's lots of food borne, agricultural based emerging pathogens like E.coli one, five, seven.

65
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,550
Cryptosporidium is here.

66
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:36,070
So you just see a wide array of different types of pathogens that have been an issue that we're dealing with around the world.

67
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:49,299
So we can come back to this our triad, to better understand what these factors and interacting factors are that govern emergence.

68
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:56,020
And again, to think about it, emerging emerging pathogens that occurred throughout the history of humans.

69
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,230
And we talked a lot about the ad, you know,

70
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:09,490
the the beginning of agriculture was a really a big technological change that caused the emergence of a lot of pathogens.

71
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:14,170
So this is something that's been ongoing, big discussion about.

72
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:21,830
You know, are are we just increasing the number of emerging pathogens over time?

73
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:34,260
And are we just better at finding them? But this is something that's been ongoing and is continuing to to happen and occur.

74
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:45,540
So we see them in the environment, a lot of factors that go into influencing emergence of diseases.

75
00:09:45,540 --> 00:10:00,540
So changing ecosystems. Lyme disease is an excellent example that afflicted us in domestically with respect to this idea of residential

76
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:10,020
and and people encouraging and imposing and moving into forested areas and getting more and more exposed to.

77
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:17,580
Factors such as ticks and and in this case, Lyme disease.

78
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:28,320
Ebola is a similar situation with respect to people moving into forested regions in Africa, resulting in emergence of Ebola.

79
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:45,960
We see a lot of issue with respect to public health, infrastructure, poverty and issues that allow for the reemergence of pathogens coming in.

80
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:49,980
Cholera in Haiti is a good example of that.

81
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,970
Ebola in West Africa, another good example.

82
00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:04,620
Climate change is huge right now and becoming a major focus and people's concern about reemerging diseases.

83
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:12,570
An example of that is dengue, which is broadening its geographic span as climate is changing.

84
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:19,920
And then again, we talked a lot about zoonotic pathogens, both wildlife and live livestock,

85
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:26,850
intensification of agriculture, resulting in a lot of spillover of pathogens from animals to humans.

86
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:41,390
And then we had the agent acting out the best example that is influenza with respect to it, the virus changing and mutating, adapting.

87
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:54,049
These pathogens are always finding, trying to find ecologic niches that they can sustain and sustain themselves in human populations,

88
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:58,040
that that's genetically and evolutionary. What their goal is.

89
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:03,979
These RNA viruses that have high mutation rates are ones that are a particular concern.

90
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:08,660
And this is why influenza has had pandemics throughout our history,

91
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:18,590
that there's there's a mutation that finds a niche with respect to the environment and social structure.

92
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:27,660
And that propagates. And then we have the host set, the ability, demographic factors.

93
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,790
We have opportunistic pathogens.

94
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:40,529
We're going to talk about C diff a little bit more with respect to its increase in severity in hospital infections and the use of antibiotics,

95
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:47,280
actually creating this niche within the microbiome for C diff as an opportunistic,

96
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:59,790
opportunistic pathogen and a pathogen that can cause a lot of disease when it finds immunocompromised hosts.

97
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,790
And then antibiotic microbe resistance is another big area that we'll talk a

98
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:08,510
little bit about now and then we'll have a whole lecture on that later on.

99
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:19,400
So the big issue, the big concept to know and just to reiterate from the title is the emergence is really due to the interaction of these factors,

100
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:30,090
not necessarily any one factor in isolation, but the interaction of these factors can result in the emergence of.

101
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:37,920
A new pathogen or the expansion or the increase of disease.

102
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,700
And again, these microbes are living organisms.

103
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,739
They adapt and they evolve.

104
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:54,600
And that's what makes them very different from other noninfectious health risks and exposures that we what we dealt with in public health.

105
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:03,270
So a big, important concept.

106
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:09,830
And to understand is how. Environmental drivers affect the emergence.

107
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:18,890
And this is really where the one health field has emerged to rethink about not just humans in isolation,

108
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:23,330
but humans in the context of animals health and environmental health.

109
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:27,590
Again, something that way back to apocalypses was talking about.

110
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:40,200
In the four hundreds B.C. and something that we time we lost the bit when we went with the advent of the germ theory and thinking about.

111
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:51,410
Humans as in isolation. But it has come back into favor thinking about environmental drivers and specifically this one health movement.

112
00:14:52,070 --> 00:15:07,970
So these are just examples of that occurring rain with residential rainforest interfacing with rain forest interface with residential areas.

113
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:22,760
Ebola again, is an example of that where again these populations are moving into previously uninhabited forested areas for a variety of reasons,

114
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:30,980
resulting in emergence of diseases like Ebola. We talked a lot about intensification of agricultural practices.

115
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:39,380
The increase in density has resulted in the emergence of a variety of different pathogens e-coli,

116
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:46,250
cryptosporidium, salmonella and drug resistant salmonella is an example, specific example.

117
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:50,500
And then climate change. Is again a big driver.

118
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:55,990
And Terry Pavin is another example in which extreme events, droughts, floods,

119
00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:06,010
extreme rain events are a major driver in the increased spread and emergence of pathogens.

120
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,910
And then biodiversity and transmission and talked about Lyme disease.

121
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:22,130
These are Lyme disease is an example of a disease that's got sustained in in forested region areas with from mammals and ticks rodents.

122
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:32,930
And there's a lot of research into how biodiversity has can create a dilution of that can

123
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:40,760
actually mitigate transmission of Lyme disease and that as we decrease biodiversity,

124
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:47,059
we increase the risk of Lyme disease transmission. There's a lot of research in disease.

125
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:53,240
Ecology is something that pure hope Yohannes will talk about on Wednesday.

126
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:01,960
So in addition, you know, we can extend when we talk about environment, the social structure.

127
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:11,930
Talk about urbanization has been a major, major force recently moving from rural to urban areas.

128
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:19,120
And increased density has resulted in one of the causes of the reemergence of dengue.

129
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:27,190
Mobility has enabled pathogens to move much more rapidly.

130
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:38,379
Influenza is a good example of that. Crowding and poverty has resulted in a reemergence of tuberculosis in areas that we're going to talk later.

131
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:41,920
More about tuberculosis. But as you know, disease, it's very treatable.

132
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:47,500
We know how to control it. But has due to crowding and poverty has.

133
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:57,090
In sustaining and increasing in both the increasing in disease burden as well as

134
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:03,809
the geographic extent where we're seeing tuberculosis and then Warren famine.

135
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:08,520
And I don't know I think that meant to be Ebola and not Lyme disease had in there.

136
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:16,469
We'll talk more about Ebola and how how the pathogen, you know,

137
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:23,970
the ecologic niche for the pathogen of Ebola to sustain and create the outbreak is typically in

138
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:31,950
12 2014 is really its ability to exploit poverty and a lack of public health infrastructure.

139
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:45,370
We'll talk more about that. Other concept to really understand and appreciate is that most emerging diseases are zoonotic, at least at some level.

140
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:51,130
Some, like HIV was. The spillover happened.

141
00:18:53,170 --> 00:19:02,500
There's a lot of theories about when it actually happened in the early 1900s, but then became person to person spread.

142
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:06,070
Same with COVID. Same with SaaS.

143
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:18,340
But here we see hantavirus as an example of where rodents are transmitting hantavirus and we get the spillover into humans bats.

144
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:23,500
With respect to Ebola, bats are very efficient reservoir hosts.

145
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:33,850
And really the reason why that they are implicated in so many emerging pathogens is because they are unique in many ways.

146
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:39,520
They're are flying mammals, so they are genetically very similar to us.

147
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:45,760
And the fact that it can fly is gives them the ability and ability to spread.

148
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:50,499
They actually have also have a huge diversity species,

149
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:56,560
diversity that allows them to fly pathogens to find different niches and different species of bats.

150
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:02,290
So bats have been implicated in quite a lot of emerging pathogens.

151
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:07,749
Birds also important for a lot of viral encephalitis.

152
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:15,970
West Nile is one example of a bat, but there's a lot of other encephalitis viruses.

153
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:21,730
The Western Equine, Eastern equine that are transmitted by birds.

154
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:25,980
And so they become a very important reservoir also.

155
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:34,120
And they are very important reservoir, prairie dogs transmitting monkeypox and in pigs and birds and influenza.

156
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:40,930
Influenza continually there's continually spillover of new strains of influenza into the human population,

157
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:46,690
many of which don't go anywhere, that they stay as human as that.

158
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:54,850
And host a few of them are a few of them are able to transmit person to person.

159
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:58,540
And that results in new epidemics and pandemics.

160
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:08,320
So four different ways of thinking about emerging or reemerging disease.

161
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:13,210
And this is one way to think about how we define emerging and reemerging.

162
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:22,780
So first day pathogens can be so there's newly recognized agents or pathogens that come into.

163
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:33,570
Starting to spread within humans, their agents that just become become more pathogenic, more virulent or less susceptible to treatment.

164
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,160
So this is where we put our antibiotic resistance category.

165
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:43,350
A third is just an increase in incidence in endemic areas.

166
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:47,820
And the fourth is the expansion into areas not previously present.

167
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:56,710
You have a lot of like a lot of examples of this, including West Nile, for instance, and Zika.

168
00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:01,100
So we're going to go through each of these one by one and talk about them.

169
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:11,100
So here's a list of newly recognized emerging diseases, not usually not newly evolved.

170
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:21,700
That's that's an important thing to consider and appreciate that some of these have been circulating for a while.

171
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:25,750
And we just you know, we recognize them for a variety of reasons.

172
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:40,960
But we see that we have. Ebola, Legionnaires disease, which has been was recognized in 1977 as an opportunistic pathogen.

173
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:49,280
And it was recognized because of the way in which they're able to colonize and cooling systems and plumbing systems.

174
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:53,060
Lyme disease, we talked about HIV.

175
00:22:53,990 --> 00:23:03,530
Again, an important example of a newly emerged disease, but it included potentially circulating in humans throughout the 1900s.

176
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:13,280
It wasn't until 1983 that we recognized that it had actually spread for a variety of reasons, causing future pandemics.

177
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:25,040
You look back to a good example of a pathogen that was newly recognize it as an infectious agent causing ulcers.

178
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:32,209
So that's, again, a pathogen that's been around for a while, but just newly recognized cholera,

179
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:38,000
a different bird, different strains of cholera have been emerging and causing pandemics throughout history.

180
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:45,530
So these are examples of newly recognized emerging pathogens.

181
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:59,630
One to highlight, we talked about this a bit see itself, which is a opportunistic pathogen, mostly in people's guts and not causing disease at all.

182
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:11,860
But when you disrupt the microbiota through antibiotics and you're immuno compromised, that can cause very serious disease.

183
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:19,730
And so it's an important hospital infection that you've probably heard about in a prior lecture.

184
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:30,860
And then I already mentioned this H. Pylori. So through improved surveillance and key research and detection, it was recognized that H.

185
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:34,040
Pylori was a major cause of gastric ulcers.

186
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:44,400
So now this is a list. And date of newly recognized agents as opposed to the diseases from the last lecture.

187
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:51,030
Our last slide. So again, these are mostly pathogens that we've been talking about.

188
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:54,130
The thing to note is that, you know,

189
00:24:54,660 --> 00:25:05,060
of the other ones that have emerged and newly recognized since 2000 to 4 or five of them are three of the five of them are coronaviruses.

190
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:11,010
And there's been a lot of talk about why where we're seeing coronavirus emerge,

191
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:20,390
even though even the common coronaviruses that are causing the common cold are relatively recent, the emerged pathogens.

192
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:31,980
So there is a lot of work in understanding why and these coronaviruses are starting to emerge lately with respect to causing these pandemics.

193
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:41,700
So to talk about a few of these in a little more detail, we've talked about cryptosporidium a bit.

194
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:54,570
It was newly recognized in the 1970s, again caused by and this intensification of farming causing a lot of contamination on

195
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:59,760
farms that get through runoff can contaminate water through can contaminate food.

196
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:05,550
And so you have important food and water borne disease, cryptosporidium.

197
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,729
And because it's emerged now, it's mutated.

198
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:15,030
So it can actually transmit effectively human to human.

199
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:28,230
At least one of the genotypes it be has become a big factor in recreational water and drinking water outbreaks in the US has become a major concern.

200
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:31,170
Here's some statistics about it.

201
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:40,380
The main thing of concern here is that people with a weakened immune systems can develop serious illness, chronic and often fatal.

202
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:52,440
And in the 1990s, there's breeding became defined as specific AIDS defining disease.

203
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:58,800
And a lot of that. Prior to the viral therapy, a lot of HIV positive people died of the disease spread.

204
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:10,110
And so it becomes even though not a major disease, if you're if you are for the general population, if you're immuno compromised, it's a huge issue.

205
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:16,920
And now it's become a leading cause of moderate, severe diarrheal disease in infants in lower and middle income countries.

206
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:27,900
There's a big study done on that 5 to 10 years ago looking at what are the biology of diarrheal disease in lower and middle income countries.

207
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:36,750
And usually rotavirus is always has been the top cause infant mortality in in these countries.

208
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:44,340
This is the first evidence that cryptosporidium in many areas is a bigger issue than rotavirus,

209
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:50,190
especially given that we now have a rotavirus vaccine that has helped to some extent.

210
00:27:50,940 --> 00:28:00,659
So cryptosporidium has really since emerged in the 1970s, has this major impact in the U.S. with respect to outbreaks,

211
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:04,110
but a major impact with respect to disease burden worldwide.

212
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:18,980
e1e coli O157 Another emerging emerging pathogen tied to agricultural practices.

213
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:25,430
This gives you a little sense of the natural history of disease.

214
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:38,540
The main issue here is this potential for causing this kidney disease here in a certain percent of the population, usually in kids.

215
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:48,200
And it was discovered in 1982 and with an outbreak in Jack in a Box that killed quite a few children.

216
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:53,330
And this pathogen was discovered at that point.

217
00:28:54,140 --> 00:29:01,730
Again, some of the Pacific aspects of this disease, we just recently saw some outbreaks,

218
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:07,730
one, five, seven, and it's tied to foodborne and waterborne outbreaks.

219
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:24,710
And this again, this was highlighted in Laura Dowling's lecture, and she tied it to this foodborne ailment or outbreak.

220
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:35,360
But many people that get, you know, get sick with equal amount of five, seven through maybe a food contact with contaminated food,

221
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:42,240
then can transmit that via water and cause a lot of recreational water outbreaks and such.

222
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:45,440
So there's this chain of transmission that's going to be occurring.

223
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:54,140
Ultimately, it's tied to these agricultural practices that actually sustain the transmission of this pathogen.

224
00:29:58,010 --> 00:30:06,680
So second. Categories pathogens become more pathogenic or virulent.

225
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:15,590
This again happens through genetic variation increase exchange of agents that is through.

226
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:21,000
Again, travel and mobility can actually spread quite quickly.

227
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:26,540
And then the big issue in this category is, is antibiotics.

228
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:30,320
Antimicrobial resistance that occurs both through.

229
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:36,880
Inappropriate use of antibiotics in humans. But I and also, you know we use in animals.

230
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:44,840
There's a list of diseases that tend to lie in this category, many of which we've already talked about.

231
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:50,920
Just a few slides on antibiotic resistance, which will devote a whole lecture to you.

232
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:57,580
But this has been highlighted in the popular media as this huge threat,

233
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:07,270
impinging threat with respect to the fact that more and more antibiotics are not being effective against bacterial disease.

234
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:12,880
Bacterial diseases before antibiotics were huge and life threatening antibiotics changed all that.

235
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:22,450
And now we're you know, this antibiotic resistance is threatening us to move back into a space where we're not able to treat certain infections.

236
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:28,480
We get to the second and third generation antibiotics that aren't working.

237
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:35,380
And we get to this situation where we can't treat a lot of these bacterial infections.

238
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:44,259
And here's some antibiotics that are second most used class of drugs in the U.S. 50% of all hospitalized

239
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:49,780
patients receive antibiotics and 50% of antimicrobial use in the hospital is either unnecessary,

240
00:31:49,780 --> 00:32:03,850
inappropriate. So this is a huge issue to be able to really address and has been highlighted again throughout the research and in the popular media.

241
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:14,799
And one thing that's come increasingly appreciated is that the actual use of antibiotics in agriculture is much larger than in humans.

242
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:24,610
And so this has become a major issue both domestically, which is tied to address through policies and internationally.

243
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:35,980
And so these are just giving you a sense of percent resistance of E coli associated with different antibiotics.

244
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:38,530
So I'm getting very high, you know, 50%.

245
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:49,720
And then also looking at Staphylococcus aureus that's causing Mersa, which is also in the in the press for a number of years,

246
00:32:50,050 --> 00:33:01,630
you know, 40 to 60% of bacteria are resistant to to, you know, first, second and sometimes even third line antibiotics.

247
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:10,249
And then talked about. Did you see already this increased virulence?

248
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:19,520
This is like looking at stats with respect to the number of deaths per 102 per million increasing from 1999 to 2000.

249
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:24,950
And that's a major, major concern in hospitals right now.

250
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:41,549
And this shows resistance to this is basically Tamiflu, which is the trade name for this anti-viral and therapy.

251
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:55,670
And it you know, we see here that it because influenza is so then changes and mutates so quickly its resistance is also going to be highly variable.

252
00:33:55,680 --> 00:34:04,530
We see it aligns with that art the 29 pandemic where resistance increased to almost 200%.

253
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:14,280
And so this is of concern, continual concern with respect to influenza.

254
00:34:14,430 --> 00:34:20,610
So just to highlight that, though, we focus a lot on antibiotic resistance,

255
00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:29,940
resistance to viruses and even to other parasites like malaria, they are also critically important.

256
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:39,630
So next category, increased incidents due to changing conditions.

257
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:45,570
So we have changing land pattern use implicated.

258
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:49,170
So in that category would be changing agricultural practices.

259
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:53,070
So cryptosporidium in that category would be deforestation,

260
00:34:53,460 --> 00:35:04,110
which has resulted in increased breeding sites for Anopheles mosquitoes, which is the primary vector for malaria.

261
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:19,350
And also with respect to the way in which residential areas are getting impinging on into forested areas, causing increased exposure to Lyme disease.

262
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:25,700
Civil unrest and malnutrition. We'll talk a little bit more about leishmaniasis.

263
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:30,140
Cholera has been incomplete, implicated and as we talked about Ebola also.

264
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:44,980
Immunity. So changing in vaccination practices has caused reemergence of measles and pertussis and then lifestyle contact pattern changes.

265
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:50,540
We'll talk more about that interest by lecturer. But gonorrhea and syphilis are examples again.

266
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:58,420
Syphilis is increased since COVID has skyrocketed with respect to incidence.

267
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,700
This is a disease and most people think,

268
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:08,770
you know what is an old disease that happened during Times of the Plague is still a huge, huge public health problem.

269
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:19,730
So just a little bit quick on meta analysis, which is the vector borne disease transmitted by sand flies.

270
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,080
There's both zoonotic and and anodic vectors.

271
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:30,049
So vectors that are that feed on non-human, but also vectors that only feed on humans.

272
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:34,430
And so human human cycle as well as an animal to human cycle.

273
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:43,130
With respect to these bananas, as it's endemic in Syria and elsewhere, the Middle East and Africa and Asia,

274
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:48,590
but political violence and instability in Syria has caused this outbreak.

275
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:59,299
Recent analysis in Syria a lot due to complain again the collapse of health, infrastructure, population displacement and poor living conditions.

276
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:05,750
These are common themes for a lot of pathogens, including recent ISIS.

277
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:15,740
This is just some data showing this increase from 1993 to 2011, increase in the number of recent ISIS cases.

278
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:19,069
Again, this is a disease that doesn't cause a lot of mentality,

279
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:32,150
but it causes a lot of it's a stigmatized disease because a lot of deformation and a huge problem in right now in Syria.

280
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:46,730
And then the last category in defining emergence and reemergence, the expansion into areas not previously prevalent present.

281
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:53,200
Again, Ebola fits into this group as well as fitting into the newly recognized group.

282
00:37:53,300 --> 00:38:03,080
I think one important thing to realize is that these diseases and pathogens can fit into multiple categories.

283
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:07,520
And so, again, even the bats are a reservoir hosts.

284
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:14,060
Primates are also get infected and become reservoir hosts.

285
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:22,160
And then humans can and can get it from both bats and from primates, and it can be self-sustained within humans.

286
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:33,150
Name the Arboviruses dengue and chikungunya Zika are all examples of expansion into areas not previously present.

287
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:38,100
Zika was a huge pandemic that moved from Africa and to Latin America.

288
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:48,060
Dengue has been expanding geographically, continuously since it's reemerged in the early eighties, 1980s.

289
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:54,680
It was a disease that, again, people felt they were.

290
00:38:54,750 --> 00:39:01,080
It was eliminated in the 1940 through the use of DDT and thought it was on its way to eradication.

291
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,440
And now it's a huge, huge public health problem.

292
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:14,070
West Nile, another example of expansion into new areas into North America and Rift Valley fever,

293
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:21,870
another vector borne disease that affects humans but is as a zoonotic disease in

294
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:27,570
Africa and changing climate to dramatically affect it has affected its expansion.

295
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:37,389
So a little bit more into Zika, which, you know, spread from Africa to Southeast Asia to Latin America.

296
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:52,840
And when it spread to Latin America, 20 1516 is when we really became aware of it as a major pandemic and a major emerging pathogen.

297
00:39:55,450 --> 00:40:05,050
It's genetically very similar to dengue. In fact, people sometimes call it the fifth serotype of dengue, and dengue has four serotypes.

298
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:20,810
It's so, so similar to dengue that there's cross immunity between the two and has been implicated with respect to causing serious dengue.

299
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:30,010
I don't know if you remember we talked about how the first time you're infected with dengue, it's a fairly serious disease, but low mortality.

300
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:37,050
The second time you're exposed to dengue is when you get hemorrhagic fever and the mortality gets to 20,

301
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:40,090
30%, depending on how good palliative care is.

302
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:45,000
It turns out Zika can be serve as that first thing infection.

303
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:50,970
And so Zika is implicated with respect to having a huge following.

304
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:54,280
The Zika outbreak that occurred.

305
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:59,470
We saw a lot of more severe the following season, a lot more severe dengue.

306
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:06,700
But even and in addition, Zika has caused serious complications for a fetus congenital infection,

307
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:13,989
which so it's actually in and of itself, but usually asymptomatic,

308
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:20,470
usually mild symptoms very hard to actually diagnose but can cause is microcephaly

309
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:29,710
congenital issue that we saw basically an epidemic of that in Latin America,

310
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:35,730
specifically Brazil. So.

311
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:42,720
And then Ebola again first emerged in 1976.

312
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:52,250
No symptoms. Again fever. Similar kind of broad spectrum dizzy symptoms.

313
00:41:54,050 --> 00:42:03,440
A certain presented those result in this hemorrhagic ailment that can be deadly through just lots of fluids.

314
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:12,140
So there was a 1976 outbreak in the Congo and Sudan.

315
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:17,310
There were subsequent outbreaks that were of limited size and scope.

316
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:28,100
So this was just known as a newly emerged pathogen that was very virulent, could cause a lot of disease, but the outbreaks were relatively small.

317
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:32,360
And so there was some attention paid to it, but not a huge amount of attention.

318
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:40,610
That changed in 2013, which was the largest recorded outbreak in West Africa.

319
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:44,320
We'll talk about a little bit more in the next slide. But it.

320
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:53,990
Was unique in that it was it moved into urban centers before it was was thought of as a rural rural disease.

321
00:42:55,070 --> 00:43:01,940
And then recently, there's an outbreak going on in Uganda.

322
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:11,540
Starting in September 20th, this is a good and a link to discussion about somebody on the ground with

323
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:20,239
respect to what it's like to be dealing with an outbreak of the Ebola outbreak.

324
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:31,250
And it's a nice, nice. Pleased to read that it summarizes this again, an ongoing theme that we've been talking about lack of resources,

325
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:36,140
lack of trust is a big cause of this ongoing outbreak.

326
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:46,970
And again, this theme is true for COVID in the U.S. It is true for Ebola in Africa.

327
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:58,940
So there's a little this some detail on this huge outbreak in West Africa that focused on Guinea,

328
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:08,720
Liberia and Sierra Leone and know it was started through this zoonotic transmission that occurred in December 2013.

329
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:14,840
And then after that, it was person to person spread that caused the outbreak.

330
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:22,460
You know, bats, that first transmission was likely from bats to humans.

331
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:27,560
This is a picture of where bats tend to live and children tend to play.

332
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:39,680
And these are just some statistics, 20,000, 28,000 cases, 11,000 deaths reported, largely likely underreported.

333
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:45,690
I talked about how the previous outbreaks have been rural.

334
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:47,760
This one was in urban areas.

335
00:44:48,420 --> 00:45:00,120
And just to highlight again that this outbreak is an example of how a pathogen exploits war torn resource poor regions with minimal infrastructure.

336
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:12,570
And that's the main susceptibility that this pathogen was able to exploit, causing this huge, huge outbreak.

337
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:20,230
These are just data from the from each of those countries.

338
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:29,640
August 2014, Joe declared an international public health crisis.

339
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:37,170
Again, a continuing theme theater and national response was criticized for being too little, too late.

340
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:42,270
And again, that's something that in public health we need to grapple with on how to.

341
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:46,780
Not respond. Too little, too late.

342
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:59,030
And it was controlled using traditional methods, contact tracing, looking for, you know, isolating symptomatic cases.

343
00:46:00,170 --> 00:46:06,640
And in this case, what was unique is is providing safe burial for the dead because of death.

344
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:19,760
That's a lot of that was a huge risk factor with respect to the funeral practices of people in this region that was exposing them to the pathogens.

345
00:46:22,790 --> 00:46:27,080
So. I'm going to end with this.

346
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:33,230
It's sort of introducing this convergence model, and this will be the focus of our discussion groups.

347
00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:39,979
So again, it's it's basically a little bit more detailed look at this,

348
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:47,150
the epidemiologic triad with respect to thinking about multiscale factors that impinge

349
00:46:47,150 --> 00:46:52,870
on the host microbe relationship and result in emerging or reemerging pathogens.

350
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:56,540
So these are just a list of different examples.

351
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:03,770
Microbial adaptation and change here human vulnerability.

352
00:47:03,770 --> 00:47:09,890
Increasing susceptibility due to malnutrition, immunosuppression, antibiotic resistance.

353
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:14,720
These are again themes that we've been talking about economic development and land use,

354
00:47:17,450 --> 00:47:24,490
resulting in more increased human exposure to the environment, the ability to transport infected products.

355
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:30,829
So the fact that we have this more centralized food distribution pattern.

356
00:47:30,830 --> 00:47:39,709
So then that's what Laura Baumann highlighted, that an outbreak that started in the law school in U of M takes you all the way to

357
00:47:39,710 --> 00:47:48,530
Arizona and California with respect to ultimate causes of that climate and weather.

358
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:56,130
Huge factor in. Emerging and reemerging diseases.

359
00:47:57,210 --> 00:48:02,580
Technology and an industry. So again, antibiotic use.

360
00:48:02,610 --> 00:48:07,260
Blood transfusions. Organ donations. Travel movement.

361
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:11,120
The speed of the travel, the extent in which we're traveling back and forth,

362
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:18,239
it increases the ability for pathogens to spread into new areas and then changing ecosystems,

363
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:32,520
deforestation and all of these anthropogenic changes that we are causing resulting in forces that that that promote the emergence of pathogens.

364
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:38,179
It's one more than the set. The lack of political will. War, famine.

365
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:50,059
Poverty. Intent to harm. These are all factors that we are facing and is resulting in huge burdens of diseases,

366
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:54,799
again, like cholera and typhoid and diseases that we tuberculosis.

367
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:58,170
That we know how to treat. We know how to deal with.

368
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:09,890
But these social forces are resulting nonetheless in this huge burden of disease and breakdown of public health measures, basic water and sanitation.

369
00:49:10,430 --> 00:49:15,650
So following earthquakes. Following hurricanes is where in?

370
00:49:17,690 --> 00:49:18,850
At least for the hurricanes,

371
00:49:18,870 --> 00:49:29,360
it's a climate change related factor that causes the loss of basic infrastructure and the lack of resilience in being able to address these kinds of.

372
00:49:32,390 --> 00:49:35,090
These kinds of extreme climate change.

373
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:46,830
And so last this last slide on prevention it emerged and so and but these are and these are themes that we've been talking about a lot.

374
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:50,400
You know, in order to prevent emerging infectious diseases,

375
00:49:50,400 --> 00:50:01,140
we need to increase our surveillance and our response to seeing new cases that are new and emerging.

376
00:50:02,190 --> 00:50:06,540
So we need to build on the surveillance system, has to be effective and has to work.

377
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:14,460
And we need to understand more about what it means to be surveilling populations over long time periods.

378
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:22,590
I'm part and a bunch of colleagues are part of this new emerging pathogen network and center funded by the NIH.

379
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:37,650
And there's a lot of focus on technology, a lot of focus on better ways to identify, better ways to measure new infections.

380
00:50:38,010 --> 00:50:45,990
But not a lot of attention, again, to the social factors and what does it mean to actually surveil a population long term.

381
00:50:46,290 --> 00:50:50,700
And so in going back to tomorrow's lecture from last week.

382
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:54,530
The need for a more applied research center stand.

383
00:50:55,520 --> 00:51:03,680
Some of these ways of developing new assays and new detections that can actually help with public health practice,

384
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:10,010
infrastructure and training again, need to develop and having a strong public health infrastructure.

385
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:22,230
Again putting these recent underappreciated. This is an under-appreciated need that often doesn't get the resources that we'd like it to get.

386
00:51:22,230 --> 00:51:26,370
And even in COVID, we've talked a lot about how these resources are being pulled back,

387
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:33,029
even as even though their people are doing important work and trying to vaccinate

388
00:51:33,030 --> 00:51:39,300
everybody and trying to identify and deal address pockets of sporadic infections.

389
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:52,190
And then moving that into prevention and control that's done efficiently and timely and not, you know, in this cycle is too little too late.

390
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:58,730
So. With that.

391
00:52:03,510 --> 00:52:13,200
I want to move to the session for everybody, the different groups.

392
00:52:14,430 --> 00:52:17,520
So the discussion question is to use the convergence model.

393
00:52:17,530 --> 00:52:28,649
So that Slide 28, I see the three models, three slides where I go over the convergence model to highlight how anthropogenic that is.

394
00:52:28,650 --> 00:52:36,090
Human caused changes can cause emergence and reemergence of following pathogens listed down here.

395
00:52:36,690 --> 00:52:45,870
So each group should field choose two examples and feel free to select others that I haven't listed here so inclined.

396
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:50,399
So the idea is to discuss which category is listed on slide eight where and

397
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:55,620
define the four categories of what defines an emerging or reemerging pathogen.

398
00:52:58,590 --> 00:53:00,480
So which which of these categories?

399
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:11,430
Again, it could be more than one false in your pathogen or example files in view and then provide an array of drivers environmental,

400
00:53:11,430 --> 00:53:16,200
social that has caused the emergence and reemergence of these patterns.

401
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:23,150
So trying to again integrate in all these different concepts, thinking that were added such as.

402
00:53:27,290 --> 00:53:45,470
Any questions or any serious issues or criticism.

403
00:53:52,550 --> 00:54:11,080
I'm just giving you actually make sure you can.

404
00:54:11,090 --> 00:54:28,180
I was there for the entire and above all, really got to show you where that I would say I think most people are trying to work out.

405
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:45,830
Yeah sorry slash communicating with each other is like them up there and they died.

406
00:54:45,830 --> 00:55:10,810
So it's worse when I was carrying on, guys. I know you were then with him and he was like, you know, so you were the first person,

407
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:33,850
which is that was just was more thing to time because I was thinking, Oh, that's a good idea.

408
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:38,770
You're in love with him. I happen to like very.

409
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:47,350
And you know, if they so sorry.

410
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:53,180
Yeah, no, you're right. So one of the main drivers is definitely travel.

411
00:55:53,420 --> 00:56:08,870
And no, I don't think it was the first time we saw him either with HIV.

412
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:13,340
It's like, yeah, because it is zoonotic.

413
00:56:14,330 --> 00:56:21,020
Yes, it started zoonotic and it was started with Richard.

414
00:56:21,590 --> 00:56:25,850
Yeah. So I mean, you're kind of race and that has to do more with hygiene practices.

415
00:56:26,450 --> 00:56:41,659
Graham has been in Syria to advise against changing stories.

416
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:45,090
Really? He was going over there?

417
00:56:45,200 --> 00:57:02,540
Yes, I suppose that has to do with both YouTube because HIV was also started as like a and what can I do for you?

418
00:57:05,870 --> 00:57:15,830
Oh, is this first of the categories from Slide eight? Yeah. Okay. So you know, you're not going to you guys are missing through this.

419
00:57:16,510 --> 00:57:38,030
Do you make it more. Yeah. So it sounds and you skepticism about is amazing.

420
00:57:38,750 --> 00:57:45,799
Yeah. So again it's hard to think of other something like oh that's like a no no no.

421
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:48,350
I was just wondering how you are going to respond to that.

422
00:57:49,550 --> 00:58:00,180
Oh you have anything like myself for I, I'm going to say that you were actually because for SaaS or for precise,

423
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:08,290
I'm just saying that it's necessary for a lot.

424
00:58:08,470 --> 00:58:16,940
Both of you. I think you're one of the most you know what I was going to say more variance.

425
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:21,080
But I just want to say like my guess is there are.

426
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:24,970
Yeah, it is. What is it about that?

427
00:58:26,830 --> 00:58:30,970
May be different from that giant microbots.

428
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:35,340
The other this competition.

429
00:58:36,910 --> 00:58:40,120
Which one you weren't going to be like?

430
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:50,290
When I got out of the journey of my first choice and I was like, Well, which were you thinking of?

431
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:56,680
Like, which in itself is just like, not true.

432
00:58:57,620 --> 00:59:05,810
I'm like, if I do, I don't know that I do know.

433
00:59:05,870 --> 00:59:11,920
Okay. So I know that I know that HIV itself was like just covered, you know,

434
00:59:12,010 --> 00:59:16,749
like when they realized that there was some sort somehow there was some sort of monkey to human resource agent.

435
00:59:16,750 --> 00:59:20,990
And that's how they kind of understood that the virus jumped into a human.

436
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:25,330
I became one, but then that one was spread person to person.

437
00:59:25,510 --> 00:59:31,040
Like sex really is like the main drivers and the challenges of drug use.

438
00:59:31,190 --> 00:59:36,450
I'm not leaving behind potential for something more than she wants to be,

439
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:42,759
but I'm not sure that actually has a lot to do with the I don't know the person to person or I don't know that story.

440
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:47,220
And so I kind of feel like that that's I think so.

441
00:59:48,650 --> 01:00:11,290
But also, my God, what am I supposed to do in the sense that they're saying, you know, so right now this is so there's no signs of slowing down.

442
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:27,440
And I was like brand new, you know, I was like, yes.

443
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:41,140
And she told me, she said, well, you can make sorry, go back.

444
01:00:42,580 --> 01:01:09,670
Several people thought I having a coming and it was talking to my treating me it's like is back in isolation like persistence I would say it's like,

445
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:18,460
oh, another one of these gonorrhea is not what it is.

446
01:01:23,110 --> 01:01:35,559
I don't want to just just create the impression that, you know, so it's a purely economic analyst giving environmental groups.

447
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:40,420
But it was about how I learned convinced.

448
01:01:40,450 --> 01:01:43,570
You know, it's just pretty complex.

449
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:59,860
And I believe the biggest return on investment is the Orioles because they were the ones we don't have like in the lab.

450
01:01:59,860 --> 01:02:16,080
We have no less footage around like, wow, this is something like there's not enough data for everyone.

451
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:30,340
Like it's a survivorship issue to like.

452
01:02:31,150 --> 01:02:35,440
I think even initially that I was making assumptions.

453
01:02:35,530 --> 01:02:41,740
Reagan I mean, she really didn't want to do it because basically you probably deserved it.

454
01:02:41,860 --> 01:02:44,960
So let's just talk about so yeah, this is crazy.

455
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:51,070
But yeah, so there was a lot of legs, there wasn't a lot of medical attention.

456
01:02:51,070 --> 01:02:57,190
That's why there was a lot of grassroots movement with HIV was because a lot of people didn't care because it was game.

457
01:02:58,810 --> 01:03:04,120
But then I just feels didn't to just say no to drugs. They never thought of that.

458
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:13,760
Yeah. Yeah, I was just wondering which was, I was so happy for them to change anything.

459
01:03:15,730 --> 01:03:20,670
So little rejection contributors. Yeah. And social.

460
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:27,440
Political. There's no super. Right.

461
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:32,530
But it's not, like. Interesting. Yeah. It seems like it's sometimes.

462
01:03:32,550 --> 01:03:35,630
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

463
01:03:37,270 --> 01:03:41,680
Why? I think it's kind of like.

464
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:48,830
Yeah. Yeah. Whether they're. Yeah, that's a big one.

465
01:03:48,830 --> 01:03:51,350
Because obviously, if you're interested in dexterity,

466
01:03:52,100 --> 01:04:05,719
that's something that's definitely going to make people think of the girl that was that was going to be because

467
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:13,450
that would kind of increase your pathogenicity if you're living in like a really serious society versus you.

468
01:04:13,780 --> 01:04:21,530
Yeah, exactly. Like, how do you want to keep her as an otherwise?

469
01:04:21,530 --> 01:04:34,069
It's like she's also stressed that he doesn't know himself as impulsive.

470
01:04:34,070 --> 01:04:38,120
Like Alex would be. Great news. So it's going to be great, but.

471
01:04:38,210 --> 01:04:50,670
So, I don't know. I don't have the time to work for you.

472
01:04:54,060 --> 01:05:06,200
But one thing I learned and I missed so much work outside of work is like I'm still not even really like,

473
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:12,890
not on purpose of like, oh, my God, I'm so sorry. Like, that's disgusting. And it's hard to get work.

474
01:05:14,990 --> 01:05:18,830
It was so tragic because it's like you're running leaves.

475
01:05:18,830 --> 01:05:25,320
You have a blog that was so much fun.

476
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:44,300
And I also like simply because it was more like, you know, so to kind of I was being examined.

477
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:50,690
So I did similar types of discussions.

478
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:57,590
Okay, let's start there reporting back. You start with one.

479
01:05:59,940 --> 01:06:08,280
So we chose cedars and antibiotic resistance as our to pick.

480
01:06:08,940 --> 01:06:15,060
And we said that for seniors for the categories it would fall into.

481
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:23,670
But the agent is more pathogenic, less virulent or less susceptible, and that it is an increased incidence in endemic areas.

482
01:06:25,230 --> 01:06:34,440
And we said the same for antibiotic resistance, but we also added expansion into areas not previously present because mostly amniotic

483
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:38,219
resistance used to be mostly found in like hospitals and long term care facilities,

484
01:06:38,220 --> 01:06:40,950
but now it's becoming more common in the population.

485
01:06:40,950 --> 01:06:50,910
So we kind of thought that we said some drivers for Edith were the use of antibiotics or like the overuse or misuse of antibiotics,

486
01:06:52,230 --> 01:06:56,760
things like close living conditions and long term care facilities,

487
01:06:58,050 --> 01:07:01,470
recent hospitalization or like hospitalization practices in general,

488
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:09,600
and then things like GI surgery, feeding to and then cleaning products being used.

489
01:07:10,770 --> 01:07:17,790
And for robotic resistance, we said that the drivers were again, normal use or misuse or overuse of antibiotics.

490
01:07:18,540 --> 01:07:19,590
We said also like.

491
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:31,050
Capitalism because like the costume, developing new antibiotics is not cost effective compared to developing drugs for like long term diseases.

492
01:07:31,830 --> 01:07:36,180
Antibiotic use in agriculture. And then also just like hospital practices.

493
01:07:38,010 --> 01:07:39,180
Great. Actually,

494
01:07:39,330 --> 01:07:51,420
I was going to bring up the the issue that people are not developing new companies and developing new antibiotics because of the cost incentives.

495
01:07:51,420 --> 01:07:55,470
And that's a huge deal because at the beginning of the antibiotic resistance.

496
01:07:57,640 --> 01:08:04,180
Issue. We were getting second and third generation antibiotics and they were being effective.

497
01:08:04,630 --> 01:08:08,000
And that was one way. People were dealing with it.

498
01:08:08,010 --> 01:08:09,149
But yeah,

499
01:08:09,150 --> 01:08:16,770
there's no there's no the cost structure is not there's no incentive to be developing new antibiotics and it becomes harder and harder to do it.

500
01:08:16,770 --> 01:08:21,060
Do you get another third or fourth generation?

501
01:08:24,420 --> 01:08:27,930
Antibiotic that's going to be effective.

502
01:08:28,050 --> 01:08:32,320
So. SMITH Yes.

503
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:35,080
And and you mentioned at the end of the day,

504
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:45,760
the use of antibiotics in animals also likely has increased this geographic range where we see antibiotics.

505
01:08:46,220 --> 01:08:54,190
And we're studying a fairly remote area in Ecuador that due to the Gates Foundation is pushing.

506
01:08:54,700 --> 01:08:58,359
This is happening globally, chicken farming as a micro industry.

507
01:08:58,360 --> 01:09:02,350
And that part of that chicken farming is the use of antibiotics as growth promoters.

508
01:09:02,860 --> 01:09:09,309
And so now all of a sudden people are getting exposed to antibiotics in these much more remote

509
01:09:09,310 --> 01:09:15,580
areas that don't necessarily have access to human antibiotic the degree that people do here.

510
01:09:18,790 --> 01:09:28,569
Great. Any other thoughts on? I have a group team for one of the pathogens.

511
01:09:28,570 --> 01:09:33,260
We also chose antibiotic resistance and we kind of said similar things.

512
01:09:33,280 --> 01:09:39,790
We also just talked to that about how bacteria have a significant ability to adapt and mutate to develop resistance.

513
01:09:41,090 --> 01:09:47,180
We talked about agricultural intensification and the inappropriate use of antibiotics as.

514
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:55,860
Also just general, like increased environmental interaction and deforestation and ecological habitat destruction

515
01:09:55,860 --> 01:10:04,740
might like introduce the population to more microbes and that we don't have antibiotics for.

516
01:10:08,060 --> 01:10:12,190
We also talked more on the capitalism aspects that like.

517
01:10:13,830 --> 01:10:17,970
In the future. We don't have as many antibiotics available that do work.

518
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:26,910
People in lower US populations might not be able to afford those drugs and so they might be help disparity with that.

519
01:10:27,860 --> 01:10:34,310
And then our second pathogen, we chose Ebola, which we considered as like a newly emerging pathogen.

520
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:43,400
And we talked about just environmental and climate exposure or like climate change and increasing exposure to the environment.

521
01:10:45,330 --> 01:10:49,860
How poverty and war contributes to a lack of public health infrastructure.

522
01:10:49,860 --> 01:10:58,830
That doesn't give the government ability to inform the public about how diseases spread and how to mitigate it,

523
01:10:59,310 --> 01:11:03,600
and also little ability to implement outbreak interventions like quarantining.

524
01:11:05,910 --> 01:11:16,950
There's no vaccine and no previous immunity. Social practices such as burial rituals or bushmeat consumption might lead to more spillover events.

525
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:23,489
And at the end of bushmeat piece, which I didn't mention,

526
01:11:23,490 --> 01:11:30,149
is when I mean that that is the whole need for communities to move into these forest

527
01:11:30,150 --> 01:11:36,930
regions for a variety of reasons to actually sustain themselves and get meat and food.

528
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:42,150
This causes increased exposure through primates, through bats.

529
01:11:43,670 --> 01:11:49,040
Yeah. So, um, what was your first pathogen?

530
01:11:49,850 --> 01:11:54,020
Oh, antibiotic resistance. Oh, in general, I think so.

531
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:58,149
Yeah. So that's so. Yeah.

532
01:11:58,150 --> 01:12:01,219
Again, Ebola. No, no, it's deadly.

533
01:12:01,220 --> 01:12:09,790
It's not that infectious. It's actually, you know, we would think it's we know what it would take to mitigate in, you know,

534
01:12:10,310 --> 01:12:21,860
politically unstable areas with not a lot of public health infrastructure stigma associated with practices makes it very hard to address.

535
01:12:27,770 --> 01:12:33,260
Group three. Yeah. So we also took a stab at antibiotic resistance as well as HIV.

536
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:41,109
A popular one. Yes. So two points that we kind of touched on that may not have been covered as much so far

537
01:12:41,110 --> 01:12:49,209
as the nuance of clinical versus public health interest in antibiotic resistance.

538
01:12:49,210 --> 01:12:54,070
So the fact that doctors are going to probably overprescribe antibiotics because they really want to take care of their patients,

539
01:12:54,070 --> 01:12:57,400
even though like from a public health standpoint, that's not necessarily advisable.

540
01:12:58,120 --> 01:13:03,249
So that's one big factor. And then kind of going off of what another group pointed out about how it's not

541
01:13:03,250 --> 01:13:09,940
necessarily financially advantageous in a capitalist system to get more antibiotics,

542
01:13:09,940 --> 01:13:13,569
it's also not advantageous in a lot of cases to make vaccines.

543
01:13:13,570 --> 01:13:21,320
So especially for like bacterial species, developing vaccines is less profitable than just continuing to throw antibiotics.

544
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:28,330
That curable disease is curable regardless of the morbidity and mortality, which is going to contribute to antibiotic resistance.

545
01:13:28,330 --> 01:13:34,150
Because if we can just eliminate the disease or even control it better, I'm not going to prescribe as many antibiotics.

546
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:45,880
And then for HIV, we were looking at category three classification, increased incidence in endemic areas.

547
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:48,760
Globalization, globalization.

548
01:13:48,760 --> 01:14:00,550
And, you know, increased travel contributes to that stigmatization of doses, can reduce care seeking and promotion for transmission.

549
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:10,600
Political and capitalist factors that contribute to high cost of treatment will contribute to spread as well as,

550
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:18,159
like the hype or stigmatization, as like a gay disease that's still carried forward and then microbial adaptations and changes.

551
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:24,729
So the genetic variability of HIV complicates creation of a vaccine.

552
01:14:24,730 --> 01:14:33,940
And so, I mean, you had this sociopolitical issues with HIV are huge.

553
01:14:34,180 --> 01:14:45,850
And it's it's to me, a great example of how it moves from as if when it emerges, it's you know,

554
01:14:45,850 --> 01:14:53,590
there's there's not as broadly as copay, but it's hitting a bi spectrum, a socioeconomic.

555
01:14:55,990 --> 01:15:00,970
Whoops. But as we move forward, it's fitting.

556
01:15:00,980 --> 01:15:07,480
It's finding its ecologic niche of a better word in areas in people that are

557
01:15:07,780 --> 01:15:18,189
less politically powerful and less economically to move from in California,

558
01:15:18,190 --> 01:15:27,280
from San Francisco, as being the center in the gay population to now Oakland being the center and single

559
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:34,000
black moms and lower socioeconomic status as economic as this foci of transportation.

560
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:37,560
You can see that theme in diarrheal disease.

561
01:15:37,570 --> 01:15:51,610
You can see that theme in all sorts of across the spectrum that we see this kind of move into these other disadvantaged areas, disadvantaged groups.

562
01:15:52,210 --> 01:15:56,020
So. Good.

563
01:16:01,770 --> 01:16:05,120
So we chose SaaS and HIPAA to talk about.

564
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:11,740
You guys kind of in touch on a lot of the things you probably do, but also. So SaaS,

565
01:16:12,550 --> 01:16:18,220
we were saying that one of the main drivers now is a lot of travel that happens like between

566
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:22,840
across oceanic travel and all kinds of different things and instances of respiratory virus.

567
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:26,710
That kind of puts a lot of people at risk in a very short amount of time.

568
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:38,559
So we are also saying that so the virus itself has evolved and different variants have different properties that have been changing quickly over time.

569
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:41,680
And there's been a lot of political rejection of control measures,

570
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:46,930
as well as political attacks on public health organizations and public health and public figures,

571
01:16:46,930 --> 01:16:53,980
as well as misinformation, which we all saw during the pandemic that really changed the landscape of how it can be spread.

572
01:16:55,240 --> 01:17:02,680
We also were talking about differential access to care and testing and an ability to quarantine based off of what you do for a living.

573
01:17:03,490 --> 01:17:06,790
If you're in a densely populated area, those kind of chain of transmission.

574
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:14,129
And then we also talked about that there was like a lack of international trust as well as a lack of

575
01:17:14,130 --> 01:17:19,560
complete information sharing that really influence the public's trust in public health institutions.

576
01:17:21,930 --> 01:17:25,950
And also with HIV, since it was a zoo, not a pathogen at the beginning,

577
01:17:26,700 --> 01:17:35,370
it kind of it was I was saying that was maybe both Category one and Category four, as in like it kind of was a new emergency, like a new pathogen.

578
01:17:35,370 --> 01:17:39,540
But it was also just an expansion of this city into humans.

579
01:17:41,970 --> 01:17:48,090
There was a lot of, you know, person to person transmission. So a lot of the social drivers are what influence transmission with that.

580
01:17:48,990 --> 01:17:54,270
And then there was still a lot of social stigma from religious institutions and from political

581
01:17:54,270 --> 01:17:59,400
figures that decreased prevention measures and also decreased treatment efforts in the beginning.

582
01:18:00,570 --> 01:18:10,230
And then with that, there's also now kind of a difference between people who have access to help to testing and getting proper treatment for HIV.

583
01:18:12,140 --> 01:18:23,240
You take it because in HIV, you talk much about how in Africa it is heterosexual disease and probably transmitted for decades before.

584
01:18:23,250 --> 01:18:34,800
And I mean, definitely there are some accounts that the early 1900 just for emerging masses of gay population in the US.

585
01:18:35,830 --> 01:18:40,840
So that's also a very stark difference in how we view.

586
01:18:42,030 --> 01:18:46,830
Transmission modes across different parts of the world.

587
01:18:52,180 --> 01:19:05,169
Gripped by. So we picked the in Colorado, we kind of had basically the same answer in terms of what was on our category.

588
01:19:05,170 --> 01:19:09,880
We thought it would be sort of fall into the three and four categories.

589
01:19:10,240 --> 01:19:19,630
I mean, the reasons for emergence or reemergence of infrastructure, sewage, things like urbanization, poverty,

590
01:19:20,230 --> 01:19:28,610
finding change, we said natural disasters like earthquakes, things like the Haiti earthquake triggered factors.

591
01:19:30,610 --> 01:19:36,500
Yeah. Cholera is, again, like like influenza.

592
01:19:37,250 --> 01:19:40,760
You've seen cholera pandemics throughout history.

593
01:19:41,410 --> 01:19:51,050
And again, now it's you know, it was hitting 1800s in the U.S. and Europe.

594
01:19:51,770 --> 01:19:59,819
And now as we move to states mostly in really underserved, politically unstable areas where we.
