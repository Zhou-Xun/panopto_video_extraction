1
00:00:08,623 --> 00:00:10,351
Welcome, you've made it to Unit 3,

2
00:00:10,351 --> 00:00:14,650
let's talk about what we're
going to cover in this unit.

3
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:17,831
We actually have two major topics
that we'll focus on in unit 3.

4
00:00:17,831 --> 00:00:22,124
The first is climate change and
the second, very much interrelated topic,

5
00:00:22,124 --> 00:00:24,730
is sustainability.

6
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:27,990
So what are we actually going to talk
about when we discuss climate change?

7
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:28,998
There's a number of issues.

8
00:00:28,998 --> 00:00:33,290
I'm going to give you an introduction to
and discuss the basics of climate change.

9
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:37,274
I'll give you some global and local
examples or indicators of climate change.

10
00:00:37,274 --> 00:00:40,930
We'll talk about global and
local climate change policy.

11
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:44,520
We're also very much going to focus on
some key health impacts associated with

12
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,510
climate change.

13
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,624
As well as how those impacts will differ
across countries around the world.

14
00:00:49,624 --> 00:00:52,163
And finally, we'll talk about
are two major strategies for

15
00:00:52,163 --> 00:00:53,472
dealing with climate change.

16
00:00:53,472 --> 00:00:55,830
Which are mitigation and adaptation.

17
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,106
That's what we'll talk about.

18
00:00:57,106 --> 00:00:58,608
What you're going to do,

19
00:00:58,608 --> 00:01:02,376
are brainstorm some of the potential
impacts of climate change.

20
00:01:02,376 --> 00:01:07,350
Identify ways we might be able to
evaluate climate change policy impacts.

21
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:12,977
Explore ways for us to visualize climate
change and evaluate changes in climate.

22
00:01:12,977 --> 00:01:16,140
And finally, work in a group to
describe some policy issues and

23
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,040
approaches to addressing climate change.

24
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,140
When we're done with that,
we'll move on to sustainability.

25
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,700
We're going to talk about
a number of things.

26
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,082
I'll give you an introduction to
the concepts of sustainability and energy.

27
00:01:28,082 --> 00:01:31,165
We're going to talk about different
types of energy sources and

28
00:01:31,165 --> 00:01:34,240
we'll specifically focus
on the problem with coal.

29
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:39,086
I'll give you some examples of efficiency
as a way to achieve sustainability.

30
00:01:39,086 --> 00:01:43,250
We'll talk about some of the major
conceptual sustainability frameworks.

31
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:47,299
And finally, we'll talk about next
steps in promoting sustainability and

32
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:48,507
sustainable energy.

33
00:01:48,507 --> 00:01:49,914
That's what we'll talk about.

34
00:01:49,914 --> 00:01:53,310
What you're going to do is actually
explore your own personal carbon

35
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:53,961
footprint.

36
00:01:53,961 --> 00:01:58,670
And identify ways to increase
sustainability in your own life.

37
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:01,720
So finally, by the end of unit 3 you're
going to have an understanding of

38
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,100
the basic concepts of climate change and
sustainability.

39
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:09,430
You'll be aware of the impacts of climate
change as well as energy sources on

40
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,600
human health,
as well as on the environment.

41
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,974
You're going to be able to
describe some policy approaches to

42
00:02:14,974 --> 00:02:17,613
help us manage the impacts
of climate change.

43
00:02:17,613 --> 00:02:21,479
And, most importantly, on a personal note,
you should have a better idea of

44
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:24,348
the impacts that your lifestyle
has on sustainability.

45
00:02:24,348 --> 00:02:29,461
As well as on climate change at the local,
all the way out to the global level.
