1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,879
The quiz results. I had a student grader do most of the grading.

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,540
I did take a last look earlier today through everything.

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:17,610
But if there's further questions or concerns, let me know and we can dig back into that.

4
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,620
I didn't want to spend a whole lot of time on that today.

5
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:30,180
I'm just wondering, trying to think if there are any main questions that a lot of people struggle with,

6
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:35,520
any general questions before we start today on the quiz.

7
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:42,910
Again, it's only 20% of your grade. There's another quiz. There's a lot of other opportunities if you weren't happy completely with your score.

8
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:49,069
I know sometimes it's multiple choice, other easy at the time, but it does come losing points at chunks.

9
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:53,340
And it's frustrating because there's not much. So you can show your work and things like that.

10
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:59,190
So. But if you didn't do as well as you thought you wanted to, please hang in there.

11
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:06,270
Like I said, there's there's more opportunities with other types of ways with that, let's take a look at the syllabus.

12
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,240
So I have posted problem set number one.

13
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:18,450
So this is entering the second unit I've been talking about where we dove into a lot more technical aspects of the occupational side of chemical

14
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:27,720
exposures and with the problems that kind of help get you to interact with some of the resources we've been talking about and also some of the.

15
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:32,840
Quantitative or technical aspects that we'll discuss.

16
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:36,610
So the promise that's been posted know that you have two weeks to do it.

17
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:40,790
So I want to stress this as hard as I can.

18
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:48,520
Don't try not to wait till two weeks from now to start it because there are two weeks.

19
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:55,339
It does kind of track with the material coming in class. So the first few problems are things you can probably do any time you want.

20
00:01:55,340 --> 00:02:00,560
Now is some of the resources we've been talking about, you know, finding the chemical of interest,

21
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:10,489
seeing what other agencies and places say about the chemical, and then getting some experience with that, the series of those questions.

22
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:13,670
And then we get into more some more technical ones later on.

23
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:16,760
But it's just if you try to do it all at once, it would take a long time.

24
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,860
So I think you can knock a few of these out.

25
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:27,890
Sort of tracking with each lecture coming up in the next couple of weeks would be a much more manageable to go by you on that handwritten or type,

26
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,739
whatever you're comfortable with.

27
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:43,520
I'll put up a submission thing on the canvas so you know, you want to show your work for calculations if you can easily do that.

28
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,769
But yeah, I think most people probably do typed out.

29
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:54,650
But there are some problems where you might do some plotting, so you have access to the graph paper.

30
00:02:55,100 --> 00:03:00,080
We can talk about that in future lectures that obviously you can scan 50.

31
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:13,010
Any other questions? Okay.

32
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:19,820
Yeah. So the first few questions are really just kind of getting to know some of those resources and we'll talk about some of today as well,

33
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:26,240
some we've already touched on. All right. So that's today, Thursday.

34
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:34,190
If you're free, there's the afternoon seminar about the health hazard evaluations from one of my former students,

35
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:37,380
James Couch, who's in charge of that whole program.

36
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:40,630
It just happens to be, you know, those who are dead.

37
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:45,230
But before I even knew that, I had covered this assignment.

38
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:50,110
So we'll talk about that next time. That's another one where you'll have quite a bit of time to work on it.

39
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:54,290
But I want to get it assigned, you know, with ample time for you guys to think about it.

40
00:03:54,290 --> 00:04:04,220
So we'll talk about that on Thursday. Today, we're going to do sort of a shift of gears to really think about occupational settings.

41
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:15,660
So for those of you in industrial hygiene, hopefully this is for some of you might be, you know, some review, but hopefully you'll find it useful.

42
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:22,950
And those of you not industrial hygiene, just kind of think about how this would apply to maybe your interest experiences

43
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:27,210
because while this stuff is useful well beyond the occupational setting.

44
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:37,040
Okay. So occupational hygiene or industrial hygiene, there's different terms people use.

45
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:42,589
This is a very old policy, very old, a profession that, as I've mentioned before,

46
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:49,120
kind of helped trigger the environmental sciences because there were such extreme exposures of settings.

47
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:58,750
While the techniques we talk about did. Sort of come about through through development within the architecture.

48
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:04,330
So it is the environmental science of anticipating, recognizing, evaluating and controlling.

49
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:11,889
I think you'll see that series of four terms a lot as we talk about this anticipation, recognition,

50
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:15,430
evaluation and control health hazards in the working environment with the

51
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:19,160
objectives of protecting workers health and safeguarding the community at large.

52
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:22,420
So as a profession within environmental and health sciences, but as we'll see today,

53
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:26,590
it's very scientific, but more and more it's also becoming more managerial.

54
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:34,990
Managerial skills are also very important, which, you know, if you apply that to somebody doing environmental science, a lot of the same things apply.

55
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:42,010
So back to our exposure to disease paradigm.

56
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:46,870
So what the impetus for this is a lot of occupational disease out there.

57
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:56,240
We've touched on this a bit. So what we want to do is go upstream and try to identify the hazards before exposure,

58
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,130
exposure, dose occurs and manage and control those before that happens.

59
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:04,420
So controlling the environment is a big part of the goal here.

60
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:14,230
Here's a very old figure from a textbook. Again, we're talking about these terms anticipation, recognition, evaluation, control through those today.

61
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:23,800
So anticipation is just like knowing the field, knowing what's possible to be able to have what you need to do the rest of the steps.

62
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:34,520
So, you know, taking a class like this, reading the book chapter, if I had to know the author of one of those is not to.

63
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:44,480
Perkins. No, not Perkins anyway.

64
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:52,940
Anticipations, recognition. So we'll get into, you know, what approaches can use to recognize the possible hazards out there.

65
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:56,600
How do you get a much more formal evaluation?

66
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:04,580
And then with that information, how do you prevent that exposure the best you can that gets into controls?

67
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:13,550
So a little bit of terminology. So again, just trying to compare and contrast occupational environmental again.

68
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:22,370
Hopefully you guys will be trained to cover the gamut because that's what today's job market a lot of times is is looking like, which is great.

69
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:26,090
But again, historically, they've been sort of separate fields.

70
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:34,320
So you might see terminology that is sort of giving up, giving up, getting at the same thing, but just a little bit variability there.

71
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:42,200
So on the occupational side, on the left, you have anticipatory recognition evaluation controlled in time off, whereas on the right, the anticipation.

72
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:46,999
Recognition is is equal to hazard identification that we talked about, say with the risk assessments,

73
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:55,190
dose evaluation you go into exposure assessment is a big one that we focus on, but also some of the toxicity and risk control.

74
00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:00,420
You see the term risk management when we talk about the pillars of risks.

75
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:02,280
Risk assessment earlier in the semester.

76
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:11,999
And then, you know whether you call it hazard communication, that's you'll see that reference a lot in occupational hazard communication,

77
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,380
whereas environmental setting is referred to more as risk communication.

78
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:24,970
So again, going back to those four main points, let's start with anticipation.

79
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:32,830
So this is having the knowledge, skills and training to be able to address these things and to do the other three steps.

80
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:39,550
Bottom line is we want to be proactive, both health and safety. So that requires us to be knowledgeable about it.

81
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:47,500
And ideally, you know, you get at this before a facility or a process is even designed.

82
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:53,110
You'd be involved with the engineers, with the product, people, whatever team you have.

83
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:58,810
They would have somebody who knows occupational exposure to be able to say, that's probably a bad idea.

84
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,730
That's going to really overexpose people.

85
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:07,660
In reality, a lot of times these things already exist and we come in and advise them on how to how to make it better.

86
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:14,290
And then as we'll talk about more of a systems approach as opposed to just kind of putting out fires,

87
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:20,440
if they come, you want to have a grasp of the entire landscape, which is a much more organized way to go about it.

88
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:28,310
So anticipating hazards, maybe driving down the freeway, probably seeing something like this, all of us.

89
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,700
Right. Probably some exposures going on in these walls.

90
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:37,980
Right. Do we know what they are? Can we anticipate what's happening here?

91
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:46,140
Probably want more information, right? We know based on our training, we have some ideas of what might go on in a building like this.

92
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:51,509
But there are tons of different things that might be happening in these walls. I grew up watching The Simpsons.

93
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:54,560
I apologize for the David reference. I think it's actually still on.

94
00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:00,950
But, you know, there could be a lot of different types of things going on in a factory like that.

95
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:04,110
You have like, you know, a duff duff beer.

96
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,100
They make that that has its own hazards associated with it.

97
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:15,270
I think this one might be my favorite. It's just a smoke factory so that it's highly polluting.

98
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:21,510
Sausage factory, a pillow factory, Play-Doh factory where you can get the idea.

99
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:29,400
You have a lot of different things being made, a lot of inputs and outputs and processes that are going to make up what the hazards might be.

100
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:33,930
I never pass up an opportunity to make fun of suburbia.

101
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:40,890
So, you know, Cheesecake Factory, you know, with a manufacturing facility that, you know, it's a restaurant where, you know,

102
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:47,310
despite the name, the hazards are probably more in the kitchen and cooking rather than what you'd see the manufacturing.

103
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:50,730
So more locally here.

104
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:57,660
You could do this for any region, wherever you're from. You can think about what kinds of things things are produced here.

105
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:07,320
Auto manufacturing, of course, is big in Michigan, and with that comes a ton of different aspects that are related to hazards.

106
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:16,680
So you have, you know, foundry work, even mining River Rouge plant here, a lot of things coming in and going out.

107
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,770
A lot of buildings like this in this area, we'll drive by the wonder, what is that?

108
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:27,210
It's just assembly. Are there other things going on? What parts of assembly are happening?

109
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:35,220
And again, we need to know more information. So this is a piece of a car being painted.

110
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:39,930
So that's an example of something that might be going on within that type of facility.

111
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:45,840
There's a lot of metal, not as much as there used to be in cars.

112
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:51,030
This goes right up in there. We talked about metal working fluids. He's got his face a few inches away.

113
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:54,090
Maybe not the best idea without any sort of controls.

114
00:11:54,090 --> 00:12:00,630
But, you know, this is another setup that could lead to various hazards depending on how it's done and what's being used.

115
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:07,340
Welding. Another example to get to all the parts together, the metal parts together.

116
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:11,990
There's a lot of hazards associated with welding and related tasks.

117
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,910
A lot of different maintenance or facilities like that are just huge.

118
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:23,390
So in addition to the actual work of putting the car together, you have all kinds of other things that go on to maintain the space.

119
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:29,240
Whatever is near this one happens to be, you know, they're blasting a tank to be resurfaced or something.

120
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:35,210
And we talked about a brace of blasting is just one of the nastiest jobs out there.

121
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,630
So you have the surface surface profile.

122
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:46,060
They're shooting a blasting agent at high speeds, something very small, and it helps break up what's going on.

123
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:52,220
And then it can be repainted or whatever they do just all kinds of different metal surfaces on wall surfaces as well.

124
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:57,800
And historically, this agent would be Sam, which, as we've mentioned,

125
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:03,080
big trouble because it's being obliterated into very small particles that that's good.

126
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:08,210
There's also other types of blasting and some metals. Various types of metals might be used.

127
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:12,670
Other mind minerals. For that.

128
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,790
So again, a lot of different things might be going on.

129
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:24,010
I mentioned foundry work, other metal forging type of things to get those metal parts in the shape you need.

130
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:29,650
For instance, making a car that has its own set of hazards.

131
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:38,200
So obviously what makes that up? But you also have some physical hazards here as well with the extreme heat involved.

132
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:47,860
Cars are becoming more high tech and global in the supply chain.

133
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:54,490
As we saw during COVID. If any of you were in the car market at all the last couple of years, it was very,

134
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:57,940
very difficult to get a new car for a while there because there was a shortage of

135
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:02,890
chips to be put in because they have controls for everything in cars these days.

136
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:08,020
Heated seats in the tills and the radio and everything else.

137
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:15,150
So this is just an example of where, you know, potentially chip making has a lot of different processes involved.

138
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:20,080
Again, a whole set of hazards that you might encounter. Here they're wearing PPE.

139
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:27,730
That's great, right? In places like this, usually the PPE is actually not to protect the worker, it's to protect the product.

140
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:40,549
So that's something to keep in mind as well. And then if you go far back enough in the supply chain, there's some mining involved back in the day.

141
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:48,440
They have the power of the plant with coal probably the also a metal mining too to get them that we for the steel now.

142
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:53,389
So if you look at the whole lifecycle of any product you can acquire to have attached

143
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:58,250
to a lot of these different types of industries that all have various hazards.

144
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:04,310
So down here, you know, you're underground. These are some mining pictures.

145
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:11,520
What are some hazards you can anticipate here? Well, 2000 and the left are not wearing masks.

146
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:15,150
Yeah. Yeah. So what do you think they might be exposed to?

147
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:26,190
So yeah, resveratrol dust is a big one for mining around radon.

148
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:36,320
You know, underground geology will have higher, lower levels of radon, which is a small particle that gets inhaled,

149
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,280
and then those alpha rays can damage the lungs once they get in there.

150
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:44,900
So it's kind of a combination between some of the chemical physical aspects of.

151
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:50,010
The aerosols we're talking about with a physical hazard as well.

152
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:57,780
Any others you could think of looking at this is using a jackhammer on the bottom left, and that's a physical hazard.

153
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:02,840
Hold vibration. You can, you know, cycle him out every so often.

154
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:07,889
So it's not getting such prolonged exposures. Mm hmm. Yeah, just some physical hazard for sure.

155
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:13,170
And it's probably. Wow, this guy is worth something here. Protection. Diesel particulate matter.

156
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:19,650
Diesel particulate matter? Yeah, depending on what kind of machinery, what else involving machinery might be of concern.

157
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:26,440
Falling someone? Yeah. What? Chemically.

158
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:31,660
Are you interested and concerned at all about running engines in a confined space?

159
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:42,819
Exhaust. Exhaust. So we talked about a spec since carbon monoxide might be produced, which would be a big concern if you're in enclosed space,

160
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:46,870
there's no ventilation, so there's no shortage of hazards for sure.

161
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:50,590
And we're only scratching the surface, really, but no pun intended.

162
00:16:52,560 --> 00:17:00,860
So there's all kinds of ways, places you can go to find more information on anticipation.

163
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:07,680
Recognition. But one of the classics here, and not the easiest in the field to push for the industrial hygiene students,

164
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:11,460
but you may get exposed to some of the unintended.

165
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:19,020
I'm on a roll today, but this is a good one if if it's a little old now.

166
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:26,940
But it does have a range of industry in one or more detailed write ups of not only the processors but the hazards involved.

167
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:37,830
So that's that I did post on there is Chapter five and Perkins if you're interested as a pretty in-depth on a range of processes as well.

168
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,240
And then this website.

169
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:50,040
If you go to the left, have there has some various industries and sort of descriptions of the process and how that might present.

170
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,390
That's one way to get some of that info.

171
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:02,409
From the book chapter that was assigned. Here again are some I showed some of these examples in pictures.

172
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:10,780
But here's just listing some of the. The processes that we know present a lot of hazards.

173
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:15,159
This isn't a final exhaustive. It's just some of the more common, more dangerous ones out there.

174
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:21,340
So abrasive, blasting, acid treatments, blending and mixing can create a lot of dusts,

175
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:28,390
cleaning, use, a lot of cleaning supplies, which can contain solvents and other things.

176
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:37,300
I'm not going to read this to you. This is for your reference. Crushing and sizing obviously gets some small particulate going decreasing.

177
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:45,430
Decreasing is actually a very common process that they use in industry.

178
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:49,600
You don't think about it because it doesn't really get to the final product,

179
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:54,480
but they use a lot of resources in the metal working and then they have to clean it off to go to the next steps.

180
00:18:54,490 --> 00:19:02,590
They use a lot of trickery sort of set. You know, the most effective degreaser is probably a lot of times more toxic solvents and things like that.

181
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:09,490
So that's why a lot of these things are still around, like trichloroethylene and others, because they are very effective at what they do.

182
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:15,640
But we now know that they're quite toxic. Electroplating uses a lot of heavy metals.

183
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:24,129
Well, the hexavalent chromium literature comes from from that type of operation as well, forging furnace operation.

184
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:27,340
So a lot of hot work with the metals. Get some fumes.

185
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:32,169
Other things. Grinding, polishing and buffing.

186
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:36,370
You can imagine why that would be a problem. This one's a physical.

187
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:39,490
Has a lot of different machining.

188
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:49,030
We've talked about metal, working fluids, cutting oils that are needed to prevent and actually deform the the product.

189
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:53,120
The metal is not using the proper lubrication or coolants with it.

190
00:19:53,590 --> 00:20:01,300
So that's a common problem. Materials handling might have some vapors and things there.

191
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:05,590
And we talked about mine. So again, this is just a partial listing.

192
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:12,550
Painting, repair and maintenance is a big one because that sometimes gets overlooked if you're so focused on the main processes.

193
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:19,210
And sometimes those maintenance things that happen irregularly and in short spurts can actually have a high peak exposure.

194
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:24,909
Some industries have quality control, which you think what could possibly happen with quality control,

195
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:29,830
but a lot of times they'll destroy a piece to see how it holds up.

196
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:37,930
Or use a laboratory, chemicals and things to link to exposures and then metal rolling.

197
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:49,390
So again, just trying to get a sense of what kinds of processes result in adverse exposures is part of the anticipation recognition.

198
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:56,860
So when we approach a new facility organization.

199
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:01,610
Process. You want to use some of these recognition tape techniques.

200
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:05,900
So this is where we have to really think about what information we have access

201
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:09,860
to and how we best use that information to to inform what we need to know.

202
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:16,040
So this can be things like, you know, what is the process, how is it laid out, where are the workers located?

203
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:20,330
A lot of those types of questions. What kinds of materials are coming in?

204
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:29,420
What are being used throughout the process? So to do this, we want to, you know, get as familiar with as we can with the facility, with the process.

205
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:39,620
A lot of times this requires going out as we're seeing it, talking to people, getting access to to records and materials that we can get access to.

206
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:50,710
And to do this as described in the Perkins chapter that was assigned, there is a background survey you can do.

207
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,000
So that's kind of like the stuff we've been talking about,

208
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:59,450
getting familiar with with a process from a distance, if you can, but getting to know the process.

209
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,550
Then you have your walk through survey again, very, very useful.

210
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:08,080
And then depending on what it looks like after that, you might need to do more in-depth survey.

211
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:17,250
And that gets us to the next step, which is evaluation. So we covered some of the background survey already.

212
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:22,980
So for the walkthrough survey. Here the list.

213
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:28,380
I have a lot of lists for this. Part of things you might want to try to find.

214
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:33,000
So again, the types and amounts of materials used. Where do you think you get that?

215
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:38,660
Standard operating procedures. Yeah, hopefully there are standard operating procedures.

216
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:46,230
Some will be great. And then hopefully they're detailed enough to let you know what's being used with some detail.

217
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:50,459
You know, it might be some street name or some chemical you don't know.

218
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:53,610
So hopefully it's detailed enough so you know where it's being ordered from.

219
00:22:54,060 --> 00:23:01,080
And then if you know that, then you can get a handle on the safety data sheets your schools have included that we'll get to.

220
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:07,560
So, yeah, that's, you know, each one of these steps has a little bit of maybe an art form depending on the situation

221
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:13,980
because you know what type of industry you're in and how good of a company it might be.

222
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,510
You know, some of this could be a bit of an uphill climb to really work at.

223
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:22,620
My idea of the process is taking place.

224
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:32,340
A plant layout which is important you know where is the source where the people that gets you some information their work practices.

225
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:40,810
This can be a huge differentiator and you have two people doing the same job with the same tools and the same materials.

226
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:44,700
And one person will have way higher exposure than the other.

227
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:50,520
It just is sometimes how it goes. He may think of an example where that might be.

228
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,080
There's tons I have on my head, I can tell you.

229
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:05,410
So I was doing a welding project once and we just told them, okay, well this piece, you know, it's the same.

230
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:09,280
We had all these preselected pieces of this pipe.

231
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:13,540
They're supposed to just do one radius and we had an apprentice center.

232
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:20,649
So but we had the more experienced people, the trainers do it. And you have one welder, you know, kind of like this one wall.

233
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:23,500
There would be like down like this. And you can see how, you know,

234
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:30,580
the fumes coming up off of that is going to their interaction is going to be way different depending on how their position handedness,

235
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:36,040
what how that interacts with the ventilation system, if there is one.

236
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:39,220
So there's a lot of factors just within working practices that.

237
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,700
Make a difference. Patterns of exposure to this one.

238
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:47,690
It's going to be based on what might be available historically.

239
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:54,280
Existing controls on ventilation, PPE, personal protective equipment,

240
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:59,260
all other things you want to take note of as you do a walk through and then

241
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:02,470
kind of know the lay of the land as far as what's regulated and what's not.

242
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:08,030
That helps give you a sense of what's what might be important talking to people.

243
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:16,570
So that's going to be, you know, the owners, supervisors, safety people if they have medical folks, if they have them.

244
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:26,290
Well, engineers, again, it's going to be highly variable depending on the industry and the size of the place.

245
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:33,230
But another one is the workers themselves. They'll tell you a lot if they're doing that type of work day in and day out.

246
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:36,590
You know, a lot of times I say and.

247
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:41,540
Very good. It's observation sensors.

248
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:45,470
So eyes, obviously, but smell.

249
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:52,819
In the old days, they used to go by smell a lot and we'll make reference to it here and there throughout the next few weeks.

250
00:25:52,820 --> 00:26:03,110
But odor threshold is the thing they used to say, you know, if you smell an agent, they have a list of what the odor threshold is for that chemical.

251
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:07,440
And you could tell by comparing that to the EPA, although, you know,

252
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:15,500
like if it's a problem so very crude because if you might expect different if you've been exposed to the same chemical for years,

253
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:19,729
your sense of smell in response to that might differ from somebody else's.

254
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:25,970
So they can move away from that. But in some certain circumstances, we still use force cream.

255
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:30,409
And like I said, it's there's a lot of science involved,

256
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:38,270
but also some art because there is so much variability in the level of information and the quality of information.

257
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:41,229
To be used. So here's more lists.

258
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:49,810
I'm not going to read to you from the book, but again, gives you a sense of types of things that you want to get to know,

259
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:53,770
to be able to recognize what hazards might be present.

260
00:26:54,310 --> 00:27:02,260
So processes, tasks within those processes, things like that interview with workers, managers, engineers.

261
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:06,370
And this is the type of things you can talk to them about again.

262
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,700
Medical safety and staff. Medical and safety staff.

263
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:17,370
Again, what types of complaints are they getting? What types of recordable injuries and illnesses?

264
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:23,810
Well, other things they might encounter and.

265
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:28,640
Look here. Look at and talk to the people doing the work.

266
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:34,830
These get into, you know, historical records.

267
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:39,710
This is useful for industrial hygiene, but also can be useful for epidemiology as well.

268
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:44,660
If you're doing a retrospective study, you're trying to piece together historical exposures.

269
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,930
Some of this type of information can be very useful as well.

270
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:55,970
If standard operating procedures like was mentioned before in how things are done, where they're done, what they're using,

271
00:27:56,300 --> 00:28:03,560
how much and what the task involves, how what's the interaction between the person and those materials?

272
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:09,440
Does it is it likely to create an airborne hazard or thermal hazard, things like that?

273
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:18,410
And do they have an impact? So you really lucky if you can find some historical exposure data that's very helpful, but not always available.

274
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:26,270
We've talked about the wheels. Those are useful to give you a sense of of what might be more concerned than others.

275
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:30,020
You're not supposed to use them as relative indices of risk.

276
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:39,620
You can sort of see if something is like ten milligrams per cubic meter versus 2.5 micrograms, you'll know that that one is more toxic than the other.

277
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:45,650
Is the literature mentioned safety data sheets?

278
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:49,280
Some of the other types of resources that are really part of the problem.

279
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:55,910
So gets equipment talked about maintenance.

280
00:28:55,970 --> 00:29:01,700
So again, just a huge list of information that can be useful depending on what you need to know.

281
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:13,680
Okay. So more about various records and documents that can help you with a specific type of product or chemical.

282
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:20,850
So these safety data sheets, those lists, you know what the chemical is pertinent chemical properties,

283
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:26,640
what known health effects are, and a range of other things.

284
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:31,070
I'll have you look at a couple of the problems, so you'll get familiar with those,

285
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:36,120
but know that these are developed by the, uh, the people selling the chemical.

286
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:41,090
So they're helpful and they're required by law, which is in the back of your mind, remember that.

287
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:47,520
So you can compare that once you know what the chemical is, you can compare it with some other sources of information on the chemical.

288
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:53,670
And if it's a product mixture, which a lot of these are, they'll tell you what's in that mixture,

289
00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:00,120
what ingredients are in that product, and then those specific ingredients might be the hazard of concern.

290
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:13,490
Day one. The other day it was a paint used in the aircraft industry a while ago and it

291
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:19,190
had strontium chromate was one of the ingredients which is hexavalent chromium.

292
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:24,860
So then that triggers looking into hexavalent chromium as opposed to the whatever that paint what's called.

293
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:30,350
Right. So these souvenir sheets can be very useful for figuring out what's in the product.

294
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:38,450
There's similar to something called international chemical safety cards. And I have some supplemental slides that we won't go through today.

295
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:42,680
But at the end of this deck, that might be useful for the for the problems.

296
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:52,849
We talked about the tubs before. Those are useful once you know what the chemicals are that you're interested in, not only as a range of of resources.

297
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:58,130
We'll talk about the health hazard evaluations on Thursday, but there's also something called the pocket guide.

298
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:05,690
Again, I'll have you go through an example of this on the problem set, but as a useful sort of information for individual chemicals,

299
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:10,400
just coming from a different perspective and say a safety data sheet that's coming from Naoc,

300
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:15,530
they're interested in health based facts related to chemical hazards.

301
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:24,020
So they'll tell you a lot of the same information about chemical properties, but also how to protect the workers and things like that.

302
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:29,279
What the oils are and things. For certain chemicals.

303
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:32,820
There are in-depth ATSDR talks profiles. If.

304
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:38,630
But if you're looking for more background on particular chemicals.

305
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:44,610
No thing you can do. You know what? You're getting this information.

306
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:47,290
If you don't have a lot of exposure data to work with,

307
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:56,829
just see if there's studies of similar operations or industries in the scientific literature that can get a hold of that might have

308
00:31:56,830 --> 00:32:04,720
published values for relevant tests give you a sense of what sort of ballpark you might be dealing with as far as exposure levels.

309
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:14,830
Then trade associations can also be very useful. While we have monthly publications, I put their well-being into what I do involving projects.

310
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:22,500
A lot of the process is materials used to even see how they view safety and health and things like that.

311
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:26,150
So for various trades, that might be. Useful.

312
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:35,330
Then within our field we have trade organizations for there's one for industrial hygiene, there's some for other.

313
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:47,710
Relevant professions as well. Any questions?

314
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:53,080
You guys are in the midst of exams, so everyone was a little tired.

315
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:59,290
I'm sorry if I contributed to that in any way. Okay.

316
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:04,390
So we're talking about chemicals processes.

317
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:09,960
You can also, you know, interviews and records.

318
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:20,160
You might see things outside of these terms or categories raw materials or intermediates, additives, waste materials.

319
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:28,380
Just know within those categories you might have processes and specific chemicals that could be of concern.

320
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:35,929
So please. So that's recognition.

321
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:41,300
Again, that's a huge universe of a large range of things that might be going on.

322
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:47,040
Just knowing some of the. Approaches. I think it is good to get introduced to.

323
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:54,770
Questions on recognition or evaluation. I guess we have to talk about evaluation and anticipation.

324
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:07,650
All right, let's evaluate them. So here we're using what we've learned so far to think about how do we combine this information or

325
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:12,900
collect new information to help us make a decision as to the risk and what we need to do about it?

326
00:34:14,430 --> 00:34:18,900
So that could be qualitative exposure assessment, what we might that is using some modeling.

327
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:25,680
Some of the numbers you might have found in the literature on a similar process to again,

328
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:31,470
try to recreate what might be going on or go out and take measurements yourself.

329
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:36,950
And that has a lot of science involved, a lot of technical know how is required for that.

330
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:41,280
And that's what we'll be talking about in the next few weeks. We'll also be talking more about.

331
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:48,360
A qualitative side as well. And then once you have the quality of a quantitative estimate or range,

332
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:56,460
then you can compare that with your regulations and standards that we've talked about the last week or so back to this.

333
00:34:56,730 --> 00:35:02,309
So coming back to what we've learned before, here's our exposure assessment approaches again.

334
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:07,080
They're applying it now to the occupational setting and direct or indirect methods.

335
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:12,270
And again, it might depend on a lot of things like what you have access to,

336
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:17,460
what the time frame is, what your budget is, might help you decide how to go about.

337
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:31,290
Keep. We had an example for I think it was benzene all the different, you know, all the different approaches you can use.

338
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:36,270
So again, for for occupational study, we might have access to a lot of different things.

339
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:44,070
You want to think about which one which approaches are going to give you the best information to make the best decision regarding risk.

340
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:53,720
The situation. So our sampling strategy, as we talked about last time, depends on a number of things.

341
00:35:54,920 --> 00:36:05,870
What type of sample do we do we want or need and what's what's needed early on as a screening technique versus more of a robust analysis?

342
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,710
This could involve area or personal samples.

343
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:20,480
As we talked about, personal samples are usually desirable over area, but there are instances where areas is useful for a certain goal.

344
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:27,200
If your goal is to look at process change or what's in the air, maybe an area makes sense because it's fixed.

345
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:34,220
But if you're looking at a personal a person's exposure, what's the time you prefer to have versus your time frame?

346
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:39,410
Is it like an instantaneous sample you want to grab sample real time or integrated?

347
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:45,830
And that's going to depend on a lot of things, acute versus prior, chronic and some of the things we've been talking about.

348
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:51,150
Toxic chemical properties. This is a big one.

349
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:57,200
And we'll start next time talking about gas in the papers, how we approach them.

350
00:36:57,210 --> 00:37:00,270
That's very different than how we approach particular rehearsals.

351
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:08,290
So the chemical properties kind of determines, in addition to some of the process factors to what form that agent's going to be in and.

352
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:17,650
Tells you what you need to know as far as how you go about assessing the exposure guidelines.

353
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:24,760
You know, to be able to compare to something and then I want to capture variability as much as we can.

354
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:34,990
We don't want to be missing some really high exposure events because we want to capture that variability and then finally picking the right method.

355
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:40,660
How sensitive does the method need to be? Usually if you get a bit more sensitive, it might get more expensive.

356
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:47,440
How much money do you have to spend on this? Things like that. There's a lot in that slide that.

357
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:52,740
This is kind of saying the same thing just in a visual form.

358
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:58,480
It's kind of hard to. Get your bearings on this one.

359
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:03,320
But in this timeline, on top of this timeline is the relevant toxicity frame.

360
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:06,640
The bottom of it is the type of occupational exposure limit that might be relevant.

361
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:14,159
So as we talked about, you know, more acute, you're looking at ceiling level or a short term exposure level, something that's more like a carcinogen.

362
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,950
And you're looking at long term average exposure.

363
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:25,130
If you're concerned or you're you're interested in. And then this part of it goes down.

364
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:29,420
So exposure, duration, we start at the top with more acute things.

365
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:38,140
That's going well. For example, is hydrogen sulfide, hydrochloric acid, get into minutes or hours, you know,

366
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,660
maybe a short term exposure limit or even an eight hour time weighted average.

367
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:49,280
Solvents while those might occur in a short period of time if you're exposed to a high level of the fumes.

368
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:56,240
Days, weeks here on long term average, you know, over time weighted average over multiple days.

369
00:38:56,660 --> 00:39:00,590
But and then again, more long term, something like a carcinogen.

370
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:07,400
You're looking at aggregated heat over time with the average over years.

371
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:14,580
Okay. So that's evaluation. Like I said, we're going to spend a lot of time on evaluation.

372
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:23,640
Here's Jesse and Mr. White cooking some stuff, but here we have control.

373
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:30,670
So when we say exposure controls in occupational settings, so most people's minds go directly toward personal.

374
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:37,520
Pee pee pee pee obviously has gotten a lot more attention during during the pandemic.

375
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:42,020
So I want to convey to you today that there is a hierarchy of controls,

376
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:46,280
that we don't want to just always jump to personal protective equipment without

377
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:50,360
first thinking about what else can be done to reduce or prevent the exposure.

378
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:56,120
So this is the hierarchy or the pyramid that we're interested in.

379
00:39:57,410 --> 00:40:04,010
So we always want to think about this when we have a hazard. More effective, more desirable is at the top of this.

380
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:07,970
So eliminating the hazard, that makes sense. Right? So we want to.

381
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:14,579
Get rid of the process that is involved in the overexposure for it.

382
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:20,459
That is a lot of times that process is what is the product and getting rid of the process.

383
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:26,760
You get rid of the product and here in the company sometimes isn't feasible, but there are certain situations where elimination might work.

384
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:34,740
Substitution is the next best. You replace it with something else in the workplaces over the years, this happens a lot.

385
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:39,840
You know, you replace one solvent with a different type of solvent, but that is maybe less toxic.

386
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:46,380
Hopefully it truly is. We see this in personal care products and and things like that all the time.

387
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:50,219
I think we talked about this earlier as well, replacing it with other bits.

388
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:54,840
Most same thing can happen in the workplace. Just one solvent with another solvent.

389
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:59,850
You want to do research to make sure it is truly what's what's hazardous.

390
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:07,500
Next is engineering controls. So one is just barriers, basically.

391
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:11,830
Worker And we talk about chemical hazards a lot of time.

392
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:16,720
What we talk about here is ventilation and there's different types of ventilation that can help.

393
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:28,400
With COVID, they're talking about general ventilation. So it's increasing just the general airflow in the space with and dilution ventilation.

394
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:35,020
So just adding fresh air, certainly with a lot of processes, what we really want is local exhaust ventilation.

395
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:40,820
That's where you have that much closer to the source. To have that in West Point Air.

396
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:45,680
So let's talk about welding on that project really and how effective a local

397
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,950
exhaust automation system was if we placed it between the Weld and the worker.

398
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:54,409
And it actually made a huge difference how close that that was placed. So that's a lot of exhaust ventilation.

399
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:59,780
It's a lot of times desirable approach to reducing exposure.

400
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:04,130
If that's not feasible or effective enough, then you get into administrative controls.

401
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:10,840
Anybody know an example of administrative control limiting the amount of time somebody set a specific worksite?

402
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:20,629
Yep. Yeah. So, you know, if you're and hopefully it's done for for good reasons, but it is one way, you know, if you have an OEM that's, say,

403
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:31,370
ten time lead average of ten micrograms or something and you're at 20, then you just have them in that job for less than 4 hours.

404
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:39,499
That's not really what we as investigators sort of what I want to say is but the worker rotation is is

405
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:46,220
a form of administrative controls that's specific to trying to get for levels below a certain amount.

406
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:53,310
Training. There's some general administration problems as well.

407
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:59,930
And then you'll notice at the very bottom is personal protective equipment.

408
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:06,380
That's supposed to be the last resort for controlling exposure to chemicals and other agents.

409
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:10,089
A lot of times, even in the wholesale language,

410
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:18,520
they'll say it must only be used as a temporary step until some of these other things can be implemented for a more permanent solution.

411
00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:27,010
This is just I like this because it was nice colors and as some examples.

412
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:31,930
I'm not going to read these off, but I think that's what I was started.

413
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:40,840
You know, eliminating mercury and small scale gold might be an example of elimination, substituting different pesticides.

414
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:46,950
In substitution. I mentioned local exhaust ventilation.

415
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:56,220
As was mentioned here, rotating workers, good standard operating procedures is another one.

416
00:43:56,460 --> 00:44:01,200
So everyone is doing the job like they're supposed to. That's an administrative one point of training.

417
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:05,840
And then. Which involves respiratory protection, clothes, goggles.

418
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:16,689
Sort of a subset of this on the elimination substitution is creating chemistry principles since this is a chemical hazard.

419
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:19,840
Of course, I thought I should at least mention it. There's a whole different.

420
00:44:20,850 --> 00:44:25,850
You know, science to this. You know, on the chemistry side.

421
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:33,410
But education, hopefully they teach this chemistry department of Chemical Engineering to,

422
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,600
you know, try to think upstream when you're designing new chemicals for some of these.

423
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:49,190
Properties that are make them less persistent was not. Okay.

424
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,970
So back to the role of the occupational industrial agents.

425
00:44:54,860 --> 00:45:01,070
So back in the day, like I said, historically, this arose from, you know, just gross amount of disease in the workplace.

426
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:08,420
It kind of chipped away at identifying what the various hazards were, measuring the exposure, coming up with control solutions.

427
00:45:08,810 --> 00:45:11,930
And that was the job of early industrial hygiene.

428
00:45:11,990 --> 00:45:15,890
So just going around putting out these fires.

429
00:45:16,910 --> 00:45:24,980
But these days, it's more developing and managing a program to anticipate and control these risks.

430
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:38,009
Which includes worker health risks. But, you know, in this field, you might also be involved in broader environmental issues, long time legal risks.

431
00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:44,230
This can be, you know, from the workers comp, of course, but you have product liability claims,

432
00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:47,920
things like that that come into play, regulatory risks.

433
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:54,610
You know, if you're putting in controls that totally kill productivity, that it's not going to go over.

434
00:45:54,610 --> 00:45:59,500
Well, a lot of times in some organizations, you have to be able to manage that as well.

435
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:04,510
Financial risks. Health risks, of course.

436
00:46:07,590 --> 00:46:12,240
So these days, these industrial hygiene programs are much more accountable than in the past.

437
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:18,810
So what we want is a systematic, well documented, comprehensive and cost effective approach to doing all this.

438
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:29,310
We also have a lot more people that are interested. So before it used to be just like the regulators, you know, OSHA and the business owner.

439
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:35,670
But now you have customers, unions, stockholders, the media.

440
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:38,669
That's a great way to get action.

441
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:48,780
Sometimes done something is to expose it to a greater audience, people in the community, your profession and the broader environment.

442
00:46:49,830 --> 00:46:56,090
So again, just demonstrating compliance isn't the goal as it used to be.

443
00:46:56,130 --> 00:46:57,060
That's part of the goal,

444
00:46:57,630 --> 00:47:08,430
but it is also to be much more forward thinking and proactive to prevent these hazards before they even arise and to think about the future.

445
00:47:08,430 --> 00:47:14,220
Because when we showed oil trends, yeah, the peels from OSHA aren't updated.

446
00:47:14,610 --> 00:47:20,909
It might be someday. We'll see. But you know, you're talking about the trees and we're preparing for the future.

447
00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:25,970
We should anticipate that a lot of these trees are going to go down over time as more toxicology information comes.

448
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:30,239
So best practices suggest not just think about today's Hot Wheels,

449
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:36,240
but what they might be in the future and think about what the next risk might be that was unrecognized previously.

450
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:37,530
So there's many,

451
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:47,639
many historical examples of things that were used broadly touted as amazing chemicals that will solve all our problems in our day to day life.

452
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:56,430
But then, you know, they become problematical. So with all that responsibility, let's talk about how we do this.

453
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:02,809
So we have the exposure assessment strategy.

454
00:48:02,810 --> 00:48:08,240
So this is promoted by the American Industrial Hygiene Association, which is a trade group,

455
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:15,740
has members from academia, government and a lot of corporate members as well.

456
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:23,300
And they have committees that get together kind of like. JH And this is, it's me because there's so much industry representation.

457
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:25,660
It's really good from this managerial type of.

458
00:48:26,930 --> 00:48:34,040
Tasks, whereas these changes more health based, they get more the scientists involved here you're getting a lot of the practitioners.

459
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:39,950
So this is a strategy that we'll talk through fairly briefly today.

460
00:48:40,790 --> 00:48:46,010
So again, not just picking out single hazards one by one and trying to do what we can at the time,

461
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:50,390
which is what was sort of published back when Ocean came about.

462
00:48:51,290 --> 00:48:54,919
And that night, astronomers, the research arm of OSHA,

463
00:48:54,920 --> 00:49:00,290
kind of they came out with best practices and in the seventies that people followed for a long time.

464
00:49:00,290 --> 00:49:06,890
But this is more the the current practice what we'll talk about this this flow chart here.

465
00:49:07,730 --> 00:49:16,640
So we're starting here at the top and just know that throughout this application of professional judgment you'll see is is key to why these steps.

466
00:49:18,530 --> 00:49:27,620
So there's seven generic steps so defining the strategy having an overall in program this is you know those of you that

467
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:36,140
interview for internships in this field for job some day we'll talk about health and safety program the written program.

468
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:41,900
So this is kind of laying out how do you approach these known and unknown hazards through?

469
00:49:43,010 --> 00:49:46,490
Facility or health organization. So you want to.

470
00:49:46,670 --> 00:49:53,870
Step two is perform basic characterization of each worksite. So just having the written program and knowing what to include in it is the anticipation.

471
00:49:53,990 --> 00:50:01,030
And the recognition is knowing what might be a hazard in all these different locations and processes.

472
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:06,420
And then you get into the actual evaluation. You'll see this is kind of dense here.

473
00:50:06,450 --> 00:50:12,290
We'll go through this. This is just a summary slide, but perform the exposure assessment.

474
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:15,440
Again, that can be qualitative and quantitative depending on what the needs are.

475
00:50:15,830 --> 00:50:18,290
And then you make a decision for each ACG.

476
00:50:18,290 --> 00:50:27,530
What SG stands for is similarly exposed groups, and that's a strategy that's very common in the field, and we'll touch on that again in a few slides.

477
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:36,160
So when you. Define exposure profiles for these, then you can you know,

478
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:41,100
they can be from expert judgment modeling or measurements and then you have a progression of quality there.

479
00:50:41,110 --> 00:50:49,419
Of course, the measurements are going to be the highest quality information you might have designated as acceptable, uncertain or unacceptable.

480
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:53,229
And that will tell you what to do next or against the summary.

481
00:50:53,230 --> 00:51:00,310
So I will go through that most. And then based on that, you might need to do more information gathering.

482
00:51:00,910 --> 00:51:06,640
And then once you know what the hazards are, then you can start talking about what controls are needed.

483
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:11,650
And then the important part of this is it's always ongoing.

484
00:51:11,890 --> 00:51:19,060
See, reassess periodically and depending on how bad that has or is, it will help you determine how frequently you need to do that.

485
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:24,190
And then you have your documentation and communication to various stakeholders.

486
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:29,830
They're interested. For me to know. Okay.

487
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:33,940
So that next step basic characterization remember or a recognition.

488
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:42,760
Now we get to. So based on a recognition we have found what processes and facilities or locations are of concern.

489
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:47,590
And now we get into exposure assessment at those various tests.

490
00:51:49,770 --> 00:51:55,440
So this is a zoomed in on the diamond from the start.

491
00:51:55,590 --> 00:52:06,240
We took this diamond and we zoomed in. So the first step within that exposure assessment diamond is to asset established or similar exposure groups.

492
00:52:06,870 --> 00:52:10,949
So what this does is some of these facilities, you might have hundreds or thousands of workers.

493
00:52:10,950 --> 00:52:16,140
Right. And to go around and measure every person is not going to be feasible.

494
00:52:16,710 --> 00:52:28,290
So the concept of similar exposure groups is to help break down that huge size potentially into manageable subgroups.

495
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:34,190
So the concept is people doing similar tasks.

496
00:52:34,210 --> 00:52:38,920
I know I already said the work practices might result in high variability between people,

497
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:43,300
but let's say their work tests or or their work practices are similar.

498
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:49,780
Their jobs they do are similar. Their work schedule, similar to the things they are coming to contact are similar.

499
00:52:50,230 --> 00:52:56,170
You might be able to then put them into a similarly exposed, similarly exposed group,

500
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:01,630
which again can make it much more efficient to go about assessing exposure and addressing.

501
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:12,820
So the same general profile based on some of the things I just mentioned, frequency of the task materials and processes and the way they do the work.

502
00:53:14,730 --> 00:53:27,000
So if you want to group them into these categories based on that, but ideally you would validate this with actual measurements as well.

503
00:53:27,450 --> 00:53:32,729
And we'll revisit this later a few weeks when we talk about statistics, there's a ton of statistics involved.

504
00:53:32,730 --> 00:53:37,740
It depends on how detailed you want to get in developing and validating your similarly exposed group.

505
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:45,900
So a basic example here is we have three workers say workers wanted to see the other distributions are similar.

506
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:53,190
I we have data to help support this. We can put them in the same message where it's worker three is a different profile.

507
00:53:53,400 --> 00:54:00,210
They need to be treated differently as we continue to measure, estimate, exposure and control.

508
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:09,790
Okay. So once we have our similarly exposed groups defined, we then need to define an export exposure profile for each of those groups.

509
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:19,580
And that's where you can use a lot of different sources of information, your indirect or your direct methods.

510
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:25,190
So. So you do have some actual quantitative data.

511
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:30,680
As we talked about, a lot of times these are like normally distributed.

512
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:34,430
So so you would need to characterize this level.

513
00:54:34,970 --> 00:54:38,420
What do we typically want to use within that distribution?

514
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:42,440
What description of that distribution is most useful?

515
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:51,230
Median The mean geometric mean I guess that means in the more robust outliers.

516
00:54:51,890 --> 00:55:01,010
Median Definitely for some things. You know, if you're assigning an average exposure for epidemiology particularly or for typical,

517
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:09,280
but you know, it might vary depending on what your your purposes for compliance,

518
00:55:09,290 --> 00:55:17,420
you might be more interested in what's the high tail exposure to make sure you're protecting the majority or all of your of your workers.

519
00:55:17,870 --> 00:55:33,720
So again, it's going to vary depending on the application. So that again can be using a measured data, historical data, model data, things like that.

520
00:55:34,290 --> 00:55:41,250
The next step is to compare the exposure profile and its uncertainty, as with the will and its uncertainty.

521
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:46,590
And this is where a lot of that judgment comes in. So.

522
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:53,930
Uncertainty is something that it's tough to grasp.

523
00:55:54,530 --> 00:55:59,900
And the quality of the information we have will also play a role in how you view that uncertainty.

524
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:05,960
So again, okay, so here we are. Here's an example of looking at qualitative exposure assessment.

525
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:11,380
So we establish are similarly exposed groups. Then we classify.

526
00:56:13,030 --> 00:56:22,550
For each of those groups, whether their exposure is thought to be acceptable, uncertain or unacceptable, it will help us make our decision to do that.

527
00:56:22,570 --> 00:56:31,790
We set priorities. So in order to set our priorities for further action, that's where we classify them as acceptable, uncertain or unacceptable.

528
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:38,900
And to do that, we use these relative rankings. So you have an exposure ranking as well as a risk or health effect ranking.

529
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:45,320
And that combination will help you prioritize which ones of these hazards need the most attention.

530
00:56:46,670 --> 00:56:51,950
You also need to pay attention to the frequency of exposure, the number and frequency of exposure.

531
00:56:51,960 --> 00:57:00,950
If it's only one person being exposed, that might mean something different than if it's, you know, 25 or 200 in a certain type of scenario.

532
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:10,060
And then how do you deal with uncertainty? And then you might want to to decrease that uncertainty.

533
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:13,750
You might want to do additional work within those highest priority groups.

534
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:27,550
So we'll talk about this just a bit more here. So here is an example of a figure showing our exposure rating on the X axis 044 being the most exposed.

535
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:31,330
And then on the Y axis, we have a 0 to 4 health effect rating.

536
00:57:32,170 --> 00:57:36,400
And this is an older version of a health effect rating. How we do that, we'll come back to that.

537
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:43,660
But so it's useful. We can plot that and that can help us prioritize what we want to do for each similarly exposed group.

538
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:48,790
Different groups doing different things, maybe for different chemicals. And then that can help us prioritize.

539
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:53,770
Again, we want to do keep in mind number of exposures.

540
00:57:53,810 --> 00:57:57,280
Answer. So how do we come up with the exposure rating?

541
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:04,090
This is the current way that AJ suggests.

542
00:58:05,110 --> 00:58:16,450
So with the for a similarly exposed group, if you were less than 1%, if your 95th percentile of your SG distribution is less than 1% of the.

543
00:58:16,450 --> 00:58:20,890
Oh yeah. Again, that could be the OSHA appeal, maybe more preferably the TLB.

544
00:58:21,790 --> 00:58:26,620
Then you'd give it a zero. Less than 10% of one.

545
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:33,850
10 to 50. 50 to 100% of the oh, yell for your 95%.

546
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:43,749
And then greater than 5% is a four. So, you know, if you're 95th percentile of your long normal distribution or sigma or any sort of distribution,

547
00:58:43,750 --> 00:58:48,819
say 95th percentile, the higher tail, the exposure is more than 100%.

548
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:52,840
The oil, it's over the oil. That's a high exposure concern.

549
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:56,730
Right. So that. So it's a rating system.

550
00:58:57,510 --> 00:59:06,720
So back to that previous theme, we should also assume this was an exporter distribution Khamenei's for a particular ACG within a rolling operation,

551
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:13,620
according to the previous slide. Which category would this be assigned?

552
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:23,930
Attention. Check. Set the second.

553
00:59:26,370 --> 00:59:30,570
So on the previous slide, we talked about how you do assign an exposure rate.

554
00:59:31,820 --> 00:59:38,720
This is a hypothetical distribution of our manganese exposure or occupational exposure limits here.

555
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:43,650
What do we think for next three? Three.

556
00:59:45,250 --> 01:00:01,570
The other thoughts. So our 95th percentile is what we're using for all these, right?

557
01:00:01,580 --> 01:00:06,040
So 95th percentile is here and it's greater than the oil.

558
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:10,120
So that's got to be greater than 100% in the oil. So that would be a four on that, right?

559
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:14,649
If it was here, we might have to do some math to see what the probability was.

560
01:00:14,650 --> 01:00:18,910
But for here, we know it's a four on that distribution.

561
01:00:23,580 --> 01:00:27,110
Okay. So again, that's the exposure rating.

562
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:33,210
You can also have a health effect rating. And what the concern is for that particular agent scenario.

563
01:00:34,530 --> 01:00:38,430
So nuisance effects zero things that are reversible.

564
01:00:40,350 --> 01:00:43,440
One or two things that are more permanent.

565
01:00:43,590 --> 01:00:49,870
You can do three as well as a risk of cancer can cause significant effects, irreversible effects.

566
01:00:49,870 --> 01:00:57,360
So there's a lot of radiation there or serious things that would be on the Y axis that factor.

567
01:00:58,380 --> 01:01:03,180
So that's that's pretty straightforward based on what's known about a chemical.

568
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:09,780
And then we talked about uncertainty. And then you can assign an uncertainty score to this as well.

569
01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:13,879
Zero one or two zero is you have a lot of quantity.

570
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:23,190
You do you pretty certain that your distribution is accurate and you know a lot about the chemical and its toxicity whereas you know,

571
01:01:23,970 --> 01:01:29,160
two you have very little or no quantity of it's a qualitative, you think it's a certain distribution.

572
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:33,090
We think the health effects are that, but you don't you're not quite sure.

573
01:01:33,090 --> 01:01:41,370
So that's going to have a little bit. Again, hopefully derived from the precautionary principle that the uncertainty turns to being more protective.

574
01:01:44,430 --> 01:01:51,089
So let's say our example, we had an exposure rating of four and the mitigates effects in this case.

575
01:01:51,090 --> 01:02:00,000
I don't want to say perhaps that we'll say that that was given a three health rating that gives us a 12 overall and falls right here on our figure.

576
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:08,459
So it's kind of between high and very high. But then how do we still so we think it's a problem that exposure is high.

577
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:15,240
So anything here should be of concern because it's also the health effects more severe.

578
01:02:15,660 --> 01:02:21,690
It's going to be a very high pressure. But also, how do we account for that uncertainty?

579
01:02:26,230 --> 01:02:30,310
Okay. Let's try to go with the third dimension.

580
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:34,570
All they did was kind of like overlay it. Oh, but I think it gets us what we need to know.

581
01:02:35,020 --> 01:02:40,270
So we had a nine from the previous slide.

582
01:02:41,470 --> 01:02:47,350
So if we have very good data. Good certainty.

583
01:02:47,830 --> 01:02:53,200
We know we need to get serious. So it doesn't really make much difference when we have a high priority thing.

584
01:02:53,650 --> 01:03:00,910
The amount of uncertainty, we just know we need to do something. If we have more uncertainty, it says more information gathering.

585
01:03:01,090 --> 01:03:07,630
But given that it's a high priority, I'd say you can act with that uncertainty comes in a more is is lower hazards.

586
01:03:08,050 --> 01:03:15,310
If you have a lower hazard, you have very good certainty. You don't really need to continue doing as much if you have a low hazard.

587
01:03:15,310 --> 01:03:19,210
But there's a lot of uncertainty still that is going to require you to do more,

588
01:03:20,260 --> 01:03:24,520
gather more information and try to use as much information as you can to reduce that uncertainty.

589
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:29,920
So basically, you take the number you get from the previous slide, which was 12.

590
01:03:30,310 --> 01:03:33,910
Oh, I said nine, sorry. And then you apply it to this graph.

591
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:37,990
So we had a four and a three. So four times three is 12. I don't know why I said nine.

592
01:03:38,830 --> 01:03:41,860
Long day, guys. Sorry, 12.

593
01:03:41,870 --> 01:03:48,430
Yeah. And you know, if we have that uncertainty, rating is going to be this is a hypothetical.

594
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:53,620
I didn't really say what we were as far as the amount of information we had tons of quantitative information.

595
01:03:53,620 --> 01:04:00,460
It might be zero. If we don't, it could be a one or two that will sort of.

596
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:05,880
Tell you whether you need more information. So kind of qualitative there.

597
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:07,700
That's it.

598
01:04:08,030 --> 01:04:14,750
But again, we always want to think about the number of people exposed in the frequency of exposure again, which might play into this priority.

599
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:20,040
And that's where sometimes these maintenance tasks can get lost.

600
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:29,390
So how you know that's another one where the your judgment professional judgment.

601
01:04:31,710 --> 01:04:36,120
Okay. So that's qualitative and quantitative exposure assessment.

602
01:04:36,420 --> 01:04:42,300
We want to think about what is our level of acceptable exposure that we want.

603
01:04:44,850 --> 01:04:48,900
And that can be based on the teeth, the oils we talked about.

604
01:04:49,290 --> 01:04:52,530
And then think about what our distribution, what part of the distribution we want to compare.

605
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:55,890
So basically you want to know what you're looking for before you start sampling.

606
01:04:56,130 --> 01:04:56,820
It's always a key.

607
01:04:58,350 --> 01:05:05,940
And then you design your sampling strategy, kind of like what we talked about last time, who like where, why, how, those kinds of things.

608
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:12,180
Typical scenario or worst case, and then what's the application going to be?

609
01:05:13,050 --> 01:05:21,930
And then what types of methods do we use? What duration, how much, what what's called low quality we need, how we assure that quality.

610
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:27,990
And then we do our statistical analysis and then determine whether or not we are appropriate for that.

611
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:32,310
So that can go in to what we talked about for that distribution of exposure.

612
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:39,810
The 95th percentile can be found from collecting data, analyzing the data, and comparing with a preselected or we'll.

613
01:05:41,810 --> 01:05:48,730
Okay. That's a lot. There's a lot in this. Oh, that's a really slow moving error.

614
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:52,390
That's excruciating. Okay, let me make this in.

615
01:05:56,360 --> 01:06:04,040
So that decision, our options were, according to this flow chart, were acceptable, uncertain or unacceptable.

616
01:06:04,820 --> 01:06:08,240
And then it gives us what we do. Based on what?

617
01:06:08,780 --> 01:06:13,940
So if it's acceptable, you go. You define how frequently you want to reassess.

618
01:06:14,030 --> 01:06:15,410
And that goes into your return program.

619
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:24,020
If it's uncertain, you need to do more information gathering, maybe more on the toxicology side of the literature, maybe more on the exposure site.

620
01:06:24,020 --> 01:06:33,380
Better exposure data. Depends on the situation. And then if hopefully can get that answer to go either one way or the other.

621
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:38,590
Um, again, you might want to air on the side of unacceptable to be precautionary.

622
01:06:39,260 --> 01:06:43,400
And then if it's unacceptable, then you need to go forward with exposure controls.

623
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:47,200
And we talked about the control hierarchy. All right.

624
01:06:47,210 --> 01:06:50,530
So closing one for further information gathering I just mentioned, you know,

625
01:06:50,540 --> 01:06:57,410
might involve more data on the exposure side, but also could be getting to know the toxicity.

626
01:06:58,190 --> 01:07:04,190
Concerns as well. So a lot of different sources of information depending on where the gaps are.

627
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:12,990
And the goal being to reduce that uncertainty, to be able to make a decision. Is to controls based on a party ranking.

628
01:07:13,010 --> 01:07:22,750
Again, PPE, you might be able to do as a stopgap for temporary until you can maybe start to redesign the task concern to get in,

629
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:28,850
maybe some substitution or engineering controls, for example, reassess periodically.

630
01:07:28,850 --> 01:07:34,520
And that should be outlined in the plan for each key based on what they are.

631
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:38,240
The acceptable ones don't, except the ones you always want to reassess, to see,

632
01:07:39,020 --> 01:07:48,020
to make sure the controls are being effective, and then again documenting and communicating to various stakeholders.

633
01:07:48,290 --> 01:07:51,439
People are going to want to know how you made a decision. Why did you make it?

634
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:53,000
You can show them all these steps you do.

635
01:07:53,790 --> 01:08:03,230
You have that that written record of everything that's done, how organized it is, how the decisions are made, and how often things are revisited.

636
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:10,410
This is another one of the figures from from a book that she puts out.

637
01:08:10,710 --> 01:08:14,190
This is just kind of putting some of the controls into the figure,

638
01:08:14,460 --> 01:08:22,770
allowing the control somewhat generic control strategies with the with those exposure categories.

639
01:08:28,950 --> 01:08:35,940
Up here, we have more of the administrative controls. The more serious it gets, the more you really want to redesign the process or rework it.

640
01:08:38,450 --> 01:08:43,480
All right. So the benefits of a comprehensive approach, better management programs,

641
01:08:44,050 --> 01:08:51,400
a better understanding comprehensively of exposures throughout the organization, and that leads to better overall management of risks.

642
01:08:52,030 --> 01:08:56,049
And you have really good records at this point that because you're on top of things and

643
01:08:56,050 --> 01:09:00,910
that if somebody wants to do a retrospective occupational epidemiology study someday,

644
01:09:00,910 --> 01:09:08,430
they'll have really good exposure. And then you'd be better prepared for future changes in a process.

645
01:09:08,910 --> 01:09:11,940
Materials used in new ways of doing.

646
01:09:14,130 --> 01:09:17,460
Okay. And that leads us back to anticipation.

647
01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:26,880
All right. We did it. So, you know, obviously, the context and the perspective is going to change depending on who's doing this.

648
01:09:28,050 --> 01:09:30,630
And the level of the stake in this is different.

649
01:09:31,110 --> 01:09:38,100
So if you're in charge of environmental occupational health for an organization, you will be really embedded in this.

650
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:42,720
Whereas if you're a compliance officer, you might come in and look at how good their program is.

651
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:46,080
So that perspective might differ for different roles.

652
01:09:50,030 --> 01:09:54,380
All right. And the rest is supplemental slides, talks about safety data sheets,

653
01:09:54,470 --> 01:10:01,040
more resources and things that you might draw upon from the first questions in the process.

654
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:06,050
So like I said, this this unit's a bit more technical,

655
01:10:06,260 --> 01:10:13,669
so I'll try to encourage you to convey this information to you guys in the most engaging way you can.

656
01:10:13,670 --> 01:10:17,750
But like I said, it's fairly technical, so we'll do our best.

657
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:23,060
Any questions? All right, let me know.

658
01:10:23,990 --> 01:10:32,760
Have a good rest of your afternoon. We were told that's supposed to be done independently.

659
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:36,780
You can. I want you to have your own answers.

660
01:10:36,780 --> 01:10:46,320
But you're free to talk to me, I'm sure. But, you know, just not the more you able to understand the material there will be for the next few days.

661
01:10:47,550 --> 01:10:48,430
Yeah, you ought to go.
