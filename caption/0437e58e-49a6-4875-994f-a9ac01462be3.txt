2
00:00:05,982 --> 00:00:10,200
Let's go back to the figure on the
components of the public health system.

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:15,385
We see that state, tribal, local, and
territorial health is depicted centrally.

4
00:00:15,385 --> 00:00:17,710
Though they are limited in their power and

5
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:21,700
resources, the constitution
grants states police power.

6
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:25,950
Now, this means something much broader
than the literal power of the police.

7
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:29,380
Police powers may be used by states
to promote laws in the interest

8
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:32,620
of the general welfare and
health of society.

9
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:37,250
Public health examples of the government's
police power include laws that authorize

10
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:41,300
isolation and quarantine,
community vaccination.

11
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:45,630
Licensure of medical professionals, and
response to public health emergencies,

12
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:49,220
such as bioterrorism or
infectious disease outbreaks.

13
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:53,850
State governments are not the only
authority involved with public health.

14
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:57,440
A lot of public health interventions and
initiatives are facilitated by

15
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,250
local governments, who get their
authority from their respective states.

16
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,677
There are over 3,000 local health
departments, most at the county level.

17
00:01:06,677 --> 00:01:10,151
There are a few major city local
health departments as well, and

18
00:01:10,151 --> 00:01:11,590
several multi counties.

19
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:15,930
These health departments are considered
the foot soldiers of public health.

20
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:16,840
They're responsible for

21
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,750
the day to day public health
activities that happen in our lives.

22
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:25,220
And they might be considered pretty
mundane, but they're very important.

23
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:29,409
For instance, when we talk about
Washtenaw County, here, in Michigan, and

24
00:01:29,409 --> 00:01:33,479
their public health system, they offer
a number of services and programs.

25
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:38,668
These include just a small sampling,
food service licensing and inspection,

26
00:01:38,668 --> 00:01:43,161
dental clinics for the population,
suicide prevention programs,

27
00:01:43,161 --> 00:01:48,650
communicable disease clinics and
school health services.

28
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,190
In addition to local
public health departments,

29
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:55,300
there are 567 federally
recognized American Indian and

30
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:58,970
Alaska native tribes and
villages in the United States.

31
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:03,210
These tribal governments
vary in legal status.

32
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:06,380
There's sovereign nations that maintain
a government to government relationship,

33
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:12,240
and the federal government provides
tribes with health related services.

34
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,720
We have now discussed the legal
authorities of the federal, state,

35
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,550
local and tribal governments for health.

36
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:19,820
There are many more entities,

37
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:23,880
however, involved with the creation
implementation, maintenance, and

38
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:28,100
evaluation of public health
activities across the United States.

39
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:33,270
There is an interconnected network of
industries, community based organizations,

40
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:38,100
hospital and health systems, non profits
and foundations, non governmental

41
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:43,663
organizations and individuals who help
same how the public health system work.
