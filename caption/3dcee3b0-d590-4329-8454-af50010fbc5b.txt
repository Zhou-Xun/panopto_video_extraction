1
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:19,710
Okay. Excuse me. Today's paper,

2
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:29,200
we're going to talk about vitamin D supplementation with high doses and its safety and instability in this particular

3
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:37,030
paper to reduce diabetes incidence in the non obese diabetic mouse model when given early and in long term.

4
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:45,490
So I picked this paper to talk about every year because not everybody picks a type one diabetes paper every year, which you did,

5
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:57,400
but it highlights some of the important issues of autoimmune disease and how vitamin D can suppress some of these responses.

6
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:07,510
So let's walk through this questions and I have other points put in intermittently.

7
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:12,070
So we've already talked quite a bit about that, the type one diabetes.

8
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:21,430
So you know that it's an insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, right.

9
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:29,560
And its prevalence is about one and a half million children and adults in the US.

10
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:42,790
So there's this website called the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation and this has up to date information on this information type one diabetes.

11
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:49,180
And we know that it used to be called juvenile diabetes and it but it can arise at any age.

12
00:01:50,890 --> 00:02:01,780
And that disease starts through the autoimmune destruction of the beta cells in the pancreas to the point

13
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:10,150
where there's not enough beta cells present to give you enough insulin to regulate glucose homeostasis.

14
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:16,760
So yeah, there's smoke, there's the the source of information for the general public.

15
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:29,929
And then those of you who are in the 639 have seen this where you have in the in the pancreas, in the islets of Langerhans,

16
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:37,970
you have different endocrine cells, alpha cells, beta cells and delta cells, and the beta cells secrete insulin.

17
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:47,630
And those are staining here. And this reddish brown stain, the blue stain is that other tissue within the pancreas.

18
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:57,500
And then for some reason you have this autoimmune reaction that occurs early in life, but it can occur later in life.

19
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:10,100
And here you have a cytotoxic T cell that recognizes an antigen presented to it, to it, which is insulin.

20
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:21,320
And these cells are directed to kill the insulin producing cells, the beta cells, the other cells persist, the alpha cells in the delta cells persist.

21
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,629
So when you take that tissue and in this case,

22
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:32,560
I believe it's a mouse with type one diabetes and you stained for insulin in the left eye looks

23
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:38,390
like you don't you see very few or a number of of cells that are standing positive for insulin.

24
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:49,720
So this is this very specific autoimmune response in this case against the islets in the the beta cells in the early.

25
00:03:52,680 --> 00:04:06,060
So as we've already talked about, the non-obese diabetic mouse develops the disease and the T cells actually infiltrate the pancreas.

26
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:15,690
And when you have initially moderate glucose area and then non fasting hyperglycemia.

27
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:23,460
And in the previous paper, they talked about their threshold for diabetes being 250 milligrams per deciliter.

28
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,010
In this one, they use 200 milligrams per deciliter as their threshold for diabetes.

29
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:46,410
And in reality, when you look at the literature and there's really no threshold for measuring diabetes, some authors refer to the human values.

30
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,570
But in the different types of diabetes, type one and type two,

31
00:04:52,950 --> 00:05:05,010
you'll see 202 50 for the nod mice and maybe elevated levels above 125 for the type two diabetes in that type two diabetes mouse model.

32
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:11,640
So there's really not a standard and you might see each paper have its own little definition for what the threshold is.

33
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:21,810
What's interesting about these mice is that the autoimmune process develops within the first ten weeks of life,

34
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:27,390
and then after ten weeks you start to see this elevation and blood glucose levels.

35
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:32,459
And so the process occurs early.

36
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:44,190
So it's more like a juvenile diabetes model. And this particular strain of mice, the at ten weeks of age, the mice are fully mature.

37
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:47,790
They would be considered young adult mice because they can reproduce.

38
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:56,790
But it's actually the females that have an earlier onset than than males.

39
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:03,600
So in males, the response is delayed for several weeks.

40
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:11,549
We're not really sure why, but if you look at information that's provided by these vendors that sell these mice,

41
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:16,890
Jackson Labs, they show you what happens over time.

42
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:29,730
And based on the vendor site at 23 weeks of age, the hypoglycemia is present in 80% of the females and 60% of the males.

43
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,810
So this is what Jackson Labs will tell you what to expect.

44
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:42,720
However, if you set up your own breeding colony in your animal facility, you'll get some variability.

45
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:48,990
And the variability mentioned in this paper was that in their breeding stock,

46
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:58,230
the prevalence of diabetes or hyperglycemia in females was was 80% and in the males is only 38%.

47
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:05,040
So throughout the literature, you might see some variation from what the supplier says, which you can expect to find.

48
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:09,930
So why do you think that? Why do you think there's variation between what the supplier says,

49
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:16,440
who has decades of experience with their mice and individual laboratories all over the world?

50
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:25,230
Yeah. Um, I guess they could depend on the conditions of the mine to live in.

51
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:31,200
And I think. So what could be different?

52
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:39,360
So if you have a lab, I believe this lab was in Japan and versus North America, what differences might there be?

53
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,400
Go ahead, Abby. You're going to raise your hand. Yeah. So the same just temperature.

54
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:50,470
So that so the animal facilities are well controlled for light.

55
00:07:50,620 --> 00:08:04,840
So we'll have a 12 hour light, dark cycle and then they'll keep the temperature fixed at I believe it's between 68 and 72 degrees Fahrenheit.

56
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:11,290
So that's pretty well monitored. What what might be different is the bedding.

57
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:22,570
So we used to use it in Michigan, but bedding called bedrock cobs, which was ground up corncobs.

58
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,460
And then they've recently switched to something else. I'm not sure what it is.

59
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:38,470
It's like a cellulose kind of a material. And then there's one thing that they can control in an animal facility is the relative humidity.

60
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:41,830
They measure relative humidity, but they really can't control it.

61
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:48,219
So that's these are some variables. The food can be fairly consistent.

62
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:51,400
You can order from the same supplier and have the same formula.

63
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:59,020
But just those two things, the bedding and the relative humidity can affect the microbiota.

64
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:04,660
So perhaps differences in the microbiota might influence this.

65
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:12,220
They did mention somewhere, and I can't remember if it was in the introduction or somewhere in the discussion, they're talking about gut permeability.

66
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:25,540
So if you have a more porous gut, perhaps the mice might be exposed to some microbes or microbial products that circulate,

67
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:38,740
at least in the mesenteric blood supply, that that might have an influence in whether or not you develop type one diabetes.

68
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:46,300
So these are some things that that might explain some of these differences, but in truth, we really aren't sure why.

69
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:57,640
So here's if you go to the Jackson Laboratory website, the supplier of all things, mice and rats, but mostly mice.

70
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:11,380
This is what they show you. So you have percent diabetic on the Y-axis and H and weeks on the x axis red from for females and blue for males.

71
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:17,170
And you see a little earlier onset for the females compared to the males.

72
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,950
And then so pick your time point.

73
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:29,050
You'll find at any time point after this you have a higher prevalence or incidence of diabetes in the females compared to the males.

74
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:44,419
So in these particular studies that were done, they're keeping the mice and they're continuing to let them live up to, in this case, the females.

75
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:50,680
It was up to 26 weeks and for the males 30 weeks.

76
00:10:51,520 --> 00:11:00,400
And then the paper that you presented, Ilana, they euthanized the mice after they got to a certain age, after they had type one diabetes.

77
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:09,790
So with some animal facilities and I don't know what the rules are here about keeping mice

78
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:15,490
around that have this really high level of hypoglycemia when you should euthanize them.

79
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:19,360
I would believe that it's when they start to lose a lot of weight.

80
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:28,270
You won't see a whole lot of data on this when people study the mice.

81
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:31,950
I don't recall in this paper if they measured the weight of the animals.

82
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:37,120
I could be wrong about this at the later time points at 35 weeks that they're going out, too.

83
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:44,950
So, you know, you have to consider the quality of life of the animal when you do these studies, too.

84
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:48,370
And when is the appropriate time to euthanize that?

85
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:55,920
So so based on the studies in the introduction.

86
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:04,710
So what's the relationship between vitamin D now and Type one diabetes in human epidemiologic studies and in animal models?

87
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:19,720
Yeah. Previous studies show that vitamin D deficiency could be an environmental trigger for developing type one diabetes.

88
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:30,309
Yeah. And then they also mentioned the possibility that enteroviruses could trigger the autoimmune.

89
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:39,670
There could be some molecular mimicry between the virus infecting the beta cells perhaps,

90
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:46,510
and this triggering that that the development of the disease could be in humans.

91
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:53,649
Some people have talked about lead exposure and perhaps that can develop into an autoimmune

92
00:12:53,650 --> 00:13:01,330
type disease in which you have either a similar response that you would see in celiac disease.

93
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:07,570
I'm not certain about that connection, but vitamin D sufficient insufficiency was was talked about.

94
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:15,490
And then they talked about the prevalence of type one diabetes based on latitude.

95
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:23,920
So we know that exposure to ultraviolet light will give you higher levels of vitamin D, right.

96
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:31,090
And they talked about this. There's an increased prevalence of type one diabetes with latitude of residence.

97
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:39,280
So the further up north you live, the greater the prevalence of type one diabetes.

98
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:47,100
And if you move closer to the equator, there is a lower incidence of type one diabetes.

99
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:52,850
Based on some of these epi studies. Now, that's not a causal relationship.

100
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:57,690
It's kind of an observational study that says that studies like this have been done.

101
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,320
Yeah. Do we see that same observation within the United States?

102
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:06,460
Do we see a higher incidence?

103
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:26,660
Within the U.S.? I don't know. I do know that people have drawn attention to the incidence of bowel cancer, cancer in large intestine and latitude.

104
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:33,940
And I knew I knew a vitamin D expert who was at Purdue.

105
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:42,770
Now he is at the University of Texas, and he studied large intestine cancer, colon cancer.

106
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:54,020
And he would always cite that information where the further north you live, the greater prevalence of colon cancer you see.

107
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:57,790
And his big thing was, well, vitamin D can prevent that.

108
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:02,990
And he had done a number of studies in mice so far.

109
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:10,940
Clinical trials where people take supplemental doses of vitamin D doesn't seem to prevent colon cancer development, however.

110
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:22,840
So the other thing that they mentioned had to do with vitamin D deficiency in children who are at risk.

111
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:36,819
So there have been studies done with children who have or women who who conceive they have a child and their relatives have type one diabetes.

112
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:43,150
And the idea was, okay, if we see that there's a genetic risk here,

113
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:50,860
if we supplement these mothers and children with vitamin D, perhaps we can delay the onset of the disease.

114
00:15:52,840 --> 00:16:03,220
And then some of the experiments done with the nod mice delaying the onset of type one diabetes and some of the studies that were done before this.

115
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:13,630
So here's a meta analysis of vitamin D supplementation in infancy on the development of type one diabetes.

116
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:18,250
And you can see these studies were done mostly in Europe.

117
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:24,940
And there's a lot of variability here. The size of the square.

118
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:31,900
So here's the odds ratio here. Right. Either you have a decrease or an increase here in the odds ratio.

119
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:39,580
So anything above would increase and people would decrease. The size of the square represents the sample size.

120
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:47,560
So the ones that have a smaller sample size, you see a greater degree of variability.

121
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,130
Okay. So you have no change here.

122
00:16:51,880 --> 00:17:01,600
This had an effect in terms of reducing the odds of developing type one diabetes where we saw an increase.

123
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,400
But they are huge here, probably indicating no statistical differences.

124
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:18,040
And then when you get to these larger studies, we see a benefit in that perhaps delaying the onset of type one diabetes in these states.

125
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:28,510
And then the average here was somewhere around a reduction of 2.5 grams.

126
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:36,250
So we're not seeing a huge effect, but it's a little bit in it might make a difference.

127
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:49,680
So what's known about treating nod mice with vitamin D and the development of type one diabetes?

128
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:55,590
Go ahead. So using those vitamin D treatments, I reduced the development of type one diabetes.

129
00:17:56,310 --> 00:18:01,680
But I talked about how only of rates that induced hypercalcemia and bone mineralization.

130
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:11,670
So questions remain about the and questions also remain about the form of vitamin D and the dose duration around that can have beneficial impacts.

131
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:16,100
And if that also would have a effect on the hypercalcemia.

132
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:19,950
Yes. So here's one of the one of the results of the papers.

133
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:23,280
And in this way, they give you a3d graph here.

134
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:27,540
So here you have on this access here.

135
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:34,260
Sure. This is an X, Y, Z. I don't know if this is the x axis.

136
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:42,540
This would be the Y axis, definitely. So you have male and female with no vitamin D and then with vitamin D, these are all not mice.

137
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:54,120
And you can see that the females without the vitamin D, they have a greater incidence and then they're given vitamin D supplementation or,

138
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:58,950
you know, these are males that have less and the females with vitamin D supplementation.

139
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:08,190
You can delay the onset of vitamin D or B, delay the onset of type one diabetes.

140
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:14,220
This is kind of hard to see. The next graph is a little bit easier and another study.

141
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:22,200
So we have with the open symbols, these are male and female.

142
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:28,110
The the male mice are the circles and the female mice are the squares.

143
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:38,250
So the open symbols, vitamin D deficient, and then the close symbols are the ones that were the controls.

144
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:50,220
And we see with vitamin D deficiency, there's a greater incidence, an earlier incidence of type one diabetes in this particular study.

145
00:19:51,390 --> 00:20:06,680
So this is where some of these ideas come from. So you answered the question about vitamin D problems or issues with vitamin D toxicity.

146
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:16,939
So one of the things that the study brought up was we're not talking about the supplemental

147
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:22,400
dose that you normally see that's given in the papers when they talked about toxicity.

148
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:28,400
They were giving 125. That's the active form of the hormone.

149
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:38,540
And there have been some studies done in humans where they're looking at the active form of the hormone, not 25 hydroxy, but 125 hydroxy.

150
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:45,860
And in those studies, you can see some hyperglycemia and hypercalcemia in some people and and in mice.

151
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:52,370
And some bone abnormalities. Bone mineralization with giving supplemental doses.

152
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:57,530
125. Why do you think that is? We always hear about giving vitamin D supplements,

153
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:09,470
but the type of supplement matters in terms of whether or not you get restoring or maintaining bone mass or bone mineralization.

154
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:15,500
Why would you see that difference with this form of the vitamin D given as a supplement?

155
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:44,060
So one of the things that the active form does is it upregulates the enzymes that are responsible for the conversion of 125 to an inactive form.

156
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:49,219
So if you're inactivating this and it happens very rapidly,

157
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:57,230
if you're inactivating the active form by up regulating the enzymes that are responsible for this effect,

158
00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:05,810
you could be lowering vitamin D levels that are actively building bond.

159
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:12,590
And in the studies that have looked at high levels of 125, they found that there's greater bone turnover.

160
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:16,790
So perhaps that's an explanation as to why that they've seen that.

161
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:22,069
And this is why you wouldn't give the active form of the hormone as a supplement.

162
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:25,610
You'd give a precursor of the active form.

163
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:38,440
So let's get into the paper now.

164
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:48,100
So in Fig. one, the impact of vitamin D3 supplementation is evaluated for potential negative side effects on bone parameters,

165
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:51,520
and I just explained why. So what did we see here?

166
00:22:55,660 --> 00:23:01,040
So we had a cross section of a bone and then we have a bunch of bar graphs down here.

167
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:05,330
What happened here, Abby?

168
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:17,410
So that they determine that the vitamin D3 supplementation did not affect and they did this in order to monitor the.

169
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,880
Details in this. Right.

170
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:26,190
So they looked at what's the difference here between the different types of bone.

171
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:32,760
So you have different bones that are measured, right? And then they had.

172
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:38,950
Cortical trabecular bone. What's what's the difference?

173
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:58,790
Between the cracks here between the between the different types of bowling alley in the third graph to be seen.

174
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:04,480
They're still the same. They're not statistically different.

175
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:12,400
But in terms of the type of bone, in terms of trabecular or cortical bone.

176
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:18,640
Now, what would you be measuring here? Yeah.

177
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:24,550
So you're looking at the cortical bone, the ocular bone here, and you're looking for, um, yes.

178
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:29,620
Density of, of that particular type of bone.

179
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:39,750
And they didn't find any differences. So that told them that the level of vitamin D that they were giving wasn't toxic.

180
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:57,280
Okay. So if you take it, let's say you have somebody who takes really high doses of vitamin D, what might that do to get that at the very end?

181
00:24:57,310 --> 00:25:05,840
Have a slide and at the very end, never mind. So so explain the results in this particular set of experiments.

182
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:11,000
What was the purpose of this experiment? And why did they do this?

183
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:19,050
Having. The most effective teacher, of course, all of life.

184
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:24,250
I said before there was a universal. Critics of Jefferson.

185
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:33,100
Yeah. So what's what's how is that a portion of this figure different than the other two?

186
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:46,870
They had. They started supplementation at three weeks and then came.

187
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:51,890
The other two did a little bit of supplementation and then stopped.

188
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:55,450
Yeah. Yeah. So this is lifelong.

189
00:25:56,660 --> 00:26:06,740
This is 3 to 14 weeks and this is just around cup length after couple of and the three weeks after birth.

190
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:18,730
So it was the lifelong supplementation that gave them a statistical difference in terms of the time of the onset of diabetes.

191
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:22,070
And that's why we see the Asterix here between the different groups.

192
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:32,179
So they're there. They look like they're both open symbols in the figures, but this one is a little bit gray and this one is open.

193
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:36,620
So they should have darkened one of them and it would have been easier to see.

194
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:47,030
So the other thing is they have males and females, right?

195
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:51,800
Mm hmm. And the males are there on set.

196
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:55,740
It's a little bit different. It's hard to see.

197
00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:04,730
So for 14 weeks here, females and males rioted about 14 weeks.

198
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:19,820
And really no difference here. When they develop diabetes, when you have this three or 14 week supplementation or the early supplementation,

199
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:22,850
these numbers are right on top of one another.

200
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:36,120
But just a little surprising, isn't it? The other thing that's not noteworthy in this figure is look at the you look at the sample size.

201
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:48,770
That's a lot of mice. So this is a huge difference in sample size to do this.

202
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:53,760
Okay. Yeah. The Civil Service Delivery Service.

203
00:27:56,190 --> 00:28:00,810
So much so that again why is the.

204
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:09,010
The treatment group said the mice receiving the vitamin D supplements were those people saying was so much than.

205
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:14,010
So what would be a reason?

206
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:18,570
Yeah. So we are trying to show a difference here.

207
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,250
You are supposed to do a power analysis, right?

208
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:28,200
To determine whether or not there's. There's how many mikes you need to do to show a difference.

209
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:31,890
But here they just show you numbers.

210
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:43,440
And what I think was going on was they continued to add numbers to this graph to show a statistical difference.

211
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:53,430
Unfortunately, you know, it's kind of a biased way to do the experiment, but they did show a difference.

212
00:28:53,440 --> 00:29:00,690
But there's a whole lot more mice here. And this is every single mouse that they're trying to account for here.

213
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:09,990
Um, so, yeah, I don't know how you can get away with that.

214
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:14,129
You know, and when you're doing these kinds of studies, whether or not the reviewer would say,

215
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:22,050
Hey, wait a minute, why didn't you have an equal sample size? And then in the previous graphs, now there's no.

216
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:27,360
Yeah. Previous examples. It doesn't give you a numbers.

217
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:31,710
Um, you know, why, why are you showing different numbers? Why is that?

218
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:38,970
You know, we have 33 and 34 and 15 and 17 and 15 and 21.

219
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:46,110
Why? Why? There's such a great disparity here. I think they're adding mice to show a statistical difference.

220
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:55,390
So the numbers of mice in the supplementation group was actually the same.

221
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:59,890
So 67 in 68 and 6768.

222
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:03,690
And it's the control group that varies a bit here.

223
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:11,430
21, 28. 34. But this is a lot of mice to to monitor.

224
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:17,360
Can you imagine being the technician or the graduate student monitoring these mice?

225
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:22,920
So what they did was they're going getting the mice and they're taking a blood sample from the tail.

226
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:30,240
So what you do is you can lightly anesthetize the animal and then nick their tail a little bit and get a little drop of blood,

227
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,870
put it in a glucose glucometer and measure their blood glucose.

228
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:41,070
And if it's under 200, which is their threshold, they're not showing anything here.

229
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:49,470
They're above the 200 while they are in the percent diabetes, diabetic mice, population.

230
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:57,180
So. Yeah, go ahead, Abby.

231
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:59,040
I always wonder. I don't know.

232
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:11,890
It just occurred to me that there is this similar size of the diabetic race that receives a certain mutation is just flawed because more mice didn't

233
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:23,990
see because it seemed like six of the seven to me for like the female in the of the implementation is if each dot represents about six out of the 70.

234
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:32,260
We're considered dirty. I see what you're saying. One, two, three, four, five, six.

235
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:37,150
So, yes, that would be the percent of the 17 that had diabetes.

236
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:41,790
And then I just have like an overall like. Question.

237
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:49,570
You're doing extra. The specifies are purple 67 race in the same thing.

238
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:53,500
Or is it each individual or do you? I believe so.

239
00:31:54,520 --> 00:32:00,850
So this is a complicated question. So in an animal facility, you'll see zillions of cages.

240
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:06,639
Okay. And here the rule is no more than five per cage.

241
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,780
But that's based on the weight of the animal. They get to be more than 30 grams.

242
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:17,080
You have to separate them. You can only have three per cage with male mice because they fight one another.

243
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,709
You have to you might not be able to keep five per cage.

244
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:26,960
You probably have to separate them out. I don't know how aggressive the dog mice are.

245
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:32,290
But some species of black six mice, which is used for the type two diabetes model.

246
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:40,500
They're very aggressive. And you often see as the mice get older, fewer and fewer per cage because they don't get long standing.

247
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:46,840
So that's you know, that's a complication of any time you're using male mice in the studies.

248
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:55,930
Your cage cost their cost per experiment is going to increase because you can you can have fewer animals per cage,

249
00:32:56,950 --> 00:33:01,720
but for the females, probably for five per cage for all of these groups.

250
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:19,200
So what did they show based on the results shown in FIG. three and how did vitamin D3 affect pancreatic beta cell function in mass?

251
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:30,960
From China. So that in a three days this created a glucose tolerance test.

252
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:35,080
Vitamin D supplementation can ward quite severe level.

253
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:40,080
That's true. Yeah. Relative to the diabetic control.

254
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:50,249
Right. And B, they just compare insulin concentration in the pancreas after they've realized that the other pancreas that they

255
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:59,470
could observe that they have this application supplemented group with without diabetes they had higher insulin.

256
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:11,910
Yeah. So they're actually measuring the nanograms of insulin per milligram of pancreas in this particular study.

257
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:15,810
And then I was trying to figure out these are all not mice according to the methods.

258
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:18,720
All of the mice used in this study were the non mice.

259
00:34:19,410 --> 00:34:30,780
So these are the normal glycemic nod mice and the diabetic, not mice and the mice that were given vitamin D supplementation.

260
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:35,000
So these mice had not developed diabetes yet.

261
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:44,820
The controls. Okay. So I was trying to think, okay, are they the same age or where did you know?

262
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:51,610
How did that work? And this was at 35 weeks of age.

263
00:34:51,790 --> 00:35:00,339
So I'm wondering, you know, how many how many mice they had to have around to to do these studies.

264
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:04,620
And it's one, two, three, four, five, and one, two, three, four, five.

265
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:10,300
They had just five and five. And if you have a huge population, mice, 67, 68 mice,

266
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:17,680
you're going to have enough to do this study such that you still have some that are even though they're not mice,

267
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:24,700
they're still long lasting, but they might have some evidence of an autoimmune response.

268
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:28,870
So in that sense, maybe they're not controls, you know what I mean?

269
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:38,380
But you would have to do that. You'd have to either get a younger mouse or a different species of mouse, perhaps, or I'm not certain.

270
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:43,840
So yeah, so this is an inter peritoneal glucose tolerance test.

271
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:58,520
So they give them a bolus of glucose and then they measure glucose from that tail prick every 15 minutes and then every half hour and then yeah,

272
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:06,969
every half hour afterward, that's what they find. And then look at the diabetic control myself.

273
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:10,270
Many mice were in that group too.

274
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:16,270
Yeah, non glycemic, normal glycemic mice.

275
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:20,950
Five and the ones with vitamin D four.

276
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:25,480
So can you do statistics with two mice?

277
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:30,320
No. Okay.

278
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:38,440
So if you are going to publish this now, this was in 2014,

279
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:45,820
you would need to show at least five miles per hour, even though they're genetically identical.

280
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:50,500
You'd need to have more than two mice. Okay. And that's that.

281
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:55,720
Then that one got by the goal. They should have asked for more mice in that particular relationship.

282
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:07,140
So here's the males. Three had enough this time, but still, it's a really small sample size between the first three here,

283
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:12,310
three of the the ones that had the vitamin D supplement. And here's the normal glycemic control for.

284
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:13,840
There.

285
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:22,110
And then, yeah, they're taking the pancreas, they're grinding them up and they're measuring the insulin content and they're finding these differences.

286
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:31,680
But there's quite a bit of difference here. Um, and even though, um, there's quite a bit of difference, it's different than zero.

287
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:36,320
Right. Which is also interesting.

288
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,650
Can you do statistics for me? I guess you can. I don't know if.

289
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:51,230
All right. So life long vitamin D supplementation preserves the insulin content and decreases severe insulin itis.

290
00:37:52,490 --> 00:38:00,530
Okay, so what is insulin? First of all, you've talked about this, Alina, something besides Abbey.

291
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:09,110
Go ahead. It's like how much the cells are infiltrated.

292
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,250
Yeah, like during the cells.

293
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:21,740
And they use a similar scale, whereas the mice, I mean, and I did as well using like grade zero through.

294
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:31,070
For, you know, to determine like how like what percent was important and.

295
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:38,729
Yeah. So there's your scale and that that's the that's the next one.

296
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:42,600
I see. And this is the, this the visual scale of what this would look like.

297
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:48,330
So the lighter stained cells here, this is the insulin producing cells.

298
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:50,040
This is the beta cells right here.

299
00:38:51,240 --> 00:39:01,920
And then you start to see some Perry insulin that is a feature immune cells outside and you get more and infiltration with score two.

300
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:15,570
So half of the area of the beta cell mass is infiltrated with these immune cells and then more than half with this particular score,

301
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:18,990
score three and then score four, there's just complete destruction.

302
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:24,300
You don't see any insulin producing cells. You just get massive immune cells here now.

303
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:38,270
So what you do when you do these kinds of experiments is you take these samples at the time point

304
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:45,499
that you're interested in measuring 35 weeks and you stain your sections and you send them off to

305
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:55,309
a pathologist and you don't tell the pathologists the identification of the slides and you give

306
00:39:55,310 --> 00:40:01,190
them a not a just some kind of identifier that they don't understand what that number stands for.

307
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:07,460
And then they give you these scores. And they they count a certain number of fields.

308
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:13,220
So they they they have more than one. I like to count other words.

309
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:19,310
And then they come up with these different scores. So.

310
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:30,620
And you're seeing here greater infiltration with these immune cells, with the diabetes.

311
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:42,770
And so there's zero with so 93 in the in the animals that aren't treated with vitamin D.

312
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:48,950
And then and then we're looking at heavy insulin, I guess, here, where they're looking at the higher score.

313
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:54,560
And you can see that vitamin D supplementation reduces it to some extent.

314
00:40:54,920 --> 00:41:06,190
Yeah, I'm happy to know what the reasoning is behind the, uh, the male mice who received the vitamin D to have more categorized.

315
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:09,500
So, for instance, I guess in the first graph.

316
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:18,639
Yeah. And see. So I was thinking right before you asked the question, I was thinking, hey, wait a minute,

317
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:24,700
aren't the Martha males supposed to be more protected than the females are?

318
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:36,070
And it depends on when you take the sample. So if you were to look at the blood glucose levels of these mice,

319
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:46,210
you would find that they would have achieved that threshold value of 200 milligrams per deciliter.

320
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:56,020
But when you look at the islets themselves, you see a kind of a similar effect in terms of similarities between the males and

321
00:41:56,020 --> 00:42:00,970
the females in terms of their insulin free mouse or the heavy insulin as per mouse.

322
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:07,720
So this is a time when these animals have diabetes.

323
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:19,540
If you were to do this experiment at ten weeks, then you would see a difference right before the mouse start to develop the diabetes.

324
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:30,740
Okay. Question number eight How did vitamin D3 supplementation affect the number and balance?

325
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:40,830
CD4 positive and CD8 positive T cells is there to factor in T regulatory cells in the spleen and in the pancreatic lymph nodes.

326
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:44,030
And this is figures four, five and six.

327
00:42:48,080 --> 00:43:00,469
Go ahead, General. So is this figure for the vitamin B can affect the number of total lymphocytes total to the court yourselves for all 58 results.

328
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:04,640
But when they dig into the subset of lymphocytes.

329
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:14,290
Maybe the next figure interferon positive 58 or 54 T-cells, which is.

330
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:23,670
The four inflammatory lymphocytes in the system decrease spleen or pancreatic.

331
00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:36,910
And then what about the figure of six direct sales, which is one subset of the typical T cells that responded to the sales increase in.

332
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:48,490
But the total number is increased at the lymph node and the activated version of those terrorist cells.

333
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:56,629
Increased imports into Sweden. Yeah.

334
00:43:56,630 --> 00:44:01,150
So the, here are the cells.

335
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:06,680
What I want to lay down and the back up.

336
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:13,060
So these are the cells that are doing the damage, right?

337
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:21,520
That effector t cells that create positive interferon gamma producing cells and they're more of them in the control

338
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:29,290
and less in the vitamin D treated animals right for both in the spleen and almost significant in the spleen,

339
00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:37,089
for the males in the lymph nodes and in the pancreatic lymph nodes in the city for cells

340
00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:45,130
to help cells that are also producing interferon gamma just in the females in the spleen,

341
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:51,970
but not in the in the in the pancreatic with those in the males.

342
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:55,000
But this was a .05 difference.

343
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:58,930
If they had more mice, they would probably have shown a little bit of a difference there.

344
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:05,560
And then they're looking at cells that have a different effect here.

345
00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:09,970
So what did we learn about the T regulatory cells?

346
00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:21,480
What are they doing? What might they be doing here? Maybe they can reduce the autonomy and immunity of this.

347
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:25,970
The greatest health. And it also begins to create some high octane.

348
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:35,390
Yes. Yeah, that would have been my next question. They would say secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines that can reduce this autoimmune response.

349
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:45,139
And we're seeing differences here. They're not huge differences, but the they're they're they're modest differences.

350
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:53,090
And then yeah, I don't remember if the paper said that they actually would have measured the biotin in the different cell types.

351
00:45:53,090 --> 00:45:55,430
But I would imagine you would see a big difference here.

352
00:45:56,780 --> 00:46:10,250
So the spleens of these animals are kind of small, but you can get a huge number of cells from them, um, hundreds of thousands of cells from them.

353
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:26,860
So that would make this, these sets of experiments easy with the getting pancreatic lymph nodes that's challenging and getting a lot of cells to, uh,

354
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:34,459
stain and measure just the thing for positive T cells and looking for the percentage of

355
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:38,570
them that are expressing Fox P three indicating that they're the T regulatory cells.

356
00:46:39,590 --> 00:46:49,850
Um, that's challenging. So I'm impressed that they were able to show these differences in the CD4 or FOXP2

357
00:46:49,850 --> 00:46:55,249
three cells and then they're looking at a double positive CD 25 positive effects,

358
00:46:55,250 --> 00:47:00,920
vox pop three for positive CD4 cells and these in these different groups of mice.

359
00:47:02,330 --> 00:47:06,680
So the T regulatory cell numbers are increased.

360
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:17,900
All right. So the next slide or the next question is in FIG. seven.

361
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:24,800
What impact did vitamin D3 supplementation have on the FOX three three cell infiltration?

362
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:34,520
And was this result consistent with the idea that vitamin D3 supplementation prevents type one diabetes by reducing insulin, I guess.

363
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:52,470
Go ahead, dylan. Fox ps3 sales were increased in the mice that receive the.

364
00:47:58,650 --> 00:48:08,760
Don't we now want them to infiltrate them? So these are the we don't want that to affect our cells that are making interferon gamma.

365
00:48:09,630 --> 00:48:17,940
And another thing that an effector cytotoxic t cells make is a grand sign.

366
00:48:17,970 --> 00:48:23,400
This is an infected air molecule that actually kills the target cell,

367
00:48:25,290 --> 00:48:35,190
whereas the T regulatory cells just secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines and they suppress the effect of the cytotoxic T cells.

368
00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:41,220
So in that way, yeah, we would want them to be in there in the eyelids to prevent this from happening.

369
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:46,560
Um, but, um. Yeah, you're right.

370
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:50,490
Okay. Why are t cells going to the to the islets?

371
00:48:50,490 --> 00:49:00,080
You know, like, yeah, these are, these are having a beneficial effect, but, um, we don't want there to be an immune response in the beta cells.

372
00:49:00,090 --> 00:49:07,110
So that's an interesting question too. So they're looking at the number of cells per islet.

373
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:13,860
So this is another score or number that they're getting here that was probably

374
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:20,729
determined by a pathologist or a psychologist where you're giving them slides

375
00:49:20,730 --> 00:49:26,040
from these sections of the pancreas and you're asking them to tell you after

376
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:31,020
you stain them for vox pop three As a marker for these regulatory T cells,

377
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:34,530
how many of them do you find per islet?

378
00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:38,880
And they'll scan a number of fields and they'll come up with this count and values.

379
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:54,720
So and they show statistical significance. Um, here they're saying there's a difference between these two and buried in this figure is a mean bar.

380
00:49:54,810 --> 00:50:00,330
Can you find the mean bar? It's here and here.

381
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:06,180
Is that the error bars? Right. And here and here's the error bars.

382
00:50:07,530 --> 00:50:10,080
Okay. And then same thing here.

383
00:50:10,650 --> 00:50:19,050
You see the same error bar, you know, the mean the nearby, you know the reverse and you can't tell that there's one here.

384
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:28,410
Okay. So not the greatest graphical representation of showing a difference between the two.

385
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:29,070
Right?

386
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:41,220
But at least they show you they're completely transparent in terms of where these mice fall or the number of islets fall in this different sentence.

387
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:51,360
And I can't recall. So this is a number for Ireland and I can't recall how many mice were in this study, actually.

388
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:57,780
Okay. 6 to 14 mice. So that's another interesting thing.

389
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:03,360
So everything else we've been seeing, right? This one.

390
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:13,350
We're looking at the numbers of these different cells per mouse.

391
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:23,160
Right. And then this one, there are 14, 6 to 14 mice represented in this graph.

392
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:32,040
So they pooled these these numbers to give you this graph.

393
00:51:32,970 --> 00:51:48,230
What do you think about that approach? They can just select.

394
00:51:50,670 --> 00:51:54,180
Plus or is history quite a piece of history?

395
00:51:54,540 --> 00:52:01,100
And then just get back to. Hi, Sylvia.

396
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:12,469
Nice. As a diabetic for years. Yeah, but what else could they be doing here in terms of a statistical.

397
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:19,400
No, no. You know what you probably shouldn't be doing. Are there that many differences?

398
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:25,590
Are there that many that that an end would represent an experiment?

399
00:52:25,610 --> 00:52:30,950
Right. And in this case, we're talking about mice that develop diabetes.

400
00:52:31,910 --> 00:52:38,450
So in that way, it's the number of mice that should you should stick with throughout the the whole paper.

401
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:43,910
Right. Okay. So here they're pooling all their data.

402
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:54,330
So in theory, in theory you should get the same mean if you pool all your data, you just have more data points.

403
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:58,920
What is having more data points, duty or statistical analysis though?

404
00:53:03,910 --> 00:53:08,020
Yes. Which is more likely to show statistical differences.

405
00:53:09,130 --> 00:53:19,590
So if you were to look at these bar graphs now, there's not a whole there's not a huge difference here between these two here and here.

406
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:23,980
So what they did was they pulled all of their data together.

407
00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:26,470
And, yes, it would have given them the same mean.

408
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:32,290
But because they have a higher end, they've got more statistical power now and they can show differences.

409
00:53:32,890 --> 00:53:37,150
So that's another criticism I would have had if I were reviewing this paper.

410
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:44,770
All right. What did this look like in terms of and then of four or five that you showed up here?

411
00:53:47,050 --> 00:53:58,360
I believe they're there. But if they're there, why can't you show this relationship to be different as well with the same sample size?

412
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:05,200
John, how you want to say something? Yeah. So, do you mean that they should use just one representative?

413
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:10,750
Then they should. Verbiage place the right milestone?

414
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,990
Yes. Yeah. Instead of number per eyelid.

415
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:23,890
Yeah. So you would in other words, you would take a mouse and you would do maybe I don't remember how many images they took and they analyzed.

416
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:31,390
So you would get an average number for per eyelid, per mouse, and that would be your your your value.

417
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:38,800
And then you would have four of those values or five of those values for four and of four or five per mouse.

418
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:52,810
So here they had one, two, three, four, five, six, six controls and five that were given the vitamin D supplement.

419
00:54:54,310 --> 00:54:58,630
So I would have expected to see the same kind of thing here in terms of their end.

420
00:54:59,050 --> 00:55:04,170
But they show that the data like this, they increase their sample size.

421
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:07,360
They it's easier to show statistical differences.

422
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:14,470
So that's you know, I don't know. That's kind of biasing your statistical analysis.

423
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:18,550
You increase your power and you can show statistical differences.

424
00:55:19,270 --> 00:55:24,550
The did the end here is the mice, not the not the number of violence that you're killing.

425
00:55:25,570 --> 00:55:28,930
Do you see that? Is that a fair assessment? That's that's the way I looked at this.

426
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:33,200
Okay. All right.

427
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:39,200
So this is what I almost talked about in the beginning, but I said, no, I'm going to leave this for the end.

428
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:43,850
So what precautions did the authors mention regarding the conversion of doses

429
00:55:43,850 --> 00:55:48,980
shown to be effective in mice and preventing Type one diabetes in humans?

430
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:54,679
Go ahead. You mentioned that that dosage that they were doing,

431
00:55:54,680 --> 00:56:08,020
the mice were about 200 times at the regular dose and not that safe to just multiply it by increasing the human dose to prevent diabetes.

432
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:18,200
Yeah. So we're we're talking about a lifelong exposure to these high levels.

433
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:26,860
Right. And these are really high doses, 200 times that present in their normal diet.

434
00:56:26,930 --> 00:56:37,090
Right. So if you convert the dose to humans, which is difficult, but if you do this just based on this multiplication,

435
00:56:38,530 --> 00:56:44,920
so you want to give enough to reach this value here, 219 animals per liter.

436
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:49,410
That's you know, here is the baseline value.

437
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:51,580
So they're raising it quite a bit.

438
00:56:53,820 --> 00:57:04,980
And what we talk about in terms of vitamin D sufficiency in animals is in this range, 100 to 50 to 100 NANOMOLES per liter.

439
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:18,270
And so for every 40 international units that you take in per day, this is equivalent to about 0.07 animals per liter.

440
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:28,380
So in order to achieve the same level, you would need to take in 12,500 international units per day to reach that level.

441
00:57:28,830 --> 00:57:42,090
That's a lot of vitamin D. And we know that once you get to this threshold of 125, you start to see some toxicity.

442
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:54,540
So here are some mild adverse effects that can occur after you reach this threshold and it can get much worse than this.

443
00:57:56,130 --> 00:58:04,910
And historically, you do find people who have taken really high levels of vitamin D that have even worse outcomes in what's mentioned here.

444
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:17,700
So anorexia, weight loss, polyp area, heart arrhythmias, and that's serious side effects, vascular and tissue calcification.

445
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:30,150
So you get damage to the heart, damage to the blood vessels, damage to the kidneys that can occur as a consequence of having too much vitamin D.

446
00:58:31,050 --> 00:58:40,230
And it's really hard to achieve these levels from getting it from food sources or exposure to UV radiation.

447
00:58:40,770 --> 00:58:44,580
It can only be achieved if you're taking in supplemental doses.

448
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:55,330
So, Abby, you had a question or comment? Yeah. Individuals who were going to need deficient.

449
00:58:56,020 --> 00:59:01,530
Would it matter how like. Because when I see that the two.

450
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:11,710
Collider. That makes me think of someone who is very concerned enough and they're not really making a decision.

451
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:19,160
So if someone is very deficient, how much Valium do they have to take supplements or dietary?

452
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:22,700
In order to see that protective factor.

453
00:59:24,590 --> 00:59:34,249
So I believe that the values that they gave in this paper or something like we know that you need 400

454
00:59:34,250 --> 00:59:41,580
international units to prevent break in service of less than than I can remember it's well below 12,000 per day.

455
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:46,660
So it's it's more like in the 600 international units per day.

456
00:59:46,670 --> 00:59:54,920
I think that's what I remember in terms of having a sufficient level of vitamin D and that's through through supplementation.

457
00:59:54,930 --> 01:00:01,070
That's the I believe that's the recommended daily allowance that I listed in the previous lecture, Vitamin D.

458
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:07,850
So if you're taking that as a supplement and I can't remember the dose,

459
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:16,160
so women and postmenopausal women are often recommended by their primary care physician to take supplement of vitamin D and calcium.

460
01:00:16,970 --> 01:00:21,710
And I think the dose is something like 600 internationally, but I don't remember exactly.

461
01:00:22,340 --> 01:00:33,260
And that is thought to bring their sperm vitamin D levels up to where normal level during this time of year living in this type of climate.

462
01:00:35,210 --> 01:00:43,880
Interestingly, if you do longitudinal studies in people that practice this guideline, you find that it doesn't prevent hip fractures.

463
01:00:45,170 --> 01:00:52,370
Um, there's a guy who's actually alumnus from our program, really, who's at Harvard School of Public Health,

464
01:00:53,060 --> 01:01:02,180
who actually shows that the more vitamin D you take in through your life, you're at a greater risk of fracture later in life.

465
01:01:02,870 --> 01:01:11,449
And he related it to height. So the taller you are, you know, and if you fall down, you're more likely to break something.

466
01:01:11,450 --> 01:01:23,779
And that's how he, you know, rationalized that association between higher vitamin D and bone length and a greater prevalence of bone

467
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:32,660
fractures in humans that take take either vitamin D3 supplementation or through the intake of dairy products.

468
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:37,910
So an interesting way to interpret that data.

469
01:01:37,910 --> 01:01:43,010
Anyhow, we have a lot this semester on type one diabetes.

470
01:01:43,010 --> 01:01:52,040
And um, so there's this interesting relationship and we had Elizabeth here who has it, who could give us a lot of personal insight to this.

471
01:01:53,000 --> 01:02:01,270
So if you're interested in type one diabetes, the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation research website,

472
01:02:01,270 --> 01:02:09,560
the Research Foundation website is a great resource and understand this said, yes, they can take insulin, but it's not a cure.

473
01:02:09,950 --> 01:02:24,860
It's a way to manage the disease. What their blood glucose levels are there, their hemoglobin levels are over the long term, probably.

474
01:02:25,580 --> 01:02:31,610
I know a few people who have type one diabetes and it's usually not in the normal range.

475
01:02:31,610 --> 01:02:36,620
It's usually above six and below seven.

476
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:41,600
They try to get it at least below 7% for a glycated hemoglobin.

477
01:02:42,830 --> 01:02:54,830
So it's it's not an easy thing to manage even if you have a pump that programs and how much is when you have and what your blood glucose is.

478
01:02:54,830 --> 01:03:00,020
And you have to be careful about how many carbohydrates you take. It is you talk about this in an empty.

479
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:04,760
Yeah. Type one diabetes. I don't think so.

480
01:03:04,820 --> 01:03:09,229
Okay. And that might be something here or even next semester.

481
01:03:09,230 --> 01:03:13,180
Probably so. I really can't yet.

482
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:21,769
Yeah. So being a diabetes educator is not only do have type twos, which will be the predominant majority of people that you see,

483
01:03:21,770 --> 01:03:26,180
but you'll see a fair amount of people with type one diabetes and that, you know,

484
01:03:26,210 --> 01:03:32,060
management of that condition is, is really important and something that people are monitoring.

485
01:03:32,810 --> 01:03:38,450
So nowadays we have this high tech tool where and I think.

486
01:03:38,450 --> 01:03:43,640
Annabelle And actually where is one of these it's a continuous glucose monitor.

487
01:03:45,230 --> 01:03:54,200
So you have this really fine needle and a device that measured blood glucose and you stick it in the back of your arm.

488
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:59,630
Is that right? And maybe I'm not really sure what they're called.

489
01:04:00,650 --> 01:04:09,560
And it's really expensive, you know. So depending on the seriousness of your condition, you, your insurance company may or may not pay for it.

490
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:16,820
And it talks to your phone and it can tell you what your blood glucose is throughout the day.

491
01:04:17,630 --> 01:04:23,390
And you can monitor it and you can send what's going on to.

492
01:04:23,420 --> 01:04:31,580
Your primary care physician, your dietician, and they can help you manage your glucose through that tool.

493
01:04:32,030 --> 01:04:41,809
But it's expensive. And and it was telling me she has she she's monitoring her blood glucose and she said,

494
01:04:41,810 --> 01:04:46,340
you wouldn't believe how much my blood sugar spikes after I've had a box of raisins.

495
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:49,520
You know, they said, well that that makes sense, that your blood sugar would go up.

496
01:04:49,520 --> 01:05:01,759
But you you never think about that source of of sugar being a significant one that could really spike up your your insulin level,

497
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:05,120
your blood and blood sugar and even your insulin levels as well.

498
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:08,660
So interesting area of study.

499
01:05:09,530 --> 01:05:19,310
Yes, I'm on Instagram and like tick tock, I've seen a bunch of like health and wellness influencers who have a lot of money.

500
01:05:19,670 --> 01:05:24,860
They wear that CGM as a way to monitor their blood glucose.

501
01:05:24,860 --> 01:05:32,060
And I know that like some of them like have clients that they also like prescribe this too to be able to help them lose weight.

502
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:36,890
I know they've received a lot of backlash in terms of like them not having diabetes

503
01:05:36,890 --> 01:05:40,640
and like having their resources up like other people don't have that included.

504
01:05:41,390 --> 01:05:44,510
So. Yeah.

505
01:05:48,270 --> 01:05:49,290
So yeah,

506
01:05:49,290 --> 01:05:57,750
I don't like Instagram and you know these aren't peer reviewed references so know I don't I don't I don't try not to pay much attention to that.

507
01:05:59,220 --> 01:06:07,800
So yeah, but there, there are groups of people who do and you have to be careful where you get your information from.

508
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:16,139
So if you're having your checkups regularly and you're monitoring your hemoglobin,

509
01:06:16,140 --> 01:06:19,440
I want to see that should be enough to tell you where you need to be.

510
01:06:19,830 --> 01:06:26,700
If it goes up and you get into the pre-diabetes range, that's when you need to start monitoring a little bit more closely,

511
01:06:27,060 --> 01:06:34,799
which would mean more frequent visits to your primary care physician not buying an expensive

512
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:38,970
monitor and trying to do whatever the person that picked up your Instagram is doing.

513
01:06:39,870 --> 01:06:45,400
Yeah. Yeah. So are we right now?

514
01:06:45,780 --> 01:06:49,620
Done a little early. So next time we don't have class on Tuesday?

515
01:06:51,150 --> 01:06:57,930
Uh, we have, uh, see a master presentation tonight, right?

516
01:06:58,470 --> 01:07:03,500
And you're going on the ninth st 29, 28th, right?

517
01:07:03,510 --> 01:07:07,860
29th. So this is when we get back to the things giving. All right.

518
01:07:08,910 --> 01:07:13,110
I didn't feel like that. So that's all I have today.

519
01:07:13,110 --> 01:07:14,400
Any questions about.
