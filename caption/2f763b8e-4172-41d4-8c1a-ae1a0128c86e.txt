1
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:20,630
All right, I think we can go ahead and get started. Good afternoon, everyone.

2
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:26,420
Welcome to eat five ninety seven, which is environmental, health and policy.

3
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:32,300
My name is Tim Debauch. I'll tell you a little bit more about myself in a few minutes.

4
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:36,140
But just to go ahead. Uh, this appears to be working.

5
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:40,100
This is my first time in this classroom, actually during the pandemic.

6
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:44,090
So the technology is a little bit of an unknown to me.

7
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:48,410
But we've got one of the fancy new owl cams, so that's great. I'm recording it.

8
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:54,950
We'll find out after class if it actually worked, and it shows up as a Panopto recording at our campus or not.

9
00:00:54,950 --> 00:01:00,920
But if it's successful, that will be my intention is to record every class session.

10
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:05,480
Let's see. I wanted to start off with this stuff.

11
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:15,980
So right, we're like right back in the middle of it with this crazy pandemic that never wants to let us be free.

12
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:20,180
I know that everyone is dealing with all kinds of crazy stuff right now, right?

13
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,570
Whether you're in the classroom or outside of the classroom.

14
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:30,260
Bottom line, if you're not feeling well, don't come to class and don't worry about it right again.

15
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:37,650
Fingers crossed the Panopto is working. I'm going to do everything I can to help you get through some miss class periods, right?

16
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:50,390
Like everyone's health and wellbeing is way, way more important than, you know, lecture materials that we have other ways to to address.

17
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:57,320
Secondly, I think most of you know this stuff here in public health, these buildings,

18
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:01,100
there's actually a screener like a real person at the entrance is right,

19
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:08,510
and you need to complete the responsibly and not just completed, but show the person the screen on the way in.

20
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:12,620
Everyone has a mask on. This is like super old news at this point.

21
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:18,860
But definitely the face covering. I'm actually at a loss.

22
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:25,010
The class that I taught in last semester had like these little sticker dots and all the cares about distancing.

23
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:28,520
I don't see any in this room. What's what's like this survey?

24
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:33,630
Is it kind of hit or miss, depending on what classroom you're in? OK, interesting.

25
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:37,280
Um, but we will still try to respect this.

26
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:44,990
Um, I might even mess around after class or something and take some liberties with like trying to, like, rearrange it in a way that gives.

27
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:50,660
I don't know if there's a way to have more distancing or not, but we'll see what we can do.

28
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:58,460
But we definitely want to stick with this one at the bottom. No, no eating in the classroom, you know, like hydration is like a real thing.

29
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:04,190
From time to time, I'm going to pull off my mask and take a sip of water. I know that you're going to that's going to be unavoidable for you.

30
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:09,740
Sometimes I do have it in a later slide. We'll definitely take a break in this class.

31
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:13,850
We're not going to start and go for two hours straight uninterrupted,

32
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:21,490
so we'll have a purposeful break, even if it's just five minutes in each class period.

33
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:30,010
And then, you know, I'm hoping to be able to ditch this slide from the first class meeting of each class as soon as possible,

34
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:33,100
but unfortunately it's still in the slide deck.

35
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:42,280
So we're coming out of, you know, it was a really challenging semester for many of you in the fall and or at least starting off this winter semester,

36
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:51,970
kind of in a similar similar mode. I am going to try to do all of these things as an instructor.

37
00:03:51,970 --> 00:04:01,480
I'm going to try to be as flexible as possible as understanding as possible, and I'm certainly practicing resiliency.

38
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:12,550
And so I'll ask you to try to, you know, implement those traits among yourselves as classmates and towards me as well as much as possible.

39
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:21,070
I think the the biggest thing as a class in our success is communicating if something is up,

40
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:26,170
if you can just give me a heads up, you don't need to give me the private details of your life.

41
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:27,910
That's certainly not necessary.

42
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:34,330
But just letting you know what's going on if you're going to miss class, if you're going to be late with an assignment, like whatever it is.

43
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:43,240
Just shoot me a note. And as long as we're communicating, you know, I don't have any concerns that we can't manage it and get through it just fine.

44
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:48,310
Yeah. So that's kind of the part of it of working together is mostly communicating.

45
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:56,740
And then this one down here at the bottom in terms of seeking out resources, I know that for pretty much all of you,

46
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:01,990
this is not your first semester on campus, so you're already aware of what some of those resources are.

47
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:06,850
Please don't hesitate to reach out to me outside of class contact.

48
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:12,400
I'm happy to serve as kind of a conduit to help point you in the right direction.

49
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:17,050
I will. I'm absolutely willing to entertain any question you have.

50
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:26,560
I might not know the answers to all the questions you have, but at this point I have a pretty good understanding of what the resources are.

51
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,410
And so together, we can kind of figure out how to get answers to the questions.

52
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:37,610
So don't hesitate to reach out to me about anything. All right.

53
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:42,830
Actually, I want to before you go forward, any questions just with the kind of this very,

54
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:52,240
very general introduction to and recognition that things are still pretty tough right now.

55
00:05:52,240 --> 00:06:01,300
Any comments? Anybody want to like, complain out loud because it would feel really good right now to do so?

56
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:11,110
OK. All right. So with that, let's go ahead and and jump into something breakout groups.

57
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:17,950
I'm going to do a really quick count. Three five six seven eight nine 10 11 12.

58
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:22,060
How about actually based on how you're spacing?

59
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:30,340
Maybe just pairs that would probably be OK pairs if it works, but I don't want anybody to actually get up and move.

60
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:40,330
Three is also OK. So in groups of two and three, whichever like physically works out best for you, turn to the person or people next to you.

61
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:49,990
And over the course of the next 10 minutes, come up with three pressing environmental health policy issues.

62
00:06:49,990 --> 00:07:00,820
Once you've done that, rank those three at the end of the ten minutes, we'll kind of reconvene and have each group report back down.

63
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:15,580
Ready, set go. I'm going to take five years if I.

64
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:24,940
I just do this. And a lot of writers.

65
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:34,430
As I say, the person who lived like me and I'm very handsome is wonderful.

66
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:37,383
Yeah, I have something along. Right here in New York or something, I know it's pretty basic.

67
00:07:42,884 --> 00:07:48,314
Yeah, I like the character of person. You care about your friend.

68
00:07:48,314 --> 00:07:55,094
All right. Let's go ahead and reconvene. All right.

69
00:07:55,094 --> 00:08:03,914
So what did folks come up with? Let's kind of maybe start in the back corner or what were three issues and what ranking?

70
00:08:03,914 --> 00:08:14,204
Yeah, I mean, I talked about what we can help them in terms of what faces, so I can be her quality.

71
00:08:14,204 --> 00:08:19,304
Materials and pathways to monitor for that.

72
00:08:19,304 --> 00:08:33,604
Yeah, that's that kind of pressing recently. Occupational vaccine candidates and their last night you got paid time off in terms of.

73
00:08:33,604 --> 00:08:43,984
Sure. Excellent example. Great, what about maybe the other corner and event we talked about carbon neutral air pollution,

74
00:08:43,984 --> 00:08:51,244
water quality and then like dust and sewage as to people's living.

75
00:08:51,244 --> 00:08:55,114
And then I'd say, OK, great.

76
00:08:55,114 --> 00:08:59,344
Excellent. Maybe just coming up a row or two. What did you come up with?

77
00:08:59,344 --> 00:09:03,604
We talked about first like carbon release regulations in terms of like climate change.

78
00:09:03,604 --> 00:09:11,824
And then we talked about water regulations and then also like land use, both in terms of like agriculture or oil drilling.

79
00:09:11,824 --> 00:09:16,364
Nature. Excellent, excellent. And then coming back over here.

80
00:09:16,364 --> 00:09:19,934
Yeah, we talked about basically the same as the last group.

81
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:24,194
Our first was climate change because it's sort of like international, I guess.

82
00:09:24,194 --> 00:09:30,344
And then water pipes, etc. And then third on the smells and regulation.

83
00:09:30,344 --> 00:09:35,954
OK. This is great like some great, some themes kind of developing, but then also some some new tangents with each one.

84
00:09:35,954 --> 00:09:41,944
What about in the front here? We talked about wildfires, air pollution and water quality.

85
00:09:41,944 --> 00:09:48,314
Perfect. And then on the side, we talked about air pollution impacting air quality, health like increase asthma rates.

86
00:09:48,314 --> 00:09:50,174
And then we talked about water quality.

87
00:09:50,174 --> 00:09:58,184
Family has runoff and then a lack of green space impacting the ability to get exercise and effective mental health.

88
00:09:58,184 --> 00:10:04,424
Excellent. Okay, wonderful. This is great. We're going to kind of come back to this stuff.

89
00:10:04,424 --> 00:10:11,204
I just wanted to get folks talking in general.

90
00:10:11,204 --> 00:10:14,454
I want to talk as little as possible in this course, right?

91
00:10:14,454 --> 00:10:18,584
I know you guys were stuck in many classes where you have an instructor up at the front of the room,

92
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:24,074
just like going on and on and on and on with lecturing. And in some cases, that's that's necessary.

93
00:10:24,074 --> 00:10:27,944
I taught classes where, you know, I have to do quite a bit of that.

94
00:10:27,944 --> 00:10:34,574
This class I designed so that I'm doing that as little as possible and so that there's truly a discussion

95
00:10:34,574 --> 00:10:39,924
going on as much as possible when we look at the requirements of the course here in a minute.

96
00:10:39,924 --> 00:10:46,034
You know, you'll see that there are some expectations, you know, for you all to kind of bring to that discussion.

97
00:10:46,034 --> 00:10:52,544
But this is great. I'm going to try to interject things like this as much as I can and to each of our class sessions to get us talking.

98
00:10:52,544 --> 00:10:57,614
And don't forget those three policy issues you came up with and the ranking.

99
00:10:57,614 --> 00:11:02,354
We're going to start to come back to that, not just in a few minutes before basically the rest of the course.

100
00:11:02,354 --> 00:11:10,154
You all have hit on some really, really important ones and the themes there are not random.

101
00:11:10,154 --> 00:11:18,164
So thanks for that. Another thing that's really important to help kind of facilitate our discussions,

102
00:11:18,164 --> 00:11:24,674
have them be open and freely flowing is to get to know each other a little bit better.

103
00:11:24,674 --> 00:11:28,844
Right. So I'm going to start. I'll introduce myself again.

104
00:11:28,844 --> 00:11:36,614
My name's Tim Demange. Um, I do research right, like most of your other professors that you've had.

105
00:11:36,614 --> 00:11:40,694
But my goal here is not to tell you about my research and say, Wow, you should be impressed.

106
00:11:40,694 --> 00:11:46,094
That's cool. My goal is to talk about my research and how it applies to this course, right?

107
00:11:46,094 --> 00:11:49,934
And so why I'm interested in teaching this course in the first place.

108
00:11:49,934 --> 00:12:00,914
So I do work primarily around pollutants that are in the air or in the air at one point and how they impact human health.

109
00:12:00,914 --> 00:12:11,574
So this picture here, I realize, as well as I was previewing the slides, uh, since the start of the pandemic, I think I really see this picture right.

110
00:12:11,574 --> 00:12:16,424
I have a single picture of myself and I still have a mask. It's terrible.

111
00:12:16,424 --> 00:12:26,744
Uh, so I do research on air pollution and health, and what this is showing is work that I've been part of.

112
00:12:26,744 --> 00:12:32,414
Not too far away. This is the Detroit Dearborn industrial area.

113
00:12:32,414 --> 00:12:36,914
This is at an elementary school, Salina Elementary,

114
00:12:36,914 --> 00:12:42,554
where one of the permanent air quality monitoring sites in the state of Michigan

115
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:50,084
operates and where we had for a time period a mobile laboratory in place.

116
00:12:50,084 --> 00:12:56,534
And so as part of this work that I was involved in, there were kind of large,

117
00:12:56,534 --> 00:13:05,924
community based participatory research projects where community members working with community based organizations

118
00:13:05,924 --> 00:13:13,964
were assessing exposures and impact on how there were others that were more specifically cohort based.

119
00:13:13,964 --> 00:13:21,134
So we had adults and looking at the risk for cardiovascular disease as a result of pollution exposure,

120
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:32,264
as well as young children and the risk of exacerbation of their asthmatic condition or status as a result of exposure to pollution.

121
00:13:32,264 --> 00:13:41,864
We were able to kind of bring that down to a more mechanistic level through the use of these mobile laboratories, the same communities.

122
00:13:41,864 --> 00:13:46,604
What we're doing is cohort studies and with community based organizations identifying

123
00:13:46,604 --> 00:13:52,214
what there's adverse impact on health from whatever it is they're being exposed to.

124
00:13:52,214 --> 00:13:57,764
You're able to bring in these mobile labs and do these very controlled studies,

125
00:13:57,764 --> 00:14:05,954
things that are really difficult to do in a population from an epidemiological perspective as so many other things that you can't control.

126
00:14:05,954 --> 00:14:11,484
So we had, uh, exposure chambers inside these labs that.

127
00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:17,964
Bringing in air from outside the community is breathing every single day, bringing it in.

128
00:14:17,964 --> 00:14:25,704
There's the inlet here on top of this. This is basically a semi tractor trailer that you would be driving down the highway,

129
00:14:25,704 --> 00:14:29,724
delivering, you know, distributing groceries or whatever to markets or something.

130
00:14:29,724 --> 00:14:35,334
Except this one was outfitted the inside with a bunch of exposure facility.

131
00:14:35,334 --> 00:14:40,704
And so it would bring in specifically particles to move the final this stuff later in the semester.

132
00:14:40,704 --> 00:14:47,214
But particulate matter, so not gases, but solids that are in the air and of a certain size range,

133
00:14:47,214 --> 00:14:54,054
the ones that are small enough to really cause, you know, lung damage and irritation and inflammation concentrate those particles,

134
00:14:54,054 --> 00:15:01,494
bring them into an exposure chamber where we had people sit in them for a couple of hours at a time.

135
00:15:01,494 --> 00:15:08,394
These were very clinical and controlled studies, right? People would volunteer to participate.

136
00:15:08,394 --> 00:15:15,504
They would come. They'd have a workup done beforehand and fast and make before blood drawn, have heart rate monitors and things.

137
00:15:15,504 --> 00:15:22,524
While they were inside. We they were controlled in the sense that they would do this multiple times.

138
00:15:22,524 --> 00:15:27,624
One of the times they would actually be exposed to particles coming in.

139
00:15:27,624 --> 00:15:32,994
Other times there was just to have a filter on the outside of the exposure chamber and their breathing.

140
00:15:32,994 --> 00:15:41,544
Very clean air, right? But they don't know the difference. So there's a really nice measure of control in place to look at the difference in response.

141
00:15:41,544 --> 00:15:46,914
There's also another component other studies where this human chamber could be removed.

142
00:15:46,914 --> 00:15:51,294
An animal chamber could go in. And so animals would be exposed.

143
00:15:51,294 --> 00:15:55,134
Same approach controls for animals that are breathing have a filter,

144
00:15:55,134 --> 00:16:03,054
clean air and then other animals that are breathing the air, coming in particles coming in from outside the community.

145
00:16:03,054 --> 00:16:06,234
So this allowed us to take those more educated,

146
00:16:06,234 --> 00:16:15,294
population based cohort study data and link it more mechanistically with and be able to answer questions like what's actually going on?

147
00:16:15,294 --> 00:16:23,194
Why are kids responding this way? Or Why are adults at a higher risk for cardiovascular disease from the exposure?

148
00:16:23,194 --> 00:16:26,514
You know, all kind of come back around to that in a minute.

149
00:16:26,514 --> 00:16:35,104
Another aspect of my work that I've spent a lot of time on is looking at atmospheric mercury deposition.

150
00:16:35,104 --> 00:16:44,274
Right. So mercury is this pretty unique metal and that it's it can exist as a vapor at ambient conditions.

151
00:16:44,274 --> 00:16:52,944
Most other medicals are in a solid phase. Because of that, it makes it awfully easy to disperse itself all over the planet.

152
00:16:52,944 --> 00:16:57,714
It's why mercury pollution is so widespread across the globe.

153
00:16:57,714 --> 00:17:04,764
But anyway, I've done a lot of work on, so in contrast to the particulate matter.

154
00:17:04,764 --> 00:17:11,724
It's a risk from an exposure perspective when we breathe in and it gets into our lives for Mercury.

155
00:17:11,724 --> 00:17:23,844
For the most part, that's not the case. Mercury exists when it's in the air, in an elemental vapor state that's not very reactive, it's pretty inert.

156
00:17:23,844 --> 00:17:31,164
So for the end, it's in pretty low concentrations. So for the most part, what you breathe in, you can exhale back out.

157
00:17:31,164 --> 00:17:34,644
Combine that with it being at a pretty low concentration in the air,

158
00:17:34,644 --> 00:17:40,554
and it's not so much of an inhalation or where the problem comes in is when that mercury is able to

159
00:17:40,554 --> 00:17:50,634
be deposited from the atmosphere down to terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and becomes methylated.

160
00:17:50,634 --> 00:17:59,334
At this point, it's fat soluble so that when creatures consume it,

161
00:17:59,334 --> 00:18:06,354
it does not just simply go through that it's retained as fat by water retained in the body as you go up the food chain.

162
00:18:06,354 --> 00:18:11,394
Bigger and better things are eating each other to the point that we are eating right.

163
00:18:11,394 --> 00:18:19,554
Most commonly, fish is the biggest source of exposure when it comes to mercury for people.

164
00:18:19,554 --> 00:18:25,494
And in that case, right, it's not that inhalation that we're worried about ingestion as a route of exposure.

165
00:18:25,494 --> 00:18:32,424
And so I've done a lot of work characterizing deposition rates in different locations.

166
00:18:32,424 --> 00:18:43,734
Most of these pictures are from down in South Florida, where the Florida Everglades and mercury contamination issues have been a case for a long time.

167
00:18:43,734 --> 00:18:48,984
So a big part of my work and both of these kind of areas of study like you might think,

168
00:18:48,984 --> 00:18:51,864
Wow, those are really different, like you're doing this particulate matter,

169
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:58,884
work about inhalation over here and you're doing this, you know, mercury stuff about ingestion over here,

170
00:18:58,884 --> 00:19:06,984
where they where they converge really nicely with my interest is aiming to inform policy.

171
00:19:06,984 --> 00:19:11,264
So providing data rate for improved decision making and.

172
00:19:11,264 --> 00:19:19,034
Policymaking, so as you might imagine, when we design this study and the main question is,

173
00:19:19,034 --> 00:19:24,884
does exposure to particulate matter caused something bad for health?

174
00:19:24,884 --> 00:19:34,514
The answer is almost always yes, right? Same kind of thing for Mercury is the mercury that's deposited in these areas,

175
00:19:34,514 --> 00:19:40,094
causing downstream impacts and resulting in high concentrations of mercury in tissues.

176
00:19:40,094 --> 00:19:48,134
The answer is almost always yes. So then kind of the natural follow up question is, well, where's it coming from, right?

177
00:19:48,134 --> 00:19:52,484
And where can we intervene to help reduce that?

178
00:19:52,484 --> 00:20:02,054
So in the case of the ppm, where are these particles coming from so that we can better regulate, have better policies to reduce those exposures?

179
00:20:02,054 --> 00:20:10,124
And in the case of the mercury, same thing, where is that mercury coming from or is it being emitted from so that we can address it head on?

180
00:20:10,124 --> 00:20:18,044
So that's really where my interest is using all kinds of tools like meteorology looking at on a regional scale,

181
00:20:18,044 --> 00:20:21,914
you know, where do air masses come from, like transporting particles,

182
00:20:21,914 --> 00:20:30,614
long distances or transporting mercury long distances or on a local scale, just basically looking at wind direction if you're in a,

183
00:20:30,614 --> 00:20:40,184
uh, in a community for the elementary school here, you know, with all of this industry lined up behind the school grounds.

184
00:20:40,184 --> 00:20:43,094
All you need to do is just have a simple wind vane. Right?

185
00:20:43,094 --> 00:20:50,744
And it's mapping, you know, which direction is the wind blowing, and it's going to tell you when you're downwind of these smokestacks that are only,

186
00:20:50,744 --> 00:20:59,684
you know, hundreds of meters away and then utilizing some, some some really cool chemistry.

187
00:20:59,684 --> 00:21:05,684
A lot of when it comes to air pollution, a lot of traditional emission sources,

188
00:21:05,684 --> 00:21:09,584
whether they're emitting mercury into the air or whether they're emitting particulate

189
00:21:09,584 --> 00:21:17,744
matter to the air and other things that are specific to the emission source type.

190
00:21:17,744 --> 00:21:23,564
So for example, when coal is burned and activities, you can't really read it.

191
00:21:23,564 --> 00:21:34,454
But this is coal combustion. When coal is burned to generate electricity, it emits bad stuff that we know about sulfur dioxide.

192
00:21:34,454 --> 00:21:43,094
Gas is is one of the bad ones. We might be also concerned about carbon monoxide, but it emits a lot of other things.

193
00:21:43,094 --> 00:21:51,044
And so when coal is mined out of the Earth, it's naturally enriched in some things, sulfur being one of them.

194
00:21:51,044 --> 00:21:55,214
That's why there's so much sulfur dioxide gas liberated when the coal is burned.

195
00:21:55,214 --> 00:22:01,094
But there's also these trace elements that are associated with coal.

196
00:22:01,094 --> 00:22:07,274
It's mined out of the Earth. So something like selenium is very specific.

197
00:22:07,274 --> 00:22:15,194
So when we measure particles in the air and if we see high levels of sulfur and selenium,

198
00:22:15,194 --> 00:22:21,914
we can characterize how much of those particles came from a coal combustion emissions source.

199
00:22:21,914 --> 00:22:26,744
Similarly, for motor vehicles, there are different elements we can look at.

200
00:22:26,744 --> 00:22:28,934
Things like oil refineries,

201
00:22:28,934 --> 00:22:42,224
vanadium and nickel are two chemical species that are again naturally enriched in this type of oil when it's extracted from the Earth.

202
00:22:42,224 --> 00:22:52,034
And so when we see those vanadium and nickel signatures in a in a ppm sample, we can tell where it's coming from going right down the list.

203
00:22:52,034 --> 00:23:03,344
Waste incineration and so forth. So they're basically chemical signatures or tracers that we can utilize to assess or apportion how much mercury,

204
00:23:03,344 --> 00:23:07,244
how much of this particulate matter is coming from a different source Typekit.

205
00:23:07,244 --> 00:23:14,744
And so, you know, I'm happy to do this type of work that contributes to continuing,

206
00:23:14,744 --> 00:23:21,344
you know, the scientific process and understanding more about exposure and health.

207
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:31,064
But I'm most excited about how it contributes to informing improved policy and regulation.

208
00:23:31,064 --> 00:23:35,174
All right. That was an extremely long winded self introduction.

209
00:23:35,174 --> 00:23:38,804
Actually, I have one last slide. This is just something to kind of promote.

210
00:23:38,804 --> 00:23:44,444
I have a new grant from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.

211
00:23:44,444 --> 00:23:55,754
This is just as of September, uh, where we've identified actually from the the needs of research, exposure and health studies,

212
00:23:55,754 --> 00:24:07,334
where there's a hurdle preventing degeneration of data and information to inform that policy one around air pollution exposure.

213
00:24:07,334 --> 00:24:16,134
And again, we're back to these particles, this particulate matter. Is the type of measurement technology that we have available to us.

214
00:24:16,134 --> 00:24:24,534
So over the course of the last few decades, mostly what's available to assess what we're supposed to for particles in the air?

215
00:24:24,534 --> 00:24:29,544
Are these things that are commercially available for occupational environments?

216
00:24:29,544 --> 00:24:37,594
So a person who works in a factory right where you know that there's exposure concerns in the air wears like this

217
00:24:37,594 --> 00:24:44,574
have this big kind of thing that they flip onto their cell and they wear it around as part of their work day.

218
00:24:44,574 --> 00:24:48,384
They do it to this part of their job, right? It's a little bit of a pain in the butt.

219
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:53,184
You have to wear this thing. It's a little bit cumbersome, a little bit onerous.

220
00:24:53,184 --> 00:24:58,314
But hey, their shift is only a few hours long, usually at the most.

221
00:24:58,314 --> 00:25:03,804
Outside of that workplace environment, there's all of the rest of us right in our everyday lives,

222
00:25:03,804 --> 00:25:07,734
and it's not like we're only exposed, you know, for a work shift.

223
00:25:07,734 --> 00:25:14,514
It's all 24 hours that we're trying to accommodate and account for.

224
00:25:14,514 --> 00:25:22,284
And then when when we talked about pollution exposure, we're most concerned about susceptible populations or vulnerable populations.

225
00:25:22,284 --> 00:25:34,224
Right at the top of that list are elderly folks, small children, women of childbearing age.

226
00:25:34,224 --> 00:25:39,744
And those are the ones that don't really conform to the big honking thing to clip onto your belt,

227
00:25:39,744 --> 00:25:44,844
that to carry around to be able to estimate what your exposure to pollution is.

228
00:25:44,844 --> 00:25:51,954
So I've been working with a group of collaborators on how to continue to miniaturize this stuff.

229
00:25:51,954 --> 00:25:54,684
So, you know, this is kind of where we're at now.

230
00:25:54,684 --> 00:26:02,064
This is maybe, I don't know, maybe the size of your phone, maybe two pounds back to back and we're trying to get smaller,

231
00:26:02,064 --> 00:26:11,874
but without losing spatial and temporal resolution and that chemical information that seems to be really valuable.

232
00:26:11,874 --> 00:26:21,414
All right. So that's the conclusion of my long winded self introduction. I want to turn things around and give you each a minute.

233
00:26:21,414 --> 00:26:26,904
Right? Again, the more comfortable we can be with having this in-class discussion, the better.

234
00:26:26,904 --> 00:26:29,184
So getting to know each other a little bit.

235
00:26:29,184 --> 00:26:38,184
How about we'll start in the very back corner and just kind of work our way up the road in 60 seconds or less?

236
00:26:38,184 --> 00:26:42,174
Your name? What program you're studying.

237
00:26:42,174 --> 00:26:50,484
What gear you're in. And if you can articulate it, why are you taking this class?

238
00:26:50,484 --> 00:26:58,764
It could be because whatever you're fascinated by the topic, it could be, yeah, I need to take it in order to graduate.

239
00:26:58,764 --> 00:27:05,454
Any of the above is a reasonable answer. And if you wouldn't mind starting, I'm not sure.

240
00:27:05,454 --> 00:27:16,914
I'm curious to hear just environmental, health and promotion policy program, and I'm here because of the president's program.

241
00:27:16,914 --> 00:27:21,284
So I don't know too much about the topic there.

242
00:27:21,284 --> 00:27:34,904
Nothing's ever things on the scene here on the viewing, public health and I'm taking this.

243
00:27:34,904 --> 00:27:43,634
There's this friend 60 Minutes recently, and this woman lived in the area and is in her backyard was just straight sewage.

244
00:27:43,634 --> 00:27:49,664
She's talking about how it's affected her kids health and the whole community needs help.

245
00:27:49,664 --> 00:27:57,524
And I was just watching and I was like, Wow, that's. I guess we're more about stuff like that.

246
00:27:57,524 --> 00:28:09,754
Awesome. Thank you so much. And first, your master's student under public health, I'm going for a master's in Health Services Administration.

247
00:28:09,754 --> 00:28:14,254
I took this personally like it kind of help me in that area.

248
00:28:14,254 --> 00:28:18,604
It's interesting. Familiar. Thanks. Excellent.

249
00:28:18,604 --> 00:28:25,594
Thank you, Courtney. I'm Sara. I'm a senior. Yes, track in the undergraduate health program.

250
00:28:25,594 --> 00:28:32,794
And I'm taking this because I'm interested in policy of, like environmental public separately.

251
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:41,284
I pulled together and it was two credits. I thought, thank you.

252
00:28:41,284 --> 00:28:46,884
Yeah, I well, I did my last year environmental engineering and kind of thing.

253
00:28:46,884 --> 00:28:53,184
This passes to friends, but I quit before DHS course because that's how my career started this year.

254
00:28:53,184 --> 00:29:04,254
So that's great. Thanks a lot. I'm Bridget, first year student and I'm in this class becomes a part of my program,

255
00:29:04,254 --> 00:29:08,934
but I chose this program because I am really interested in my mental health and policy.

256
00:29:08,934 --> 00:29:14,934
Had an internship when I was an undergrad that had to do with the mental health policy and and blood poisoning.

257
00:29:14,934 --> 00:29:21,384
That's kind of what got me out of this crisis. Well, my favorite topics in the past.

258
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:25,344
Perfect. Thanks, Bridget. Hi, I'm Victoria, she hers.

259
00:29:25,344 --> 00:29:29,234
I'm a senior in undergraduate and public health programs.

260
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:35,434
B.A. and I decided to take this class because I was addressing conservative support in the future.

261
00:29:35,434 --> 00:29:42,354
I know that environmental hazards disproportionately impacted communities of color. So let's hear more about that.

262
00:29:42,354 --> 00:29:48,324
Excellent. Thank you. Hi, Andy, I'm kind of a senior in the fourth called City Public Policy.

263
00:29:48,324 --> 00:29:50,754
My focus here now is health care policy.

264
00:29:50,754 --> 00:29:54,804
So taking taken a lot of her off policy courses that I haven't taken environmental environmental policy class,

265
00:29:54,804 --> 00:29:59,904
so I'm really excited to round out that part of my education discourse.

266
00:29:59,904 --> 00:30:10,684
Excellent. Thank you. Either I'm a senior undergraduate program and I already took the environmental, public health class and undergrad program.

267
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:16,194
I really liked it. So. But I would take this. That's great.

268
00:30:16,194 --> 00:30:21,714
Thank you so much. I'm Claire, I'm a senior in the undergraduate program in the abstract,

269
00:30:21,714 --> 00:30:29,454
and I also took this class because I had exposure to environmental health classes and policy classes and was attracted to others,

270
00:30:29,454 --> 00:30:35,064
but sometimes fantastic. My name is Mira. I'm also a first year news program,

271
00:30:35,064 --> 00:30:43,644
so it is required for the concentration that I did to the class because it's really interesting and I like Dr. Factor mindful classes with him.

272
00:30:43,644 --> 00:30:47,394
So, yeah, excited. Awesome. Thank you. I'm Rachel.

273
00:30:47,394 --> 00:30:51,474
I'm a senior in undergrad public health program.

274
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:57,294
I'm really interested in the topic of this class and I haven't had a chance to teach environment class yet.

275
00:30:57,294 --> 00:31:01,854
So excited. Okay, awesome. Awesome.

276
00:31:01,854 --> 00:31:05,964
So exactly what I was hoping for and commenting on.

277
00:31:05,964 --> 00:31:12,684
You all bring very different perspectives, right? Very different interests.

278
00:31:12,684 --> 00:31:19,704
Hopefully, you're going to learn a lot from me in the course, but I'm going to do my best to facilitate you,

279
00:31:19,704 --> 00:31:24,534
not just learning from me, but also learning from each other.

280
00:31:24,534 --> 00:31:30,714
Trust me, it happens every year and every class it happens, and it's a really, really cool.

281
00:31:30,714 --> 00:31:35,064
But you all have unique experiences and unique skills,

282
00:31:35,064 --> 00:31:42,294
unique understandings and unique perspectives that you bring to a specific topic or any array of topics.

283
00:31:42,294 --> 00:31:48,654
And so that's my goal is to facilitate those exchanges so that collectively we're

284
00:31:48,654 --> 00:31:54,294
learning absolutely as much as possible any any questions or comments before.

285
00:31:54,294 --> 00:31:56,784
That was kind of our introduction section.

286
00:31:56,784 --> 00:32:01,134
Any questions or comments before we kind of move on, we'll get into some of the nuts and bolts of the course.

287
00:32:01,134 --> 00:32:05,424
Yeah, go ahead. How do you prefer to address your question? It's totally your choice.

288
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:10,224
So I introduce myself as Tim demarche. Some people just like, have this thing.

289
00:32:10,224 --> 00:32:16,524
They either professor or a doctor, or they just don't feel comfortable. I'm fine with that.

290
00:32:16,524 --> 00:32:20,934
I'll only answer to pretty much whatever you call me. Actually, here's another one to throw in there.

291
00:32:20,934 --> 00:32:24,804
So if you yeah. So here, here it is. This is my full name.

292
00:32:24,804 --> 00:32:31,554
Joseph Timothy device on canvas. Everything that's posted, it's going to see like Joseph device write.

293
00:32:31,554 --> 00:32:38,214
My email is probably going to have something that shows up. Is Joseph device actually go by my middle name?

294
00:32:38,214 --> 00:32:45,474
So throughout my entire life, I've responded to like multiple names that kind of like, look, no matter what people say.

295
00:32:45,474 --> 00:32:58,224
So, you know, Professor Dr. Divines, Tim, hey, you like whatever works and I want to be as informal as possible in this course.

296
00:32:58,224 --> 00:33:04,484
So it's really up to you. I have I have zero expectation in that regard.

297
00:33:04,484 --> 00:33:08,244
So I'm not. It's it must be the mask.

298
00:33:08,244 --> 00:33:13,984
Do I sound like I'm from the south is a common thing that a lot of people are going to be told is obviously they go out middle name.

299
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:17,514
Oh yeah. Then they get the like the first, second, first and middle name.

300
00:33:17,514 --> 00:33:25,314
Then they're like, I did something bad is this is my father's name was also Joseph.

301
00:33:25,314 --> 00:33:32,654
So like, you know, as as far back as I can remember, I've always been called Tim and referred to as Tim.

302
00:33:32,654 --> 00:33:36,174
I think you're at what age I realized that my first name is Joseph.

303
00:33:36,174 --> 00:33:44,154
And it was, uh, it was like this painful experience every first day of school throughout all of grade school.

304
00:33:44,154 --> 00:33:50,004
Right. The teacher takes attendance and they're calling out their names on the letters that they have.

305
00:33:50,004 --> 00:33:52,734
And you're supposed to raise your hand, right if you're there.

306
00:33:52,734 --> 00:33:59,124
And the teacher says, Joseph Debauch and I like I raise my hand and then I say, Can you please call me Tim?

307
00:33:59,124 --> 00:34:03,844
And they gave me this look at like, why? But OK, whatever.

308
00:34:03,844 --> 00:34:18,314
Sure. I don't know. I'm kind of beyond it now, so I pretty much answer to anything without any offense taking any, any other questions or comments.

309
00:34:18,314 --> 00:34:26,594
All right, cool. And thanks again, thanks for being willing to introduce yourself and share a little bit about your interest.

310
00:34:26,594 --> 00:34:30,104
So we're going to actually do all these things in the past.

311
00:34:30,104 --> 00:34:36,164
I used to just say, you know what, you're responsible for reading the syllabus and knowing all the information.

312
00:34:36,164 --> 00:34:40,964
I'm not going to do that. I want to take the time and actually today so that we're all kind of on the same page.

313
00:34:40,964 --> 00:34:46,004
I know that you're all super busy and I've been managing and time.

314
00:34:46,004 --> 00:34:50,234
So let's actually allocate a little bit of, of course, time to doing this.

315
00:34:50,234 --> 00:34:56,924
I think it's important enough to set ourselves up to be successful going through the course of the semester.

316
00:34:56,924 --> 00:35:05,414
I'm going to leave this page and actually go to our canvasing. And pull up the syllabus.

317
00:35:05,414 --> 00:35:14,354
We're not going to read it word for word. That's pretty small. I was not looking at that because it's still too small to see text.

318
00:35:14,354 --> 00:35:19,934
It's OK. All right. So yeah, here's me.

319
00:35:19,934 --> 00:35:26,414
We're Tuesdays one to three. Actually, it's like 250, right is what we're used and why.

320
00:35:26,414 --> 00:35:30,134
And I promise we'll have a little bit of break in between today.

321
00:35:30,134 --> 00:35:34,394
I'm actually expecting course to not even go the full length, so we'll probably skip the break.

322
00:35:34,394 --> 00:35:40,304
And when we're done instead of a kind of belaboring, it's not going to go through the course description.

323
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:48,524
I want to do that in terms, of course, materials. There's no textbook, you know that you need to go by or anything.

324
00:35:48,524 --> 00:35:55,844
All of the readings are provided through the canvas site. I want to achieve the goal of the competencies.

325
00:35:55,844 --> 00:35:59,654
Everyone's interested in this stuff. The grading, right?

326
00:35:59,654 --> 00:36:05,534
So let's kind of talk through grading and assignments. Grading is really, really straightforward.

327
00:36:05,534 --> 00:36:10,634
This is absolutely dead to a team. So good and bad news.

328
00:36:10,634 --> 00:36:16,034
They're the best. I'll give you the bad news first. And it's not very bad.

329
00:36:16,034 --> 00:36:27,764
The bad news is I absolutely stick to this. So when you get to the end of the semester and you're at a ninety two point nine,

330
00:36:27,764 --> 00:36:31,634
don't come to me and ask if I'm willing to wound it up to a ninety three.

331
00:36:31,634 --> 00:36:36,074
All right. I know I sound really mean right now, but it's not that bad.

332
00:36:36,074 --> 00:36:41,744
Um, so this is what this is looking at as a minimum to get a better look at ninety three point zero.

333
00:36:41,744 --> 00:36:49,784
OK. The good news is, and this is not curve, this is all this strength scale.

334
00:36:49,784 --> 00:36:56,924
The good news is I have no expectation for some sort of late grade distribution, right?

335
00:36:56,924 --> 00:37:02,504
I'm not looking for like all or even this many A's, many b's and so forth.

336
00:37:02,504 --> 00:37:07,064
My absolute goal is for you all to get it.

337
00:37:07,064 --> 00:37:12,554
OK. I'm actually I mean, yeah, I'll say it.

338
00:37:12,554 --> 00:37:17,504
I don't even really care what grade you get. What's most important to me is that you learn, right?

339
00:37:17,504 --> 00:37:22,724
This is like the ultimate goal is that you walk out of this course and you're like, Wow, I learn something.

340
00:37:22,724 --> 00:37:32,174
And Professor divides his class, Tim's class. Joe, is this class where whoever that guy is a friend.

341
00:37:32,174 --> 00:37:36,884
The reality is, if that's your reflection that you've really learned a lot in this class,

342
00:37:36,884 --> 00:37:40,574
you're most likely going to have a really good grade to show for it.

343
00:37:40,574 --> 00:37:47,084
Right. Where I am a bit more lenient is in the grading of each individual assignment.

344
00:37:47,084 --> 00:37:52,904
Right? I absolutely am willing to give you partial credit. Give you the benefit of the doubt and so forth.

345
00:37:52,904 --> 00:37:58,154
So that for each of those assignments, you know, that's where kind of the softie in me is coming through and being,

346
00:37:58,154 --> 00:38:01,094
you know, a little bit more generous with grading.

347
00:38:01,094 --> 00:38:10,474
But when we get to the end of the semester, you know, this is where this is, what's going to define, you know, how grades are, are assigned.

348
00:38:10,474 --> 00:38:19,304
Um, but yeah. And then again, the better grades that you all get is I see it as a reflection on like I've done a good job of teaching.

349
00:38:19,304 --> 00:38:25,994
So it's absolutely my goal is for you to all get good grades. I'm going to do everything I can to help you get there.

350
00:38:25,994 --> 00:38:33,374
Uh, in terms of the assignments. There are a little bit varied and that's on purpose.

351
00:38:33,374 --> 00:38:38,084
I'll introduce all four of them right up front and then talk through each individually.

352
00:38:38,084 --> 00:38:46,274
It's going to be a couple of exams. There's going to be a term project, both a paper and a presentation.

353
00:38:46,274 --> 00:38:55,694
There's going to be a more formal class discussion that you're responsible for a student led class discussion and then class participation,

354
00:38:55,694 --> 00:39:06,494
which is a bit more general. And these are, you know, varied just with the recognition that everyone has kind of strengths and weaknesses.

355
00:39:06,494 --> 00:39:10,364
You perform better on this type of assessment than you do on that.

356
00:39:10,364 --> 00:39:13,934
And so I really don't want to come in and say, Well, we have our three exams,

357
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:18,884
and I hope you're good at taking exams because that's what you're that's what your grades have been based on.

358
00:39:18,884 --> 00:39:26,354
My goal is to mix things up as much as possible and give you each a chance to, you know,

359
00:39:26,354 --> 00:39:33,524
to excel where your strengths are, but then also maybe an opportunity to to improve on where where are less strong?

360
00:39:33,524 --> 00:39:42,494
All right. So the exams, there's going to be two of them. Uh, they are each worth 20 percent of the final course.

361
00:39:42,494 --> 00:39:47,894
Grades or combined exams make up 40 percent of the course grades.

362
00:39:47,894 --> 00:39:53,114
They're each. Each exam is going to be answering short answer questions.

363
00:39:53,114 --> 00:39:57,784
As we get closer to our first exam, we'll talk about it in a ton of detail.

364
00:39:57,784 --> 00:40:02,824
Um, the first exam is going to be kind of the.

365
00:40:02,824 --> 00:40:10,204
Some bolts over the course, the second exam in the second half of the course is going to be a lot more applied

366
00:40:10,204 --> 00:40:18,244
and much more an integration application of those nuts and bolts to applied topics.

367
00:40:18,244 --> 00:40:22,174
The term paper. Both the project and the presentation.

368
00:40:22,174 --> 00:40:29,434
My goal and again, I get this feedback and reviews from the course and this is just being up front.

369
00:40:29,434 --> 00:40:36,154
And it's great feedback, and that's why I want to keep doing it as I get comments from students at the end of the course and say,

370
00:40:36,154 --> 00:40:40,774
finally, I got to take a course where we really like.

371
00:40:40,774 --> 00:40:48,814
I felt like I did something. I wasn't just listening to someone lecture and trying to get all the answers right.

372
00:40:48,814 --> 00:41:00,004
And so, you know, part of it is having the open discussion, having a chance to discuss things openly, share opinions and viewpoints,

373
00:41:00,004 --> 00:41:08,944
and then also have the opportunity for this project to explore something that's not the topic isn't being assigned to you.

374
00:41:08,944 --> 00:41:12,184
It's up to you to come up with the topic.

375
00:41:12,184 --> 00:41:28,234
So within the context of discourse on environmental, health and policy, I'm asking you to identify and study a specific topic.

376
00:41:28,234 --> 00:41:34,684
Beyond that, it's going to be, you know, a pretty typical type of paper that you would write for the class.

377
00:41:34,684 --> 00:41:40,114
I have it broken out by some specific dates that will go through.

378
00:41:40,114 --> 00:41:44,884
And it's just kind of helped move you along and also an opportunity to get feedback from me.

379
00:41:44,884 --> 00:41:52,504
So two weeks from now, I'm going to ask you all to simply submit basically a title or draft title of an

380
00:41:52,504 --> 00:41:58,714
issue that you want to investigate for your for your project by February 1st.

381
00:41:58,714 --> 00:42:01,534
I'm going to ask you to submit a draft abstract.

382
00:42:01,534 --> 00:42:09,994
So at that point, you've actually explored it a little bit right enough to kind of write off an abstract of what you're going to be looking at.

383
00:42:09,994 --> 00:42:15,664
And then you've got the, you know, most of the semester to work on it. They're due later in April.

384
00:42:15,664 --> 00:42:18,094
And then in addition to the paper itself,

385
00:42:18,094 --> 00:42:30,954
we'll have a class period set aside specifically for an opportunity for you to present your work and individual presentation of of your your topic.

386
00:42:30,954 --> 00:42:36,114
Scroll a little bit here. The class discussion.

387
00:42:36,114 --> 00:42:45,534
So these are the student led class discussions as we go through the course of the second half of the semester.

388
00:42:45,534 --> 00:42:52,284
We're going to have with each class period, maybe the first half of the class is going to be me kind of lecturing.

389
00:42:52,284 --> 00:43:00,984
Or maybe we have some discussion. The second half of the class is going to be an assigned student led discussion on the topic for that week.

390
00:43:00,984 --> 00:43:05,574
Everyone's done the readings. Everyone comes prepared to participate.

391
00:43:05,574 --> 00:43:09,434
But there will be a group of students and we'll see how the numbers are going to sort out.

392
00:43:09,434 --> 00:43:15,804
But maybe three or four of you at a time that will be in charge of basically leading that discussion.

393
00:43:15,804 --> 00:43:24,444
We'll talk more about it again as those get closer, but you can be as creative as you like for how to actually lead or facilitate that discussion,

394
00:43:24,444 --> 00:43:29,964
and we can talk about different kind of examples of approaches you might take.

395
00:43:29,964 --> 00:43:39,084
And then finally, so that's worth 10 percent that student led discussion. The class participation is another 10 percent of your total course grade.

396
00:43:39,084 --> 00:43:43,464
And again, this is, you know, for participation in the basic sense.

397
00:43:43,464 --> 00:43:49,164
It's not for how many answers you give that are correct or not.

398
00:43:49,164 --> 00:43:55,374
It's just being willing to to share your opinion, willing to answer a question, willing to ask a question.

399
00:43:55,374 --> 00:44:02,274
And just overall participate in general. So engaged learning is kind of a term that we like to apply to that.

400
00:44:02,274 --> 00:44:08,274
So here's a summary of that, of course, grade and how it's broken out.

401
00:44:08,274 --> 00:44:14,694
Any questions about grading? Uh, just basic understanding of that.

402
00:44:14,694 --> 00:44:20,724
Of course, we're going to go into the detail of each of them as we get closer in terms of the first exam,

403
00:44:20,724 --> 00:44:28,164
uh, getting a handle on your paper topic, the class discussions and so forth.

404
00:44:28,164 --> 00:44:47,374
All right, great. We were already kind of talked a little bit about COVID with those first few slides before you showed up last.

405
00:44:47,374 --> 00:44:52,834
We talked a little bit about COVID again, just communication.

406
00:44:52,834 --> 00:44:59,544
Just let me know what's going on. I'm going to get worried if I don't see you in class one time.

407
00:44:59,544 --> 00:45:05,554
But I don't see a class like a second time, right? And I'm going to get worried. Let me now say, Hey, this is what's going on,

408
00:45:05,554 --> 00:45:14,644
and I can do whatever I can to kind of help make sure you don't fall too far behind classroom expectations etiquette.

409
00:45:14,644 --> 00:45:20,584
This is basic stuff. I'm not going to go through it, you know, silence. Silence your phones.

410
00:45:20,584 --> 00:45:25,564
I basically you're going to have your laptops up, you know, trying to shop on Amazon during class.

411
00:45:25,564 --> 00:45:31,264
You know, you have it open for class related stuff. Um, this is really important.

412
00:45:31,264 --> 00:45:37,894
This is like standard verbiage in most semesters. But you know, during the pandemic, it's even more important.

413
00:45:37,894 --> 00:45:48,544
So if you're going to miss a class or if you end up missing a class, an assignment, whatever it is, again, reach out to me as soon as you can.

414
00:45:48,544 --> 00:45:54,214
Right? Let me know in advance if you know that you're not going to make it to class,

415
00:45:54,214 --> 00:45:59,734
like if it's a big thing, like an exam or some other assignment, let me know in advance.

416
00:45:59,734 --> 00:46:02,564
We got to dress it up with an alternative.

417
00:46:02,564 --> 00:46:12,034
Um, if it's a scenario that doesn't allow for that, follow up as quickly as you can with me and let me know what's going on.

418
00:46:12,034 --> 00:46:22,644
Again, so the thing is, don't get too far down without being addressed and that you've far too far too far behind.

419
00:46:22,644 --> 00:46:30,214
D.C. and I am really hoping that you hear quite a bit about this in your other courses.

420
00:46:30,214 --> 00:46:36,644
But I've talked about how we want this course to be interactive and discussion based as possible.

421
00:46:36,644 --> 00:46:44,204
Right. So we are absolutely going to be adhering to the School of Public Health expectations for inclusivity.

422
00:46:44,204 --> 00:46:49,624
Um, I'm going to do as much as I can to promote brief discussions.

423
00:46:49,624 --> 00:46:57,094
We're going to follow those multicultural ground rules. And again, there's I don't actually I should have a link for this in my syllabus.

424
00:46:57,094 --> 00:47:04,324
I did that. But we're going to follow, of course, the university policies and procedures as well.

425
00:47:04,324 --> 00:47:12,004
Specific to the D and high academic integrity, I'm not going to go over that one.

426
00:47:12,004 --> 00:47:18,214
Do your, you know, have the work, be representative of yourself and not anyone else.

427
00:47:18,214 --> 00:47:23,314
The rest is some resources. Others are writing Lab here.

428
00:47:23,314 --> 00:47:27,844
If folks don't know that in the scope of the health, you're writing this paper for this course.

429
00:47:27,844 --> 00:47:32,194
If you need someone who is good at, you can always bounce something.

430
00:47:32,194 --> 00:47:37,984
Pass me on something, pass me an idea before you know which direction to take in your topic.

431
00:47:37,984 --> 00:47:44,704
If you get to a point where you're not sure where to go next or it's getting too big or didn't seem big enough,

432
00:47:44,704 --> 00:47:50,854
um, but about the writing itself or other writing labs are really, really useful.

433
00:47:50,854 --> 00:47:55,444
Student Wellness This is huge right now. Not just for students.

434
00:47:55,444 --> 00:48:03,574
For all of us in general. Um, but as a student, I want to make sure that you know that we have some fantastic resources,

435
00:48:03,574 --> 00:48:07,384
not just on the campus, but right here in the School of Public Health.

436
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:16,294
There is a woman named Meghan Narula, who is part of counseling and psychological services, who is assigned to the School of Public Health, right?

437
00:48:16,294 --> 00:48:20,314
So she is, um, she's there to be contacted directly.

438
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:25,084
She's actually told all of the instructors to tell your students this.

439
00:48:25,084 --> 00:48:31,514
If they are having issues, having problems, they need to talk with someone to reach out to her directly.

440
00:48:31,514 --> 00:48:43,654
Her email is here in the syllabus. I know her personally and many other students, right, who through class have reached out to me, reached out to her.

441
00:48:43,654 --> 00:48:49,624
Um, and she's been super helpful, so don't hesitate to do so.

442
00:48:49,624 --> 00:48:56,824
Accommodations are also very important. Um, I know with like the new system,

443
00:48:56,824 --> 00:49:01,534
like it kind of goes through this process like administratively right and eventually it gets

444
00:49:01,534 --> 00:49:10,084
processed and then it shows up on my desk or my table about what accommodations are needed.

445
00:49:10,084 --> 00:49:16,564
I don't think I've gotten any yet for this course. It doesn't mean that there aren't some still being processed.

446
00:49:16,564 --> 00:49:25,924
Uh, if you're comfortable with it and you have them and you've already started that process, reach out to me directly and just let me know.

447
00:49:25,924 --> 00:49:28,054
The more head's up I have,

448
00:49:28,054 --> 00:49:36,394
the more planning time I have to to come up with those accommodations and make sure that everything is most advantageous to you as possible.

449
00:49:36,394 --> 00:49:43,564
Any any questions about about accommodations? OK.

450
00:49:43,564 --> 00:49:49,184
And then last, I like to include this, and again, I think most folks are aware, but, you know,

451
00:49:49,184 --> 00:49:55,264
recognizing some realities with regards to food insecurity, there's a wonderful resource and I can't scroll down further.

452
00:49:55,264 --> 00:50:07,114
It's way down the bottom. There is the maize and blue cupboard right here on campus, down pretty much along State Street.

453
00:50:07,114 --> 00:50:11,554
You don't need to demonstrate need. You don't need to have a reason.

454
00:50:11,554 --> 00:50:17,044
It's open. You go in. You get what you need. You leave. No questions asked.

455
00:50:17,044 --> 00:50:25,414
So if you're not aware of that, there's this great food cupboard available on campus.

456
00:50:25,414 --> 00:50:32,434
That's the syllabus. And I like to kind of the course schedule at this point.

457
00:50:32,434 --> 00:50:39,304
Any questions about any of those syllabus topics before we kind of walk through the course to school?

458
00:50:39,304 --> 00:50:48,564
All right. Good. And I promise we're going to end really early now, and we'll be starting that five minute break in a regular class period,

459
00:50:48,564 --> 00:50:51,294
but I'm going to suggest that we just kind of move ahead because I don't think we have

460
00:50:51,294 --> 00:50:57,594
too much further and then we can just in the class considerably early for today.

461
00:50:57,594 --> 00:50:59,274
Here we are. We're going through the course.

462
00:50:59,274 --> 00:51:06,594
Overview This canvas home page is set up so that when you click this arrow, it downloads a brilliant file, right?

463
00:51:06,594 --> 00:51:12,444
So this is the PowerPoint slides that we've been looking at. We're going to look at this one in a minute.

464
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:18,054
Going into next week and actually the next three weeks, coming up the 18th,

465
00:51:18,054 --> 00:51:23,484
the 25th and February 1st, the topics that will be covering quite a bit of reading.

466
00:51:23,484 --> 00:51:29,274
This is most of your work over the next three or four weeks is a lot of reading

467
00:51:29,274 --> 00:51:36,204
that's going to lighten up a little bit as we get later into the semester. But earlier on, it's going to be a lot of reading.

468
00:51:36,204 --> 00:51:43,184
There's dates over here and the assignment columns and reminders.

469
00:51:43,184 --> 00:51:46,604
We get to February eight, which is not that far away.

470
00:51:46,604 --> 00:51:52,544
We're already going to have our first exam and your reaction is probably like mine, like, holy cow, we just started the class.

471
00:51:52,544 --> 00:52:00,764
We're having an exam already. But again, these are the it's the nuts and bolts of our kind of covering up until this point.

472
00:52:00,764 --> 00:52:08,504
We're going to have an exam along those lines on the 25th.

473
00:52:08,504 --> 00:52:13,874
You're submitting your term project topic again, just like a draft title.

474
00:52:13,874 --> 00:52:19,094
The following week, you're developing into a project abstract or draft abstract.

475
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:25,544
We'll take our exam on the eight and then those last two weeks of February.

476
00:52:25,544 --> 00:52:34,694
We're going to start to do a little bit of application, but here close to home some issues projects on campus,

477
00:52:34,694 --> 00:52:44,504
starting with the university's central power plant in non-pandemic but then also non power plant expansion times,

478
00:52:44,504 --> 00:52:49,814
which is what's happening over there. There's a huge project right now. We would actually get to do this to her in person,

479
00:52:49,814 --> 00:52:53,144
which is really cool where you go over and we'd like walk through the entire

480
00:52:53,144 --> 00:52:58,964
plant to learn all kinds of cool stuff about it outside of that restriction.

481
00:52:58,964 --> 00:53:05,894
We're going to have folks from the central power plant so they can join us in class and kind of give that to her virtually,

482
00:53:05,894 --> 00:53:11,954
but still be able to have those discussions and we'll have a little bit of a group project.

483
00:53:11,954 --> 00:53:19,724
Will I come out of that? Won't really require much work outside of class. There'll be some, some in class time allocated to that.

484
00:53:19,724 --> 00:53:29,354
We'll start March with the university's winter break and then we get into the very much applied part of the course.

485
00:53:29,354 --> 00:53:36,044
From then on, we get into case studies and this is where the student led class discussions come in.

486
00:53:36,044 --> 00:53:40,274
So, for example, on March eight, we're talking about drinking water quality,

487
00:53:40,274 --> 00:53:47,024
and we're going to look at that in Flint as a case study there the following week.

488
00:53:47,024 --> 00:53:53,384
We're going to be looking at flame retardant specific to girls in California and regulation

489
00:53:53,384 --> 00:54:01,694
and in place for the student led discussion and so forth as we get to the middle of March.

490
00:54:01,694 --> 00:54:08,864
We'll finish up our case studies and on the 12th and then we'll have our term project papers due and we'll

491
00:54:08,864 --> 00:54:19,124
also have that class period set aside for presentations and we'll finish on the 19th with exam number two.

492
00:54:19,124 --> 00:54:26,734
That's kind of the course schedule. Any questions about that?

493
00:54:26,734 --> 00:54:30,484
Yes. So exams or during class exams or during class?

494
00:54:30,484 --> 00:54:40,434
Yes, and as long as they allow us to keep meeting in person, which I'm actually pretty hopeful about at this point,

495
00:54:40,434 --> 00:54:44,524
I'm totally embracing that and going as old school as possible.

496
00:54:44,524 --> 00:54:49,024
So I'm going to hand out paper and ask you to bring something to write with.

497
00:54:49,024 --> 00:54:54,694
And that's how we're going to take exams and we're like, totally thrive in like this old school approach.

498
00:54:54,694 --> 00:55:03,394
As long as we can be in person. And unless, of course, there's an accommodation that's needed and we can do it otherwise any other.

499
00:55:03,394 --> 00:55:10,274
That was a good question. Any other questions? Yes, the exams aren't cumulative, right?

500
00:55:10,274 --> 00:55:19,274
Good, good question. So. So yes and no. So that first exam was this all about at first exam?

501
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:22,514
I told you about the nuts and bolts, right? It's a terrible term, but it's the best.

502
00:55:22,514 --> 00:55:26,294
I got the first month or so of the course.

503
00:55:26,294 --> 00:55:36,494
It's a lot of reading, as I mentioned, and these are chapters out of a couple of different textbooks, but it's kind of building a foundation.

504
00:55:36,494 --> 00:55:45,524
And we're going to be, you know, we're going to take a test on that foundation, the foundational understanding from that point forward.

505
00:55:45,524 --> 00:55:51,674
It's going to be a lot of applied work and applying those foundations and those

506
00:55:51,674 --> 00:55:57,524
tools and those approaches to analyze and incorporate into case studies.

507
00:55:57,524 --> 00:56:06,374
So once we get to the second exam, you're going to be examined mostly on those applications.

508
00:56:06,374 --> 00:56:10,694
But in order to answer the questions, you can't forget about the foundational stuff, right?

509
00:56:10,694 --> 00:56:17,354
So I'm not going to. What I won't do for exam number two, for example, is go back to the, you know,

510
00:56:17,354 --> 00:56:23,714
the lecture in January 18th and pull some random thing out of ball chapter one right to test you on.

511
00:56:23,714 --> 00:56:28,064
It's going to be very much applied. Is that is that a fair answer?

512
00:56:28,064 --> 00:56:36,664
Okay. Okay, good. Any other questions? All right.

513
00:56:36,664 --> 00:56:44,104
Let's see what is next. And go back to the PowerPoint slide, so we talked about the syllabus at any point.

514
00:56:44,104 --> 00:56:48,334
If there's something that's not clear. Just ask me if we're not in class, right?

515
00:56:48,334 --> 00:56:52,174
Shoot me an email. Whatever it is, all questions are good.

516
00:56:52,174 --> 00:56:59,044
Do you have a question? Means I didn't explain it well enough in the first place, so please call me out on that.

517
00:56:59,044 --> 00:57:03,844
We talked about this. You talked about assignments. You got a couple of places.

518
00:57:03,844 --> 00:57:08,854
There's the course, schedule and canvas. All this stuff is listed in the syllabus as well.

519
00:57:08,854 --> 00:57:19,244
We have kind of a variety of assessments on purpose. And again, if you are looking for answers, canvas is the place to start.

520
00:57:19,244 --> 00:57:24,754
Believe it or not, yeah. My goal is that we're going to have some fun over the course of the semester.

521
00:57:24,754 --> 00:57:29,014
There are some really difficult topics, often frustrating topics,

522
00:57:29,014 --> 00:57:36,844
but I am going to try to incorporate as much as possible and even ask for your help in that regard.

523
00:57:36,844 --> 00:57:42,094
Now, more than ever, let me know how I'm doing right.

524
00:57:42,094 --> 00:57:48,304
We have this formal component built in that at the end of the semester, the instructor,

525
00:57:48,304 --> 00:57:54,814
the school or university asked you please complete your student evaluation, right?

526
00:57:54,814 --> 00:58:05,404
Those are absolutely helpful. They help me for my the next time I offer a class during this pandemic and things change every semester, right?

527
00:58:05,404 --> 00:58:08,014
I've taught courses completely remotely.

528
00:58:08,014 --> 00:58:15,184
I've taught courses, hybrid right, where we're using the I walk hand and like half the classes on Zoom and half the classes here.

529
00:58:15,184 --> 00:58:20,144
Now, here are some stuff we were finally all back in person. We're all wearing masks, right?

530
00:58:20,144 --> 00:58:26,524
We're all supposed to like, stay apart from each other like the dynamics are constantly changing and they don't always occur to me.

531
00:58:26,524 --> 00:58:32,884
So to the extent that you're comfortable, please don't feel like there's going to be any negative consequence.

532
00:58:32,884 --> 00:58:39,484
Reach out to me in both directions. If you if you see something in this class that you think is really working and you

533
00:58:39,484 --> 00:58:43,684
have the advantage that I do and that you are taking other classes right now,

534
00:58:43,684 --> 00:58:50,194
so you maybe have some like comparative opportunity there, say, Hey, you know, you're doing this in this class.

535
00:58:50,194 --> 00:58:54,704
My other classes don't do that. It's really working well at the same time.

536
00:58:54,704 --> 00:59:03,904
Let me know what's not working right and say I'm really having trouble or I can tell from my classmates, this is a really difficult way to do it.

537
00:59:03,904 --> 00:59:07,534
And then along a similar line, my other class doesn't like this.

538
00:59:07,534 --> 00:59:09,304
Have you ever thought of doing it that way?

539
00:59:09,304 --> 00:59:16,124
So instead of waiting until the end of the semester and giving that feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out to me at any point.

540
00:59:16,124 --> 00:59:22,674
Let me know how I'm doing. I'm absolutely happy to pivot and try to improve things you know on the fly.

541
00:59:22,674 --> 00:59:28,654
Uh, we're mixing it up on purpose. I'm going to lecture, but as little as possible,

542
00:59:28,654 --> 00:59:36,124
we're going to have discussion as much as possible and also to help that, we're going to do kind of group activities.

543
00:59:36,124 --> 00:59:43,864
And I mentioned the breaks that we're going to make sure we do during each class session and then a little bit of actual real topics.

544
00:59:43,864 --> 00:59:55,854
And this is kind of coming back around to what you all came up with just from, you know, examples of current environmental policy issues.

545
00:59:55,854 --> 01:00:04,554
But this is previewing some of the case studies where I'm talking about a little bit later in the semester.

546
01:00:04,554 --> 01:00:17,364
And the main takeaway, the main thing I want you to take away from these next five slides is to have your mindset be oriented for the purposes of this

547
01:00:17,364 --> 01:00:27,564
class is not looking at these as these like historical things that happened in the past that we're going to study and learn from.

548
01:00:27,564 --> 01:00:31,324
Hopefully, we're actually going to do that. We're going to study these things that happened in the past.

549
01:00:31,324 --> 01:00:37,704
Now we're going to learn from them, but it's to recognize that it's not just in the past.

550
01:00:37,704 --> 01:00:45,264
This stuff is continuing and this is the case in almost every, you know, every issue that you all gave as an example.

551
01:00:45,264 --> 01:00:51,534
They weren't just things that happened in the past. There are things that are still happening now, and they're things that in many cases,

552
01:00:51,534 --> 01:00:57,624
right where we're kind of projecting getting worse going into the future.

553
01:00:57,624 --> 01:01:02,184
So we're going to study Flint and lead contamination.

554
01:01:02,184 --> 01:01:10,284
They really began to evolve 2013 2014 as kind of an event, as a starting point.

555
01:01:10,284 --> 01:01:19,764
But I have. And each of these five slides example just news, headline stories over the last year or so.

556
01:01:19,764 --> 01:01:26,184
These continue to to unfold and continue to be relevant and continue to be, in this case, relevant beyond Flint,

557
01:01:26,184 --> 01:01:35,544
right when it comes to lead contamination, deteriorating infrastructure when it comes to drinking water for public utilities.

558
01:01:35,544 --> 01:01:47,394
This one was about, uh, not the former governor. Not just him, but others in his administration that were formally charged for their role in this.

559
01:01:47,394 --> 01:01:58,494
It was only a few months ago. Uh, the judges were deciding amounts of.

560
01:01:58,494 --> 01:02:19,474
Excuse me, your water. Judgments in the amount of funds to be distributed as part of class action lawsuits,

561
01:02:19,474 --> 01:02:25,024
civil lawsuits going back, you know, at this point eight years ago.

562
01:02:25,024 --> 01:02:30,934
These things are continuing to unfold. We're going to look at flame retardants.

563
01:02:30,934 --> 01:02:35,434
We're going to look specifically at the state of California.

564
01:02:35,434 --> 01:02:44,554
In the US, the state of California has traditionally been more progressive than pretty much anywhere else in the country.

565
01:02:44,554 --> 01:02:50,854
That includes federal regulation and policy, as well as any other individual state.

566
01:02:50,854 --> 01:02:55,174
And this is common across many kind of environmental health related topics.

567
01:02:55,174 --> 01:02:59,704
It's also the case specific on the issue of a flame retardants.

568
01:02:59,704 --> 01:03:03,994
So California has kind of led the way there.

569
01:03:03,994 --> 01:03:08,644
It's still in flux there, and things are just now, you know,

570
01:03:08,644 --> 01:03:15,544
maybe a decade later beginning to be addressed in other areas as well as at the federal level.

571
01:03:15,544 --> 01:03:25,294
But this is ongoing, right? We're going to study flame retardants in California going back to kind of a 2013 timeframe, coming forward to the present.

572
01:03:25,294 --> 01:03:31,624
But this stuff continues to unfold not just in the U.S. around the world.

573
01:03:31,624 --> 01:03:38,504
Speaking of round the world greenhouse gases, right? This one goes back more than a decade.

574
01:03:38,504 --> 01:03:45,754
This is a couple of decades in the making, at least with a pretty clear acknowledgment that it was going to be a problem.

575
01:03:45,754 --> 01:03:53,914
Um, from a policy perspective. It's going to be really interesting in its class to kind of analyze and study,

576
01:03:53,914 --> 01:03:59,854
even from a U.S. perspective and as well as how the U.S. fits into a global context.

577
01:03:59,854 --> 01:04:00,964
We went from a White House,

578
01:04:00,964 --> 01:04:14,014
the administration previous to the current that basically jumped out of commitments or agreements with regards to reductions in greenhouse gases.

579
01:04:14,014 --> 01:04:24,484
We got a new administration that came in with it basically being part of the platform that it was elected upon to make major headway.

580
01:04:24,484 --> 01:04:35,374
Right? Lots of promises. Lots of commitments. And it's kind of up to us to sort out how successful that has been so far from a domestic perspective.

581
01:04:35,374 --> 01:04:46,774
But then also looking more internationally or globally from that context, the Miramar Convention, this is actually coming back around to Mercury.

582
01:04:46,774 --> 01:05:00,004
For the most part, this is what that as a successful piece of scientific data informed policy on an international level, on an international scale.

583
01:05:00,004 --> 01:05:03,364
It was going through stages.

584
01:05:03,364 --> 01:05:16,474
It got to 2020, and it just barely hit the point where now all of the policy that was agreed to internationally hit a point on the timeline where,

585
01:05:16,474 --> 01:05:22,894
OK, now it's time to actually implement it. So the M.R. Convention is now in the implementation phase.

586
01:05:22,894 --> 01:05:30,634
We're going to learn as we study environmental health policy framework that there's various stages, and that's an important one.

587
01:05:30,634 --> 01:05:32,824
The policies now being implemented,

588
01:05:32,824 --> 01:05:40,474
but there's a lot of assessment that needs to be done to determine whether the policy is actually becoming effective or not right,

589
01:05:40,474 --> 01:05:53,544
and whether it needs to be revisited, adopted or to address further to shore up where things are failing or challenge.

590
01:05:53,544 --> 01:06:00,294
This one shifts gears a little bit. We're going to talk about the goal here is to mix in something that is,

591
01:06:00,294 --> 01:06:11,994
is this when I design the course was specifically occupational and focus with the pandemic and hybrid work and remote work.

592
01:06:11,994 --> 01:06:21,894
It's kind of blurred those lines, right? So many people working from home, studying at home are joining class from home.

593
01:06:21,894 --> 01:06:29,574
And so we're going to look at this from a historical perspective. This goes back to for a couple of months in the U.S.,

594
01:06:29,574 --> 01:06:37,224
we actually had an ergonomic standard that was implemented by OSHA, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

595
01:06:37,224 --> 01:06:39,924
It was in place for like two or three months.

596
01:06:39,924 --> 01:06:46,974
And since then, we've not had an ergonomics standard, so we'll study it again from a historical perspective.

597
01:06:46,974 --> 01:06:53,424
But, you know, look at it through a lens of the present and where the failings are,

598
01:06:53,424 --> 01:07:00,634
where the challenges are and where the opportunities are going forward.

599
01:07:00,634 --> 01:07:05,614
All right. So, so any questions about that kind of I don't know a little bit of a teaser,

600
01:07:05,614 --> 01:07:14,274
a little bit of introduction of what kind of case studies and what we're going to be kind of focusing on in this course.

601
01:07:14,274 --> 01:07:21,264
All right. A couple of bits of homework for you.

602
01:07:21,264 --> 01:07:26,784
Uh, the first one is I'm going to pivot here to canvas.

603
01:07:26,784 --> 01:07:41,724
Can. So over here in the assignments column, you hit the arrow and it downloads a word file.

604
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:48,324
They by the end of the week, I'd like you to complete and this mail to me, super super brief,

605
01:07:48,324 --> 01:07:55,644
you have some input or I'm going to try to to the extent that I can to assign people to

606
01:07:55,644 --> 01:08:01,134
a team of students to coordinate a discussion that's actually of most interest to you.

607
01:08:01,134 --> 01:08:09,084
So of these five discussion topics, if you could just rank them your top choice.

608
01:08:09,084 --> 01:08:17,074
Your second choice. Your third choice. And just send this word out to me over email.

609
01:08:17,074 --> 01:08:25,434
I'll kind of compile them all and try to sort them out and assign folks so that they're actually leading a topic that they're some I relatively,

610
01:08:25,434 --> 01:08:34,754
hopefully very interested in. And I'll send out like a canvass announcement as a reminder on that as well.

611
01:08:34,754 --> 01:08:43,034
What else is there? I think that's it.

612
01:08:43,034 --> 01:08:50,114
I'll remind you, as we get closer to two weeks from now, you'll be looking to submit a draft title for your term project.

613
01:08:50,114 --> 01:08:54,814
So if you're ready, you know, start, start thinking about that.

614
01:08:54,814 --> 01:09:01,714
Otherwise, there's quite a bit to read in preparation for next week.

615
01:09:01,714 --> 01:09:18,734
So at this point, I'll just back out and say any questions about anything that we've either discussed or omitted from discussion today.

616
01:09:18,734 --> 01:09:23,444
All right, fair enough. Have a great rest of your afternoon.

617
01:09:23,444 --> 01:09:28,804
Try to stay warm if you do think of things between now and next week.

618
01:09:28,804 --> 01:09:33,734
You don't need to wait till next week to ask me, threw me an email, say, Hey, I thought of something.

619
01:09:33,734 --> 01:09:38,794
I'll try to respond as quickly as possible. Thanks so much, guys.

620
01:09:38,794 --> 01:09:45,303
Have a great week.
