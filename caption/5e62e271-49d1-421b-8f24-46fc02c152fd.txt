1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:05,090
I'm talking to you about is less like big ideas rather than kind of small storeys.

2
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:09,728
These storeys kind of interweave with an area that's kind of directly within my

3
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:12,991
clinical interest as well, as my research interests.

4
00:00:12,991 --> 00:00:17,080
It's also an area that really evolved over time.

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,940
So I do this really around kind of a storey.

6
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,240
I think that's more memorable for you.

7
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,240
It also will give you this idea of perspective.

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,228
A lot of what you work on is the stuff that takes a long time belong to

9
00:00:31,228 --> 00:00:35,671
implement, a long time to see the results in a long time and

10
00:00:35,671 --> 00:00:38,141
this is a great example of this.

11
00:00:38,141 --> 00:00:42,740
This is a storey of particular performance measure called door-to-door ballon time.

12
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:47,353
And what I want to do is start with a bit of a review or a introduction to some

13
00:00:47,353 --> 00:00:52,440
basic kind of cardiovascular physiology just to get the baseline set.

14
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,751
This is the second year I'm giving this talk.

15
00:00:54,751 --> 00:00:58,736
And one of the things I learnt was there were particular times last year when

16
00:00:58,736 --> 00:01:01,549
people were kind of giving me a bit of a confused look.

17
00:01:01,549 --> 00:01:06,341
The nice thing about what I do is is it's completely explainable to speak in my

18
00:01:06,341 --> 00:01:09,430
seven year old daughter, she kind of gets it.

19
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:11,447
This is a angioplasty balloon and

20
00:01:11,447 --> 00:01:15,126
it's a treatment that's used in the case of heart attacks.

21
00:01:15,126 --> 00:01:18,670
And what heart attacks basically are if you look up there,

22
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:23,298
there's a catheter in the city in a blood vessel called the right corner that

23
00:01:23,298 --> 00:01:26,699
artery supplies the heart with oxygen and nutrients and

24
00:01:26,699 --> 00:01:29,940
the hearts of muscle that needs those things.

25
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:30,740
Okay.

26
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:33,562
And you look kind of logistical part of that area,

27
00:01:33,562 --> 00:01:38,140
there's actually a little bit of a narrow, that's a blockage.

28
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:41,835
When that blockage develops, it doesn't give enough of those oxygen and

29
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:43,350
nutrients for the heart too.

30
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:48,134
So when this happens, people come in, they have chest discomfort and

31
00:01:48,134 --> 00:01:50,880
they have what we call an injury EKG.

32
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,464
They almost immediately to the and what we do is we pass a wire,

33
00:01:55,464 --> 00:01:59,091
these wires very thin about as thin as your hair.

34
00:01:59,091 --> 00:02:02,768
And with a little bit of Xbox skill, we get those down there and

35
00:02:02,768 --> 00:02:05,809
then we passed a balloon and a stent and then voila,

36
00:02:05,809 --> 00:02:11,140
you know that blockage that was there before is gone and his patients do well.

37
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,780
Now this is a technology that's about three or four decades old.

38
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,320
It's evolved over time.

39
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,382
And it's and sometimes when I kind of pause and think

40
00:02:18,382 --> 00:02:23,170
about really amazing this is, I mean, we can do this now through the wrist.

41
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:27,480
People can have a cup of coffee like 30 minutes after we're finished.

42
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:32,210
It's really an amazing technology and it's happened really in sequential steps.

43
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:37,448
Lots of scientific advances that have kind of occurred that have really

44
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:42,860
made this both from a device standpoint as well as the drug standpoint real

45
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:48,479
kind of signature mark in terms of kind of the potential of modern medicine.

46
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:52,391
Now, that said, one of the things that really true and

47
00:02:52,391 --> 00:02:56,477
fundamental about this is that the technology only works

48
00:02:56,477 --> 00:03:01,640
as well as the situation in circumstances in which it's applied.

49
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:06,040
And one of the critical factors is there is a time dependency of heart attack care.

50
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:10,120
You can do everything I described, open up that blood vessel, make it look beautiful.

51
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:15,398
But if you do it 12 hours after that closure starts, usually,

52
00:03:15,398 --> 00:03:20,891
what happens is as exemplified by that grey box is the tissue dies.

53
00:03:20,891 --> 00:03:24,340
And even if you restore flow to that area, it's not coming back.

54
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:27,389
And so this time dependency of heart attack here is critical and

55
00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:31,416
it's particularly critical when you think about how you take all these like really

56
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:35,440
modern medical advances and really apply them in a little more exciting.

57
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,451
So this has led to a paradigm that's been around for a couple of decades or so.

58
00:03:40,451 --> 00:03:43,311
This idea that treatment delayed his treatment denied.

59
00:03:43,311 --> 00:03:48,091
And this was kind of a phrase that was brought out by a guidelines group made by

60
00:03:48,091 --> 00:03:50,557
the American College of Cardiology and

61
00:03:50,557 --> 00:03:55,281
the American heart association when it came to care around heart attacks.

62
00:03:55,281 --> 00:03:59,444
And it's this idea that patients at the left there have some symptoms recognition

63
00:03:59,444 --> 00:04:02,850
of a heart attack and then they have to activate this whole system.

64
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:06,008
They go through the emergency department, get to the cath lab.

65
00:04:06,008 --> 00:04:08,479
And every single moment that this is happening,

66
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:12,040
there's this increasing loss of myocytes or heart tissue.

67
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,926
And so there's a real delay in the initiation of what we call re perfusion

68
00:04:15,926 --> 00:04:18,551
therapy or restoring blood flow to those areas.
