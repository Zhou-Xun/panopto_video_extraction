1
00:00:00,213 --> 00:00:03,581
So that's really lead to just increasing attention to this field and

2
00:00:03,581 --> 00:00:05,508
thinking how we address disparities.

3
00:00:05,508 --> 00:00:09,885
And one of the most important thing is really sort of culminated in the enactment

4
00:00:09,885 --> 00:00:13,758
of the affordable care Act is what's the role of insurance coverage.

5
00:00:13,758 --> 00:00:18,197
And when we teach medical students or residents other health professional

6
00:00:18,197 --> 00:00:21,446
students about the diagnosis that patients may have.

7
00:00:21,446 --> 00:00:26,806
We oftentimes generated list based on what you're presenting with headache and

8
00:00:26,806 --> 00:00:28,786
chest pain, stomach pains.

9
00:00:28,786 --> 00:00:33,515
And the diagnosis of exclusion is the bottom diagnosis on the list after we

10
00:00:33,515 --> 00:00:36,420
sort of eliminating all the possibilities.

11
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,915
And so in many ways lacking insurance in United States is a form of

12
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:45,495
a diagnosis of exclusion or social exclusion as captured here and

13
00:00:45,495 --> 00:00:49,004
that's how equally distributed in population.

14
00:00:49,004 --> 00:00:54,032
So, around the time when the affordable care was just enacted or a year later

15
00:00:54,032 --> 00:00:59,861
in 2011, we knew that about 18% of the population under age 65 was uninsured.

16
00:00:59,861 --> 00:01:05,058
If you're white American under 65 we had about a one in

17
00:01:05,058 --> 00:01:10,810
eight chance of being uninsured, if you are Asian American or

18
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:15,468
one in five American Indians for Hispanic three.

19
00:01:15,468 --> 00:01:19,891
And so that's important part of how people access to health care whether they're

20
00:01:19,891 --> 00:01:21,697
covered for services they need.

21
00:01:21,697 --> 00:01:23,078
Why does that matter?

22
00:01:23,078 --> 00:01:27,415
So this is a fairly standard quality measures of whether

23
00:01:27,415 --> 00:01:31,200
patients with diabetes or high blood pressure,

24
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,110
having their cholesterol tested and appropriate intervals.

25
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:39,425
We know that folks with those two conditions diabetes,

26
00:01:39,425 --> 00:01:44,150
I mean blood pressure are at increased risk of having strokes, heart attacks,

27
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:48,398
and kidney failure which can obviously raise their mortality as well.

28
00:01:48,398 --> 00:01:52,063
Identifying those who have high cholesterol in the setting of diabetes or

29
00:01:52,063 --> 00:01:55,445
high blood pressure is an important way that we can lower that risk.

30
00:01:55,445 --> 00:02:00,225
In addition to treating the diabetes with blood pressure if you lower flex

31
00:02:00,225 --> 00:02:04,865
from the effect of medications, you can reduce those complications.

32
00:02:04,865 --> 00:02:08,321
And so what we see before age 65 is that those who are uninsured and this is,

33
00:02:08,321 --> 00:02:11,404
I'm drawing on something called the health and retirement study.

34
00:02:11,404 --> 00:02:15,788
Which is a national cohort that's actually run out of our institute of social

35
00:02:15,788 --> 00:02:17,754
research here at the University.

36
00:02:17,754 --> 00:02:19,937
It goes back to the early 1990s.

37
00:02:19,937 --> 00:02:24,126
People have been surveying and evaluated every two years since then,

38
00:02:24,126 --> 00:02:25,476
starting at age 50.

39
00:02:25,476 --> 00:02:28,162
What we found was that before age 65 and

40
00:02:28,162 --> 00:02:33,535
those who are uninsured roughly half his life really basic primary care services

41
00:02:33,535 --> 00:02:39,004
cholesterol testing amongst those with that blood pressure is especially needed.

42
00:02:39,004 --> 00:02:43,077
And after age 65, that gap is almost completely eliminated.

43
00:02:43,077 --> 00:02:46,174
So, as people gain Medicare coverage,

44
00:02:46,174 --> 00:02:51,550
those who previously uninsured and blue, get up to about 80 percent

45
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:56,943
of testing compared to 88 insured before and after major coverage.

46
00:02:56,943 --> 00:03:01,928
So, this speaks to that earlier question about blood sugar control that

47
00:03:01,928 --> 00:03:06,926
we started wide access to primary care matters for health disparities.

48
00:03:06,926 --> 00:03:11,667
The affordable care Act, one of the most important features was it gave

49
00:03:11,667 --> 00:03:16,419
states the option to expand Medicaid coverage to cover their glowing.

50
00:03:16,419 --> 00:03:21,450
So basically, single adults up to about 16 dollars a year income are now

51
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:26,416
eligible in States that have chosen to expand their Medicaid programmes.

52
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:29,491
Originally, the intent was for all 50 States to expand Medicaid.

53
00:03:29,491 --> 00:03:33,413
But a couple of years after the important care act in 2010,

54
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:38,299
the Supreme Court came back so that you can actually force States to do this in.

55
00:03:38,299 --> 00:03:40,483
The States contribute to share the cost and

56
00:03:40,483 --> 00:03:43,039
the federal government had to give them a choice.

57
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:48,490
And so this is where we stand as of late 2015, early 2016.

58
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:52,378
The State shown in purple, including Michigan have chosen to expand their

59
00:03:52,378 --> 00:03:54,733
Medicaid programmes for low-income adults.

60
00:03:54,733 --> 00:03:56,998
And the States shown in white and so

61
00:03:56,998 --> 00:04:01,700
that it creates geographic components to the disparities that we see.

62
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:06,642
Because for example, in Michigan 600,000 adults have signed up with

63
00:04:06,642 --> 00:04:11,521
what we call the healthy Michigan about 6% of population is 10 million.

64
00:04:11,521 --> 00:04:15,632
And so they now we're actually studying this with our team from students,

65
00:04:15,632 --> 00:04:20,071
their policy innovation, how this is affecting people's use of healthcare and

66
00:04:20,071 --> 00:04:23,548
their costs of healthcare and also with their health outcome.

67
00:04:23,548 --> 00:04:27,618
Based on prior work, we expect that people gaining insurance coverage agency

68
00:04:27,618 --> 00:04:30,528
are going to see substantial benefits on their health.

69
00:04:30,528 --> 00:04:33,348
And hopefully that will eliminate some of the racial and

70
00:04:33,348 --> 00:04:35,990
ethic associate economic disparities that we see.

71
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:39,335
But insurance coverage may not be the whole solution, so

72
00:04:39,335 --> 00:04:42,192
we know if the whole country expanded Medicaid,

73
00:04:42,192 --> 00:04:45,550
about 16 million low income adults would be eligible.

74
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:49,196
But at the present time, only about 11 million of those adults living in 30

75
00:04:49,196 --> 00:04:50,754
States that expanded Medicaid.

76
00:04:50,754 --> 00:04:55,268
So that really five million adults in places like Texas and Florida and

77
00:04:55,268 --> 00:04:58,491
Georgia without good access to coverage of care.

78
00:04:58,491 --> 00:05:02,707
There's another 16 million middle income adults who are eligible for

79
00:05:02,707 --> 00:05:06,232
private coverage either now through the employer mandate or

80
00:05:06,232 --> 00:05:09,075
through the marketplace insurance exchanges.

81
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:13,167
In about nine million members exchanges through the end of 2015,

82
00:05:13,167 --> 00:05:16,928
we just completed the new open enrolment period for 2016.

83
00:05:16,928 --> 00:05:19,688
So, some of the questions we're left with is,

84
00:05:19,688 --> 00:05:23,212
will those remain in 20 states choose to expand Medicaid?

85
00:05:23,212 --> 00:05:27,333
And will the new enrollees either in the Medicare programme in the marketplace,

86
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:31,705
will they have access to effective primary and speciality care, medications, and

87
00:05:31,705 --> 00:05:32,969
preventive services?

88
00:05:32,969 --> 00:05:36,984
And my perspective is that insurance coverage is necessary, but

89
00:05:36,984 --> 00:05:41,148
not sufficient to eliminate some of these disparities that we see.

90
00:05:41,148 --> 00:05:44,782
It alone because just giving someone insurance card,

91
00:05:44,782 --> 00:05:49,288
it doesn't solve the problem unless they have access to good care.

92
00:05:49,288 --> 00:05:51,904
>> Yesterday at the presentation, Dr.

93
00:05:51,904 --> 00:05:55,753
Frederick made the counter about how toxic the ACA was.

94
00:05:55,753 --> 00:06:00,456
And just the perception of depending on political viewpoint,

95
00:06:00,456 --> 00:06:04,537
I wonder if you could that takes whatever you think that

96
00:06:04,537 --> 00:06:08,364
industrial progress should be made to the policy.

97
00:06:08,364 --> 00:06:11,581
>> No, go back this slide.

98
00:06:11,581 --> 00:06:16,088
I think that's sort of that toxic sort of reaction to ACA is pointing out at

99
00:06:16,088 --> 00:06:17,188
the state level.

100
00:06:17,188 --> 00:06:22,420
So most of the states, but not all shown purple have Democratic governors and

101
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:27,413
legislators that were active supportive of Obamacare when it was enacted

102
00:06:27,413 --> 00:06:30,729
Reportable Care Act and continue to support it.

103
00:06:30,729 --> 00:06:34,317
So, places like California and New York, Illinois,

104
00:06:34,317 --> 00:06:38,919
Michigan is one of a handful of states that the Republican governor and

105
00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:42,830
Republican legislature that decided to expand Medicaid.

106
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:46,909
And probably one of the few states where we're actually able to achieve compromise

107
00:06:46,909 --> 00:06:47,789
in that respect.

108
00:06:47,789 --> 00:06:52,692
And most of the states shown in white have a politics, legislators and

109
00:06:52,692 --> 00:06:56,348
the biggest and emerged into the affordable care act

110
00:06:56,348 --> 00:07:00,937
being signature accomplishments of the Obama administration.

111
00:07:00,937 --> 00:07:05,621
And the Democratic Congress that was empowered when we started has led,

112
00:07:05,621 --> 00:07:10,712
I think if somehow this was sort of separated from President Obama's agenda.

113
00:07:10,712 --> 00:07:15,359
I think many states China white expanding, there's actually a school thought that

114
00:07:15,359 --> 00:07:18,052
suggest once we get through this next election.

115
00:07:18,052 --> 00:07:22,112
Some of those states that haven't expanded will now choose to

116
00:07:22,112 --> 00:07:26,573
the paradigms that will continue to pay up to nine percent of costs.

117
00:07:26,573 --> 00:07:31,955
So, there's and actually healthcare providers in places like Texas and

118
00:07:31,955 --> 00:07:37,182
Florida and lobbied their legislatures and governors very strongly.

119
00:07:37,182 --> 00:07:38,660
But yeah, you know,

120
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:44,014
I agree with assessment that we're still very polarised Graham this issue.
