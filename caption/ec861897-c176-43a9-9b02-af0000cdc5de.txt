1
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:11,940
I knew that they were not about to refuse the applications for really doing sort of high levels of political to last time.

2
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:25,740
You know, we wasted a lot of time on 32nd hours later, also energetic in the morning.

3
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:35,370
I imagine most and probably all of us have given some money or donated some of our time to charity in the last year.

4
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:41,399
Have you? I'm not going to ask for a show of hands, because probably don't raise your hand, because embarrassingly,

5
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:47,360
the only one in the room not too far, something we've all done, we probably all contributed something, you know,

6
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:56,640
whether it's a $3 in a shoe or somebody collecting money for some cause, whether it's something we routinely fund,

7
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:05,400
whether it's something we volunteer for a voucher for a soup kitchen and volunteer in our church, volunteer in various civic organizations.

8
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:12,420
So we have this model of utility maximization, which sort of inherently sounds like a selfish model.

9
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,730
I've got my utility function, and what I'm trying to do is maximize it.

10
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:25,140
I'm trying to get the highest level of happiness I can personally get from the goods and services that I can afford to buy.

11
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:36,060
Sounds very selfish. Yes. Does it contradict this notion that all of us have given away some of our resources in the last year?

12
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:41,910
Or can we reconcile the idea that we're voluntarily giving things away?

13
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:54,110
The idea or utility maximizing consumers? I think even giving away to charities was selfish because because you want people out of it.

14
00:01:54,550 --> 00:02:08,680
So what are some of the reasons that you've got people feeling better if you're religious, you know, you get good deeds afterwards for good.

15
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:21,050
So some hope of future benefit because I do good deeds all benefit myself in the future.

16
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:25,170
So it's just an investment. Yeah. So tax deduction.

17
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:36,290
It always comes up quickly. Can a tax deduction be sufficient?

18
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:41,030
Can that be the only reason I give the sheriff? Literally, that's the only reason this is possible.

19
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:46,580
Where does that not make sense? That's the only reason. What's the tax deduction worth to me?

20
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,850
And some are less than a dollar per dollar dividend.

21
00:02:53,220 --> 00:03:00,670
And so even if I'm in, say, a 35% tax bracket, if I give away a dollar, it saves me $0.35 in taxes.

22
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,370
So I'm still giving away $0.65 of my own money.

23
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:09,650
So a tax deduction would be very important explaining sort of how much I get a certain set of.

24
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:17,330
It changes the price of giving. Now, every dollar I give to a cause only costs me $0.65.

25
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,240
Essentially, the government is subsidizing $0.35 on the dollar or if I'm in the 35% tax bracket.

26
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:27,440
So tax deduction can definitely be a contributing factor to maybe how much I give.

27
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:33,139
But if literally the only reason I gave to charities to get a tax deduction that would

28
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:40,400
actually be kind of stupid is it's a very poor investment to lose a dollar to save $0.35.

29
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:48,420
So that really is can this could interact with any other reason, reasons that we can end up with on this list and explain how much we get.

30
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:52,580
It could be a contributing factor, but it can't be the sole only factor,

31
00:03:53,360 --> 00:04:00,240
at least if I'm a rational utility maximizing consumer, because why would I lose $0.65 if I'm getting no value?

32
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:06,070
And so we've got future about a third tax deduction. What are some other reasons to write?

33
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:10,999
You feel good about giving somebody and somebody you've received your degree in,

34
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,380
appreciate of what you use and still that's you're buying a warm glow.

35
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:20,759
You're buying a good feeling. I've done something good today.

36
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:25,169
I feel good about myself. Social traits like people will see you.

37
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:29,610
Oh, he's a good person. Okay. NPR coffee mug.

38
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,400
I donate to NPR. They send me a coffee mug. I get to have that in the office.

39
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:47,850
Everybody sees that I'm an NPR donor. And of course, a lot of schools of public health, a lot of other schools on campus have names, right?

40
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:53,920
Ross School of Business, the D.C. Chan School of Public Health at Harvard.

41
00:04:53,940 --> 00:05:04,460
The Bloomberg School of Public Health. The Hopkins. For the low price of $100 million, somebody shout out their last name in math.

42
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,120
Okay. If you look at our School of Public Health for only $100 million.

43
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:15,450
Okay, so that's a that's a very expensive coffee, but also much more prominent.

44
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:23,040
What kind of people raise money because it is getting more from the people.

45
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:28,050
So it it might be it might benefit you professionally.

46
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:35,130
So it's not just that you get personal praise for being the donor that the School of Public Health is named after.

47
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:48,550
But maybe there is a professional benefit as well. We will see you all to correct.

48
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:59,340
Or maybe your kid wouldn't even get into the school. But after you give them $100 million that you get to promote ideologies, you align with that.

49
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:13,020
So instead of that public facing aspect of it.

50
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:18,659
Yes, this might run into the other things, but if you genuinely sit down and you say,

51
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:24,600
okay, this extra bit of money, it would better be used elsewhere so I can use it.

52
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:31,170
Or at least the amount of happiness I'm going to get from using it is not as much as what I think we'll gain from it.

53
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:41,030
The key is that the extra bit? Yeah. I'm sorry.

54
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:47,270
Marginal utility. So build on that one. Anything else?

55
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:54,830
Yeah. This might be with professional benefit, but if you're, like, into, like where you want to build your legacy.

56
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:02,770
So, like, legacy building and. Okay.

57
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,370
So that's a pretty good list. Now, let's look at these.

58
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:08,850
How many of these are sort of, you know,

59
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:16,240
clearly self-interested if we can take sort of a hard boiled view of utility maximization as a self-interested, selfish process?

60
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:22,210
You know, if I'm doing it for some future benefit, I'm just really making an investment.

61
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:27,400
I contribute something now and I expect to get something in return later.

62
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:33,640
That's just an investment tax deduction to the extent that interacts with these other things and contributes to it,

63
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:41,090
well, that just decreases my price of giving a charity. I'm saving $0.35 in tax for $1 donations.

64
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:47,510
That donation only costs me $0.65. Is that $0.35 in tax was gone whether I gave the money away or not.

65
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,050
Okay, feel good.

66
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:58,760
That's kind of sounds like utility, but let's kind of unpack that one was a lot of this is related to maybe some of these other things as well.

67
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:07,390
If they approaching ideology, building a legacy, all of those things are kind of feeling a little bit different.

68
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:09,650
This should be just more of an internal setting.

69
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:15,270
Some of these other things are more like require some external, you know, there are some people who donate anonymously.

70
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:22,870
So if you see any charities, donor reports that they put out at the end of the year, the vast majority of people have their names listed,

71
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,730
you know, and of the classes, you know, gave 100,000 or more, gave 10,000, maybe 1000 or more.

72
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:38,260
And you see a whole bunch of names, but you actually do see a few lines that say anonymous donors, three in the $10,000 class or 1000 something.

73
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:47,620
So they're not doing it as much for some public facing recognition, but maybe more internal.

74
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:51,640
So feeling good might be internal as opposed to purely external.

75
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:58,510
So if I say, you know, here's your here's $1,000 and please don't put my name, I just want to be anonymous.

76
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:04,360
Maybe that's a little bit more of an internal motivation. And getting the coffee mug.

77
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:09,399
So I get the recognition. That sounds pretty selfish, but actually rational benefit.

78
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:15,910
Promoting an ideology, building my own personal legacy or my family legacy, maybe clearing my family name.

79
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:23,139
You know, somebody in my family has gotten in trouble and I donate.

80
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:28,100
So anywhere like the Annenberg School of Communications at Penn.

81
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:33,640
So Walter Annenberg and he also has school at USC named after him.

82
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,379
So there is some scandal in the family.

83
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:42,340
And they tried to kind of clear the family name essentially by having a name associated with something positive or something negative.

84
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:50,850
Okay. So now let's really take a look at this one. Marginal utility, that extra bit of money.

85
00:09:52,140 --> 00:10:00,570
So if we say I'm trying to maximize my utility and there are very simple generic two good world, we just say good X and good.

86
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:06,810
Why do we say what? Good, excellent, good. Why have to be just kind of generic.

87
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:10,920
So what if good acts this sort of my stuff.

88
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:16,410
So think it was maybe the vector only goods and services that I buy and and I use myself.

89
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:23,209
My housing, my food, my travel. And maybe good.

90
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:31,640
Why is some organization with this objective I care about or some social objective that generates utility for me?

91
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:39,980
Nobody says that I can't have something external to my narrow consumption in my utility function.

92
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:45,710
If I care about the environment, if I care about public health, if I care about other things,

93
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:51,049
they can go in my utility function to the extent of no reason that they can't now say,

94
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:54,890
Well, that's fine because now you're just making the model a tautology.

95
00:10:54,890 --> 00:11:00,049
As always, it has to be true. By definition, it's no longer sort of scientifically meaningful.

96
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:05,300
If you can just say what you throw, whatever you want in here, and therefore by definition the person's utility maximizing.

97
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:09,050
Therefore, by definition, you can't refute this model as being sensible.

98
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:14,969
But let's make an argument that maybe will help. Refuse that.

99
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:21,580
And I think that was made by the idea of that extra dollar. Suppose we ask?

100
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:25,780
I'll ask you. We'll see that all of you have given something in the last year.

101
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:33,340
Have any of you been evicted from your apartments and had your cars repossessed so that you could give that money to charity?

102
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:42,520
Now, if somebody had raised their hands oh yeah, I got evicted last week because I decided to give the red money to charity.

103
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:47,350
And they just took my car this morning out of the parking lot because I gave my car payment money to charity.

104
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:55,540
What would you think about that person's decision making process? The nicest thing, in fact, that's a little weird.

105
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:02,650
That's kind of odd. I oddest thing since that is the craziest thing I've ever heard in my life.

106
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:11,230
Can you take me? Yes. This person ought to be referred because they've got some issues here.

107
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:14,890
They're harming themselves. There's some self-harm going on.

108
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:24,060
We don't give. Those first dollars that are incredibly valuable because we want shelter and transportation and food.

109
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,879
Charity what we do is, you know, I paid my rent. I've made my car payment.

110
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:34,620
I bought my groceries. I've got $100 left in the weekly budget.

111
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:39,870
Some of it maybe I'll spend on going out to the movies myself.

112
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:45,360
But maybe that next dollar I will donate to a cause that I care about.

113
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:54,510
So it is kind of thinking at the margin. So I argue that that that behavior is consistent with this model of utility maximization,

114
00:12:54,510 --> 00:13:00,720
not just because we've created a logical tautology that has to be true and can't be refuted.

115
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:06,480
But because we don't observe people getting evicted from their apartments because they gave their money to charity.

116
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:11,580
But we do observe as people paying their rent and then giving some money to charity.

117
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:24,399
So very much in line with sort of the type of decision making at the margin, this model really is simply what's the marginal utility of my own?

118
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,230
Consumption is relatively low.

119
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:35,860
I might get the next happiness, the most happiness, by spending that next dollar on a donation rather than on movie tickets.

120
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:40,390
Or maybe today I'd rather have a movie ticket and I won't make that donation.

121
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:46,930
But it's that decision making about what I do with that last dollar. Given the bundle of goods and services I've already got.

122
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:51,969
I already paid my rent. I already bought my groceries for the week. I already made my car payment.

123
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:58,210
I already paid my utility bills. I've got my wife so I can keep doing my classes when they're not in person.

124
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:07,490
Okay. Now let's talk about charitable contribution. We're not thinking or talking about that before we pay those other bills.

125
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:19,589
And it makes sense in terms of how we're thinking at the margin and how the how even the fact that all

126
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:25,170
of us voluntarily give away some of our stuff rather than using it for narrowly selfish purposes,

127
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:30,000
may not actually contradict the idea that we're trying to maximize our utility.

128
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:35,070
In fact, that we hate the way we give it away is actually very consistent with what this model would predict.

129
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:40,770
What we refute this model is if we all got evicted from our apartments because we gave our money to charity,

130
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:47,640
now we'd have to really scratch our heads and say, This just doesn't seem like sensible behavior.

131
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:59,610
But that's not behavior we observe very often. Let's look at some other evidence.

132
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:12,480
This is from a Gallup World poll which was done in something like as many dots as are there, about 50 or 60 countries in the world.

133
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,940
And it tries to assess the relationship between money and happiness.

134
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:25,620
And we might wonder, like, is there a point where, you know,

135
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:29,399
some some people have suggested and there's been some research suggesting there

136
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:35,280
might be sort of a satiation point that people beyond a certain income level,

137
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:42,750
more income doesn't make them happier. These data are actually pretty compelling to say, kind of the opposite,

138
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:50,280
that people are better off in terms of their own assessed subjective assessment of their happiness.

139
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:56,670
So each dot here is a country and that line is kind of like the kind of overall trend.

140
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:02,520
And oddly, because different countries, people are very different circumstances.

141
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:06,599
So it's on a log scale because you've got some countries that are living on

142
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:12,200
a few dollars a day and other countries are living on 30 or $30,000 a year.

143
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:15,810
Per capita scales are so differently poor on a large scale.

144
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:20,010
And we see there is no evidence that there's a point where, you know,

145
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:25,100
if there is a point where more income really didn't make people happy or what you'd see is kind of the opposite,

146
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:32,400
see, going up to some point and then you see it flattening. It's kind of odd to see it actually steepened beyond some point.

147
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:40,500
That's kind of a little bit hard to explain. But, you know, these are people in very different countries and it's hard to directly compare them.

148
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:46,200
But at least sort of across this broad range, there's certainly no evidence that it plateaus and stops growing.

149
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:53,400
And so more compelling is this graph. So the first graph is sort of across all countries.

150
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:55,200
Each data point was a different country.

151
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:02,850
So that kind of makes it hard to compare because, you know, two countries are different for many reasons other than just the per capita income.

152
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:08,760
So here we're looking at survey results within each of each of these countries.

153
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:16,830
So each line represents the relationship between happiness and income within a country.

154
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:23,610
I was happiness assessed. The survey question they use sort of around the world is kind of very simple.

155
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:27,420
It's, you know, imagine there's a ladder across ten steps.

156
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:31,110
The bottom of the ladder is zero. The top of the ladder is ten.

157
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:36,420
And imagine how high you are open. This ladder is a measure of how satisfied you are with your life.

158
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:43,170
So sort of life satisfaction measure zero is the worst possible life for you and ten is the best possible life for you.

159
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,040
So those are sort of the kind of words we're used to anger of the zero and ten.

160
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:53,220
What what step of the ladder would you be on? So that was the question that was asked.

161
00:17:53,670 --> 00:18:02,370
And what we see is that within every single country that was surveyed, people in that country who had higher income were higher on the scale.

162
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:06,610
It wasn't a single country where there was an exception.

163
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:13,320
Some countries that are lower income, like here's Nigeria, for example, I think has the lowest slope still positive.

164
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:19,379
So the income range is over here, whereas in Japan, say the income range is here because there's just not a lot of overlap.

165
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:24,180
There are not a lot of people in Japan that have incomes at the lower end of the Nigerian scale.

166
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:27,840
So each line sort of covers a different part of the income scale.

167
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:33,420
But no matter what part of the income scale it represents, the evidence is consistent.

168
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:39,270
So does that apply causation and say the phrase correlation does not prove causation?

169
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:41,430
That's here true in spades right here.

170
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:52,710
But certainly there's no descriptive evidence that either across countries, the previous graph or within a country that there's any point where,

171
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:59,879
you know what, if you give people more money, they're not going to be better off. Well, let's say you have $60,000 in salary.

172
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,030
When I get 61,000, I'm not any better off. There's no evidence.

173
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:07,150
So what about the two that curve out like asses? Like, what is it?

174
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:11,430
The ABS and Japan or the curve looks more like an S than a line.

175
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:16,960
Or it is plateauing at the top. Which one is flatter?

176
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:23,710
Well, it looks like both Japan follow it up starts to plateau just below.

177
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,510
Yeah. I kind of made it happen. Well, it's still going up, so it's sort of going up at a decreasing rate.

178
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:35,849
I've said if you think about diminishing marginal utility, again, these are different people.

179
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:39,569
So it's interpersonal comparisons, which is harder.

180
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:46,139
But if you measure servers within a person, you know, how much would your happiness be if your income went from 10000 to 20000?

181
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:50,700
From 20000 to 30000, from 1000000 to 1010000.

182
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:57,089
So eventually we would expect that, you know, because the marginal utility of stuff goes down,

183
00:19:57,090 --> 00:20:02,550
the more stuff you already have that the marginal utility of the income which used to buy that stuff would also probably go down.

184
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:08,310
So again, these are different people at different points rather than one person at different incomes.

185
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:12,630
But for one person with different incomes, we would actually very much expect.

186
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:21,350
The castle or something like that. STEBER Those first dollars are really valuable.

187
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:27,530
Imagine you haven't paid your rent. You haven't bought your groceries. How important are the are your rent grocery dollars to you?

188
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:32,190
Probably crucial. You're going to be devastated if you don't have them.

189
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:41,190
Yeah, it's it's beautiful to sleep outside tonight. Trust me, in a couple of months, you're going to want that apartment.

190
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:51,990
But if you're already a millionaire and somebody gave you your think, where you walk down the street, you find a $20 bill.

191
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:58,200
There's nobody around. So you can't even be like the honest person and say, okay, did you drop this 20 littering?

192
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:02,010
Nobody around here in the ARB. There's a $20 bill and you're only on walking down the path.

193
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:08,700
Pick it up. Right. You know, leave it there. You know, pick it up and stick it out.

194
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:13,200
And if I asked you a week later, what did you do with that $20 bill?

195
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,910
What's it probably you're going to have an answer for me.

196
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:25,050
Oh, I went out to the movies or I got a pizza, or you're probably even going to be able to tell me what you did with that $20 bill.

197
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:30,240
Now, imagine, Bill Gates is walking through the hour and there's a $20 bill.

198
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:36,240
So he's probably got to think now, if I actually bend over to pick it up, I might strain my back.

199
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,329
Should I even bother picking it up? Where is the risk of straining my back too?

200
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:45,500
Great. Now, did any of you think of that when you saw the $20 bill?

201
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:50,490
Risk reward of straightening my back versus getting the $20.

202
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:54,209
Now, suppose Bill Gates says, you know, hey, my back is feeling fine today.

203
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:56,280
I'm going to pick up that $20 bill.

204
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:04,890
Now, I ask Bill Gates a week later, hey, what did you do with that $20 that you wouldn't have done in your life if you wouldn't have picked it up?

205
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:13,739
I don't know what. $20. He's not using a real answer to that question of, you know, how did his life change?

206
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:18,299
Because he had that $20 bill he found. Whereas you're going to say, yeah, I was going to cook dinner tonight.

207
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:24,390
Instead I ordered pizza. You're probably telling me in a week, how did your life change because of that $20?

208
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:28,919
Bill Gates could not tell you that. Yeah, I put it in my pocket.

209
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,660
It probably is in the dry cleaners now.

210
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:48,950
So at least we have some evidence both on kind of our own behavior of giving money to charity and sort of how we do it, which dollars we give away.

211
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:55,730
We don't give away our rent and car payment and grocery money and give away what's left over after we've done those things.

212
00:22:56,550 --> 00:23:01,400
Now, once our marginal utility of income, how much an extra dollar is worth to us is lower.

213
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:04,820
At that point, we start weighing, How would I rather go to a movie or what?

214
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:11,630
I rather support a cause that I care about. That's a reasonable thing to weigh and say, you know, I'm going to donate money to this cause today.

215
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:23,960
You go to a movie next week. Getting evicted versus donating, not a reasonable thing to pay those rent dollars are really, really important to us.

216
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:35,390
Her. Let's talk about the basic income experiment in Kenya.

217
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:39,979
So is the article from Vox from a couple of years ago describing the experiment and

218
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:45,110
some of the the individuals that were in it and what they did with their money.

219
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:50,340
And then there was a more recent one that just came out a week or two ago that I sent in the announcements that

220
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:57,850
sort of a follow up away on that sort of a broader perspective on the kind of giving directly organizations.

221
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:02,300
It was not very long ago or 2010, 2011.

222
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:09,799
So basically a decade ago, where what what reaction is giving directly in there?

223
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:14,240
People get when they were trying to pitch their approach,

224
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:21,860
they were happier about it than giving out, you know, pitch their approach like other funders.

225
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:26,930
Oh, yeah. People are crazy. Yeah. Basically, there are two, two quotes.

226
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:34,610
One is like, you can't just give people money. Yeah, well, you must be smoking crack.

227
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:39,980
So it's like ten years ago that the idea that, well,

228
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:49,760
the best way to make people better off is actually to give them money is sort of anathema in the charitable community.

229
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:53,600
You don't need to give you don't give them money. You give them bednets.

230
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,110
You give them schoolbooks, you give them a cow.

231
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:00,900
That's how you make people better off.

232
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:09,960
So what what was the reason for that reaction, that sort of typical view of smoking crack if you're going to give people money?

233
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:16,870
They're not going to use it for what you intend to use it for. So basically, you don't trust them, basically.

234
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:23,500
You mean you as a donor say, I don't trust that you're going to make good decisions with this.

235
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:29,500
You're going to squander it. And what's the second reason?

236
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:33,610
So it's sort of related to that, but it's a little bit distinct.

237
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:42,640
What might people do if you just sort of give them money? In particular, people assume that they'll use it for drugs or alcohol or tobacco.

238
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:46,780
Okay. So that's kind of within the sort of the squandering it from the donors perspective.

239
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:51,880
Yeah. They might not want to work there. Might not want to work. And basically you're just making them dependent.

240
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:59,770
Or I think the word that was used in the article was shiftless. So you're making people lazy.

241
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:05,859
So either they're going to they're going to waste it on things that are harmful rather than spending it on things that are good,

242
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:10,660
like the alcohol and tobacco. And they're going to become lazy, independent.

243
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:15,220
You know, why would they have any initiative to work for money if you're is handing it to them?

244
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:25,420
Yeah. And we see that in real life with COVID and unemployment checks in terms of like there's still a lot of staffing issues in small

245
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:33,680
businesses because people were so reliant on the unemployment checks after those have gone away for a large part in this.

246
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:38,770
And they're still have a lot of labor shortages. And now we have people going back.

247
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:44,380
I think just in the last month, the labor force returned to the pre-pandemic level for the first time.

248
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:48,280
So say for now, temporarily, people made decisions.

249
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:55,930
But those decisions can be complicated, too. It's like, well, I have kids at home and the kids now are not at school.

250
00:26:55,930 --> 00:27:05,350
They're doing home school. Okay, so I have a check and it's not a Oh God, now I'm living a life of leisure and I, you know, never have to work again.

251
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:09,040
And this is awesome in my job. Suck in my boss. Suck do I hate my boss?

252
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:15,000
It's I got three kids at home and they're doing Zoom school, you know.

253
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:20,530
So now the check has allowed me to stay home and support them doing Zoom school.

254
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:26,319
It hasn't allowed me to sit home watching TV all day. So again, you can always find exceptions.

255
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:34,120
Are you somewhat different? Can you experiment? I'm sure there's somebody who said, Hey, let's just go buy booze, let's put our job, buy boots.

256
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,140
I'm sure somebody did that. And another 20,000 people in the village or however many.

257
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:44,760
But did that seem typical? So what do people use the money for?

258
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,200
Depends on the individual.

259
00:27:49,340 --> 00:28:00,329
Yes, some people use wisely and some, like you say, it's like giving up some big money to go up on alcohol or somebody like you need food,

260
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:04,890
candy and things before and they might use for that reason for traveling.

261
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:11,970
I kind of like them individual decisions. And it was incredibly varied.

262
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:17,430
Whereas what are some of the other things that people would let them to work or in some instances to

263
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:22,190
expand their businesses using that extra money instead of what we thought they would do is work less.

264
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:28,050
Some investment said, You know, I can now expand my business, maybe even employ somebody else.

265
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:38,060
But the key is, like you said, it's very individual. So suppose that you're at the end of the semester is right before the holiday season.

266
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:44,390
Suppose I like you guys so much this semester. I decide I'm going to get you all a Christmas present.

267
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,450
I'm going to go to the mall. I'm going to spend $100 for each of you.

268
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,970
I'm going to pick what I get for each of you.

269
00:28:53,440 --> 00:29:00,700
And I'm not giving you the gift receipt, so you can't return it and you get $100 and buy it and buy something else with it.

270
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:08,140
How good of a job do you think I'm going to do picking something for you versus if I just said, Hey,

271
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:14,200
you guys are so great this semester, I want to give you each $100 to go to the mall and buy something that you want.

272
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:19,740
People do good by giving money. That way I can be nice.

273
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:25,120
What I want you to work on. What's my me? A community that you do not understand that.

274
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:31,629
So maybe I will utilize better. So basically, I might take a really ugly face that I love.

275
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:35,410
But you look at that and say, Oh my God, that clashes with everything in my house.

276
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:41,110
That's the worst. That's the ugliest thing I've ever seen in my life. You spend $100 on that.

277
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:52,600
You know, I don't know what your preferences are, and I probably have a better guess of what your preferences are than I would sitting here

278
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:58,570
in the United States guessing what the preferences of a low income villager in Kenya is.

279
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:02,740
I don't have the first clue what what would really make them better off.

280
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:08,179
So I decide it's going to be schoolbooks and bed nets. Okay.

281
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:12,470
Well, ten organizations have already given my family 100 bed nets.

282
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,920
In fact, everyone in my village has got 100 bed nets, so I can't even sell the extras.

283
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:23,300
So it's kind of like me giving you the ugly face and no gift receipt.

284
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:36,530
So if my goal at the end of the semester was just to spread holiday joy among you more effective way for me to do that is to give you $100 and say,

285
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:47,030
Go buy yourself a present. Rather than be trying to pick for each of you not knowing anything about your preferences, what you might like.

286
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:52,399
So I was curious because that article was written and it's a bunch of anecdotal stories that talk about,

287
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:55,790
you know, these are the people that I talked to which could be selected or could not be selected.

288
00:30:55,790 --> 00:31:01,400
We don't really know because it's just one reporter writing about it. It was supposed to be a 12 year project.

289
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:06,469
Are there measurable outcomes that they're able to use? And then where is that data?

290
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:08,270
Because that happened in, what, 2010?

291
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:14,570
So we should have some results from that because we were speculating right now that this would be better for them,

292
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:18,620
but we don't actually know how the money was spent. It's just pure speculation.

293
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:24,709
The one thing that the GiveDirectly organization is that they have an evaluation plan for all their initiatives.

294
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:35,420
So it was actually run as a randomized controlled trial where there was another nearby village of similar kind of socioeconomic status,

295
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:40,570
similar size, similar kind of job distribution that didn't get it.

296
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:43,940
And they're trying to track it. And I don't think they published the final results yet.

297
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:48,760
So we had to we have to hope that the reporter was sort of honest and, you know,

298
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:57,140
presented a representative set of what they found as opposed to a highly selected set, sort of a certain amount of trust in the reporter here.

299
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:03,140
Hopefully, as a professional reporter that it's not, you know, cherry picking the stories,

300
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:06,500
but until the evaluation is out, there's a certain level of trust there.

301
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:11,570
Now, one of the questions is going to be with the evaluation is, was it transformational?

302
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:18,980
And the other thing is, if people invested it in their businesses and grew the local economy and hired extra people,

303
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:27,140
then the impact of the experiment would be even more than just, well, the people who got money are better off because they got money.

304
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:31,130
You know, that would be sort of the minimum standard you would want to meet.

305
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:36,740
The more maximal standard is that it was transformational to the community.

306
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:40,770
And that, I think, is as yet to be seen.

307
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:47,270
I mean, they talked about, you know, maybe pooling the money and bringing in electricity and paving roads and stuff like that.

308
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:50,360
But that's what I was. It was just it's half of the argument.

309
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:53,540
We didn't get to see the whole result of it.

310
00:32:53,550 --> 00:33:00,200
I think that's the part that's uncertain is sort of was a transformational in the infrastructure and what can the total economy of the village?

311
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:08,330
Or was it just. Well, of course, people are better off if you give them money, but there's no kind of what they call a multiplier beyond that.

312
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:14,570
And that's going to be I think there's a really interesting thing to see when they do come out with the final results.

313
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:18,770
I think that first part almost surely an accomplished, you know,

314
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:22,519
that the people are better off with the money and that for the most part I think the

315
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:27,829
reporter is not being disingenuous and it's not like 90% of the people quit their jobs.

316
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:35,330
And what better I think is a pretty I think he's a pretty credible reporter from a credible site.

317
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:39,440
So I think it is at least that first objective.

318
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:46,069
I expect to be met that the people are better off and that they used it in a lot of different ways, most of which we,

319
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:52,820
as the external donors sitting here in the United States wouldn't look at and say, well, they just squandered it on something stupid and foolish.

320
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:59,290
But the second part, did it transform the economy of the village?

321
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:02,440
Did it contribute to the broader infrastructure of the village?

322
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:11,230
I think it's more of an open question. I may have been extrapolating this and it wasn't there, but it seemed like the writer was saying,

323
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:18,850
okay, now we've done this thing in Kenya, it's going well. So the general assumption that we can't trust poor people with money is wrong.

324
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:25,060
And that's too big of a step for me. I don't think this is generalizable to other populations necessarily.

325
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:29,240
I don't really think there's a lot of evidence for that and plenty of reasons against it.

326
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:33,909
So what are we to do with that? Yeah, that's a great point.

327
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:39,340
And you can make a really a very close analogy to clinical trials in medicine.

328
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:45,710
Any physicians in here? Yeah.

329
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:54,170
Okay. So, so sorry. Yeah, well, I am a physician, so I don't know if you're afraid to say something.

330
00:34:54,170 --> 00:35:02,930
We're not physicians. So based on the discussion that we're having right now, if you need an example that's more close to home or more recent.

331
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:13,220
Back in 2019, they did this a similar type of experiment at Stockton, California, where they chose like a random 125 people,

332
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:21,440
and every month they gave them $500, no strings attached from like February of 2019 to February of 2020.

333
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:27,140
And they actually like publish the results and got similar findings.

334
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:31,879
There was actually an increase in employment and productivity. People were less stressed,

335
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:39,110
people were using it to pay off student loans and what else their wellbeing was okay

336
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:44,210
and like they emphasized heavily that it was spent on necessities and not drugs,

337
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:52,100
which I think is quite similar to what the findings might be as far as the Punia study.

338
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:58,940
But one thing that kind of I guess raises a couple of questions in my head is

339
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:04,730
why the focus is like spending it on necessities like you're giving me money,

340
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:10,040
why can't I spend it on what I deem fit to spend it on in my life?

341
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:14,000
Because that has to be of some value to me, right?

342
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:23,120
So I just don't understand how. And so if I truly respect your preferences, I should let you spend it on what you spend it on.

343
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,720
You know, but I think the argument being made, though,

344
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:36,030
was that there was an assumption that people would spend it on things that the donor would not like.

345
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:45,769
And that's been disproven. So I think that's kind of more the points from looking at it from the adult the donors perspective.

346
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:49,520
We've got sort of a paternalistic donor. I know what's good for you.

347
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:56,330
Tobacco is not good for you. I don't want you spending my money on tobacco.

348
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:04,430
That's paternalism in the sense of and I think at least that's been disproven that the typical person I say nobody did,

349
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:10,190
but the typical person did not spend the money on things that even the paternalistic donor would say.

350
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,530
No. I don't want my money to go in there.

351
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:21,980
And probably used it a lot more effectively than if the donor said, here, I'm sitting 6000 miles away and I think you need a bed net.

352
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:32,600
And I think what you need is three textbooks for your kids. So we're making it so far from that,

353
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:37,430
even from the perspective of the paternalistic dollar is trying to put I'm trying to impose my preferences on you.

354
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:45,620
I probably did a better job by giving you the cash than by giving you a bad net.

355
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:53,110
So does that make sense? Now I'll go back to the physician virus and go to physicians.

356
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:58,989
You spent a day in clinic. What specialty are you, general?

357
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:02,350
Family medicine. And you are plastic surgeon. Plastic surgeon?

358
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:07,690
Okay, so what percent of the things you do in a typical clinical day.

359
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:13,940
Could you show me that there is ironclad, randomized, controlled,

360
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:20,840
trial based evidence that this is the best thing to do for exactly this kind of a patient?

361
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:27,970
Does that sound like 98% of what you do in a day or is that 9% of what you do in a day?

362
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:34,900
Okay. So we've got the exact same issue that we do a randomized controlled trial.

363
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:39,280
So let's say we're trying to determine whether some drug works.

364
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:43,300
So we pick a treatment group.

365
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:53,740
So we say, well, nobody over age so-and-so and nobody with any of these 25 co-morbidities, this huge list of things were excluded from the trial,

366
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:59,740
and nobody whose condition is less severe than this, and definitely no risk conditions more severe than that.

367
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:12,100
And we do the trial and we closely monitor the prescribing and then the practices of the clinicians and the adherence to the drugs.

368
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:15,610
And we've got nurses calling them at home saying, did you take your drugs today?

369
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:23,030
And we find out that the drug is effective. And so what do we know?

370
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:29,750
We know that in this very narrow group of people, very selected drug, be the people most likely to benefit from it.

371
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:37,070
They don't have any of these co-morbidities. Their condition is not so severe or so mild that they're not likely to benefit.

372
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:44,010
They're in a narrow age range. And that when we have somebody from the health care team calling them,

373
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:49,220
we're texting them every day to check if they took their drugs, that, in fact, the drug is effective.

374
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:58,250
And we have to hope there wasn't like differential dropout from the study from one or from either the treatment or control arm.

375
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:03,950
Yeah. So now we've got great evidence that this drug under very tightly.

376
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:12,770
Define delivery protocols for a very tightly defined group of people, for a very tightly defined range of illness works.

377
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:20,770
Now, the FDA approves the drug on that basis. Now you can prescribe it to anybody, right?

378
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:26,809
Does anybody tell you, well, the FDA only approved it for this little narrow slice of your patient population.

379
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:34,310
Therefore, you can't prescribe it elsewhere yet you couldn't be over 75 years old and you prescribe it to 76 year old,

380
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:37,640
if only up to 75 is in the study force again.

381
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:43,850
Yeah. You know, so we've got a huge generalizability problem.

382
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:50,240
Randomized controlled trial as well executed has very, very high validity.

383
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:55,820
It's considered the gold standard of scientific evidence, clinical effectiveness,

384
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:02,569
but it's got a huge generalizability problem because now in practice we're giving the

385
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:07,070
treatment to all kinds of people who didn't qualify for the trial for any number of reasons.

386
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:13,340
And we're not doing it in a tight scenario where people are texting you every day to check it, to check on you, to make sure you took the drug.

387
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:20,150
So I've got the exact same issue. That is a huge issue.

388
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:23,750
It worked in one village in Kenya compared to another village in Kenya.

389
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:28,229
So if it's a well-designed, well-executed, randomized controlled trial,

390
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:34,950
that would have high validity to say that program was effective for that village in Kenya compared to this other village in Kenya.

391
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:42,110
That doesn't mean it was good for this village in Botswana compared to some other village in Botswana,

392
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:47,840
or there was good in Stockton, California, compared to a similar town elsewhere in California.

393
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:54,980
We also have a bit of experimental Alaska, so we know what Alaska does every year.

394
00:41:56,630 --> 00:42:02,600
You live in Alaska, you get a check. The Alaska Permanent Fund.

395
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:11,810
The state of Alaska has very few people and a lot of oil and minerals on state land.

396
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:20,120
So the state collects a lot of royalties from oil and mineral production and in fact spends more than their state budget each year.

397
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:24,770
How much more varies because like if the price of oil is $120 a barrel,

398
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:29,090
it's going to do a lot more for the state permanent fund than if it's $60 a barrel.

399
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:33,739
But every year they figure out how much surplus do we have in the state budget

400
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:37,280
as a permanent income fund that we're getting from oil and mineral rights.

401
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:42,200
We divide it up by the number of residents, the state of Alaska. We send you a check.

402
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:47,090
Typically, it's in a range two or three, four or $5,000 a year.

403
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:55,310
So again, it's if you say universal basic income, that's not enough to live on, especially in Alaska, where everything has to be flown in.

404
00:42:55,340 --> 00:43:00,890
Alaska is a very expensive place to live, but you get a check every year for doing nothing.

405
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:09,280
So there have been some studies of that, too, and I think they're broadly consistent with the sorts of things we see.

406
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:13,490
So we got to see some different context. Stockton, California is different than Kenya.

407
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:19,580
Alaska is different. Alaska is different than everything. Alaska is truly a new place.

408
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:25,790
And we're sort of building up some sense of is this generalizable?

409
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:31,040
And we're not there yet by any means, but moving in that direction.

410
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:41,040
Right. You've got some time to do practice problems.

411
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:47,670
So you pull up a few brings do a couple that are sort of more split graphical ones,

412
00:43:48,810 --> 00:43:54,840
kind of do them together and then we'll do maybe another one will kind of have you kind of get in small groups

413
00:43:54,840 --> 00:44:00,720
of maybe like four people and work on them for a few minutes and then we'll solve them together afterwards.

414
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:21,260
We? Okay.

415
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:29,480
We'll do the first six here, which are just sort of trying to draw the indifference curves consistent with the scenario described

416
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:34,549
so that the sentence is going to tell you something about the person's preferences and say,

417
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:39,740
well, if they have preferences like that between these two goods, what would their indifference curve look like?

418
00:44:42,330 --> 00:44:48,090
The first one. A student is happy with some amount of pizza and some of her favorite pizza really drunk and gets

419
00:44:48,090 --> 00:44:54,820
less happiness for each additional unit consumed for the indifference curve between the pizza.

420
00:44:57,570 --> 00:45:00,990
So it's like, is it a certain indifference curve shape?

421
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:08,160
It sounds like one we've seen before that we saw last Wednesday. And if so, what sort of a shape would be consistent of that preferences?

422
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:14,580
So I, I like pizza, I like sort of a drink with we'll call it Coke like we did last week.

423
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:21,750
But the more I have of each of those two goods, the less additional happiness I get from getting get another unit of them.

424
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:42,500
What does that sound like? My indifference curves is what? Like. Downward sloping in what shape but didn't give you any.

425
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:48,050
Doesn't say you get less happy with pizza or less. That is probably just straight down, right?

426
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:50,870
Yeah. That's that's is you.

427
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:59,059
Unless happiness with each additional unit consumed of each sum of the words, every additional coke I have gets me less happiness than the one before.

428
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:03,380
Every additional slice of pizza is actually going be our standard shape.

429
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:16,890
Our standard shape. I'm. That's just kind of the story along with our standard shape.

430
00:46:16,910 --> 00:46:22,760
If I got diminishing marginal utility of both goods. That's what that's putting in economics jargon with those words.

431
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:27,710
Say that I get less of additional happiness with each additional unit I get each day.

432
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:35,210
So that's diminishing marginal utility of those scores. So if I'm at a bundle up here where I've got a lot of pizza and very little coke,

433
00:46:35,870 --> 00:46:41,900
what that applies to me is that pizza is not worth a lot to me at the margin because I've already got so much of it.

434
00:46:42,290 --> 00:46:45,230
Coke is worth a lot to me. At the margins. I have very little of it.

435
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:51,020
So therefore, I would be willing to trade quite a bit of pizza to get a little bit more coke.

436
00:46:53,450 --> 00:46:57,020
Whereas if I were, I'd say down here where I've got a lot of coke and very little pizza.

437
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:03,500
That trade I was willing to make up here is a terrible. If I'm down here, I've got very little pizza.

438
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,730
So the value of that last slice of pizza is really high.

439
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:11,020
I've got lots of coke in the fridge. The value of another can of coke is very low.

440
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:17,440
So I would only give up a very small amount of pizza to get quite a large additional amount of coke.

441
00:47:19,030 --> 00:47:24,700
So this idea that both goods are less valuable to me the more I have of them.

442
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:30,660
It's going to lead to sort of that steam to flap, as it says, by willingness to trade.

443
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:32,450
Depends on what mix I start with.

444
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:40,200
If I start with a very sort of pizza, heavy mix pizza is not worth a lot to me at the margin, so I'd be willing to give up a lot of it.

445
00:47:40,710 --> 00:47:43,110
Coke is worth quite a lot to me at the margin,

446
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:50,790
so I train that large amount of pizza for a relatively small amount of additional coke for a down here would be the exact opposite scenario.

447
00:47:51,390 --> 00:47:58,110
Pizza is really valuable to me, so I would only give you a very small amount of pizza in exchange for a very large amount additional amount of coke.

448
00:47:59,370 --> 00:48:08,070
Does that make sense? It's not a constant value. Yeah. So based on the question, how do you know which one is on the X and y axis?

449
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:12,460
That's absolutely arbitrary. Yeah. So you can you can draw that.

450
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:18,810
So in general, like if we have problem sets or exams, I'll generally either put them on an axis or tell you which one does that.

451
00:48:18,810 --> 00:48:23,850
Everybody's graph looks the same, but you could, you know, it's completely arbitrary.

452
00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:34,900
Which one you put on which axis. Second one, another student is all is happy only with pairs of shoes.

453
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:40,660
What is the indifference curve of left and right shoes look like? That's another scenario that we talked about.

454
00:48:40,990 --> 00:48:44,410
Think back to last Wednesday before the holiday weekend.

455
00:48:44,410 --> 00:48:51,770
A long, long time ago. Perfect complement, perfect compliments.

456
00:48:51,770 --> 00:48:56,179
And what are the conference cards look like? It's going to be like straight like an L-shaped.

457
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:58,250
Exactly. So the perfect complements.

458
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:06,060
And again, to go back to you, I could put right shoes here and left shoes there, or I could do it the other way and it wouldn't matter.

459
00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:13,050
So right in the left. Okay. So I'm only happy with pairs of shoes.

460
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:26,430
So if I was down here, I've had notions. I know this is going to be on a higher indifference curve.

461
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:31,350
One pair of shoes is better than having no pair of shoes and having.

462
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:41,500
Four left shoes and one right shoe is going to be on the same indifference curve as a pair of shoes is if I still only have one right shoe.

463
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:45,910
Those three extra left shoes do nothing for me. They don't make me happy.

464
00:49:45,910 --> 00:49:53,549
Are still going to be on the same indifference curve. Similarly,

465
00:49:53,550 --> 00:50:00,209
what if I had one left shoe and somebody gives me three extra right shoes was three

466
00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:05,010
extra right shoes are absolutely useless to me unless I also get it for left shoe.

467
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:09,239
So is it groovy on the same indifference curve or was an equally happy with the bundle?

468
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:15,630
Four left. One right, one right. One left, one right or one left for right.

469
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:25,940
They're all on the same indifference curve. But now, instead, I got a pair of shoes, had one extra left and one extra right.

470
00:50:25,950 --> 00:50:29,520
That's going to put me on a higher indifference curve. That makes me happier.

471
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:35,520
But again, once I've got two of each, if you just give me extra left shoes, that'll be on the same indifference curve.

472
00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:39,540
If you just give me explorations, they'll be on the same curve.

473
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:50,990
So that makes sense. So these extra shoes I get beyond an even pair are useless to me, so they don't make me happier.

474
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:56,660
Five Now give me an extra one of the other one to go along with it that I can move to a higher indifference curve.

475
00:50:57,590 --> 00:51:04,750
I'd rather have two two pairs of shoes than one. I wouldn't rather have four left and one right than one left and one right.

476
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:09,610
Because those three extra shoes. Unmatched or useless.

477
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:16,809
I think that just is an extreme scenario. Not a not everything as a compliment.

478
00:51:16,810 --> 00:51:20,020
Is that strictly complimentary? That is absolutely lockstep.

479
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:25,110
Like pairs of shoes brass yourself in the pair of shoe example of.

480
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:29,520
Suppose there are two shoe stores. They're selling the same shoes.

481
00:51:30,450 --> 00:51:37,469
One of them sells $50 a pair. The other one says, right, shoes are 49, 99.

482
00:51:37,470 --> 00:51:44,520
And then we'll throw in a left shoe for a penny. You care which store you go to to get that pair of shoes.

483
00:51:48,450 --> 00:51:51,480
It's irrelevant because you never buy the right shoe without the left.

484
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:56,270
All the care. All you care about is either store. It's $50 for a pair of shoes.

485
00:52:02,350 --> 00:52:04,839
Driver needs to fill up fill up the car with gas,

486
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:11,110
but is indifferent between BP and Exxon gasoline draw the indifference curve between the two types of gas.

487
00:52:14,650 --> 00:52:21,360
So now I think we can come back to one of the answers that was raised for this one.

488
00:52:24,050 --> 00:52:27,180
Yeah, it's just going to be a straight line.

489
00:52:28,050 --> 00:52:34,320
It's gonna be a straight line because I don't couldn't care less what the composition of gas in my tank is.

490
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:39,760
All I care about is how many gallons I have. So let's say.

491
00:52:41,610 --> 00:53:04,460
There's BP and there's the other brands, Exxon. Suppose I have one gallon of BP in my gas tank and no sun.

492
00:53:06,010 --> 00:53:09,040
I'm going to be equally happy if I had a half a gallon of each.

493
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:17,650
If I had 9/10 of a gallon of gasoline and 1/10 of a gallon of pee, or if I simply had all excited.

494
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:25,900
All I care about is how many total gallons I have. So I'm equally happy with any bundle of gasoline brands.

495
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:32,340
Where the total that I have is one gallon. If I'm going to be better off.

496
00:53:36,370 --> 00:53:39,490
I've got to move to a bundle that has more gas. And again.

497
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:48,159
Any bundle that gives me exactly two gallons in my tank is just the same to me,

498
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:53,350
regardless of whether it's all BP, all Exxon or any mix of BP and Exxon.

499
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:59,610
So think of my marginal rate of substitution. So you drop the slope of the indifference curve.

500
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:03,419
It's going to be constant for a perfect substitute here.

501
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:10,950
It was not constant because the mix mattered to me. I feel very different at the margin about another slice of pizza and another can of coke.

502
00:54:10,950 --> 00:54:18,810
If I started this bundle that I feel if I started this bundle here, I couldn't care less what the mix is.

503
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:31,730
I only care what the total is. So I'd only be willing to trade, say, a 10th of a gallon of BP for a 10th of a gallon of Exxon.

504
00:54:31,730 --> 00:54:37,549
If I started there. I'd only be willing to try a 10th of a gallon of BP for a 10th of a gallon of Exxon.

505
00:54:37,550 --> 00:54:44,420
If I start there. I'm exactly as willing to trade between the two, regardless of the mix that I start with.

506
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:48,050
I was very different in my willingness to trade between the two.

507
00:54:48,890 --> 00:54:52,810
Based on the mix I started with here. Trade.

508
00:54:52,810 --> 00:55:01,860
That was good to me up here. Looks terrible to me down here. So I guess that's an assumption question because the question doesn't say that.

509
00:55:02,130 --> 00:55:05,220
It doesn't say that you're going to be happier with.

510
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:12,850
You know equal makes a pizza in Cairo and it's kind of the same to me is the Exxon BP question.

511
00:55:13,430 --> 00:55:17,570
It's just the total number of units. That's the way the question reads, right? Or am I miss enough?

512
00:55:18,590 --> 00:55:23,010
So the answer is Coke. I'm indifferent between the two brands of gas.

513
00:55:23,510 --> 00:55:27,140
But there's no in the I am they're they're perfect substitutes to me.

514
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:31,820
I understand the concept, but I guess my question is, when I read the question, number one,

515
00:55:32,090 --> 00:55:38,300
it looks to me like you're indifferent there either because it just says you're less happy for each additional unit.

516
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:43,280
You're making the assumption that you're going to be happier with some mix of coke and pizza.

517
00:55:44,750 --> 00:55:50,149
Is that wrong? To think that I'm negative, but I'm not trying to split hairs.

518
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:53,790
I just want when I read the question, I get a little confused that that.

519
00:55:54,310 --> 00:56:03,020
So the key in the first one is that I get less happiness from each additional unit consumed of each of the two goods that because of that,

520
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:08,180
if I think about how valuable the two goods are to me relative to each other,

521
00:56:08,450 --> 00:56:12,650
where the slope of indifference curtails my willingness to trade between the two goods,

522
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:18,620
and if I've got diminishing marginal utility of both goods by willingness to trade.

523
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:25,939
And this mix has to be different than my willingness to trade for this mix, whereas that doesn't happen.

524
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:29,450
That isn't the case with the perfect substitutes, because to me it really does the same good.

525
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:34,880
So I might get less marginal utility from additional gas in general.

526
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:42,140
But in terms of the two different brands of gas and they're absolutely equivalent to me, they're the same thing.

527
00:56:42,710 --> 00:56:53,030
So because they're the same thing, I would never say, let's say make this BP and this X sorry, I would never say wow,

528
00:56:53,030 --> 00:57:00,680
if I've got a lot of BP in my tank and very little x son, I was sure sacrifice lots of BP just to get a little bit of Exxon.

529
00:57:01,130 --> 00:57:06,620
But if I had the opposite, if I had a lot of Exxon and very little BP Well, wait a second.

530
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:13,310
BP is really scarce to me. I really want my BP. I'm only going to give up a little bit of BP if you offer me a lot of extra sun.

531
00:57:14,950 --> 00:57:21,819
So does that make more sense? If I put a nice person, you know, that that argument made with pizza and coke doesn't make sense.

532
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:30,100
What I make it was BP and Exxon. What makes sense with BP and Exxon is I'm always willing to trade at exactly the same rate.

533
00:57:30,190 --> 00:57:35,290
In other words, the slope is constantly. The slope is my willingness to trade.

534
00:57:35,950 --> 00:57:41,680
If those two goods to me are perfect substitutes, I'm always willing to trade at a rate of one gallon for one gallon.

535
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:45,760
These are those of whether I'm up here, whether I'm in the middle or whether I'm down here.

536
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:53,380
That's definitely not the case when we talk about pizza and my willingness to trade.

537
00:57:53,410 --> 00:57:58,270
Very much depends on the mix I'm starting from. It's up here.

538
00:57:58,300 --> 00:57:59,920
Pizza's not very valuable to me.

539
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:05,950
At the margin, the last slice is not carrying a lot of utility, but the next kind of coke is generating a lot of utility.

540
00:58:07,610 --> 00:58:14,830
And down here, it's the exact opposite. Yeah. So we'll always be stated in the question whether or not you're indifferent or whether or not you care.

541
00:58:15,430 --> 00:58:21,459
Because if, like, say, BP was way more valuable to me than Exxon in the question,

542
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:24,850
it would read like that, like the first one, and we would have to draw a curve like that.

543
00:58:25,630 --> 00:58:30,870
Yeah, right. Sort of like it'll always be stated whether or not you're indifferent.

544
00:58:31,350 --> 00:58:37,190
We'll never be an assumption, but you'll be. There'll be enough there for you to draw inference.

545
00:58:37,410 --> 00:58:40,559
I guess that's the way that I can answer that.

546
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:43,740
Unfortunately, it's always a little bit different.

547
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:50,040
Justin likes baseball gloves and is right handed, so he has no need for a left handed glove.

548
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:55,980
So draws indifference, curves the right hand and left handed baseball gloves.

549
00:58:56,610 --> 00:59:03,840
Yeah, I'm sorry about the last two. So for the perfect complement, substitute one in it.

550
00:59:04,890 --> 00:59:08,820
Theoretically, it would be lying parallel to those forever.

551
00:59:08,820 --> 00:59:11,040
Right? So like you could have three. Yeah.

552
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:18,150
So it would be whole numbered for the shoes but for the for the gas that would theoretically be every single parallel like that Jesse is.

553
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:24,750
We could draw as many as we wanted to. So we talk with a topographic map.

554
00:59:25,710 --> 00:59:31,920
You know, that map I showed you of Pikes Peak was drawing lines where every 20 feet you could draw a line every ten feet to draw a line,

555
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:36,390
every one foot, you could draw a line every inch, but eventually you wouldn't be able to see anything.

556
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:42,530
You know, the graph would just turn for the first time on sun or like the exam do.

557
00:59:42,810 --> 00:59:46,290
Like, how many should we do in that kind of scenario?

558
00:59:48,190 --> 00:59:51,880
Basically. Well, I'd say you're going to hate this answer, but enough to answer the question.

559
00:59:52,270 --> 00:59:54,630
But that's generally going to be two or three.

560
00:59:54,640 --> 01:00:01,210
You know, it's like you're you're really never have to draw four or five different scores to, you know, clearly answer the question.

561
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:04,030
I can't imagine that you would ever have to.

562
01:00:04,510 --> 01:00:09,430
And the other thing you should just assume, unless I tell you something, can only be consumed in whole units.

563
01:00:09,790 --> 01:00:15,790
Always assume the fractional units are possible, you know, even if it's something you might think of as a whole unit thing.

564
01:00:16,270 --> 01:00:21,759
So the question doesn't say assume it has to be whole units and assume they're fraction is most things.

565
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:27,069
Fractions are possible. You know, I can buy a quarter pound of chicken.

566
01:00:27,070 --> 01:00:36,820
I can buy a half gallon of gas. So just to kind of keep things easy, we're going to just so unless you're explicitly told it has to be whole,

567
01:00:36,820 --> 01:00:40,270
units just assumed that fractions are fine.

568
01:00:43,190 --> 01:00:49,519
So one thing to note also in this perfect substitute one here, the slope was negative one because the trade off,

569
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:53,810
obviously for measuring them in gallons, it would make sense to trade one gallon for one gallon.

570
01:00:55,130 --> 01:00:59,090
Just because something is a perfect substitute doesn't mean though it has to be negative one.

571
01:00:59,630 --> 01:01:06,170
What if I just do something silly, like measure Exxon in liters and BP and gallons?

572
01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:14,330
That doesn't mean Exxon and BP would cease to be perfect substitutes, but.

573
01:01:15,490 --> 01:01:20,440
The subject of humility would cease to be one for one now, be one for 3.7.

574
01:01:21,820 --> 01:01:26,230
You know, if I give up a gallon of BP, you'd better give me 3.7 liters.

575
01:01:27,790 --> 01:01:34,450
So just by doing something silly like measuring them in different units, I can get the substitute ability to be not 1 to 1.

576
01:01:36,070 --> 01:01:42,820
So there's nothing magic about 1 to 1. It's just that literally a gallon of gas is a gallon of gas that measured in the same units.

577
01:01:42,830 --> 01:01:51,520
That's obviously going to be 1 to 1. And you could imagine some things like that you might say are perfect substitutes.

578
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:56,829
But one of them one of the one of them essentially is is inherently smaller than the other.

579
01:01:56,830 --> 01:02:01,209
So you would want to trade one, 2 to 2 brands of soap.

580
01:02:01,210 --> 01:02:03,150
And one of them, the bars are bigger than the others.

581
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:09,850
You might say I couldn't care less which brand I have, but I wouldn't trade them 1 to 1 because one of them is twice as big as the other.

582
01:02:09,850 --> 01:02:15,490
I'd have to trade the 1 to 2. Okay, so let's go to the baseball glove we've got.

583
01:02:16,030 --> 01:02:20,970
Justin is a right handed thrower, so he doesn't have any need for a glove for a left hander.

584
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:26,050
What were his indifference curves between left and right handed gloves look like?

585
01:02:29,020 --> 01:02:35,730
Be like a vertical line. Instead of a vertical or horizontal, again, depending which axis we pick.

586
01:02:37,230 --> 01:02:43,990
So gloves for right handed throwers. Loves for left handed throwers.

587
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:50,670
Suppose he has one right handed glove and no left handed gloves.

588
01:02:51,510 --> 01:02:54,540
And now we give him a whole bunch of gloves for left handed throwers.

589
01:02:56,110 --> 01:03:00,250
They wouldn't make him any happier. They don't harm him, but he does no use for them.

590
01:03:02,260 --> 01:03:06,640
If you want to make him happier, we've got to give him a second glove for a right handed thrower.

591
01:03:09,970 --> 01:03:15,130
And that's what that indifference curve look like. So he's got gets happier the farther he moves in that direction.

592
01:03:15,790 --> 01:03:22,750
But he only cares about this direction. Because he has absolutely no use for the other good.

593
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:31,120
If we just flip the axes, if I put right handed there and left handed, they're then they'd be horizontal and he'd be happy moving up.

594
01:03:32,230 --> 01:03:39,460
So again, that's the question of what you put on which axis is arbitrary, what you choose, but it might change the way things look.

595
01:03:40,030 --> 01:03:46,050
So if you want everybody's graph to look the same, I would say put right handed gloves on the x axis, left handed axis.

596
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:53,260
And that way, everybody's indifference curve should be vertical. But if I let you just choose, then I just say, Well, it's vertical.

597
01:03:53,260 --> 01:03:59,589
If you chose right handed here, the horizontal, if you put right in here, it's arbitrary.

598
01:03:59,590 --> 01:04:05,020
There's no reason why you put one on one end system. The other one might change the way the graph should look.

599
01:04:07,780 --> 01:04:28,129
I've got a final one with you. The number five for a typical person drawn indifference curve between housing

600
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:32,630
something they like and noise pollution exposure something they don't like.

601
01:04:34,790 --> 01:04:39,049
So so far we've only talked about things that were, quote, good, good meaning.

602
01:04:39,050 --> 01:04:42,980
It's something that generates utility is something that I'd like, something it's positive to do.

603
01:04:43,790 --> 01:04:46,840
Now we've gone to something where we had a good and a.

604
01:04:50,210 --> 01:04:54,890
There's one thing this person likes, but the other thing, it didn't help them.

605
01:04:54,890 --> 01:04:58,360
It didn't hurt them. They couldn't care less. The right handed thrower.

606
01:04:58,370 --> 01:05:03,559
I've got no use for gloves that go on my right hand. The right hand thrower I catch with my left hand.

607
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:07,969
So, right. So I have no use for this type of a glove. Now we're going to go even a little further.

608
01:05:07,970 --> 01:05:12,140
We have one thing I like. It's a good and the other thing is actually a bad.

609
01:05:12,140 --> 01:05:23,010
I dislike it. That would be like a positively sloped, like cave.

610
01:05:23,540 --> 01:05:27,919
Why? Because, like, at some point you might wind up housing that.

611
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:32,910
Maybe you're okay with having a little bit more noise explosion.

612
01:05:33,170 --> 01:05:42,750
That's okay. Sure. So. She said that indifference curves are always going to be negatively sloped.

613
01:05:43,830 --> 01:05:48,360
But what we didn't say is that there was sort of implicit assumption there that we're talking about two things,

614
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:52,060
that our goods have two things our goods.

615
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:54,030
In other words, the person likes both of them,

616
01:05:54,510 --> 01:05:59,190
and different things should be negatively sloped because there's got to be a tradeoff being the same indifference curtains.

617
01:05:59,190 --> 01:06:01,290
I like the two bundles just as well.

618
01:06:01,860 --> 01:06:08,730
So if there's more of one thing, there's got to be less of the other thing for me to like those two bundles equally well.

619
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:13,410
So that's how he ruled out the positively sloped portion of the indifference curve.

620
01:06:13,410 --> 01:06:15,540
When we were talking about preference properties, he said, Well,

621
01:06:16,050 --> 01:06:22,350
it doesn't make sense to have a positively sloped indifference curve because more is better for principle.

622
01:06:22,820 --> 01:06:28,920
If for supposedly sloped indifference curve. They're saying there are some bundles that have more of both goods and you like them equally well.

623
01:06:29,490 --> 01:06:34,950
That violates the peak principle. But it had the implicit assumption that I like both of the goods.

624
01:06:35,850 --> 01:06:41,820
We're talking about things that are, in fact, goods, not bads. Not for something like.

625
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:51,170
Housing and noise. Very the opposite kind of a trade off.

626
01:06:52,310 --> 01:06:57,070
So maybe it's just.

627
01:07:06,510 --> 01:07:10,320
And we'll flip them because I'm just which we now have in the solutions that I'm going to post.

628
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:19,860
I've got. Noise, pollution and housing.

629
01:07:22,020 --> 01:07:27,360
You know, maybe it looks something like this. So suppose that I have.

630
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:33,020
Let's just say I'm at that point. I've got a certain level of housing.

631
01:07:34,830 --> 01:07:40,250
And a certain level of noise. Where am I?

632
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:45,230
I'd be indifferent to that. Where might there be another bundle that like just as well as that original one?

633
01:07:45,670 --> 01:07:51,560
Ah, it's got to be somewhere in this direction. Because if it's a noisier neighborhood.

634
01:07:53,130 --> 01:08:00,270
If noise goes off, that makes me worse off. So if I'm worse off because of that, you need to compensate me.

635
01:08:03,070 --> 01:08:08,140
Say a bigger house. So think of the tradeoff.

636
01:08:08,150 --> 01:08:12,320
There's a Detroit metro airport and certain flight paths.

637
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:23,400
Their houses are right under the flight paths. So one of the attributes of that house, when you're weighing whether to buy it, is it's noisy.

638
01:08:27,590 --> 01:08:34,940
So let's say I've got a 2000 square foot house in the flight path and I've got another 2000 square foot house that looks exactly the same,

639
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:44,780
very similar neighborhood. It's got the same roof and the same rooms and everything's identical about it, except it's in a quieter neighborhood.

640
01:08:47,090 --> 01:08:49,400
I obviously prefer the one in the quieter neighborhood.

641
01:08:50,980 --> 01:09:00,400
So the tradeoff I'd make if I say, well, waste, I must spend $100,000 on this house because I can have a bigger house in a noisier neighborhood.

642
01:09:01,330 --> 01:09:05,200
Or maybe I choose a slightly smaller house in a quieter neighborhood.

643
01:09:08,110 --> 01:09:11,440
And at some point I might say, well, I'm indifferent between those two. Yeah.

644
01:09:11,830 --> 01:09:19,660
Would it make sense to have a show? Because at some point, like the bigger house isn't worth the noise level.

645
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:23,620
Right. And then we also have the first dollar matters more principle.

646
01:09:24,070 --> 01:09:27,879
So what? I mean, I'm just trying to make sure I'm thinking about this the right way.

647
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:30,180
Is that is that still accurate? Yeah.

648
01:09:30,190 --> 01:09:36,429
I mean, you can think about you could tell very stories about maybe the curvature of this, should it be getting steeper, should be getting flat,

649
01:09:36,430 --> 01:09:44,770
or as the trade off changes, then that kind of depends on the person's preferences and think about how they might trade off those two attributes.

650
01:09:45,190 --> 01:09:51,160
So their general point, the main part of this is just to say it has to be positive, though,

651
01:09:52,030 --> 01:09:56,589
if I'm going to link these two houses equally well and one is in a let's say,

652
01:09:56,590 --> 01:10:01,090
the the attribute of housing, I'm measuring just how big the houses keep it very simple.

653
01:10:01,090 --> 01:10:04,750
There's two attributes of a house. How big is it and how noisy is the neighborhood?

654
01:10:06,370 --> 01:10:10,480
So this is a bigger house going this direction, a noisier neighborhood going in that direction.

655
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:15,580
So at what point does it become straight up and down, like when you have the 30,000 square foot house?

656
01:10:17,820 --> 01:10:20,360
Does it make a difference that there's that for you?

657
01:10:20,820 --> 01:10:26,640
You probably don't value the 30,000 at first foot very much, but you might really want quiet, you know.

658
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:29,999
So at that point, you probably said, again, kind of like the pizza on coke.

659
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:34,110
I've got so much housing that I really value quiet.

660
01:10:35,340 --> 01:10:42,930
So moving and having the house be, you know, why would I have a 3000 foot house, a 30,000 square foot house in a really, really noisy neighborhood?

661
01:10:43,530 --> 01:10:46,710
So I guess that was her question. And that's what I'm trying to dig into, too.

662
01:10:47,070 --> 01:10:50,870
Does it become flat or does it always stay sloped, as you suggested?

663
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:52,080
It should always stay sloping.

664
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:59,399
It could become very close to vertical as long as long as housing remains a good long as there's not sort of a satiation point where

665
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:06,640
I literally don't want a square foot bigger house for anything because it's more pain in the ass to take care of right there.

666
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:12,750
Yeah, most of us are not making our decisions at that level. We talked last time about, you know, is there a sort of a satiation point?

667
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:17,160
Is there a point in which you don't want more of anything?

668
01:11:18,090 --> 01:11:23,250
You know, maybe, maybe not. But are any of us operating in our lives anywhere near that point?

669
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:27,570
You know, the decisions we're making, our lives, unfortunately, are nowhere near.

670
01:11:28,980 --> 01:11:36,840
If you consider the Bill Gates example of his money is scarce, even though in our everyday sense it's abundant.

671
01:11:38,930 --> 01:11:49,969
Scarce as long as it as an alternative means, as long as there's something valuable to him, he's weighing between, do I give it away for this cause?

672
01:11:49,970 --> 01:11:53,330
Or I give it away for that cause? It's still a trade off.

673
01:11:53,850 --> 01:11:57,560
Yeah, but use spectrum in everyday terms. Yeah, it would be.

674
01:11:58,070 --> 01:12:02,900
At some point the house would be so big. It's like, yeah, it's a pain in the butt to take care of a bigger one for you.

675
01:12:04,850 --> 01:12:08,059
Are any of us really operating at that level in our everyday lives?

676
01:12:08,060 --> 01:12:14,270
We're making decisions. I'm like, Well, that's the biggest house I would ever, ever, ever, ever imagine being.

677
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:22,669
But we probably would never make a choice. And I think this goes very much with your logic of saying, you know what,

678
01:12:22,670 --> 01:12:30,440
I want that 30,000 foot house so bad that I will take it in the noisiest neighborhood in the country just to bring down its price.

679
01:12:32,180 --> 01:12:37,910
It's like, well, wait a second. Does that last for their house worth so much that you want to live in an incredibly noisy place,

680
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:42,380
which makes sense to have a huge house in that type of a neighborhood?

681
01:12:43,700 --> 01:12:47,780
Probably not. I'd probably rather a 29,000 square foot house in a much quieter neighborhood.

682
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:58,360
I plan to be much more willing to trade off size to get customers now.

683
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:06,489
So we're really never going to work with this type of an example again because you can always get back to negatively sloped indifference,

684
01:13:06,490 --> 01:13:08,260
different curves, and you have a guess how we might do that.

685
01:13:11,030 --> 01:13:18,590
You could like flip the pollution axis so that like you're talking about less pollution going up instead of more.

686
01:13:18,890 --> 01:13:23,299
Exactly. You can always turn a bad into a good if something is a bad.

687
01:13:23,300 --> 01:13:28,250
Well, the absence of it is a good. So what if instead of noise, I said, quiet.

688
01:13:29,930 --> 01:13:35,300
If noise is bad, quiet is good. If pollution is.

689
01:13:35,390 --> 01:13:37,880
If air pollution is bad, well, clean air is good.

690
01:13:38,540 --> 01:13:43,880
So I can always get back to working with negative indifference curves and making it look like everything else we've looked at.

691
01:13:44,210 --> 01:13:47,840
We've looked at by saying, if one of the two things is a bad well,

692
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:54,670
then I can always define the absence of that thing as being a good so dirty or water is bad.

693
01:13:54,680 --> 01:14:04,130
Well, cleaner water is good. So if I'm trading a cleanliness water against something else, then it's going to be a standard negative trade off.

694
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:12,830
So if I define noise as quietness and so then I'm just kind of flipping it around where more is better.

695
01:14:13,940 --> 01:14:20,190
The set of A.q. Now more is better.

696
01:14:20,210 --> 01:14:21,290
Now they're both goods.

697
01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:31,100
And now we should again have a downward sloping indifference curve, because I'm willing to trade a bigger house against a quieter neighborhood.

698
01:14:37,090 --> 01:14:43,770
All right. Well, we don't have a lot of time left. So what I'll do is I've got a couple other problems here,

699
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:49,540
and I'll post the solutions later today and then we can kind of they work through one of them next time.

700
01:14:51,610 --> 01:15:09,610
And so which one how did you take a look, particularly at number nine?

701
01:15:17,390 --> 01:15:27,500
And number nine is a good one for practice and say number 12 A through C and 12 in

702
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:32,090
particular is going to be useful when you're thinking about your first problem set.

703
01:15:32,570 --> 01:15:40,370
It's going to be very kind of analogous to the electricity problem in terms of what happens to the budget constraint.

704
01:15:41,870 --> 01:15:47,120
So doing number 12 is going to kind of help you out with that problem. So I will post the solutions later today.

705
01:15:47,930 --> 01:15:54,160
So let's try those too, kind of on your own before you look at the solutions and then we can talk about them a little bit.

706
01:15:54,920 --> 01:16:06,250
Someone may have noticed that we're supposed to be leaving this practice process.

707
01:16:07,580 --> 01:16:36,670
Okay, so be able to track this problem. Is it going to let him go out there and do something that is annoyance solutions before the law school?

708
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:52,480
So I just sat there and I was like, okay, that's what I'd like.

709
01:16:52,580 --> 01:17:12,530
You know, I think we are going to have more than one request over this weekend.

710
01:17:16,730 --> 01:17:26,020
Where did you want to screen time with your friends or even I guess this is just a natural thing to do.

711
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:30,860
So you say it's like the fourth company.

712
01:17:30,860 --> 01:17:35,780
She's gotten answers. Like, I've just been leery over this.

713
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:58,680
This is like, when does a drugstore like, hey, I guess so I got to get, you know, I think it's better than.

714
01:17:58,680 --> 01:18:06,130
Well, I know there's like two names that it's just, like, being broken.

715
01:18:06,150 --> 01:18:14,000
Like, so you're sitting there and she's got me, and I get really surprised when I don't know how to use.

716
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:17,000
So she's super nice. Okay. It's not like that's probably.

717
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:33,350
Yeah, I mean, if I knew when I was going to ask you why are you going in that and which one is it that you do that?

718
01:18:33,620 --> 01:18:42,190
I'm like, Oh, yeah, I'm going to ask you, what do you want people to hear?

719
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:45,800
It's just like writing these things.

720
01:18:49,020 --> 01:18:52,210
I know that. I just understand the concept.

721
01:18:52,250 --> 01:18:59,510
So it's like the people that don't have to.

722
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:02,340
Yeah, that's what I was saying to you.

723
01:19:02,570 --> 01:19:12,170
It's like you're just trying to the problem because I think that's why we just get frustrated because I need to, right?

724
01:19:12,290 --> 01:19:16,330
Yeah. Right. Okay.

725
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:27,810
You know, I heard something so out about this program and I said, how convenient.

726
01:19:27,830 --> 01:19:35,000
Because you don't. I don't. I just like to read it. What is the source of the problem?

727
01:19:35,010 --> 01:19:46,780
But I think I was trying to find out. But if we did have to take another look, I was kind of any part of that.

728
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:55,390
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, you know, we're pretty much, like, making sense, you know?

729
01:19:55,430 --> 01:19:57,700
I don't want to do that because I think you should be.
