1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:06,480
Okay. I'm Bridget. I'm interviewing Emma. And what position are you interviewing?

2
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:15,720
Like a policy management, like I like to do that.

3
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,000
So why are you interested in this position?

4
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:26,850
I'm interested in this position because through what I've learned in my master's program and like a lot of my classes,

5
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:36,290
I became really interested in the management of health care and how to provide health care for people who may not understand it so well,

6
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:41,580
like in the public. And so I'm interested in, let's say,

7
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:49,080
policies and practices that can allow us to more equitably distribute health care and make sure that everybody has access.

8
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:57,420
Okay. And what are some of your strengths and weak? When I met her strength was I'm a very relational person.

9
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:02,720
And so I like to work on teams, I like to work around people, whether that's on the project or not.

10
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:12,810
And I like to be organized before I can understand what other people are working on and know what I need to get done based on their projects.

11
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:22,570
If they are calling it my weakness, also having to do with a really slow start is that I don't need to actually communicate with people.

12
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:30,830
I need to be communicated with. I like to make sure that things are going well and so that sometimes prevents me

13
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:35,150
from communicating something that has gone wrong or that needs to be changed.

14
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:40,010
And so through my internships and my experiences in the Master's program,

15
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:48,380
I've been able to have one on one meetings with my supervisors and practice how to communicate more directly and efficiently.

16
00:01:49,700 --> 00:02:00,049
And why should we hire you over other applicants? I have had experiences through my undergrad in nursing and the now in Masters in Public Health

17
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:06,380
that help combine the clinical side of health care versus the other side of health care.

18
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:12,020
And so I think both of those two things, along with some classes I've taken in business management,

19
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:19,640
have helped me combine all three of those aspects that I needed in the policy and healthcare field.
