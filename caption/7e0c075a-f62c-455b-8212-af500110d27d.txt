1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:08,390
Thank you.

2
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:19,140
You have water lilies. All right, folks, how are we doing?

3
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,700
Amazing. Yes. Who knows you back there?

4
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,360
All right. I'm glad to hear there's some amazingness that's happening.

5
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:32,280
Great. Well, for me, it's great to be back.

6
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:37,139
I was I was in D.C. this this week, so it's nice to be home.

7
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,900
Although it wasn't snowing in D.C. and I heard we got a little bit of both the white stuff while we're here.

8
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:46,920
Just a reminder that next week is Thanksgiving. So we will not be meeting.

9
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:54,900
We will resume the following week and we're actually going to be virtual.

10
00:00:55,690 --> 00:01:04,290
Oh, oh, good. The reason is our guest speakers that week are from the CDC Injury Prevention Center.

11
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:12,180
So they will be zooming in. And I figure it might just be easier to have folks zoom in if you want.

12
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:17,550
But I'll tell you what, we can also make it hybrid. I'm I'm going to be here anyways so we can have this room available.

13
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:19,290
We can do kind of a zoom session here.

14
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:27,690
But if folks wanted to zoom in for that, maybe a nice little break, even though I've had Thanksgiving night kind of stuff.

15
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:33,450
But I know we're going to at that point in the semester, but at the same time, we'll also continue to make space available for group work.

16
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:40,500
So if you wanted to spend some time at the end of that session working with your groups, that might be another way to utilize that time.

17
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:46,260
Moving into today, we have a few different things that are happening and one, I'm very excited.

18
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:47,940
Our guest is already here. Dr.

19
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:54,179
You will Foster said he's going to be talking about some intervention work that that she's been doing will have an introduction coming.

20
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,770
But Cindy also volunteered and is willing to participate in our conversation.

21
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:03,090
So it's not going to just be me because we're going to have a real expert.

22
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:07,980
And then I'll also be here, too, to talk through some of the epidemiology behind suicide risk.

23
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,010
We'll hear about we'll hear from Cindy and some of the great work that she's doing.

24
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:17,610
We are going to then look at some of the the issues around screening so that maybe we have

25
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:23,250
this this prevalent a super highly prevalent issue across a lot of different populations.

26
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:30,060
We're going to focus on adolescents and emerging adults because you'll see this is one of the first places where we see suicide rates start to spike.

27
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:34,079
And how can we begin to identify those as those individuals?

28
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:40,649
Because unlike a lot of other forms of injury that might be obvious or overt, mental health challenges can go unnoticed.

29
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:45,600
And so what are some of the things that we can do to address those concerns?

30
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:50,879
But I thought we would start with just a little bit of a thought exercise or think fair share, if you will.

31
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:56,610
I want you to turn to your neighbors, because I had this question in the past, and I'm curious what folks think about it.

32
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:01,310
Here we are in an injury class. We've talked about firearms, we've talked about motor vehicle crashes.

33
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:06,390
We've talked about things that happen to you in the workplace. And now we're moving into a mental health space.

34
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:14,159
Does this belong in this class? So players do we should we be thinking about mental health and injury or is this really I mean,

35
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,720
we have another whole class that focuses on mental health. We have departments that focus on mental health.

36
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,440
And yet here we are again, injury class. So take just a couple of minutes.

37
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:28,260
I think I might know your answer, but just the same, I'd love to hear from you. So tell me why or why not?

38
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:32,070
And if everybody's like now is then longer, maybe we should go. And we got that.

39
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:36,250
All right, so find a friend who clearly does.

40
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:43,560
Yeah, don't you, dummy, are you?

41
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:50,370
You don't have to be here. You don't have to do anything chemical for an injury.

42
00:03:50,640 --> 00:04:17,660
Yes, but you know, sometimes I'm on medications like you know, like you said, you know, I saw a lot of you guys are to be like, we had a bad idea.

43
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:24,060
It was like, yeah, I'm pregnant. How is it now?

44
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:33,780
Oh, you want to get. Well, I just think that people that are really I'm just trying to figure out what is the

45
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:37,940
alternative because they're having to use some sports injuries and not being there.

46
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:47,030
Where would it be? Awesome. Is it just oh, like it's like it's like like, you know, four months.

47
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:55,139
I don't know. The word for it doesn't seem very dangerous because it doesn't and it doesn't address it.

48
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:58,910
I was like, Oh, here's a Band-Aid on. Yeah, like.

49
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:08,829
And we saw what happened with him before.

50
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:17,420
He was a guy who was continually lost some of the people around him.

51
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:24,760
And this is all damage that they know because they can't as with Washington,

52
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:31,840
without giving me the personal examples of where I'm from, the government, those are economic.

53
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:38,620
Yes, there are people that care, but yes or no.

54
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:39,490
Yes, people.

55
00:05:41,470 --> 00:06:03,180
I think you should you know, I think it should be my my my view is only that, you know, it's been a $27 billion at home with all the 5 billion.

56
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,540
And as I said, there's no reports of infection.

57
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:14,750
And he said, no, no, no, no, I'm not going to be like, I can't.

58
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:25,960
Oh, yeah. I mean, like I'm going to I mean, I feel like I another know they're doing it's the last mile basketball.

59
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:30,410
Yeah. There you go. And then there's like I'm going to my hair.

60
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:35,530
Right, this one. So my.

61
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:46,260
I really do think it's a good thing and I will go through it.

62
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:58,170
Yeah. People, you know, it's not like they don't like they don't really get physical, you know.

63
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:18,080
Yeah, I confess sometimes, but occasionally because people would probably say like that, like sometimes like you could experience depending on their.

64
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,830
I wouldn't say. I mean, I think it's kind of like trial and error and I don't I don't know.

65
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:44,160
I think that in my mind that there's a way that I think this nation is going to be interested in what's on the news.

66
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:51,290
I guess I'm like, What are we waiting for?

67
00:07:51,310 --> 00:08:01,360
We're looking for peace that are in place. I think that doesn't mean we actually have to be crazy.

68
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:06,609
Have you thought about it? I mean, I think in the primary, yeah, I know.

69
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:11,830
We're so far more than seems like there is like.

70
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:17,770
Yeah, that's like yeah, like, just like a more severe version.

71
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,950
So yeah, yeah, yeah.

72
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:35,240
Like when I started, it seems like the time they probably have something going on that allows them to know that I'm like, you know, I like,

73
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:50,280
you know, like, like, you know, medication and repeat the diagnosis or solution like and a lot of money down and all the other things that.

74
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,179
In her. Like planning and planning.

75
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:03,980
There's nothing that you have anymore than that, like.

76
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:08,030
Yeah, right.

77
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:22,690
I like this conversation is animated. Well, here's your chance to inform the 2021, 2022 and 2024 version of this injury prevention class.

78
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:32,709
How did you manage to do it? Yeah, I got 15, 15 precious weeks that these like 14 precious injury prevention topics, the transfer of energy.

79
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:36,120
That was part of our definition of what injury is. Does mental health?

80
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,760
Does does it get. One of my important weeks? Why or why not?

81
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,360
Does this. Does this belong here? You tell me, sir.

82
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:49,360
Don't you shake your head. You. I mean, what do you think?

83
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:52,810
Yeah, I think mental health definitely belongs to this class.

84
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:56,610
And there's actually a lot we can do about it because, you know,

85
00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:04,300
family mental health is the foundation of all the underlying conditions, either primary or secondary.

86
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:13,809
And, you know, say, for example, depression, you know, people just need sleep medications and that would cause them to, you know, cost business.

87
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:16,570
And it would fall, especially in the city and the population.

88
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:23,800
And, you know, older population usually experience, you know, some kind of mental health over the course of their life.

89
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:34,330
Either mom lives up or is up on conditions that chronically which will eventually lead to mental health in some form or another,

90
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:41,920
even heart attack will eventually lead to mental health. Well, even us, you know, students, we have mental health issues, stress.

91
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:50,200
Yeah. We also are aware from Dr. Alexander last week that when you have some older populations that might be suffering from depression,

92
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:54,130
underlying cause related to mental health, the medication that they might be taking,

93
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:57,850
there's some links that they're finding between the sorts of educate medication that

94
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:02,300
they may be taking in this fall clinics and that risk prevalence going up or down.

95
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:09,850
All right. So here we have a connection, maybe not a direct connection, but an indirect connection through fall risk based on on mental health.

96
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:13,250
Okay, what else on the air there?

97
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:16,730
Um, I'll start by saying I agree that it does, but I think devil's advocate.

98
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:19,780
Oh, man, where does this because this is the.

99
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:30,669
So then the question I propose is we know that mental health is this know of most injuries, if not all, then why do we have injury prevention?

100
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:38,230
And I just focus on mental health. So yeah, because not all injuries are related to mental health,

101
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:47,770
like a concussion doesn't necessarily occur because you might have a mental a mental health, disease or condition.

102
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:54,010
You can get a concussion because on the football field, that doesn't mean you're on the football team that you have.

103
00:11:54,280 --> 00:12:00,879
I guess I would say I think like mental health conditions are like disability and that it is possible for

104
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:09,040
anyone to develop and or some sort of temporary event like it's not necessary to have like to have any.

105
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:17,010
No. Okay. No more responding.

106
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:24,500
I wanted to say it like it's it's very hard to screen for mental health and people may not be honest sometimes.

107
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:37,040
So you may not be able to prevent injury by trying to target mental health because it's hard to even deal with mental health in the first place.

108
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:42,120
Okay. So then this is a couple of kind of competing thoughts up in the air.

109
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:46,250
One is that there could be connections between mental health and different forms of injury.

110
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:50,270
Sierra's point is that you can't necessarily say that all injury is going to have

111
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:54,020
some either foundational relationship or causal relationship to mental health.

112
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:59,770
No, my point is well, and we're not even sure that we can detect it in many cases anyway.

113
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:05,060
So does that have implications for prevention or even for the connection between mental health and injury?

114
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:11,000
Yeah, I'm responding to Darryl like that. It's it will be harsh to troops mental health.

115
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:18,470
So the at the end of the day, we can really trying to treat mental health for a lot of people.

116
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:23,959
Okay. So we can just like focus on things that we can see then I don't know what kind of obvious.

117
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:28,900
So we can't really try to go to the root because it's really lights people.

118
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:32,120
Yes. Okay. Okay. Michaela, Adam? Yeah. I think,

119
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:38,900
like all the conversation has been about like how mental health can connect to like other types of injury that they've talked about in the past,

120
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:43,970
that there's like a whole spectrum of injuries that are, like, unique to mental health.

121
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,590
Mm hmm. Like today. I mean, some of the information about, like, suicide, for example.

122
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:55,400
But there's all sort of like self-harm injury media that are, like, unique for people who are struggling with mental health.

123
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:59,160
So I think that's also a piece of it. Okay. Let's leave here.

124
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:04,220
You know, I was just going to know is doing it.

125
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:13,070
But like, are you saying that we should respond to what we see first and then we can use that as a foundation to help with the mental health?

126
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,760
Or like, that's what I was like.

127
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:25,370
Are you saying that we should focus on for we can see when and then we use that as a starting point to build a mental health.

128
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,790
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think that's a good starting point.

129
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:36,649
But also I try to really improve the screening processes and also just remove the stigma around mental

130
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:41,080
health because sometimes people are not going to be open about that because there's a lot of stigma.

131
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:44,600
So I think that's there's a lot of like branches to the problem.

132
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:53,900
So like first try to see with the obvious cases and let's try to go back and then also like remove the stigma and try to reach just said all the time.

133
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:58,550
Yeah, let's hear I have a question.

134
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:04,640
So like a lot of people like, for example, like PTSD.

135
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:11,360
If so, if people have family, it's like if a parent has PTSD, there may be things that they do.

136
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:21,170
And then that could like I'm thinking about like, what if parents experience abuse and abuse as often as they go and it's hard to break.

137
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:28,129
Does that relate to us? Because it could it like a parent who like if a parent was abused as a child and

138
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:32,060
they abuse their child and there could be something for them as prevention,

139
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:36,570
social or primarily, is that related to this with mental health?

140
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:40,440
Because that could be that could lead to PTSD.

141
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:48,020
For some people, it's like a cycle. Yeah. I'm wondering, does that and what you're talking about makes me think of aces?

142
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,650
Well, I mean, you know, I'm sorry.

143
00:15:52,650 --> 00:16:00,650
And I guess for you guys, I mean, when that came out, I don't know if you've seen this article like five, ten years ago, this and,

144
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:06,139
you know, this was the most important public health study that nobody knew about at the time that it came out so private.

145
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,010
You guys know about this,

146
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:14,959
but really what you're talking about is that adverse childhood experiences are transmitted intergenerationally rather than be managed.

147
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:22,460
Defense mechanisms that might be parenting might be morally right about the fact that we think psychopathology.

148
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:29,510
Few parents are turning out. Okay, so. So does mental health.

149
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:34,610
Well, if you flipped it to instead of mental health as a cause, a consequence of venture.

150
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:37,040
Right. So you can think about injuries that might happen.

151
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:40,940
So when we do think about some of the trauma that's experienced by those who have had an injury,

152
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:44,180
whether from car accidents or gun violence or whatever else it could be,

153
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:49,730
and how that might play into someone's mental wellness and has some of the same ramifications,

154
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:58,550
reap repercussions that physical injury can have in terms of expense, in terms of your functioning, your quality of life.

155
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:06,600
You know, I guess we've talked about I think of two points. I have one and then a question I guess related to that would.

156
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:14,630
So like, for example, there are some mental health conditions that cause people.

157
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,730
That's increase the likelihood of someone becoming violent.

158
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:24,080
And then like, I don't know, I guess not to themselves but other people.

159
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:37,099
And I think that for me relates to that. I'm thinking and then my second question, my question is then how would how would you classify it?

160
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:42,140
Because I think people are now moving towards eating disorders being a mental health condition.

161
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:49,730
Would that be injury like self inflicted injury unintentional?

162
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:59,130
It could be a form of injury to people eating disorders like um, I guess it could be a consequence of mental health issue, right?

163
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:06,080
Mm hmm. Okay, listen, before I tend to agree with the address, and some people just don't eat at all.

164
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:10,730
Yeah, I just want to counter the narrative that mental health makes people more aggressive.

165
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:17,000
I don't think there's strong evidence to support that, so I don't want that to be like kind of predominant narrative.

166
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:20,450
I think that that kind of factual should be mentioned.

167
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:28,790
I think that is something that that's happening in discourse in our society and has been for a long time that there are several folks who are,

168
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,410
you know, working on this issue.

169
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:39,070
And, you know, the incidence of violent behavior as that relates to some sort of diagnosable mental health condition is extremely low.

170
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:42,950
Does it happen when it happens and you get a lot of press?

171
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:51,800
Yes, but the but the the relationship between violence and mental health that overlap in in that diagram, that's a really cool place of the high.

172
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:58,180
John, how do we deal with, like, road rage incidents?

173
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:05,500
Like, what is that? One thing I think is interesting that you guys are talking about is like, what is mental health?

174
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:09,820
You know, I mean, like, what do we mean by those? Are you talking about a diagnosed psychopathology?

175
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:17,620
Right. Like someone comes in and they met DSM criteria for PTSD or depression or ADHD or schizophrenia or whatever.

176
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:25,540
So like, there's that, right? Then there's also, you know, so that's maybe 20% of the population right there would meet criteria for something.

177
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:30,520
Then there's like a whole nother section of the population that's walking around with

178
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:35,710
some things that aren't working so well for them and someone else has some subclinical.

179
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:41,190
Do you have symptoms of depression? Do you have symptoms of PTSD that maybe don't meet that threshold?

180
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,680
Maybe they're just very lacking in the world who aren't doing so well.

181
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:49,120
And so I think when we're like, you know, what are we talking about here?

182
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:53,880
And I think what some folks are talking about is just people being disregulated,

183
00:19:54,520 --> 00:20:02,680
people not having acquired the life skills of emotion regulation affect regulation, how to manage their anger when somebody cut them off in traffic.

184
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:07,000
Right. And all of that exists on a spectrum.

185
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:14,170
But, you know, your comment over here about like, how would we screen for mental health so we could promote, you know, injury prevention?

186
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:22,780
You know, I think another question is what should we be doing in society to promote mental wellness and all the people at the beginning?

187
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:27,040
Right. And what might that do to prevention in general?

188
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:34,900
I saw Alexis hand an the and I was beginning to look at school shootings.

189
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:39,400
So, like, when they're they go in and they automatically. Oh.

190
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:43,389
Well, do you see that?

191
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:46,510
You'll be more than just like. How does that.

192
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:55,980
But they're not always just are they diagnosed from society or are they actually diagnosed like in the hospital that they had.

193
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:05,710
Like from a help and then they had your passion and some of them have issues and I just it's a career that I deal with quite often.

194
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:09,149
It's how could this happen if if mental health wasn't involved in some way,

195
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:13,560
shape or because I was so quick to jump to the what they had is they had the emergency.

196
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:19,470
Did they have are you just me and there's did they and were they receiving care.

197
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:25,110
Yeah. Did somebody know whatever. Right. Were they do they have access to care of somebody helping them with that?

198
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:29,399
These are all major issues that we're dealing with. Right. We were just saying, you know,

199
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:35,010
it's probably like 20% of the population of kids as before covered under 18 in the US

200
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:39,030
that were meeting criteria would have met criteria for a mental health condition.

201
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:43,380
But, you know, only like 30% of those kids are receiving any kind of specialty care.

202
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:52,830
Right. So we have a lot to do in society in terms of, you know, getting people the help that they need to really think about.

203
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:57,360
Coming back to my original protection, that going to people's responses,

204
00:21:57,930 --> 00:22:05,130
we're blending the two so we don't really have a thorough understanding of injury prevention or mental health, which is.

205
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:14,630
Something to find out, at least from what I'm hearing, how people are describing their lives.

206
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:21,380
I received an eyewitness account,

207
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:37,250
so it can be a different sort of narrative from here that I think the other folks that we haven't heard from now on the same topic kind of sort of I

208
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:47,180
just wrote my paper on like firearm injury prevention and since like the majority of firearm deaths are from suicide and also the counter-narrative of

209
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:56,989
what I kind of found when I was looking at organizations like the NRA that kind of want to like push that this is like a mental health probably more

210
00:22:56,990 --> 00:23:01,340
regulations on like people are not allowing people who have mental health

211
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:06,410
histories to acquire guns rather than dealing with the fact that they have all.

212
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:14,450
And also like, again, like kind of demonizing, like people who have no job like that,

213
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:17,840
they might like be violent or something or is offering a very, very small portion.

214
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:24,979
So I really just kind of like the comment that I guess conveniently forgetting

215
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:29,360
that firearms are just a particularly effective method for completing suicide.

216
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:39,920
But there are differences in the choice of method in terms of how do have folks contemplate or actualize what I'm thinking about.

217
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:49,059
It's not easy to measure. I don't think I'm thinking about those things where you can hurt others, but that's not by being violent.

218
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:52,060
Like, for example, you know, postpartum depression.

219
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:57,430
You're like, it's not exactly like you're hurting your friend, but maybe you're not responding to their needs.

220
00:23:57,430 --> 00:24:04,299
And that needs to be. Child abuse and neglect was one of our topics.

221
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:07,540
And as I would not neglect in the way that we're thinking like intentionally.

222
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:10,570
Right. But I realize you're kind of speaking to another connection.

223
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:18,610
I'm wondering about how like reactionary their kind of like health care is for health services and that.

224
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:22,570
Andrew It's injury prevention, mental health.

225
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:29,220
I would like to think that could be prevented and should it be prevented because when you say it shouldn't,

226
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:32,800
it shouldn't exist or it needs to like not happen.

227
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:39,520
Like, it's one thing that a suicide should happen. But to say depressed people with depression shouldn't exist or they shouldn't have it.

228
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:43,660
That like, again, it makes it like, oh, that's really bad.

229
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:48,820
It's like how people talk about autism. It's not bad to be autistic.

230
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:55,570
Like, I think what like the care because screening is so difficult and it is a difficult discussion,

231
00:24:56,140 --> 00:25:02,680
but like if the drug has a way that it was normal, that it would change the discussion on it and not a stigma.

232
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:07,719
Well, if there's a normalization and then like the like the health that the health services that

233
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:12,790
could be provided aren't there like as a Band-Aid or like as a cane or like a wheelchair,

234
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:19,040
it's actually designed to help the person and not like something that could possibly cause that harm later on.

235
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:23,530
Like some medications could be interacting with other medications that person could be using,

236
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:27,250
or just in general what that person is able to have access to.

237
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,230
Does that make sense?

238
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:38,430
So my second question is, is screening actually difficult or are we afraid the label that screening will give us no screening as.

239
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:41,129
One of my friends is a social worker.

240
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:51,470
And so what they often have when there's when they have to screen patients and with the DSM five first off like how different patients are going to be

241
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:56,310
sleeping separately like depending on like your cultural background or based

242
00:25:56,310 --> 00:26:01,580
upon what you identify or what you think of what it is that you don't have,

243
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:05,940
what your experiences are going to be, rather than having somebody else who knew that had that not right.

244
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:13,530
And like, not like when you see one case of a lot, you've only seen one.

245
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:16,740
You know, two cases are exactly the same.

246
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:23,150
And if they were, you need a writer, you need to write a paper on it, and they present it because it's impossible.

247
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:27,150
Like, I don't know. But nothing is, like, identical.

248
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:33,960
Yeah. And the DSM five is often criticized by people who work in that field, because that's what it's going to be.

249
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:37,830
Nothing. Yeah, it's. Yeah, it's constantly needing to be updated.

250
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:44,399
It's not always accurate for everyone because somebody could have, like, one thing, but the one you don't need like four of the five.

251
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:52,500
So you definitely don't. And it's like, well, you have three, but it's not as bad as one in different communities, like I a minority.

252
00:26:52,890 --> 00:27:01,350
But I mean maybe like just because like different screenings like we're saying that they probably doubled let a possible overlap.

253
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,510
So there could be some overlap but they're not going to be like a bad guideline.

254
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:11,370
Yeah, I know. I'm just saying that it's good to know that in some communities we don't have that.

255
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:14,849
But when it comes to screenings, how we view mental health and mental health,

256
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:21,000
how we view getting help, you know, getting the resources and do we have access to those resources?

257
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:30,520
Yeah, it's yeah, I think, you know, so big problem in screening, particularly in communities that no, they don't have access to resources.

258
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:36,090
Right. Because why would they tell someone that they're having a problem when they know they're not going to get help or afterwards?

259
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,200
And it's also, I think,

260
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:43,650
really hard for the people doing the screening to want to do a screening in a community where they can refer anyone to something,

261
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:53,070
or if they do something, they want to make further traumatization for that person because it like it have to be their attitude, you know,

262
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:59,550
I guess related to screening, I was thinking that I think someone mentioned that the D as something has ended.

263
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,350
Yeah. Hasn't hasn't been updated and like I don't know,

264
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:14,190
I feel like some communities I'm thinking like African immigrant communities and like black communities like immigrant communities,

265
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:17,700
it's how people express things is very different.

266
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:26,459
So like if you're like going to write or ask someone how they're going to understand, then they want as a question the right way.

267
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:31,050
So like you won't even catch any problem, even though they were trying to tell you that was a problem in the first place.

268
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:34,570
So. But you're not speaking the same language, right? Yeah.

269
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:41,430
Right. So like you have to you know how people use a language because yeah, we use language is different for you.

270
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:46,570
Like I know I learned British English and I'm always almost always confused.

271
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:51,899
So if someone is like asking something in a mental health setting, then it becomes really hard.

272
00:28:51,900 --> 00:29:03,830
Because how I learned is very different from American, you know, most poor, I think also so in Alaska Native population,

273
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:11,520
the research project that I there's such like a baseline level of trauma that exists then

274
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:16,770
people are like this is just like this just happened today and like it was part of my day.

275
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,979
Like they go home, like I, they just tell people as part of their day.

276
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:26,010
It's not like it's not registering as like a new traumatic event to them in a way it might for

277
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:30,870
someone who's not part of that community and doesn't have that same like historical drama,

278
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:38,159
but also just because of historical trauma and historical housing, there's so much that can happen in their communities.

279
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,840
Like my contemporaries, I didn't do that.

280
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:47,820
It's just constantly things happening that I think are beginning people in mental health and are actually considered traumatic events.

281
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:56,219
If you looked at a definition of a traumatic event, but it's just like so naturalized that it's it it doesn't register that way.

282
00:29:56,220 --> 00:30:00,670
And so if you're putting that down as a question, like no one's going to like is this, you know,

283
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:08,930
already experiencing that a traumatic event or something like that, they're probably going to be like, no, we're going to talk about this later.

284
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:13,319
Do you see some of the challenges of what it means to try to screen who has access to screenings and how it's done?

285
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:19,050
But listen, I guess my last thing is so we know why screening is difficult.

286
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:25,470
Like we know some of the complications with it, but yet we're fully focused on prevention and that mental health.

287
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:32,990
You can take. But then. I want you to elaborate.

288
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:36,820
Yeah, I think so.

289
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:42,920
So, I mean, I'm pretty sure there are experts that are dedicated to working on the screen aspect, that aspect of it.

290
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:47,480
But yet we're in class. We're asking, does mental health fit in injury prevention?

291
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:52,219
Right. That's the question. And as I said earlier in my statement,

292
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:58,580
we've lended to but we're focused on the behaviors that we can prevent from the

293
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:04,810
individual right and the understanding of the mental health that contributes to the news.

294
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:06,200
Does that make sense?

295
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:17,120
So then I'm asking what the next kind of back to this question is mental health just a set of behaviors and this of mental health as much of behavior?

296
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:22,190
It's like your internal experience, your thinking is what injury prevention?

297
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:25,920
What is it like in the field of intervention?

298
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:31,130
You know, I mean, it could be the consequences of mental health.

299
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:45,350
So that's one aspect of this. And I was thinking like the for example, the question about how if we know that there's a problem with screening,

300
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:47,780
why are we not just like focusing on something that you separate?

301
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:52,150
I think as an outsider looking at US health care, the public health is very underfunded.

302
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:57,560
It's like, no, as long as it doesn't give you money in the US, like people are not putting in money into it.

303
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:05,239
So that's why you have public health interventions not working because we are not funded

304
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:11,569
properly and then you end up end up not end up having them not work not being done,

305
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:13,459
thankfully appropriately.

306
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:22,690
So I think it's I think people see the problem now because we have diversity of thoughts and ideas and more people have, for example,

307
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:28,459
video something something people have been talking about this and how they it doesn't really take into account for example,

308
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:32,750
for black people like racism and doesn't take into account racism.

309
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:36,680
So people know those and those things exist, right?

310
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:41,270
But they just don't have the money to really, you know, navigate the system.

311
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:45,020
Yeah. I think that's what makes a.

312
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:52,560
One is worth 2 to 1 to one person accountable or accountable for one thing.

313
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:56,620
Think of the words like everyone would just like for the other person.

314
00:32:57,590 --> 00:33:00,930
All right. So on this, this should be like.

315
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:08,930
Like it's a thing, but it's the danger of the mental health narrative is an individually focused model,

316
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:14,360
and it's taken mental health a really long time to understand what are the social determinants of health?

317
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:21,500
How did you do? You know, what are the things that happened to you in your life and in your society that are contributing to your lack of wellbeing?

318
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:25,099
So it's I mean, certainly we're going to talk about suicide today.

319
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:28,700
And, you know, I've been working in this field for two decades.

320
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:36,080
We are just trying to, you know, starting to get people to understand that a public health approach is weird, that, you know,

321
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:42,049
we cannot solve this problem by continuing to pull individual people out of the river, you know, and really working.

322
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:51,440
And that medical model is sickness, but it has been the domain of mental health for, you know, many, many, many years.

323
00:33:51,440 --> 00:34:03,690
And that's. Now we're all going to take them to the next generation.

324
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:08,390
There you go. So I just had a question.

325
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:12,840
So screening is a big measurable challenge,

326
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:19,860
but in a different like sitting with in public like without a public health concern is like how the BMI is used.

327
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:28,829
And just like the DSM five, which is just a like psychiatrist used to diagnose people more or less just like that.

328
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:36,149
The BMI was only like I believe it was only made using a very small population.

329
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:39,270
It's not a representative sample population. And the same with like.

330
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:47,489
Yes, and five. It's it doesn't have like it's not like, oh, we talked to like 10,000 patients who are who are black.

331
00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:51,900
We talked to 2000 patients who are spending we talked to 2000 patients who are Pacific Islander.

332
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:57,680
You don't have that representation. I think like by definition to me and I could be wrong.

333
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:03,350
I don't think like measurements like the BMI or the data are good because they're not representative.

334
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:07,889
Why would you use something that is like not not like comparable?

335
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:15,510
It's like measuring water, but with a ruler, it's like that's not water is a volume, not a weight is it feels like that.

336
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:23,190
It feels like that's like mental health kind of. This is what we keep trying to do it like this because for a long time in like medicine,

337
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:28,410
it's been like, well, we can this is like it seems like like we describe it like a behavior.

338
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:34,450
So we keep like thinking about it like that. But we also are aware of like the internal powers we have.

339
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:41,250
Like it's all inside of me keep like trying to be like, okay, you're going to defend your profession.

340
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:44,069
No. Oh, my. Not actually going to mention that.

341
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:51,240
Like with action in the whole area, mental health is based on like a lot of these ideas of like how we define certain diseases,

342
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:54,870
like get the brand name out of them and there's like great books on it.

343
00:35:54,870 --> 00:36:02,250
The process that goes, This is fantastic. If you'd like to learn about like how messed up the DSM in like how is derived from like

344
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:07,379
like we talk about like history on that that's all from like how we have oppressed

345
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:15,450
women and I was like really to politicize a way to like to basically oppress black

346
00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:19,740
men and it's like really messed up and so like that's all still present the DSM.

347
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:28,290
And so I just wanted to speak to your point and make that see that title the protest psychosis.

348
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:34,800
Protest psychosis. Yes, it's time for next year.

349
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:44,390
Yeah. All right. Well, you know, I wasn't sure exactly where this conversation would go, but I kept going, which is wonderful.

350
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:52,140
So I think in 2024, this probably does need to stay in this class and if anything perhaps needs to be integrated in more,

351
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,059
more weeks one way or the other.

352
00:36:54,060 --> 00:37:00,110
And we're going to take a fairly least I'm going to take a fairly narrow review of mental health, at least in this case as well.

353
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:06,360
When I think directly around injury and related to mental health, oftentimes we do move into to suicide self-harm.

354
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:18,299
So I'm going to just I'll probably breezed through this because city has newer data than I do from it, but it's it's good to have it the most updated.

355
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:21,209
So I think a lot of this is pre-COVID, which is really interesting.

356
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:27,960
And actually I think a lot of the current data that we can get from the national reporting systems might still be a couple of years lag.

357
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,330
So we might still be talking 20, 19, 2020.

358
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:38,700
But depending on kind of how we're categorizing thing, I think the biggest issue that I would want to point out is that it's not just a youth problem.

359
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:43,200
It's not a middle aged problem. It's not an older adult problem. It's kind of a life span problem.

360
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:52,080
And we've kind of see it throughout. There are these kind of big spike areas that at least I think folks in injury prevention are attending to.

361
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:58,530
You can see kind of right around adolescence. I'll be curious to see over the over the coming years whether or not some of these things shift.

362
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,250
So these are just kind of your rote numbers versus kind of accrued rates.

363
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:07,110
So you can kind of see something hidden by just a fewer number.

364
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:10,470
Doesn't necessarily mean that the prevalence is following in suit.

365
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:18,210
So yeah, this is some of that older data. Just looking at some trends relative to homicides.

366
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:28,170
Suicide is one of those things that we do start to look at some of those group differences when we're talking sex, race, location, country, region.

367
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:37,049
I can kind of start to see some of these differences to potentially opportunities for intervention, male suicides by race.

368
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:40,050
So kind of the intersection of I'm sorry, I don't know if you can really see those.

369
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:47,639
They're white so white living in Alaska Native.

370
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:53,940
These are all kind of CDC data. Hispanic, black, Asian, Pacific Islander.

371
00:38:54,850 --> 00:39:04,300
And then the age groups are really young and kind of 5 to 9, 15 to 19, 25 to 29, 45 and 49.

372
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:08,260
So we're kind of going up by decades here. And you can see some of these different spikes.

373
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:15,010
Anything in particular, you start to notice some of these differences. So these are your American-Indian, Alaska native, this kind of decrease.

374
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:20,140
I'm colorblind. So what is this? Asian Pacific Islander? Yeah. No, no, no.

375
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:23,500
This is white. This is white. Oh, the white woman was white.

376
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:27,940
Whatever color that is is white. Her color, that is.

377
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:34,150
Is Asian Pacific Islander. Sorry for the gray hairstyle for females.

378
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:38,320
Mm hmm. So you can see that. I mean, there's going to be a main effect for male.

379
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,660
Female, right? There are much higher rates for males.

380
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:47,739
But in here, just the differences in some of the and these are on the actual side you're in are up on canvas.

381
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:52,600
So you can actually see some of these things. Sorry about the the legends here not being visible.

382
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:58,690
But again, so white. Native American. Hispanic.

383
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:04,950
Black, Asian. Pacific Islander. All right.

384
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:08,860
So we've talked about some of these things in the past. So, for example,

385
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:14,620
one of the ways that the Institute for Firearm Injury Prevention is trying to make a case for why there

386
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:19,750
needs to be more of a focus on firearms is to show juxtapose it with other forms of injury traffic.

387
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:27,310
Traffic deaths have been kind of a benchmark in which a lot of other injury is is juxtaposed against.

388
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:30,880
Look at the burden that we have from traffic leading cause of death.

389
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:35,319
But we're starting to see traffic start to emerge back. And I don't think it's a regression to the mean.

390
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:42,070
I think in many cases it's seeing an uptick in other forms of injury and mortality that are starting to emerge with the traffic deaths.

391
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:51,729
And again, I'm really sorry about these. So this is suicide traffic and homicide traffic is a huge no, no, no.

392
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:55,490
Like tragic for those of us in motor vehicle crashes, right?

393
00:40:55,750 --> 00:41:01,420
Yeah. And we saw that we saw those lines converging and actually surpassing with firearms here a little bit early on the semester.

394
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:05,710
This is way down here is like 2000. This is 2015.

395
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:15,700
Prevalence of youth suicide. And I can speak a little bit to some of this data.

396
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:18,370
We're seeing this within our our healthy minds data, too.

397
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:29,090
And I think one of the big questions that I get asked is whether or not COVID has been resulting in a big spike of depression or suicidal ideation.

398
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,040
And right about this time, you're not going to sit there.

399
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:35,480
You're going to see within this graph, and I'm hoping soon is maybe does this line just keeps on going?

400
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:44,120
So we're seeing higher rates of depression, we're seeing higher rates of suicide ideation, even planning that kind of continues up through 2022.

401
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:48,020
So all of our data suggests that this was something that it began before COVID.

402
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,360
It's probably going to get exacerbated by COVID.

403
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:56,120
It's potentially something that's going to make connection to services and treatment even more difficult because of COVID.

404
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:00,620
But the this was something that began before the pandemic.

405
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:05,209
So to to think about this as something that's just a recent problem that's going

406
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:09,740
to go away or this was a blip in the in the numbers is probably not accurate.

407
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:21,680
So these are 10 to 14 year olds is just awful. And you have to text this there's this is 15 and 18 year olds, 2000 all the way up to 2015.

408
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:28,310
Age adjusted rates. This is the methods of suicide. Now, this actually is recent data.

409
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,079
And again, I think it's it's it's interesting to look at some of these intersections.

410
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:35,880
So we're going to see a main effect by race, right?

411
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:41,900
So across all these different categories, you would see white participants or white individuals at higher rates.

412
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:46,170
But then across these different methods, you can start to see some of these differences.

413
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:49,550
Yeah. So yesterday in bioscience, I'm final one.

414
00:42:49,820 --> 00:43:00,350
Yes. So we were talking about we were given a set of data from state firearm ownership, male analysis on suicides.

415
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:04,580
And we came across this website called Prevent Firearm.

416
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:09,010
Suicide got into the death and it shows it's cool.

417
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:13,990
I think you've got it's a lot of colors, very similar color.

418
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:21,770
Okay. And so this is sort of this is another 19 and it's males and it's up in several states.

419
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:25,610
I think it's Johns Hopkins. Oh, gotcha. Okay.

420
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:30,410
So this is males and then like different colors.

421
00:43:30,410 --> 00:43:36,790
We like different racial groups, but then like down below, you also have female and it's just it's different.

422
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:46,070
And so we want to take a look at what it that it to me I was brought up about um during the break your music and you sing it.

423
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:49,580
Yeah, yeah yeah. You I was up.

424
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:54,150
I'm just like suffocation hanging there. Yeah.

425
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:58,430
Discrimination. Yeah, hanging. Yeah.

426
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:02,840
Are these the three mysticism? I'm sorry.

427
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:07,140
I was like, the three leading causes of the word breathing. Yeah.

428
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:13,580
It's interesting how you base because there's so this is national data.

429
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:19,700
And so like one of the things we've been thinking a lot about is like at the local level, from a clinical standpoint,

430
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:26,900
how important it is to know your local data because it really informs the kind of prevention measures you're doing in a clinical setting with kids.

431
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:29,390
So for example, I do a lot of training for clinicians here.

432
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:35,149
And out of any of you who've lived here for a while now that we have a real problem in Ann Arbor with people also,

433
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:37,850
that is not something that you see nationally.

434
00:44:37,850 --> 00:44:45,170
It's like a leading means of suicide, but it's something that has been really we're ready to kind of in here in Ann Arbor.

435
00:44:45,530 --> 00:44:51,649
And so for me, it's like such a success story of knowing your data and having that drive your prevention behaviors.

436
00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:56,840
So if you kind of walk around with them, you know, you go into like the Liberty Square parking lot.

437
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:01,730
Please note as that there have been there's fencing that's been around out there.

438
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:05,510
There's postings, you know, the new prevention they have.

439
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:11,510
Here's the number for cabs. Here's a psychiatric emergency service that was all funded by the city of Ann Arbor,

440
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:15,860
because we were looking at our data and really seeing that there was a concern.

441
00:45:15,890 --> 00:45:20,360
Now the University of Michigan is now pulling out for that kind of expensive barriers.

442
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:27,080
So if anybody wants to work on that, please do. But, you know, it's just it's important to know your data.

443
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:36,979
So what could be the reason why, you know, modeling and contagion?

444
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:41,410
And that is a really powerful phenomenon with suicide prevention.

445
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:49,250
And we just know that, you know, once I mean, a lot of the kids who've died in a number in that manner,

446
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:52,650
you know, it seemed they were high school students here.

447
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:56,450
They had a lot of friends with like that behavior that put something on the table for other kids.

448
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:01,400
And and so it's just I know that it's really important.

449
00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:07,010
Yeah. And so you think like locally it'll be different.

450
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:13,879
These these three leaders, the ability, for example, you know, in our rural communities,

451
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:18,800
we are seeing very concerning, very high and growing rates of firearm related suicides.

452
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:23,510
Right. You're going to see that more than you'll ever see necessarily in an urban area.

453
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:28,400
Some of it depends on the population and access to firearms.

454
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:33,430
The phenomenon that you just mentioned, contagion.

455
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:41,610
Contagion. So there's been conversation around the reporting of school shootings or incidents and that is one of sort.

456
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:47,810
So is that I see it as something that should be done to promote conversation.

457
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:53,390
Yeah. Yeah. Please, if you're interested in this issue, please Google safe and effective messaging.

458
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:57,500
So this has been part of the public health approach to suicide prevention, right.

459
00:46:57,530 --> 00:47:01,070
Is knowing that what do we need to do in a systems level to take better care of people?

460
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:06,469
We're actually funded by our Michigan CDC grant. Actually, in the next couple of months,

461
00:47:06,470 --> 00:47:13,400
our communications department and the HHS is doing a training for kids who are in journalism school here in the state of Michigan and folks who

462
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:23,710
work in the media about how to report about this in a way that does not increase the chances that you are going to contribute to contagion.

463
00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:26,600
So we know what that looks like.

464
00:47:26,870 --> 00:47:32,360
It's don't talk about the how, you know, we could talk about the how in here because you're talking about allocating prevention resources.

465
00:47:33,470 --> 00:47:38,360
But, you know, in a in a newspaper article, we're not going to talk about how that happened.

466
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:43,760
We really need to focus on messages of hope, getting the lifeline number out to people.

467
00:47:43,970 --> 00:47:50,600
You know, really, you know, there's a whole list of sort of do's and don'ts that we want to be sure that we're

468
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:55,940
ascribing to and any sort of awareness campaigns we're doing more coverage of.

469
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:06,510
The safe and effective messaging figures from the Suicide Prevention Resource Center or the National Anthem Action Alliance.

470
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:15,290
Since he's gone back in 2024 to see her son.

471
00:48:15,410 --> 00:48:20,240
Suicidal thoughts. Know all these numbers are really difficult to see.

472
00:48:21,650 --> 00:48:28,580
So I'm all right. Get, get, get. You got it. I did want to I just notes on some of the intersections and again,

473
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:32,930
making some of those connections to some of the other the other topics that we've talked about in this class,

474
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:35,879
noting that for whom we mentioned earlier,

475
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:44,060
originally you were talking about that one of the leading causes or leading ways that people are dying by firearms is through suicide.

476
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:49,550
All right. So you're you're not going to be able to disentangle these these different areas of injury prevention.

477
00:48:50,210 --> 00:48:54,650
Another one, this is suicide rates and location.

478
00:48:54,920 --> 00:49:00,920
So where are these happenings? And you mentioned earlier rural versus more urban context and again,

479
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:06,650
seeing a main effect for females versus males, but then also uncertainty certainly with males.

480
00:49:06,830 --> 00:49:11,270
As you move into more rural spaces, I'm seeing this becoming a greater and greater issue.

481
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:17,990
All right. So we are now at for about 55 minutes.

482
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:19,339
Why don't we take a break?

483
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:32,479
Because I'm going to let folks who want to know in my mind there is all this really take over and then we can just be I mean,

484
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:38,330
I think some of the other the risk factors are things we've talked about and might be touched on anyways.

485
00:49:38,510 --> 00:49:44,030
They're going to be there. We can return to them, but let's take about 10 minutes and then we'll come back.

486
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:48,169
We're going to hear from Cindy. Were going to see some of the some additional data as well as think about some

487
00:49:48,170 --> 00:49:51,070
more intentionally about some of the interventions that might be happening here.

488
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:56,479
So we'll look forward to seeing you're about 1235 that it's gone comments.

489
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:01,960
Just really good. I know we're all Stan let's go take it up right now.

490
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:18,780
We'll see about 12 oh oh something back. What happened is that in his teaching, philanthropy ran an ad for breakfast being here.

491
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:21,890
So is this true?

492
00:50:25,203 --> 00:50:30,002
Yes. I was like, yeah, know, you can't do be like I know us in the younger age and older age.

493
00:50:30,003 --> 00:50:34,623
And I was like, no, I'm just to down the family.

494
00:50:35,463 --> 00:50:43,353
So folks there this is my understanding is that this is good data that was an engineer which was fine,

495
00:50:44,043 --> 00:50:48,873
brought up in a biostatistics class, which is great. So we see three variables interacting here.

496
00:50:48,873 --> 00:50:52,472
What are the variables? Age?

497
00:50:52,473 --> 00:50:56,132
Yes, I guess we could say race.

498
00:50:56,133 --> 00:50:59,373
Yeah. Gender, yes. Or just physics. Right.

499
00:51:00,153 --> 00:51:05,043
What's the let's see here. Do we see main effects for race?

500
00:51:06,453 --> 00:51:10,923
How do I know this is stat? So I get to I get to ask these questions.

501
00:51:12,313 --> 00:51:19,503
You see what I mean? Effect for race. What is it or how do you know what is mainly the jargon.

502
00:51:19,983 --> 00:51:23,373
Yeah. The that's class. Oh come on.

503
00:51:23,553 --> 00:51:26,643
The average effect. So the average effect for race. Do we see race differences.

504
00:51:26,673 --> 00:51:29,823
Oh yeah. Sorry, I'm sorry.

505
00:51:30,613 --> 00:51:34,263
We the average differences by race and by and for which groups.

506
00:51:34,713 --> 00:51:38,283
White and Asian percentage.

507
00:51:38,823 --> 00:51:44,193
Right. So if we're thinking about this stuff for a kind of a manufacturer and average of fact.

508
00:51:44,193 --> 00:51:47,913
Right. We can't just look at these different groups. Right, because these are by age.

509
00:51:48,123 --> 00:51:51,183
What we're doing is we're kind of taking in our minds, we're taking these three pieces,

510
00:51:51,663 --> 00:51:55,253
all these kind of white columns where summing them together, thinking about what level they might be there.

511
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:59,433
We can take the Asian Pacific Islander kind of sum together and we're going to do work on it.

512
00:51:59,433 --> 00:52:06,423
Excuse me, looking to see across all these ages. And that's the key across all these ages, because we have this broken down,

513
00:52:06,663 --> 00:52:16,623
we are looking at a stratification or an interaction between age and race and race for these rates.

514
00:52:16,983 --> 00:52:23,943
Okay. So our main effect for here, for race would be just in general or when you sum together these whatever columns, what color,

515
00:52:23,943 --> 00:52:32,313
purple, green, blue, white is sun, gather all these and compare them to other groups when you kind to something together.

516
00:52:32,493 --> 00:52:36,333
That's our race. Our race effect. How about our age effect? How we figured that out?

517
00:52:36,993 --> 00:52:45,753
Oh, it's not looking good. What happens is when people get older, the suicide rate increase or go down for males is increasing for a combination.

518
00:52:46,053 --> 00:52:48,093
All right. So good point. Good clarification.

519
00:52:48,093 --> 00:52:53,463
We're actually talking about sorry, from more jargon, conditional mean effects because we've stratified by sex and race.

520
00:52:53,643 --> 00:52:58,052
I'm not trying to be pedantic here. I just want folks to be able to talk about like this and consider this.

521
00:52:58,053 --> 00:53:01,323
When we're explaining this to folks outside this website's available,

522
00:53:01,323 --> 00:53:06,243
people are going to look at this data and say, wow, this is what's happening across these different groups.

523
00:53:06,453 --> 00:53:13,503
But yes, when we kind of take an isolation, we want to average across this age group, average across this age group, average across this age group.

524
00:53:13,713 --> 00:53:19,683
And do we see for males that there is sort of an uptick in these rates or are they still are sort of staying flat?

525
00:53:19,893 --> 00:53:25,503
Is this one bar enough to skew what might be true of at least white participants?

526
00:53:25,503 --> 00:53:31,263
75 and older, but perhaps not for whatever colors is black and Hispanic, Latino.

527
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:38,673
Right. And then similarly, when we look at females, does it look different then?

528
00:53:38,733 --> 00:53:41,433
I have a question about the last slide. Sure.

529
00:53:41,433 --> 00:53:51,392
So I was wondering if it's either the life expectancy for Asian Pacific Islanders is low or they are not.

530
00:53:51,393 --> 00:53:54,903
It's basically, say, for men or it's both.

531
00:53:56,043 --> 00:54:04,983
So the and the I would be because you just don't see people from this group living as long they might have a lower rate of suicide rate.

532
00:54:05,343 --> 00:54:08,403
Yes. So is it like life expectancy or. Yeah.

533
00:54:09,243 --> 00:54:17,253
Oh, my guess is that this is probably I think one of these notes talks about the suppression of data that's below a certain number of individuals.

534
00:54:17,403 --> 00:54:22,653
So if your rate per 100,000 is less than 50 or something like that, it's not going to be reliable.

535
00:54:22,653 --> 00:54:30,783
And so they just don't they just don't report. Same thing with females.

536
00:54:32,023 --> 00:54:36,993
Here we see quite a few suppressed columns as my guests began to look into this date a little bit more.

537
00:54:37,743 --> 00:54:46,983
But yeah, very different trends. Thank you for sharing this. This is the first one that was actually interesting, Stand Your Ground.

538
00:54:47,553 --> 00:54:55,633
There's a cool stuff out there. It's just it's always a more easier well well, we want to be good stewards of data.

539
00:54:55,663 --> 00:54:58,562
We want to be able to talk about data. We want to mislead people with data.

540
00:54:58,563 --> 00:55:04,863
But at the same time, we want to identify when data is being used in a way that can either be manipulative or could be a good obscure picture.

541
00:55:05,553 --> 00:55:09,903
You know, a lot of some of these examples where they can show you like what happens when you cut

542
00:55:09,903 --> 00:55:14,283
out the middle range of your scales and you can make baskets that would normally be,

543
00:55:14,283 --> 00:55:18,573
you know, pretty separate, seem like they're crunched together or exaggerated.

544
00:55:18,873 --> 00:55:23,222
So. Again, bring I mean, what is an MP supposed to do for us?

545
00:55:23,223 --> 00:55:29,913
It's supposed to allow us to think critically about some of the science that's out there so that we can be good translators of that science.

546
00:55:30,573 --> 00:55:36,003
So that's just what struck me, in addition to just some of the trends that are here.

547
00:55:36,003 --> 00:55:39,033
But I will stop lecturing.

548
00:55:39,393 --> 00:55:42,993
That's lecturing and turn it over to Zane. Thank you so much for joining us.

549
00:55:42,993 --> 00:55:47,073
And we're really excited to hear about your intervention. So I'm gonna move to the side and get out of the way.

550
00:55:48,123 --> 00:55:53,593
The little clicker. This makes them happy, right?

551
00:55:54,533 --> 00:55:57,643
Okay, cool. Hi. Hi. How are you?

552
00:55:58,113 --> 00:56:01,413
I said, is that okay? Because if I on that late that.

553
00:56:01,533 --> 00:56:04,803
Okay, can you guys hear me? Okay. All right. Hi.

554
00:56:04,833 --> 00:56:08,763
Thanks for having me. This is so much fun. I haven't time in a long time.

555
00:56:08,763 --> 00:56:16,263
So things I notice. You say that. Let me I think what I want to do, just to start is tell you things a little bit about who I am and what I do.

556
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:20,102
I have a slide deck here. We can stay with it or not stay with it.

557
00:56:20,103 --> 00:56:22,113
Like, really, whatever you guys want to talk about.

558
00:56:22,713 --> 00:56:30,873
I did bring I hope you're interested in hearing a little bit about actually, let me just go to go back to that in a second.

559
00:56:30,963 --> 00:56:33,993
Um, you know, this is kind of what I prepared.

560
00:56:34,233 --> 00:56:41,553
I have some slides that are redundant and we can go pretty quickly through and that are some more surveillance stuff.

561
00:56:41,823 --> 00:56:49,142
I have I brought it to talk to you today, an intervention that is actually like the most joyful,

562
00:56:49,143 --> 00:56:52,953
near and dear to my heart thing that I've done in the 20 years that I've been here at U of M.

563
00:56:52,953 --> 00:56:55,982
So I do want to share that a little bit with you guys,

564
00:56:55,983 --> 00:57:02,222
but I'm happy to really talk about anything related to suicide prevention that you find interesting

565
00:57:02,223 --> 00:57:08,093
or that you think would help you in your friends and the things like don't really want it to be a,

566
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:09,603
you know, a good, useful time for you.

567
00:57:09,603 --> 00:57:19,953
Well, so let me back up and say thank you to all the people who pay my salary and or who have made my salary in the past.

568
00:57:21,123 --> 00:57:24,482
I am going to tell you a little bit about like who I am, what I do.

569
00:57:24,483 --> 00:57:29,303
And I think that maybe I'll help you understand like what questions you could ask for, things we could talk about today.

570
00:57:29,793 --> 00:57:37,833
Okay. So I'm a child clinical psychologist by training and in my next life I'm going to get an MPH.

571
00:57:37,833 --> 00:57:43,652
Funny, don't have one. I mean, I don't know. Really jealous of these cool classes that you guys get to take.

572
00:57:43,653 --> 00:57:47,373
So I'm trained as a clinician.

573
00:57:47,373 --> 00:57:50,342
I'm a licensed clinician and a clinical scientist.

574
00:57:50,343 --> 00:57:59,443
And before I came to Michigan, I was working on intergenerational transmission of depression from mom's to cancer and,

575
00:57:59,463 --> 00:58:05,163
you know, came here to work with Cheryl King about 20 years ago, who's been my mentor ever since.

576
00:58:05,163 --> 00:58:07,413
And that's really when I got into suicide prevention,

577
00:58:07,413 --> 00:58:14,373
when I got here to you about fun fact when I was in graduate school and the person teaching my child psychopathology and

578
00:58:14,373 --> 00:58:19,953
child treatment class told me that I could skip the chapter on suicide because I wasn't going to see that in my career,

579
00:58:20,313 --> 00:58:21,933
which is like somatic.

580
00:58:22,383 --> 00:58:33,423
So since for about 20 years, a lot of the work that I have been doing has been in concert with the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services.

581
00:58:33,423 --> 00:58:39,542
And I wanted to tell you a little bit about that work, because it's been so formative for me and like I'm amazing.

582
00:58:39,543 --> 00:58:46,613
So Michigan has been extremely fortunate to have received four different times.

583
00:58:47,073 --> 00:58:52,013
Very large federal grant from Santa, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.

584
00:58:52,023 --> 00:58:58,052
It's called the Garrett Smith Memorial Act, and it's money that was appropriated by Congress in the early 2000.

585
00:58:58,053 --> 00:59:04,053
It was the first time our country ever appropriated federal money for youth suicide prevention,

586
00:59:04,053 --> 00:59:07,083
even though it is the second leading cause of death for kids in this country.

587
00:59:07,083 --> 00:59:12,783
So talk about stigma, right? But that is really special money.

588
00:59:12,783 --> 00:59:17,373
It was appropriated by Congress after the death of care, at least, and that has just happened to be a senator at the time.

589
00:59:17,943 --> 00:59:22,982
So one of these one of the beautiful things for me about working in this field

590
00:59:22,983 --> 00:59:26,853
is the way that people who are survivors and people with lived experience are.

591
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:31,263
You'll be able to move the needle in the field forward with their stories and with their passion.

592
00:59:31,263 --> 00:59:35,133
So just transforming youth suicide prevention in Michigan.

593
00:59:35,143 --> 00:59:40,563
And so that project has allowed us to do so many different things,

594
00:59:40,563 --> 00:59:46,053
but it's really implementing a public health approach to suicide prevention across our whole state.

595
00:59:46,323 --> 00:59:49,833
I get to work with communities, health care systems, you know,

596
00:59:49,833 --> 00:59:54,693
different kinds of entities to do individualized and tailored public health approaches in

597
00:59:54,693 --> 00:59:58,802
their particular communities and help them evaluate and know what are the best practice,

598
00:59:58,803 --> 01:00:02,133
what is the evidence suggested that you should be doing so?

599
01:00:02,793 --> 01:00:09,963
Although I'm super excited to talk about Key, I'm also happy to talk about really any component of the public health approach to suicide prevention,

600
01:00:09,963 --> 01:00:14,643
because chances are over 20 years I've worked with some community on implementing that.

601
01:00:14,643 --> 01:00:18,453
So anything you're interested in recently, the soundtrack, right?

602
01:00:18,453 --> 01:00:22,442
Cool. I'm a kid person. I'm a child clinical psychologist.

603
01:00:22,443 --> 01:00:31,863
By training, I talk mostly about kids, but we are so excited here in Michigan to have this new CDC grant that is allowing us for the first

604
01:00:31,863 --> 01:00:38,103
time in Michigan to have federal dollars focused on something other than youth suicide prevention.

605
01:00:38,133 --> 01:00:42,633
Now, I think we all know that working with kids is for me, that's prevention.

606
01:00:42,633 --> 01:00:44,973
You know, you got to get in there early, get in there early.

607
01:00:44,973 --> 01:00:52,383
You have much more opportunity to shift somebody's developmental trajectory when you start, when they're 1030, when they're 50, great.

608
01:00:52,683 --> 01:00:59,163
But if you look at the data in the state of Michigan, that 68% of the suicides in our state are middle aged men.

609
01:00:59,643 --> 01:01:04,513
So it's, you know, pretty upsetting that we haven't had federal dollars focused on that population.

610
01:01:04,513 --> 01:01:07,592
And now we do. So that's so great. So happy to talk about that, too.

611
01:01:07,593 --> 01:01:13,203
And also, I'm really happy to work with Justin and be a part of the Institute for Firearm Injury Prevention here.

612
01:01:13,203 --> 01:01:17,433
So yeah, and then these are my conflicts of interests.

613
01:01:17,673 --> 01:01:21,573
Basically, I'm affiliated, they don't pay me anything, so that's not going to impact.

614
01:01:21,663 --> 01:01:30,273
But I'm telling you guys today, okay, I also whenever I talk about suicide prevention, I just really want to start with a site like this and say,

615
01:01:31,473 --> 01:01:40,353
gosh, you know, it's it's hard to meet anybody anymore who doesn't have some personal connection to this issue, either professionally or personally.

616
01:01:40,353 --> 01:01:46,292
Friends, family, it's a heart. It can be a really hard and distressing thing to talk about.

617
01:01:46,293 --> 01:01:49,923
And so I just thank you all for spending this time in your day talking about it.

618
01:01:50,313 --> 01:01:55,113
If at any point something that I'm talking about hits you the wrong way, please feel free.

619
01:01:55,113 --> 01:01:57,992
You know, step out and get a drink, get some fresh air.

620
01:01:57,993 --> 01:02:04,363
But if you can give me a thumbs up and let me know that you're okay, that makes me feel better because I'm a clinician first and I will go after you.

621
01:02:04,733 --> 01:02:08,223
You know, I'll be worried about you. Okay?

622
01:02:09,633 --> 01:02:13,703
All right. You talked about what I was thinking. We could do this. I found. Okay, good.

623
01:02:13,773 --> 01:02:17,073
When am I supposed to be done? 130 is much time.

624
01:02:18,663 --> 01:02:25,263
Okay. Let me also say, I don't like to talk at people, so I just want to chat with you.

625
01:02:25,623 --> 01:02:31,173
So if there's a slide that comes out and you're like, Oh, I want to talk about this or I don't want to talk about this, I got to talk about that.

626
01:02:31,413 --> 01:02:34,513
Just please, you know, interrupt. Cool. Okay.

627
01:02:34,833 --> 01:02:41,542
Okay. All right. Thanks. Okay. So we can go pretty quickly through this item.

628
01:02:41,543 --> 01:02:45,503
Prepare like a big script. I'm just going to have to talk about slides and we can have a conversation.

629
01:02:46,823 --> 01:02:50,093
But this is basically the story of length.

630
01:02:50,573 --> 01:02:53,903
You know, this is the second leading cause of death of kids in this country.

631
01:02:54,083 --> 01:03:03,533
For most of my career as a suicide prevention person, suicide has been the second leading cause of death for kids ages ten all the way up to 34.

632
01:03:03,863 --> 01:03:10,313
That actually has changed recently. You can see in this 15 to 24 age group, it's down to number three.

633
01:03:10,883 --> 01:03:17,393
I would argue that is because of the increase in homicides that we started seeing during COVID times.

634
01:03:18,893 --> 01:03:26,843
So, you know, I just think we need to look at this and we need to think as a society,

635
01:03:27,083 --> 01:03:34,642
if this is responsible for killing so many kids in our country, what are we doing as a society to move the needle here?

636
01:03:34,643 --> 01:03:41,603
Right. And like going back to the slide that you just showed about, you know, how do we get traffic fatalities to go down in this country?

637
01:03:41,603 --> 01:03:44,693
Right. I'm sure you paid to talk about this, you know, ad nauseam in here.

638
01:03:44,693 --> 01:03:51,173
Well, took a lot of money, took a major national commitment, a lot of multi-disciplinary folks at the table.

639
01:03:51,653 --> 01:03:55,853
We really haven't done that for suicide prevention.

640
01:03:55,853 --> 01:03:58,853
To the same extent. I will say I have a lot of hope.

641
01:03:59,183 --> 01:04:08,093
Over the past decade there have just been amazing, amazing changes in this field funding, science, public private partnerships.

642
01:04:09,083 --> 01:04:14,213
You know, the CDC grant that we have in Michigan, CDC didn't have this money to give until three years ago.

643
01:04:14,663 --> 01:04:17,062
Right. So things are changing for the better.

644
01:04:17,063 --> 01:04:25,773
But it really does need advocacy and and people caring about this issue and not saying this is a mental health individual problem for the therapist.

645
01:04:26,963 --> 01:04:31,613
Because speaking for the therapists, we cannot do this by ourselves.

646
01:04:34,103 --> 01:04:41,303
What's interesting, you know, you have this point who had this point about Asian Americans and sort of thinking about suicide rates based on,

647
01:04:42,083 --> 01:04:47,693
you know, what else is killing people. So, you know, you can see as the older you get, the more other things kill you.

648
01:04:47,873 --> 01:04:53,473
Right. But it's interesting, you know, we have seen a very similar pattern.

649
01:04:54,803 --> 01:05:00,383
One of the exciting things that this prison grant is doing here in Michigan is it's paying for the first time ever in our state,

650
01:05:00,653 --> 01:05:06,253
a point five dedicated epidemiologists to work just on suicide data for the state of Michigan.

651
01:05:06,263 --> 01:05:07,433
We've never had that before.

652
01:05:08,063 --> 01:05:18,233
And she showed very similar data, actually, in a recent reading of that elderly white man statistic dying by firearm suicides.

653
01:05:18,233 --> 01:05:21,413
And we're seeing that same thing here in Michigan really concerning rates.

654
01:05:21,503 --> 01:05:29,973
This is national data. And this is you know, I just want to highlight what you guys have already been talking about that,

655
01:05:31,533 --> 01:05:36,633
you know, for decades and decades we have this pretty much 3 to 1 ratio.

656
01:05:37,863 --> 01:05:44,163
Men are probably about three times more likely to die die by suicide than women.

657
01:05:44,523 --> 01:05:51,632
What's really interesting to me and speaks to of that we're going to talk about universal screening is that if you look

658
01:05:51,633 --> 01:05:56,973
at so this is the way data that's basically what you were just showing is just a different way to look at that data.

659
01:05:57,903 --> 01:06:01,593
So it's the boys that are dying. Okay.

660
01:06:02,043 --> 01:06:10,293
It's the girls who are endorsing, thinking about suicide, making a plan, attempting okay.

661
01:06:11,283 --> 01:06:18,783
At higher levels. And if you go on, people walk into our psychiatric emergency services here at U of M 65%.

662
01:06:18,783 --> 01:06:23,073
Girls we go in our inpatient unit here at U of M is 65% girls.

663
01:06:23,163 --> 01:06:27,482
70% profit on women. And so, like, what is that like?

664
01:06:27,483 --> 01:06:28,393
What's going on there?

665
01:06:28,423 --> 01:06:36,453
You know, there's like a real prevention question there about and I know that's really something that Cheryl May mentor in terms of screening is like,

666
01:06:36,453 --> 01:06:39,693
how can we find the boys? How can we find them intact?

667
01:06:40,343 --> 01:06:44,143
Right. Because they're not we don't really know yet.

668
01:06:44,163 --> 01:06:47,763
This is such an awesome and rich discussion you guys are having about screening.

669
01:06:47,763 --> 01:06:54,363
And is it the language and is it the stigma and is it that people don't feel like they have resources and so they're hesitant to screen?

670
01:06:54,363 --> 01:07:05,552
It's like all those things, you know? But we certainly have some data that when we were screening in Flynn that made us really worry about how we

671
01:07:05,553 --> 01:07:13,353
were asking the questions and how the extent to which that matches the experience of young men of color.

672
01:07:14,163 --> 01:07:21,153
Right. Because, you know, they were just saying no, like no, I'm not thinking about killing myself.

673
01:07:21,543 --> 01:07:27,543
And I don't think they were necessarily not being truthful. I mean, maybe there's the stigma and you don't want to say that you're vulnerable.

674
01:07:27,603 --> 01:07:28,863
You know, I can see that.

675
01:07:30,543 --> 01:07:38,913
But I also think there's a group of people we know there's a group of people that don't walk around thinking that they're going to end their lives.

676
01:07:39,093 --> 01:07:42,392
They just something happens. They make that decision very quickly.

677
01:07:42,393 --> 01:07:46,802
And like on Tuesday, if I asked them, they would have said, no, I'm not thinking about that.

678
01:07:46,803 --> 01:07:50,882
But on Thursday, when they're drunk at a party and they have a huge fight with their girlfriend

679
01:07:50,883 --> 01:07:53,973
and they just got grounded by their parents because they got a D in algebra,

680
01:07:54,813 --> 01:07:58,443
that's the chain rape. But like on Tuesday, they weren't lying to me.

681
01:07:58,713 --> 01:08:05,193
Right. So this is the thing that makes it hard. Okay, same thing.

682
01:08:05,313 --> 01:08:07,382
We this is a global issue.

683
01:08:07,383 --> 01:08:16,893
This isn't just a United States issue that our indigenous young people are at the highest risk for suicide, you know, across the world, actually.

684
01:08:18,663 --> 01:08:25,652
So that's, you know, pretty concerned. I have to ask, the government contends this, talking about Native American.

685
01:08:25,653 --> 01:08:29,123
Are you working with Lisa Wexler? Are you okay? Good for you.

686
01:08:30,753 --> 01:08:35,283
Please look at her work. And have you talked about that working here just a little bit?

687
01:08:35,463 --> 01:08:40,083
Yeah, she does. Really fantastic. I remember Emily's. I don't know.

688
01:08:40,533 --> 01:08:48,272
Yeah. Do you want to tell folks what you're doing? I mean, she's our nation's expert in prevention, I would say, of suicide among indigenous youth.

689
01:08:48,273 --> 01:08:52,683
And she's here at U of M School of Social Work. Yeah, she's really wonderful.

690
01:08:52,693 --> 01:09:00,093
She is. So she has a long history with both Alaska Native populations, which is actually a similar background.

691
01:09:00,333 --> 01:09:04,143
But she currently runs three different studies.

692
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:07,433
I don't I'm not familiar with her third one of Anchorage,

693
01:09:08,133 --> 01:09:14,763
but she runs one that's on promoting community conversations around research on suicide so that it's going into these

694
01:09:14,763 --> 01:09:21,213
communities and having community members have developed conversations that they want to have about what suicide looks like.

695
01:09:22,323 --> 01:09:26,603
And then also both like prevention, but then they also do post tensions.

696
01:09:26,613 --> 01:09:29,013
And what do you do after suicide has happened?

697
01:09:29,443 --> 01:09:36,333
You get kind of really seriously considering topic, like how are we talking about it in the community and taking what we learn from it.

698
01:09:36,663 --> 01:09:42,753
You know, I go, I'll be responsible way to alter it and then also some conversations around restriction.

699
01:09:42,753 --> 01:09:48,963
And then her family safety project is focused more on safety and firearm safety.

700
01:09:49,233 --> 01:10:00,393
But it really acknowledges that a lot of the suicide prevention in the lower 48 is focused on like individual mechanisms around firearm safety.

701
01:10:00,693 --> 01:10:04,613
And in the last two years of operations that her work is focused on,

702
01:10:04,623 --> 01:10:12,853
there's much more of like a community based and a family based narrative and a relational like experience and so doing,

703
01:10:12,993 --> 01:10:19,083
drawing on those and with a better predictor of how that suicide.

704
01:10:20,233 --> 01:10:24,712
It's such an important message about the need to do cultural tailoring in your

705
01:10:24,713 --> 01:10:28,013
prevention strategies or actively partnering with the community for the event.

706
01:10:28,033 --> 01:10:32,743
Just it's really moving work in that space and sometimes your working integrity is great.

707
01:10:33,923 --> 01:10:40,913
So you said that on average white male age have a tendency to commit suicide to fight on.

708
01:10:41,243 --> 01:10:46,013
So now my question is, is there a correlation between violence, suicide and gun ownership?

709
01:10:47,573 --> 01:10:52,673
That's a complicated question. Is there a correlation between firearm suicide and gun ownership?

710
01:10:53,753 --> 01:11:00,953
You know, we certainly know that when there is a gun in the home, the risk of somebody dying by suicide is increased.

711
01:11:01,493 --> 01:11:05,453
Right. It has to do with access. Right. And we can talk about them.

712
01:11:05,453 --> 01:11:08,123
I don't I don't have a lot of them. Please jump in. Just jump in.

713
01:11:08,723 --> 01:11:18,323
You know, the reason that lethal means restriction counseling and access to these on the inspire and safe storage.

714
01:11:18,323 --> 01:11:24,863
You know any of these things are in firearms. The reason that they're so important with respect to suicide prevention is a couple things.

715
01:11:25,463 --> 01:11:32,863
Number one, about over half of the deaths by suicide across all ages and reasons, you know,

716
01:11:32,963 --> 01:11:37,463
putting everybody together over half of a death by suicide in this country are by firearms.

717
01:11:37,763 --> 01:11:41,873
So if we're serious, we really want to reduce the rate of suicide in this country.

718
01:11:42,023 --> 01:11:45,953
We have to have a plan for that and we have to have a plan.

719
01:11:46,843 --> 01:11:56,153
So that's one issue. The other thing that's really important is that, you know, for all the reasons that we just talked about, screening is hard.

720
01:11:56,423 --> 01:11:58,943
We don't have enough capacity in our health care system.

721
01:12:00,263 --> 01:12:07,103
You know, we're not always going to we're not we can't find everybody and get them help when they're hurting.

722
01:12:07,103 --> 01:12:15,653
Right. We just can't. And so we need to, as a society, have more ability to have a second chance with somebody.

723
01:12:16,043 --> 01:12:17,243
That's really what it's about.

724
01:12:17,243 --> 01:12:23,753
And so if in that moment somebody makes a decision to end their life, and if in that moment there's a loaded firearm there,

725
01:12:24,533 --> 01:12:30,653
the likelihood of that person dying when they make that attempt is really high like 95%.

726
01:12:30,743 --> 01:12:35,913
Right. Right. And it's really it's pretty rare to survive a suicide attempt with a firearm.

727
01:12:36,503 --> 01:12:39,803
Any other thing you pick to end your life?

728
01:12:40,253 --> 01:12:44,303
I have more like a 90% chance of getting a second chance with you.

729
01:12:44,903 --> 01:12:50,033
You're much more likely to survive. And I just want a second chance that you can get people towards recovery.

730
01:12:50,393 --> 01:12:59,993
There's a lot of people that, you know, have attempted suicide and nobody had any idea that they needed help.

731
01:13:00,543 --> 01:13:09,253
Right. And it is not unusual, particularly with young people, for the attempt to be the thing that gets people into care.

732
01:13:09,593 --> 01:13:13,943
Right. It mobilizes the family system. Oh, my God. I didn't really know it was this bad.

733
01:13:13,943 --> 01:13:17,482
Right. And so we just really need that second chance.

734
01:13:17,483 --> 01:13:23,693
And so having firearms safely stored in the home is a really critical prevention strategy.

735
01:13:23,933 --> 01:13:31,523
You want to put time and distance between the person who's hurting and that weapon and time and distance.

736
01:13:31,913 --> 01:13:36,953
And the beautiful thing is that when somebody is really and as soon as they see clinically,

737
01:13:37,223 --> 01:13:41,513
their problem solving skills aren't that great, their frustration, tolerance is not that great.

738
01:13:41,723 --> 01:13:46,103
They get real tunnel vision. They can't think of a lot of different options at that time.

739
01:13:46,103 --> 01:13:51,742
That's why they're focused on suicide rate and they can't think like, I can call my therapist tomorrow, I can work.

740
01:13:51,743 --> 01:13:55,253
And I get, you know, they get one restriction that the thing they're restricted on,

741
01:13:55,673 --> 01:14:05,723
it's hard to get to truly the wave recedes and it's very rare for people to then go try to find something else.

742
01:14:06,023 --> 01:14:08,693
Even if they do and they find something else, they're likely to survive.

743
01:14:10,313 --> 01:14:17,453
But again, you know, in the nineties, I think it's this has been studied tons of different samples, different times.

744
01:14:17,453 --> 01:14:23,993
But this narrative that if somebody really wants to do it, they're going to do it is really not true.

745
01:14:24,353 --> 01:14:30,682
So we follow people over time. We've made a suicide attempt and that's been the 90% of people.

746
01:14:30,683 --> 01:14:35,183
You know, ten years later, they're still here. They don't try again is that we got to keep them safe.

747
01:14:35,183 --> 01:14:40,943
And at one time, that one time when the wave hit so so it really is just being sure that there's

748
01:14:40,943 --> 01:14:45,683
there's a plan for safe storage that calls for stricter guns and I guess policy.

749
01:14:46,193 --> 01:14:49,762
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, there's so many different ways to intervene here.

750
01:14:49,763 --> 01:14:54,232
It has to be, you know, in health care, we talk about like the holes in the Swiss cheese.

751
01:14:54,233 --> 01:15:00,173
You know, when you have an adverse event in a health care system, it's like the holes in a Swiss cheese lined up and then something bad happened.

752
01:15:00,473 --> 01:15:03,633
So the holes in a Swiss cheese can be so many different things, right?

753
01:15:03,683 --> 01:15:09,592
It can be you choose not to be a firearm owner. If you do, you got your ammunition separated from your firearm and they're both lax.

754
01:15:09,593 --> 01:15:16,283
Right. Your screenings. I've got teachers who are looking after your kids and telling parents that they're concerned about them.

755
01:15:16,283 --> 01:15:19,193
You know, there's you know, they're in the emergency room.

756
01:15:19,573 --> 01:15:25,213
And if somebody is giving them counseling and access to lethal means, the pediatrician is saying, oh, we know you guys are a hunting family.

757
01:15:25,223 --> 01:15:31,453
How do you strain your firearms? You know, there's so many ways that we can make sure that the holes in the Swiss cheese don't.

758
01:15:35,123 --> 01:15:43,073
So we're entering this field where some of the terminology you should be aware of used when talking about that.

759
01:15:44,563 --> 01:15:51,333
Instead, like many. They died from suicide.

760
01:15:51,693 --> 01:15:55,333
Exactly. What is thank you for that question.

761
01:15:55,353 --> 01:15:58,533
I so appreciate it. Tell me what motivated that question for you.

762
01:15:58,653 --> 01:16:04,363
I read the website. I was looking at it and I was like, oh, my God, I receive communion.

763
01:16:04,383 --> 01:16:09,303
Oh, my God. I, I say, you know, I'm saying that now. Thank you for elevating that question.

764
01:16:09,633 --> 01:16:14,462
It's so great. So the question was, what is the language that we should be using when we talk about this?

765
01:16:14,463 --> 01:16:21,753
And again, this is something that I really love about this field is there is a real focus on elevating the voices of

766
01:16:21,753 --> 01:16:28,832
people with lived experience and having their perspectives infuse what we do as professionals in the field.

767
01:16:28,833 --> 01:16:34,863
And so this is an example of that. People with lived experience have said, please watch your language.

768
01:16:35,193 --> 01:16:39,392
It really matters in so many different ways. So committed is a great example.

769
01:16:39,393 --> 01:16:46,323
They're saying we really we that term is hurtful to us because you guys tell me, what else do you commit?

770
01:16:47,303 --> 01:16:52,443
Right. Commit a crime. You commit adultery, you commit a sin.

771
01:16:52,683 --> 01:16:56,373
I mean, it is really a very negative term in our society.

772
01:16:56,373 --> 01:17:03,003
And so, you know, people do you prefer the term died by suicide instead of committed suicide?

773
01:17:04,473 --> 01:17:07,053
There's also in health care. You and I work in a health care system.

774
01:17:07,323 --> 01:17:15,812
There's a lot of really concerning clinician talk that happens that I worry about a lot.

775
01:17:15,813 --> 01:17:19,323
And I don't know if you guys have any. Do you have any idea what I'm talking about?

776
01:17:19,323 --> 01:17:25,213
Give me some of the selfish or lack thereof that you know.

777
01:17:25,293 --> 01:17:31,383
Yeah, it would mess right away. Just sort of put some attribution from people who've made a decision to end their lives.

778
01:17:31,713 --> 01:17:41,373
And then we also, you know, I will hear people say, like, I have a 13 year old girl here who's made a suicidal gesture and she is,

779
01:17:41,553 --> 01:17:45,632
you know, trying to manipulate the situation at home with her mom.

780
01:17:45,633 --> 01:17:51,093
She doesn't want, you know, and that those kind of terms like gesture, manipulative.

781
01:17:52,143 --> 01:17:57,003
My personal favorite is we get a frequent flier here and I saw it with somebody who

782
01:17:57,003 --> 01:18:01,773
was coming in with chronically elevated sort of they read all of that language.

783
01:18:02,163 --> 01:18:10,203
Not only is it not person centered, it is not respectful, but it really undermines the risk assessment process.

784
01:18:10,473 --> 01:18:14,943
You know, like when you say that's a gesture, well, then all of a sudden you don't take that seriously.

785
01:18:15,063 --> 01:18:18,373
Okay. That's not a gesture. That was a suicide attempt. Okay.

786
01:18:18,673 --> 01:18:22,923
And that was valid of that attempt to meet their needs. But that's good news.

787
01:18:23,253 --> 01:18:26,193
I'm happy that you only took four Tylenol. Awesome.

788
01:18:26,433 --> 01:18:33,603
You know, eventually you take more than 44, but it's just really important to watch Russian language.

789
01:18:34,803 --> 01:18:39,753
Okay. Okay. This is what I wanted to just spend a minute honoring my public health friends.

790
01:18:40,653 --> 01:18:45,183
So this is, you know, really like that public health model of suicide prevention.

791
01:18:45,183 --> 01:18:52,823
And I just want to say that there is exciting stuff happening in each of these we all so, you know,

792
01:18:52,843 --> 01:18:58,113
I just thought maybe it might be fun to talk about, you know, how is this all happening with prevention?

793
01:18:58,683 --> 01:19:05,373
So in terms of like promotion and wellness, I mean, this is really anything that we're doing to have healthy kids and families in our country, right?

794
01:19:05,373 --> 01:19:11,202
That's suicide prevention and on the board of our kids daycare for like ten years.

795
01:19:11,203 --> 01:19:17,943
And I think you guys are doing something prevention because you're making these kids feel so special and they're loved and they're smart.

796
01:19:17,973 --> 01:19:23,073
They can do school like this is all, you know, healthy kids and families,

797
01:19:23,073 --> 01:19:27,873
that suicide prevention, anything that we're doing there is important, you know, universal rate.

798
01:19:27,873 --> 01:19:37,383
These universal programs like one of my favorite is have you guys heard of the good behavior game that came out of Baltimore City public schools.

799
01:19:37,743 --> 01:19:48,423
Beautiful. You will love, you know, the good behavior and I'm sure so it was just a first and second grade behavior like pay attention in class,

800
01:19:48,423 --> 01:19:52,263
kind of an intervention for inner city public schools in Baltimore, where I'm from.

801
01:19:52,743 --> 01:19:58,743
And, you know, they just followed up on followed up their data when the kids were like 18, 19, 20 years old.

802
01:19:58,953 --> 01:20:05,493
And it's that classroom intervention that made kids feel like they could do school and that they were good kids,

803
01:20:05,733 --> 01:20:09,183
had an impact on suicidal ideation as kids got older.

804
01:20:09,783 --> 01:20:15,572
And in some of the sample actually mortality is that mortality outcomes for cancer and I

805
01:20:15,573 --> 01:20:22,623
can't remember the but it is cited as a universal strategies suicide prevention strategy,

806
01:20:22,623 --> 01:20:26,612
you know, and violence prevention. Violence prevention and pregnancy.

807
01:20:26,613 --> 01:20:32,522
Yeah. I mean, all of these, you know, universal rates.

808
01:20:32,523 --> 01:20:36,482
So why is t what we're going to be talking about today?

809
01:20:36,483 --> 01:20:44,703
I would call that an indicated prevention strategy because the kids in that intervention were recruited off of our unit here.

810
01:20:45,093 --> 01:20:49,183
So they already were struggling. They were. Finding an app for suicide risk.

811
01:20:49,183 --> 01:20:56,382
So, you know, they're pretty far down the line and we're just trying to prevent their death

812
01:20:56,383 --> 01:20:59,953
by suicide right now and trying to prevent the onset of suicidal behavior.

813
01:21:01,963 --> 01:21:05,653
Anybody have an idea of what a selective intervention might look like?

814
01:21:06,373 --> 01:21:15,593
What might that look like with respect to suicide prevention? Maybe some kids might have some.

815
01:21:16,283 --> 01:21:19,913
Sometimes just groups of kids. Exactly.

816
01:21:20,093 --> 01:21:24,802
Right. So for whatever maybe you're screening or maybe you just figure out that somebody has some

817
01:21:24,803 --> 01:21:28,733
elevated symptoms and elevated risk and then you're going to do something different for them.

818
01:21:28,733 --> 01:21:34,943
Right. So you're trying to catch right before, you know, an example of that with somebody else has their hand up.

819
01:21:34,943 --> 01:21:41,662
Yeah. Would you do a selective intervention in somewhere like in our room where like there was I returned

820
01:21:41,663 --> 01:21:48,083
from an entire school year and right after I graduated there was like a strong contender for that.

821
01:21:48,113 --> 01:21:54,562
Yeah. And I mean, there was such a really hard time here in, in Arbor, but like,

822
01:21:54,563 --> 01:21:59,383
when would that be a time when you use a selective intervention because of that confusion?

823
01:21:59,693 --> 01:22:02,182
That's a really great question.

824
01:22:02,183 --> 01:22:12,023
I would call that like post vention, which really is that that's I don't know that that's like reflected here really well,

825
01:22:12,023 --> 01:22:17,963
but I, I would probably put that here, but I also think you could think about that as selective.

826
01:22:18,773 --> 01:22:24,263
One example, I'll just share that our team worked on with a study that we did.

827
01:22:24,413 --> 01:22:26,393
This is why we were screening in Flint.

828
01:22:27,083 --> 01:22:34,072
It was a study funded by the CDC to look at whether this protective factor of making kids feel connected to other people,

829
01:22:34,073 --> 01:22:37,883
to their families, to the community at large, was a protective factor for suicide.

830
01:22:38,363 --> 01:22:49,703
And so they wanted the CDC asked us to create a sample of kids prior to the onset of any suicidal behavior.

831
01:22:50,783 --> 01:22:57,473
So we screened kids for thoughts of suicide depressive symptoms and alcohol use.

832
01:22:58,673 --> 01:23:00,943
And so that's that that's a data set that I was seeing.

833
01:23:00,953 --> 01:23:09,143
Like the black boys were much more likely to endorse some depressive symptoms, much more likely to endorse alcohol use.

834
01:23:09,263 --> 01:23:17,332
It was like the combination of I'm feeling bad and using alcohol that actually predicted suicide attempts in that population.

835
01:23:17,333 --> 01:23:21,113
They weren't saying like, I'm thinking about killing myself tomorrow, but it didn't resonate.

836
01:23:21,443 --> 01:23:22,462
So that was that study.

837
01:23:22,463 --> 01:23:31,933
But we enrolled kids as our Let's Connect project and if you're interested in having a sense of the papers about it, but with the fabulous Jenny Cube,

838
01:23:31,943 --> 01:23:40,822
it was really the intervention was hooking up with a community mentor in Flint and, you know, having them,

839
01:23:40,823 --> 01:23:45,323
you know, meet and try to get them engaged with pro-social activities, you know, in their community.

840
01:23:46,193 --> 01:23:50,043
So that was a selected case ID that screening, right?

841
01:23:50,063 --> 01:23:56,753
That's the idea of like if we all as a society have our eyes open and we know what the warning signs are, we know what we're looking for.

842
01:23:56,753 --> 01:24:05,812
And as a society, we are ascribing to some of these stigmatizing beliefs that we shouldn't be talking about this or we can't ask the question.

843
01:24:05,813 --> 01:24:08,903
Or if I tell somebody, I'm worried about them and put the idea in their head.

844
01:24:08,903 --> 01:24:15,903
Right, that all of us as a society can keep our eyes open and say, Hey, I'm a little worried about you.

845
01:24:16,163 --> 01:24:18,802
How are you doing? Right. That's the case ID.

846
01:24:18,803 --> 01:24:24,863
So that can happen in the community and that can also happen being a screening work and a health care system treatment.

847
01:24:25,313 --> 01:24:27,533
Let's keep them in treatment that's promote recovery.

848
01:24:27,773 --> 01:24:32,013
And then I would say, you know, Pulse mentioned kind of is how we take care of people after a die.

849
01:24:33,853 --> 01:24:37,483
Incidentally, we've never had money to do this in Michigan, and we do now.

850
01:24:37,753 --> 01:24:42,573
We are going to be funding five Los teams here in Michigan, which is great.

851
01:24:42,583 --> 01:24:46,243
It's training victims advocates to go out to the scene, you know,

852
01:24:46,273 --> 01:24:50,603
after a death and really try to support the family and get them into the services, basically.

853
01:24:53,303 --> 01:24:56,493
Do you guys go with them? Even they go.

854
01:24:56,973 --> 01:25:01,983
I don't do that. No, but I have friends and colleagues who do.

855
01:25:01,983 --> 01:25:05,043
And that is the work of angels right there.

856
01:25:06,093 --> 01:25:10,583
The thing to do, it's so important.

857
01:25:10,593 --> 01:25:14,642
I mean, there's not a lot of research actually about police function and how important it is.

858
01:25:14,643 --> 01:25:17,882
But some, you know, more like surveillance.

859
01:25:17,883 --> 01:25:25,133
This kind of data suggest that after a death, they used to say for many years there were six people impacted after a suicide death.

860
01:25:25,473 --> 01:25:32,853
Now the data is saying it's 135 people who are significantly impacted after a suicide death.

861
01:25:32,853 --> 01:25:36,273
And I think many of us have gone through that. It's a different death.

862
01:25:36,303 --> 01:25:42,363
You know, it's a different thing to process. And it's kind of like a bomb goes off in your family.

863
01:25:42,363 --> 01:25:45,693
And so when there's a post mentioned services like a loss team,

864
01:25:45,933 --> 01:25:52,853
the data suggests that those surviving family members are much more they link to supportive care a lot faster.

865
01:25:53,073 --> 01:25:56,783
And so that's about the only outcome we know about right now.

866
01:25:56,793 --> 01:26:00,423
But, you know, take it. Okay.

867
01:26:01,353 --> 01:26:11,323
So, like, why is this hard right now? We talked a lot about this this morning, you know, but as you were saying, Justin, you know,

868
01:26:11,343 --> 01:26:20,882
we were seeing from like 2008 the suicide rates for kids had been stable for a better time to high that stable starting in like 2008,

869
01:26:20,883 --> 01:26:24,603
they started going up from like 28 to 2020.

870
01:26:24,783 --> 01:26:27,813
The youth suicide rate went up about 54%.

871
01:26:28,653 --> 01:26:36,933
And now, you know, before COVID. And then, of course, you know, there's a tsunami happening right now in terms of kids mental health needs.

872
01:26:37,383 --> 01:26:43,923
So this is, you know, all recent stuff. We have the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of Child Less and Psychiatry,

873
01:26:43,923 --> 01:26:47,673
and the Children's Hospital Association got together and said, we have a national crisis.

874
01:26:47,673 --> 01:26:53,943
Where anybody is working in mental health right now, knows that anybody who's working in emergency departments knows that we have,

875
01:26:54,153 --> 01:27:00,993
you know, a 50% increase in young girls coming into emergency departments during COVID with suicide attempts,

876
01:27:01,143 --> 01:27:12,553
suicidal ideation we haven't seen yet a COVID related impact on mortality in young people, but there's been some like within subgroups and pockets.

877
01:27:12,573 --> 01:27:16,203
And I think, you know, people are kind of expecting that maybe we will see this.

878
01:27:17,223 --> 01:27:22,683
I am leading Michigan's Youth Suicide Prevention Emergency Department Network,

879
01:27:22,683 --> 01:27:27,693
which is kind of a community of practice of people who are working in emergency departments all

880
01:27:27,693 --> 01:27:33,453
across the state because they're drowning and kids with suicide risk who can't get in anywhere else.

881
01:27:33,753 --> 01:27:38,462
And our emergency department colleagues really are trying to do that, to really trying to support people.

882
01:27:38,463 --> 01:27:46,773
So we've got a lot of capacity issues in our health care system right now, which for me makes the public health approach so much more important.

883
01:27:46,773 --> 01:27:51,303
You know, we really need to think about not just like referring people to therapy.

884
01:27:51,813 --> 01:27:53,403
You know, we got to think bigger than that.

885
01:27:55,623 --> 01:28:03,092
We talked about this, just that the screening issue like this is hard because there's not one profile of kid who is going to die by suicide.

886
01:28:03,093 --> 01:28:06,243
Like you can get to that place taking a lot of different paths.

887
01:28:06,573 --> 01:28:12,933
I mean, I'm happy to talk about any of this, but I want to get into my esteemed back.

888
01:28:15,693 --> 01:28:21,853
Okay, so this kind of stuff gets me excited, right?

889
01:28:22,383 --> 01:28:28,743
At risk factors. That's really important. Understanding how to people get to that place, how can we reduce those risk factors?

890
01:28:28,743 --> 01:28:30,183
That's really important for treatment.

891
01:28:30,933 --> 01:28:38,103
But for prevention, what's I think what's really important is data about, you know, what do we know that's protecting kids?

892
01:28:38,103 --> 01:28:39,963
You know, what is keeping them safe. Right.

893
01:28:40,413 --> 01:28:47,552
And this idea of connectedness is and we're finding this over and over again, people are calling it connectedness now.

894
01:28:47,553 --> 01:28:55,253
But 20 years ago, they called it social support or family cohesion or, you know,

895
01:28:55,293 --> 01:29:06,483
family climate and school connectedness, you know, really important kids who are able to say, I know I am here.

896
01:29:07,713 --> 01:29:12,123
You know, I know what I'm fighting for. I know what I'm supposed to do in my life.

897
01:29:12,453 --> 01:29:16,442
You know, I have a plan for myself. Like these kinds of things are really protective for kids.

898
01:29:16,443 --> 01:29:24,153
So what I love about waste is that it really does try to harness and grow the protective factors.

899
01:29:25,123 --> 01:29:29,113
Okay. Let's talk about this now. Have you heard of the intervention?

900
01:29:29,953 --> 01:29:35,293
Yeah. Okay. So let me tell you my involvement about this.

901
01:29:36,523 --> 01:29:41,713
I got to Michigan as Cheryl's post in September of 2002.

902
01:29:42,253 --> 01:29:45,223
My very first day of work was the launch of this study.

903
01:29:45,763 --> 01:29:51,443
So she just had an hour when I was a postdoc, I got to be one of the intervention specialists for my teeth.

904
01:29:51,883 --> 01:29:55,633
Truthfully, it's one of the most wonderful things I have ever been a part of.

905
01:29:55,633 --> 01:30:02,263
And I say to Cheryl all the time, I have a personal motto of anything four ways to anything to get this out into the world.

906
01:30:03,583 --> 01:30:11,893
And I mean this you know, Charles, you've kind of steals my thunder that we after some time, found some really cool results,

907
01:30:12,673 --> 01:30:21,043
that my history actually is the only intervention right now for youth that has a demonstrated impact on suicide mortality in young people.

908
01:30:21,403 --> 01:30:26,383
But it's a cool story. So it seems to be done well.

909
01:30:26,393 --> 01:30:31,873
And maybe if I could be wrong.

910
01:30:31,873 --> 01:30:34,993
So it was 1235 is when we came or we came back.

911
01:30:35,563 --> 01:30:40,753
We take a little break if maybe for 130. Okay, yeah, that's pretty good.

912
01:30:41,383 --> 01:30:46,523
Okay. So oh, they're interested in a different show and tell us.

913
01:30:47,113 --> 01:30:52,722
So I have come the man was there. He they kind of have been I've been sitting in my office for 20 or so.

914
01:30:52,723 --> 01:30:59,263
They might be a little dusty and there might be some stuff stuck in there, but I think I kind of get a sense of the intervention.

915
01:31:01,123 --> 01:31:06,012
So what is why is he it is based on this is before we were using this connectedness.

916
01:31:06,013 --> 01:31:09,823
Language is based on social support and health behavior models.

917
01:31:10,033 --> 01:31:13,753
It is a psycho educational, social support, adjunctive intervention.

918
01:31:14,173 --> 01:31:18,823
It is not treatment. It is supposed to go alongside treatment.

919
01:31:19,423 --> 01:31:21,553
And one of the questions I have is, you know,

920
01:31:21,853 --> 01:31:27,703
could waste even be a bridging intervention during this time when her health care system really does demand,

921
01:31:28,903 --> 01:31:35,893
you know, could this be something that is keeping kids afloat between the crisis being identified and really being able to access care?

922
01:31:36,303 --> 01:31:39,953
You know that. Yeah. Okay.

923
01:31:39,973 --> 01:31:50,203
So the goal is to build this team around a kid who's hurting and is often provided in combination with treatments like psychotherapy or medication.

924
01:31:50,653 --> 01:31:55,653
The intervention is not with the kid. The intervention is with the adults around the kid.

925
01:31:56,293 --> 01:32:00,553
And they found cool. So here's what happened.

926
01:32:00,553 --> 01:32:05,653
So again, this was an IRA one funded by the National Institute of Mental Health to Cheryl King.

927
01:32:05,653 --> 01:32:09,523
And I was just really, you know, grateful to program under her coattails.

928
01:32:10,903 --> 01:32:13,993
So so here's what happens.

929
01:32:14,683 --> 01:32:20,443
Kids are on the unit. This there are about 480 or so kids who are in this original hour.

930
01:32:20,443 --> 01:32:26,653
One about a third of them came from here, RCP, share it with them and the rest came from Haven and Oakland County.

931
01:32:27,403 --> 01:32:31,993
So the kids are on the unit, they're there for suicidal ideation or suicide attempt,

932
01:32:32,323 --> 01:32:41,563
and they get randomized in to ask why is she or why is she plus treatment as usual or just treatment as usual?

933
01:32:41,713 --> 01:32:46,153
Okay, so you would go in and you meet with the kid and they would nominate their support team.

934
01:32:46,153 --> 01:32:52,542
So one really critical piece of why is two years that if a kid nominated, it's not your mom telling you who you want on your team.

935
01:32:52,543 --> 01:32:57,043
It's like who you want to be on your team. Most kids didn't pick parents, but not all of them.

936
01:32:57,133 --> 01:32:59,803
Right? So they have a slave leader.

937
01:32:59,803 --> 01:33:07,303
But, you know, if we really tried to get kids to think about all the places that they were and be sure that somebody was there.

938
01:33:07,303 --> 01:33:10,663
So somebody I home, somebody at school. Oh, you playing sports?

939
01:33:10,663 --> 01:33:14,593
How about your soccer coach, all your super active and youth group? How about your youth group leader?

940
01:33:14,593 --> 01:33:19,363
You know? Oh, your best friend's mom. You're really close to her. Awesome. So this is, you know, kids are nominating.

941
01:33:21,043 --> 01:33:26,053
So this is, you know, what I did as an intervention specialist 30 the nomination parents had to say yes.

942
01:33:26,713 --> 01:33:35,203
Right. So you couldn't nominate like your drug dealer. Yeah. Well, you know, most parents didn't have any concerns with who kids were nominating,

943
01:33:35,533 --> 01:33:42,462
so we would bring all of these people together, get their consent to be a part of this and do a psycho educational session.

944
01:33:42,463 --> 01:33:47,173
It was like 90 minutes here. You know, this kid was just in the hospital.

945
01:33:47,503 --> 01:33:52,933
Here's why and here's how you can help them and really teach them about what their role was.

946
01:33:53,623 --> 01:33:58,482
And then the support people would check in with the kid once a week, ideally.

947
01:33:58,483 --> 01:34:01,873
And then I, as the intervention specialist, check in with the support person once a week.

948
01:34:02,173 --> 01:34:06,043
How's it going and psychoeducation on sessions.

949
01:34:07,243 --> 01:34:16,392
Let's go ahead. Do you have a question? Yeah, I just want to explain why do so people have to explain why they selected a specific

950
01:34:16,393 --> 01:34:22,903
person or why as a parent or a caregiver said this person is not okay to be their person.

951
01:34:23,623 --> 01:34:28,962
They didn't. Like have that. I mean and feel like we would chat about it often.

952
01:34:28,963 --> 01:34:34,453
Kids have needed some hand-holding because you know, they're in the hospital, right?

953
01:34:34,603 --> 01:34:38,023
They're in a lot of like I actually don't nobody cares about me.

954
01:34:38,473 --> 01:34:43,033
You know, they're in that like perceived burdensome and like, I don't, you know, nobody.

955
01:34:43,303 --> 01:34:49,123
So you had to really help them say, like, oh, no, people do care about you.

956
01:34:49,123 --> 01:34:56,442
And I, you know, I say because like, nobody ever says, you know, like they're going to say, yeah, I believe we don't know right now.

957
01:34:56,443 --> 01:35:04,213
This was done before. And I mean, just so into mechanisms of action, you know, like we don't really know exactly why why is she works the way it does.

958
01:35:04,513 --> 01:35:08,563
But I have to say, for me as an intervention specialist, being with those kids,

959
01:35:08,803 --> 01:35:14,743
watching them say they're not going to say yes, and I'm saying nobody says no.

960
01:35:15,373 --> 01:35:18,913
Okay, let me call them. I think they're going to say yes.

961
01:35:19,273 --> 01:35:26,853
And so having like that real experience as a kid, like, oh my God, my English teacher said, yes, really?

962
01:35:27,163 --> 01:35:33,373
Like my English teacher cares that much about me that she would do this for me or my soccer coach care that much about me or my grandma.

963
01:35:33,793 --> 01:35:39,193
That is an important intervention that is telling her that they matter to people in their community and in the world.

964
01:35:39,193 --> 01:35:48,973
And I think that's really powerful. But definitely sometimes the parents would be like, oh, you know, like, okay, yeah.

965
01:35:49,303 --> 01:35:54,943
I went into essentially targeting their environment for this intervention.

966
01:35:55,093 --> 01:35:59,152
Like, how did you guys discover that?

967
01:35:59,153 --> 01:36:02,993
Is the support around the individual as opposed to the individual?

968
01:36:03,753 --> 01:36:08,803
Oh yeah. I wish Sheryl was here because this is all Cheryl's brainchild, you know.

969
01:36:09,523 --> 01:36:16,813
But I got to tell you, what I would suspect she would say is that her first job here at the University of Michigan medical staff was on our unit,

970
01:36:17,443 --> 01:36:22,093
and she served as the psychologist on our unit for 15 years before she wrote this grant.

971
01:36:22,603 --> 01:36:28,063
And she was watching those kids every day. She got to know those kids every day saying nobody cares about me.

972
01:36:28,513 --> 01:36:35,263
Right. I don't have anybody. I mean, that's the element that's the cognitive part of that illness is that,

973
01:36:36,043 --> 01:36:40,243
you know, I go in one room and I can see that the parent and the parent is saving.

974
01:36:40,573 --> 01:36:44,563
This child is the most important person for me. You know, I can think of one mom.

975
01:36:44,863 --> 01:36:49,572
I tried for eight years to have a baby. I've never wanted anything more than this child.

976
01:36:49,573 --> 01:36:54,553
I love her so deeply. And then I go in another room and the kids see I'm nobody loves me.

977
01:36:54,803 --> 01:36:59,533
Nobody cares about me. Right? There's this huge disconnect in that really suicidal state.

978
01:36:59,533 --> 01:37:04,092
And so my guess is that Cheryl just observed that.

979
01:37:04,093 --> 01:37:11,623
And it's also similar. Any of you who've worked in community mental health, it's a little bit similar to that wraparound model.

980
01:37:11,623 --> 01:37:14,982
I don't know if you guys are familiar with that, but it's really in my kids really struggling.

981
01:37:14,983 --> 01:37:20,833
That's a kind of the mental health model of wrapping around a kid and getting everybody like,

982
01:37:21,313 --> 01:37:27,283
you know, at the table, okay, so what is poor people supposed to do?

983
01:37:27,883 --> 01:37:31,613
They are just supposed to have meaningful, supportive contact with the kids.

984
01:37:31,613 --> 01:37:34,722
So sometimes it's a phone call and then they get to get ice cream.

985
01:37:34,723 --> 01:37:41,203
Sometimes they went for a walk. You know, it really varied by the nature of the relationship and the kid.

986
01:37:42,313 --> 01:37:47,802
But a couple of things we really wanted them to do provide emotional support, incurred.

987
01:37:47,803 --> 01:37:52,303
A huge piece of that psychoeducation session was what is the treatment recommendations?

988
01:37:52,483 --> 01:37:56,292
And please encourage them to go with a huge issue in this country.

989
01:37:56,293 --> 01:38:02,683
When kids leave emergency departments and inpatient hospitalization, they don't either they don't link or they don't follow through with treatment.

990
01:38:03,013 --> 01:38:07,783
And so really encouraging kids to stay in treatment.

991
01:38:07,783 --> 01:38:11,832
If you're having side effects, don't just stop your medicine. Go talk to your psychiatrist about it.

992
01:38:11,833 --> 01:38:15,523
Like let's be proactive, support their behavioral choices.

993
01:38:15,523 --> 01:38:18,793
And then we went through with them. What should you do with your work?

994
01:38:19,003 --> 01:38:25,633
What's the plan? With the crisis plan? And they would come to us and ask questions and stuff.

995
01:38:25,873 --> 01:38:32,503
They were not expected to be mental health professionals. We told them, you're not responsible for this kid's safety, are their choices.

996
01:38:33,583 --> 01:38:38,083
And, you know, definitely spent a lot of time around, you know, what do you do if you're really worried?

997
01:38:39,613 --> 01:38:48,912
Okay. So the first study I got 448, ages 13 to 17, and I think we talked about most of this.

998
01:38:48,913 --> 01:39:01,062
So, you know, the I'm going to skip some of this, but I think what the story is here is I mean, you can see here, you know, how sick these kids were.

999
01:39:01,063 --> 01:39:03,642
You know, we have several that, you know, a big chunk,

1000
01:39:03,643 --> 01:39:07,903
about a quarter of the sample that has multiple suicide attempts before they came into our study.

1001
01:39:10,153 --> 01:39:19,093
I think the story here is that, I mean, I loved this intervention, right?

1002
01:39:19,093 --> 01:39:24,223
Like I would have grandmas, like, crying in these psycho educational sessions, like, thank you so much.

1003
01:39:24,243 --> 01:39:27,543
You're telling me? I don't know what's going on with her. I knew something was wrong.

1004
01:39:27,603 --> 01:39:31,773
I didn't know how to help. Thank you for giving me something to do. Like I love this child so much.

1005
01:39:31,773 --> 01:39:36,123
Like my personal experience of running this intervention with that this is going to change the world.

1006
01:39:36,423 --> 01:39:45,103
This is amazing. And then when the hour one is over at five years, you know, I realized them not as too facts,

1007
01:39:45,213 --> 01:39:49,292
but it wasn't anything to write home about in the fact that none of you probably had heard of it.

1008
01:39:49,293 --> 01:39:53,403
Suggest that people weren't like, wow, I is this movie is going to change the world.

1009
01:39:53,763 --> 01:39:56,373
You know, we had these really we didn't do any harm.

1010
01:39:56,823 --> 01:40:03,273
You know, at six weeks, the kids in waste, their suicidal ideation went down a lot faster than the kids in the other group.

1011
01:40:03,663 --> 01:40:11,972
But it really wasn't anything to write home about. And so I think one of the lessons for me in this intervention is that is like patience.

1012
01:40:11,973 --> 01:40:17,403
And if you believe in something like, look, longitudinally, you know, get longitudinal data.

1013
01:40:17,403 --> 01:40:25,563
And so the story of that is that she was in a work group where people were saying, how can we get more science around suicide prevention?

1014
01:40:26,973 --> 01:40:33,483
Look at other longitudinal data sets that we have in our nation that might be relevant to suicide.

1015
01:40:33,483 --> 01:40:38,853
And and could we go back and look at some of these data sets and see, you know, if we look over time?

1016
01:40:39,183 --> 01:40:47,343
So that's what we did. We actually pulled the National Death Index data out of all the kids in our study about ten, 15 years after the study ended.

1017
01:40:47,613 --> 01:40:54,063
And that's how we found out that way, is she actually does have a very meaningful impact.

1018
01:40:54,123 --> 01:41:01,683
So you can see there were 15 deaths in that, 448 kids, and 13 of those deaths were in the treatment as usual.

1019
01:41:02,853 --> 01:41:08,163
That's a whopping five, two whopping effects that I'd never forget in my whole life.

1020
01:41:08,343 --> 01:41:17,643
Shell walking down the hallway and telling me, you know, when this data came in and you're, like, crying, you know, it's it's really quite remarkable.

1021
01:41:18,123 --> 01:41:27,873
So one thing that so here's the survival analysis, Kathleen, is way a study in the bottom line is cheating as usual.

1022
01:41:28,203 --> 01:41:34,732
One thing that I just really want to point out that's so interesting for those of you who are interested in public health and injury prevention,

1023
01:41:34,733 --> 01:41:41,333
is that these kids didn't all die of suicide. They died for a lot of different reasons.

1024
01:41:41,693 --> 01:41:50,663
There's a very big overlap between, you know, drug overdoses and sort of some undetermined deaths.

1025
01:41:51,233 --> 01:41:57,382
So we don't know how exactly why she worked.

1026
01:41:57,383 --> 01:42:06,473
But one of the things that we do know is that kids who were in waste, she got more treatment and they specifically got more substance abuse treatment.

1027
01:42:06,893 --> 01:42:09,173
So we really think that that, you know,

1028
01:42:09,173 --> 01:42:17,933
that mechanism of really encouraging kids to stick with it and stay in treatment and having their community really support that made a difference.

1029
01:42:19,503 --> 01:42:23,493
Okay. Be sure you get on that and it's probably a good place for a break for that.

1030
01:42:25,323 --> 01:42:31,353
Real quick questions, Sampras. How much did the timing of the delivery play an intervention?

1031
01:42:31,353 --> 01:42:36,113
Because. I'm just after ten and you it.

1032
01:42:36,233 --> 01:42:42,382
I'm assuming that it happens after tonight, but I'm wondering if the data shows that this works.

1033
01:42:42,383 --> 01:42:46,863
Why not implemented in school? That just an activity like something like.

1034
01:42:46,903 --> 01:42:53,552
Yeah. Yeah. We have a lot of questions going forward and I am happy.

1035
01:42:53,553 --> 01:42:57,773
Okay. There's a whole bunch of resources on here for you guys and I'm happy to share it.

1036
01:42:59,463 --> 01:43:03,243
Just an idea that sent you the right slide deck. Okay.

1037
01:43:03,513 --> 01:43:05,643
So this is like after one of my flights.

1038
01:43:07,863 --> 01:43:14,583
There are a lot of folks now who not a lot, but there's a team of us who are working on like, what are the next steps?

1039
01:43:14,593 --> 01:43:18,963
You know, what else do we need to figure out, as I mentioned.

1040
01:43:19,053 --> 01:43:25,173
So one of the things we've done why is she was originally done for kids who had received

1041
01:43:25,173 --> 01:43:29,883
an inpatient hospitalization and it was offered in the three months after they got out.

1042
01:43:30,213 --> 01:43:36,933
We know that one of the highest risk times for death by suicide across the lifespan is after discharge.

1043
01:43:37,323 --> 01:43:41,793
Right. You have to go back to your life and your life still sucks and it's really hard.

1044
01:43:42,123 --> 01:43:51,273
So that's a really high risk time. If you ask me right now, the kids who get a bed in this country, they're the lucky one and the lucky one.

1045
01:43:51,603 --> 01:43:58,413
There are kids all over this country who are sitting in emergency departments and they can't get a bed and they really need one.

1046
01:43:58,863 --> 01:44:05,682
And so we did do a study to see if y is he was feasible to get started in the emergency department.

1047
01:44:05,683 --> 01:44:08,643
And we did that here in Children's Emergency Services at night.

1048
01:44:08,913 --> 01:44:18,513
And yes, worked well, even our 34 that's pending right now where you would recruit kids out of the emergency department at children's to training,

1049
01:44:18,723 --> 01:44:26,733
really interested in trying to serve this population of African-American youth who are showing very,

1050
01:44:26,733 --> 01:44:30,543
very concerning elevations in their death by suicide right now.

1051
01:44:30,903 --> 01:44:37,292
So this is really trying to work on why is she in this community really trying to harness some of the protective factors

1052
01:44:37,293 --> 01:44:44,313
that we know are amazing in the African-American community and try to bring them to bear quickly for kids who are hurting.

1053
01:44:44,613 --> 01:44:47,642
Because as you guys, you know, may have had this experience,

1054
01:44:47,643 --> 01:44:52,413
there's often some stigma around mental health that is unique in the African-American community,

1055
01:44:52,413 --> 01:45:00,783
but also amazing resiliency and amazing opportunities for getting kids connected to church at their,

1056
01:45:00,963 --> 01:45:05,163
you know, fictive can and Angie's and all these people. So, you know,

1057
01:45:05,163 --> 01:45:11,822
we have a grant that's pending to just pull kids out of the emergency department who don't need

1058
01:45:11,823 --> 01:45:18,873
to go in-patient and use as teeth really quickly to help them to link to outpatient treatment.

1059
01:45:19,113 --> 01:45:26,942
Right. Because again, we see really concerning linkage rates for everybody, but especially for African-American youth.

1060
01:45:26,943 --> 01:45:32,072
There's so many different barriers, you know, insurance and transportation and all that jazz.

1061
01:45:32,073 --> 01:45:39,123
But we've partnered with one of the agencies for the D1 to Trade Integrated Health Network Exchange and Wayne County.

1062
01:45:39,543 --> 01:45:46,683
And that's our hope is like when you pull together that team, you're going to get kids to engage better in treatment.

1063
01:45:47,223 --> 01:45:55,413
So it's like really trying to integrate ways to like a CBT approach, but people are doing lots of different like let's try to figure out how it works.

1064
01:45:55,663 --> 01:46:00,363
Let's try to figure out how we can tailor it for other people. Yeah.

1065
01:46:01,113 --> 01:46:07,113
Can. Can someone like the French see us as adults or excluded?

1066
01:46:07,263 --> 01:46:12,343
Yeah. Love that question. Okay, so the first you know how interventions work, right?

1067
01:46:12,363 --> 01:46:17,483
You have an idea, then you get pilot data, you figure out what doesn't work, then you get the big money, right?

1068
01:46:17,733 --> 01:46:26,673
So with the pilot data, this was a foundation grant that Cheryl got from the account how actually for ways she won and we did that.

1069
01:46:26,673 --> 01:46:31,233
Kids pick friends. They were allowed to pick one person under the age of 18.

1070
01:46:31,773 --> 01:46:40,563
What we realized is that it was a lot for a kid under the age of 18 to manage, and they often flipped out.

1071
01:46:41,133 --> 01:46:50,793
They often didn't finish. That's her that we are worried that they got through Gen-X for the teen who were, you know, the kid with an elevated risk.

1072
01:46:51,333 --> 01:46:56,073
And it just felt like a lot to ask for another, you know, another.

1073
01:46:57,543 --> 01:47:02,523
And the other thing that we changed from the pilot to the r-1 was the length of the intervention.

1074
01:47:02,523 --> 01:47:05,493
So the first iteration was a six month intervention.

1075
01:47:05,823 --> 01:47:12,733
And what ended up happening is like life goes on, you know, six months is a long time for your English teacher and me.

1076
01:47:13,213 --> 01:47:20,733
I don't know what happened. So we start in 2 to 3 months for the data that the why is due to intervention.

1077
01:47:20,733 --> 01:47:22,923
That's the one you guys read about in the in the article.

1078
01:47:23,373 --> 01:47:34,502
Yeah, I have I think you showed a slide of showing how women tend to have higher suicide ideations and everything,

1079
01:47:34,503 --> 01:47:37,893
but the rates of suicide is higher for men.

1080
01:47:38,283 --> 01:47:45,453
How is it like what explanations are behind women being successful to women?

1081
01:47:46,233 --> 01:47:49,073
Yeah, that's a great question. We just got out of that study.

1082
01:47:49,753 --> 01:48:02,163
And so historically, you know, many people have thought that firearms are a big piece of that, right?

1083
01:48:02,193 --> 01:48:10,263
That men have a higher likelihood of choosing that really highly lethal method.

1084
01:48:10,683 --> 01:48:16,473
And that's why they don't survive. That's what people have had historically.

1085
01:48:16,833 --> 01:48:24,453
You know, I think it's a great question. I mean, I don't know that we have all the answers, but I do think firearms, you know,

1086
01:48:24,453 --> 01:48:30,663
if you look at that data about who chooses to use a firearm, it is men and using firearms at a higher rate.

1087
01:48:30,933 --> 01:48:36,303
I will say the number of women who are using firearms is increasing at a concerning rate right now.

1088
01:48:36,483 --> 01:48:40,493
But. I'm tired of this.

1089
01:48:40,493 --> 01:48:47,663
But for the adults who are nominated as their like I know you said that you're they're told it's not their responsibility,

1090
01:48:47,663 --> 01:48:50,863
but is there like support for them? Because I feel like you can be very happy.

1091
01:48:50,903 --> 01:48:54,413
Oh, yeah, for sure. That is a huge piece of waste.

1092
01:48:54,653 --> 01:49:05,513
So as an intervention specialist, my job was I would nominate with the kid, I would do the psycho educational session with support people.

1093
01:49:05,783 --> 01:49:10,073
And then I called each of them every single week. How are you doing?

1094
01:49:10,613 --> 01:49:14,123
Have you talked to them? Are you worried about anything? What's going on?

1095
01:49:14,333 --> 01:49:18,083
So it is facilitated by a mental health professional.

1096
01:49:18,773 --> 01:49:22,343
You know, people had really varying needs.

1097
01:49:22,863 --> 01:49:28,853
Some people like, I'm fine, I'm good, I'm good. And other people were like, I am very concerned about this kid.

1098
01:49:29,973 --> 01:49:33,923
You know, another thing that I think was interesting just anecdotally is that,

1099
01:49:35,843 --> 01:49:40,463
you know, most of the teens that I was administering, a parent was on the team.

1100
01:49:40,883 --> 01:49:48,143
And, you know, there were a number of things that I can just remember happening where I was like, well, that's not okay.

1101
01:49:48,863 --> 01:49:52,703
You know, like there was some coaching of parents around how to manage the health care system.

1102
01:49:53,003 --> 01:49:56,993
You know, like I will never forget a man whose kid had made a very suicidal,

1103
01:49:57,173 --> 01:50:02,632
very serious attempt, whose kid was being seen in community mental health.

1104
01:50:02,633 --> 01:50:06,923
And the mom, when I called her one week, was just crying, crying,

1105
01:50:06,923 --> 01:50:15,773
crying and said that her child had been discharged from therapy after like, I don't know, six weeks or something.

1106
01:50:15,773 --> 01:50:23,513
And it was a pretty short and when the mom asked the therapist if the kid was still thinking about killing himself,

1107
01:50:23,663 --> 01:50:27,923
the therapist said, I can't tell you that because it's a HIPA violation.

1108
01:50:28,373 --> 01:50:31,763
And I was like, Oh my God, this kid is 16.

1109
01:50:31,973 --> 01:50:34,133
You know, the right to privacy actually belongs to the mom.

1110
01:50:34,223 --> 01:50:38,513
So there's like sometimes that funky stuff, you know, that happens in that health care system.

1111
01:50:38,513 --> 01:50:44,153
And we did get some guidance around that kind of stuff. I was like, You call him right back right now.

1112
01:50:45,563 --> 01:50:51,292
And if the parents like or whoever was like, Oh, I'm very concerned, you have to like escalate.

1113
01:50:51,293 --> 01:50:58,793
Then what was going on? Yeah, I mean, we had obviously a risk management arm, you know, for the study and there was a protocol,

1114
01:50:58,853 --> 01:51:04,133
you know, and again, a big piece of that educational session was what are the warning signs?

1115
01:51:04,853 --> 01:51:09,723
You know, what? What are the red flags? And if you see those red flags, then what should you do?

1116
01:51:09,743 --> 01:51:16,643
So every support person you know knew about the lifeline, knew about 911, you know, about their nearest emergency room.

1117
01:51:17,153 --> 01:51:22,873
And we had a, you know, risk manager. Oh.

1118
01:51:24,693 --> 01:51:30,363
What about if the parents was the cause and would have been the person that was?

1119
01:51:30,693 --> 01:51:34,443
Yeah. Why do you think that? The kids. Why do I need my period?

1120
01:51:35,643 --> 01:51:40,653
Yeah. You know, like, how can a being from a guardian or did it happen before?

1121
01:51:41,103 --> 01:51:46,053
The parents did not have to be on the support sheet. The parents had to consent to the kids.

1122
01:51:46,323 --> 01:51:51,513
Whoever the Guardian was, had to consent for the child's participation in the study.

1123
01:51:51,513 --> 01:51:52,683
And the kid had to us them.

1124
01:51:53,163 --> 01:52:03,033
So we had to have both, um, the parents had to approve of everybody that with a kid nominated on the team to be sure they were safe,

1125
01:52:03,303 --> 01:52:11,283
positive influences on the kid, but the parent did not have to be on the team and therefore it was rare.

1126
01:52:11,733 --> 01:52:16,083
But there were definitely some kids who didn't want a parent on their team and like, that's okay.

1127
01:52:16,113 --> 01:52:22,923
You know, we definitely know that family dysfunction is a risk factor for suicide.

1128
01:52:23,283 --> 01:52:33,033
And, um, you know, there are a lot of, you know, really difficult chronic parent child relationships that contribute to stress for kids.

1129
01:52:33,033 --> 01:52:38,762
So, um, you know, that was definitely on our radar.

1130
01:52:38,763 --> 01:52:45,242
But on the other hand, most of these kids were going home to this setting and they were going home to that setting.

1131
01:52:45,243 --> 01:52:53,763
So it was nice to have another point of contact, you know, for that parent.

1132
01:52:54,723 --> 01:52:58,173
I will say one of the things I'm really excited about if we get this new grant

1133
01:52:58,173 --> 01:53:02,973
funded is that the way this project worked last year was totally separate.

1134
01:53:03,303 --> 01:53:06,363
It was like its own island as the intervention specialist.

1135
01:53:06,363 --> 01:53:11,283
I called the therapist once. They said, Hey, your kid, the kid that's on your caseload is in our study.

1136
01:53:11,583 --> 01:53:15,663
Here's my number. I'll call you if anything comes up. And I'm worried about this kid.

1137
01:53:15,843 --> 01:53:19,473
We're going to here's what it's about and encourage them to stay in treatment like I'm here.

1138
01:53:19,773 --> 01:53:24,572
But honestly, I hardly ever talk to anybody. Therapists, they just, like, leave it the voicemail.

1139
01:53:24,573 --> 01:53:30,933
You know something? We were in relationship at all in the intervention, especially the way we this grant that we have pending.

1140
01:53:30,933 --> 01:53:36,453
Right now, there's an integration between wellness and CBT for suicide prevention.

1141
01:53:36,693 --> 01:53:43,352
So the intervention specialist for why is she is going to be the kid's therapist so so I think that's going to be

1142
01:53:43,353 --> 01:53:50,763
a really cool synergy because the therapist is going to know the grandma and the therapist is going to know that,

1143
01:53:51,093 --> 01:53:57,662
you know, when I'm a bad teacher and they're going to know the kids in a way that I didn't know.

1144
01:53:57,663 --> 01:54:02,103
I mean, I met the kid on the unit, but I wasn't seeing that kid every week in therapy.

1145
01:54:02,253 --> 01:54:04,263
Right? I didn't really know them.

1146
01:54:05,403 --> 01:54:12,303
So I think that's going to be a really neat thing to explore and see if we get that grant so you can just sense the positive that.

1147
01:54:14,413 --> 01:54:22,423
So for the support person, were they trained to include what to talk about doing the woodland conversations with the kids?

1148
01:54:22,903 --> 01:54:26,263
Were they trained to talk about anything?

1149
01:54:26,563 --> 01:54:26,833
You know,

1150
01:54:27,223 --> 01:54:36,913
usually we train people to talk about we like to talk about certain things with the kids so they train in any way they topics that they include.

1151
01:54:36,943 --> 01:54:45,523
If you guys see the manual running around, I think there's like information about what's in a psycho and sessions are in that manual.

1152
01:54:45,913 --> 01:54:55,003
But there were a few components. One was like, you know, just some basic information about suicide risk and the mental health model.

1153
01:54:55,003 --> 01:54:58,803
And, you know, we would go over like, what is the kid's diagnosis?

1154
01:54:58,813 --> 01:55:02,683
What does that look like? You know, some basic stuff like this kid is depressed.

1155
01:55:02,953 --> 01:55:07,533
What does this look like? Or This kid has ADHD. What might this look like in your interaction with this kid?

1156
01:55:07,543 --> 01:55:13,663
So just trying to put some context around. There was definitely a piece around, you know, how to talk about suicide.

1157
01:55:14,383 --> 01:55:18,943
It's okay to ask them how they're doing. You're not going to put the idea in their head.

1158
01:55:19,333 --> 01:55:26,083
But this is a very basic psychoeducation like gatekeeper training, basically this event.

1159
01:55:26,113 --> 01:55:29,443
They were definitely not being trained as clinicians.

1160
01:55:29,803 --> 01:55:32,293
They weren't being trained to do therapy at all.

1161
01:55:32,533 --> 01:55:40,453
They were really we tried to give them sort of, you know, like it was a 90 minute, 60 to 90 minute session that included all these components.

1162
01:55:40,783 --> 01:55:44,113
There was a piece about adherence, testing and treatment.

1163
01:55:44,543 --> 01:55:48,433
It's about the complexities of talking to teenagers sometimes, which.

1164
01:55:49,843 --> 01:55:53,953
It can be challenging sometimes and how to manage risk.

1165
01:55:54,283 --> 01:56:00,253
That was really what the training was. So what do you mean about a weekly pass where they train on what to talk about?

1166
01:56:00,613 --> 01:56:04,193
Oh, no, no, no, not really. It was really like, how are you doing?

1167
01:56:04,213 --> 01:56:14,023
What's going on this week? And it really varied. You know, I think there were some kids that got a lot of social support, really just caused a lot.

1168
01:56:15,493 --> 01:56:26,133
You know, I think one of Cheryl's theories about why did this work so well is intervention specialists just being like an extra grown up from Kevin.

1169
01:56:26,413 --> 01:56:31,992
I mean, you guys know, like, maybe you didn't tell your mom that you were drinking at that party on Saturday night,

1170
01:56:31,993 --> 01:56:39,493
but you might tell your best friend's mom, you know, or you may tell your older cousin, you know.

1171
01:56:39,493 --> 01:56:45,283
And so it was surrounding kids with people that they could go to for different me.

1172
01:56:45,793 --> 01:56:49,833
Do you know, I mean, if you look at like social support models, like there's all different kinds of social support.

1173
01:56:49,843 --> 01:56:55,093
Like sometimes it's tangible, like I need a money or I need somebody to take me here, right?

1174
01:56:55,303 --> 01:56:57,253
Then it was like this emotional support. But.

1175
01:56:57,453 --> 01:57:07,272
But we do wonder if kids were talking how to have a team where they can selectively talk about things and,

1176
01:57:07,273 --> 01:57:14,743
like, match, you know, with people and that that encouragement of, like, good choices, really.

1177
01:57:14,953 --> 01:57:22,933
Do you think you ought to be doing that? Like you're on a depressant, you know, drinking as whatever, you know, whatever any of us might say.

1178
01:57:23,083 --> 01:57:26,583
And I'm thinking about like my daughter's friends that are sitting around my kitchen table right now,

1179
01:57:26,583 --> 01:57:31,812
and I'm like, Really, guys, I don't know if you got a good idea. I'm sure you know.

1180
01:57:31,813 --> 01:57:36,793
So it's just trying to grab that kid around with different people that they could talk to about different things.

1181
01:57:37,033 --> 01:57:40,063
So really very great question.

1182
01:57:40,273 --> 01:57:49,103
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just last one and then they a separate you the testing a little bit but how did you get buy in from the kid.

1183
01:57:49,193 --> 01:57:55,693
I was the into their room as you are like how did you get them to trust you and participate.

1184
01:57:56,443 --> 01:58:04,813
Yeah I mean we certainly I the concert diagram is probably in that first paper that I sent of like how many kids said no.

1185
01:58:05,173 --> 01:58:11,143
I mean, certainly kids had no, you know, from kids that no, some parents said no.

1186
01:58:12,643 --> 01:58:19,033
The fact that it was randomized with an issue, you know, parents are like, well, I'll say out if you can guarantee you get this program.

1187
01:58:19,033 --> 01:58:22,093
And I was like, that's not how randomization work.

1188
01:58:22,103 --> 01:58:29,113
You know, I can't tell you they're going to get it. So people definitely said, no, we paid them.

1189
01:58:29,563 --> 01:58:33,943
I mean, that was a consideration for anybody.

1190
01:58:34,423 --> 01:58:43,303
The support people we did not pay the anybody who was participating in the ongoing assessments that paid for participating in the assessments.

1191
01:58:43,633 --> 01:58:51,523
So there was a six week, a three month, a six month and a 12 month follow up that was separate and blinded from the intervention.

1192
01:58:51,583 --> 01:58:54,443
Right. So I was an intervention specialist. I was doing the intervention.

1193
01:58:54,453 --> 01:58:59,713
A separate team of people was doing the assessments with kids, but they got paid for each of those.

1194
01:59:00,043 --> 01:59:05,503
But there was a factor for some people, you know, even for people.

1195
01:59:05,503 --> 01:59:09,943
What I would say to families are families trying to get people to say, yes, it was.

1196
01:59:10,333 --> 01:59:17,683
Even if they're not in the intervention, your kid is going to get a higher level of monitoring than they would get otherwise.

1197
01:59:18,073 --> 01:59:23,773
And so if at that six week follow up, they tell us that they are really having concerning levels of risk,

1198
01:59:24,163 --> 01:59:31,033
we are going to, you know, act on that and we are going to reach out and we're going to put a plan in place.

1199
01:59:31,033 --> 01:59:36,612
So that was like an extra thing that everybody in the study got, that level of monitoring.

1200
01:59:36,613 --> 01:59:40,033
And that was comforting for, you know, for a lot of parents.

1201
01:59:44,483 --> 01:59:48,273
Well, thank you so much for introducing the study and we're going to have some more time afterwards.

1202
01:59:48,663 --> 01:59:52,683
So let's take a break. Let's go over 155 and come back.

1203
01:59:53,193 --> 01:59:56,633
We will at some point move a little bit into the screening conversation, too.

1204
01:59:56,643 --> 02:00:05,733
But I think if there's any other follow up questions and your buzzer, we'll be happy to answer that manual on the Internet.

1205
02:00:06,333 --> 02:00:10,863
Yes. The other thing is publicly available information.

1206
02:00:11,073 --> 02:00:25,743
Yeah, sure. Yeah. I'm so sorry.

1207
02:00:26,553 --> 02:00:35,373
I had no idea that you wanted to hear it.

1208
02:00:35,403 --> 02:00:39,663
I remember everything. Yeah. A lot of things are for you.

1209
02:00:39,753 --> 02:00:43,713
Yeah, they are. You both are awesome. Thank you. That's a good question.

1210
02:00:44,613 --> 02:00:51,323
What you really need to know, I'm like, Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1211
02:00:51,363 --> 02:01:09,243
You say, yeah, I do need to get my manual to be closing the door is a nice I know there are like you know there's parole acquittal.

1212
02:01:11,703 --> 02:01:16,772
I also read the project finder like eBay like a real like I want to see how in

1213
02:01:16,773 --> 02:01:21,273
any of our one like would have to find like all the measures and all that stuff.

1214
02:01:23,853 --> 02:01:31,313
But I mean, this is people over 20 years old, I really don't have it how they don't have a real competition.

1215
02:01:31,323 --> 02:01:40,923
And I know I mean, I literally like this is what I got, which is nothing I worried about this.

1216
02:01:42,073 --> 02:01:47,973
Yeah, they're having that transportation.

1217
02:01:48,013 --> 02:02:01,583
I would love to get my information.

1218
02:02:01,813 --> 02:02:18,033
Yeah. Yeah. So what was that like through that process?

1219
02:02:18,513 --> 02:02:23,243
But every now and again, you know, because I left.

1220
02:02:24,633 --> 02:02:28,313
Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, I read for fun.

1221
02:02:28,983 --> 02:02:42,273
It's good. Very good at all. I mean, I think that's the thing.

1222
02:02:43,053 --> 02:02:53,403
You don't know who I was like, Yeah, I have no idea.

1223
02:02:54,583 --> 02:03:00,263
But you know what happened in there?

1224
02:03:00,273 --> 02:03:09,423
I have something that was like this when I was pregnant.

1225
02:03:10,413 --> 02:03:24,093
Mother It was very, very difficult to get together.

1226
02:03:24,783 --> 02:03:41,463
Yes, I felt exactly. But in one sense, boy, that was close because I was going to find out what it was.

1227
02:03:41,683 --> 02:03:46,303
You know, it rolled around like this interview.

1228
02:03:47,693 --> 02:04:00,203
Well, for, you know, well, I'll get it out of the ordinary people that whatever that.

1229
02:04:03,413 --> 02:04:09,243
Yes. I mean, it really denies the depth of gender sexuality.

1230
02:04:12,173 --> 02:04:21,743
I think, as she said, she might be a bit one should be.

1231
02:04:21,773 --> 02:04:29,303
I'm thinking about 35, 48, but it is like a chronic illness for her.

1232
02:04:30,653 --> 02:04:35,893
Yeah, I really do.

1233
02:04:37,503 --> 02:04:41,563
I mean, there's nothing wrong with, you know, those living.

1234
02:04:42,403 --> 02:05:04,283
Yeah. Yeah. If you're like, you know where you are and, you know, I'm happy to be, you know, your lives with the work program and the program.

1235
02:05:04,303 --> 02:05:09,543
But I need one year old boys.

1236
02:05:10,493 --> 02:05:17,123
And you. Are you doing? Yeah, I'm the adolescent.

1237
02:05:17,123 --> 02:05:21,243
Sometimes you're not supposed to be going. Okay. I'm.

1238
02:05:22,173 --> 02:05:26,263
I'm a really lovely person. So sorry. You know, he was loud.

1239
02:05:26,873 --> 02:05:31,192
Yeah. Oh, no. Oh, class existing.

1240
02:05:31,193 --> 02:05:34,913
This semester, I was able to do 644.

1241
02:05:35,153 --> 02:05:39,953
But your boss was a treated. That's one of the things that you take with the other ones I.

1242
02:05:41,003 --> 02:05:45,232
Oh yeah. There's actually I think I did mostly ride with actually training for trainers.

1243
02:05:45,233 --> 02:05:51,993
That's how you say, oh, I want to have a better person than you.

1244
02:05:52,123 --> 02:06:03,193
But yeah, I like that with know it's better when I say I want to be able to pick a ball.

1245
02:06:03,263 --> 02:06:08,542
I yeah. I mean I want to have that in my house.

1246
02:06:08,543 --> 02:06:10,413
I don't have anything to say.

1247
02:06:11,013 --> 02:06:22,943
I mean, I don't like all by myself because I think I think it's important to get and I'm enrolled in school credits right now.

1248
02:06:22,943 --> 02:06:43,173
I will drop out for currently I will drop one of them because I, I think what I want, I think you do it and I just think, yeah, yeah.

1249
02:06:43,613 --> 02:06:59,753
That is why I like to think about something like that.

1250
02:06:59,973 --> 02:07:12,563
And you're just hired to really know what it's like for a while, you know?

1251
02:07:17,213 --> 02:07:21,843
I'm like, I'm considering just playing in your face.

1252
02:07:22,023 --> 02:07:33,933
It doesn't matter what say you need to fill your requirements, what they think is the right one.

1253
02:07:36,593 --> 02:07:44,722
I don't know why.

1254
02:07:44,723 --> 02:08:08,463
I don't think it does. I think it was violence, but I don't think it was like 97, 129, 3999.

1255
02:08:10,573 --> 02:08:23,003
I hope it means more than anything, I don't care for you.

1256
02:08:23,773 --> 02:08:43,503
Take at least two years for it, but I get excited that it lives all in the blood for the government.

1257
02:08:44,613 --> 02:08:47,713
I just.

1258
02:08:50,883 --> 02:09:06,433
Really? I need to be able to tell you why you're doing everything right now.

1259
02:09:07,703 --> 02:09:22,773
It is be like I've been hearing how you couldn't even get out of it.

1260
02:09:22,833 --> 02:09:28,123
Like, I don't know what I think.

1261
02:09:28,133 --> 02:09:36,343
Let's not even watch it. Can I get a regular guy like that in my office this week?

1262
02:09:36,343 --> 02:09:41,113
I've had my goal. I've done work.

1263
02:09:41,503 --> 02:09:53,183
Work? Yeah. Go to bed. And I haven't had time to even see just how we're going to hear their five year plan.

1264
02:09:54,803 --> 02:10:07,093
And I feel like that is a problem. I just thought that I was like, Yeah, and he's attacking him, but he's very fragile person.

1265
02:10:07,423 --> 02:10:14,733
So if you want to hurt your feelings, I her hurt the internet.

1266
02:10:14,833 --> 02:10:21,213
So yeah, I think like B has done just no really.

1267
02:10:22,063 --> 02:10:26,303
Yeah. They in their interest maybe.

1268
02:10:26,493 --> 02:10:30,803
I guess. But there's been a lot of them.

1269
02:10:32,833 --> 02:10:48,552
But I don't if you want to do that, I'll tell you, I've chosen to not have anything for even abuses or otherwise.

1270
02:10:48,553 --> 02:10:51,793
I don't care. I like. I can't.

1271
02:10:53,053 --> 02:10:59,503
Hey, folks, their last 25 minutes here, we're going to shift the conversation just a teeny bit,

1272
02:10:59,563 --> 02:11:02,563
because I think actually our city touched on a lot of this anyways,

1273
02:11:02,563 --> 02:11:11,023
but I cannot help myself because I was presented with a methodological reminder, which I love, so I figured to get our juices flowing again.

1274
02:11:11,383 --> 02:11:18,073
We randomization in this. Why is the intervention from therapy usual to either a therapy plus?

1275
02:11:18,163 --> 02:11:21,792
Why a c randomization? What's so? Why is that so useful?

1276
02:11:21,793 --> 02:11:28,153
Why do we do it? What to do it for us. We it's like you would result in death.

1277
02:11:29,413 --> 02:11:33,163
Okay, but ah. So what kind of bias increases external.

1278
02:11:34,143 --> 02:11:39,493
It does. Why not only external validity but also internal bleeding as well.

1279
02:11:39,493 --> 02:11:43,073
Why? What are we trying to construct here with, huh?

1280
02:11:44,323 --> 02:11:49,003
Causation. Yeah. So we are looking for causation, right? This is our treatment condition, right?

1281
02:11:49,003 --> 02:11:55,213
This is our control condition. What's our control condition? Designed to do? This is our comparison.

1282
02:11:55,453 --> 02:11:57,913
Is there a comparison group? Is there counterfactual? Right.

1283
02:11:58,663 --> 02:12:03,943
Because we could just give everybody wise t why wouldn't we just give everybody wise t but that everybody needs like,

1284
02:12:04,393 --> 02:12:09,313
well, oh, nothing and nothing that I might add.

1285
02:12:09,343 --> 02:12:12,433
Well, it's not all and not every community is in resource.

1286
02:12:12,673 --> 02:12:19,212
It's this drug. So to show it's a factor, we have to be a little firm like, oh, you have to show something's affected.

1287
02:12:19,213 --> 02:12:22,753
You have to be able to prove like that. It's not a factor.

1288
02:12:22,873 --> 02:12:34,273
Yeah. So by having like a comparison group that doesn't think that's the key here is a word is going to see that otherwise you're going to tell them,

1289
02:12:34,453 --> 02:12:38,533
okay, yeah. Yeah, you can see that.

1290
02:12:39,403 --> 02:12:41,982
Right. So you're you're on there. You're absolutely right. Right here.

1291
02:12:41,983 --> 02:12:48,523
So the idea is, if we are in a perfect world, we give care, we have kids, we'd watch them kind of progress and see their outcomes.

1292
02:12:48,523 --> 02:12:52,993
And we go back. You take those same kids and give them what you see and see how they might differ.

1293
02:12:53,083 --> 02:12:58,003
We can't do that in practice. So what we're trying to do is construct an equivalent comparison group, right?

1294
02:12:58,183 --> 02:13:04,003
And where are the best ways to establish that equivalence is using a randomization procedure.

1295
02:13:04,153 --> 02:13:07,153
Why? Why randomization? What's it what's it kind of controlling for?

1296
02:13:09,043 --> 02:13:11,893
We can see some of the differences. We know some differences.

1297
02:13:11,893 --> 02:13:17,802
When people are coming in, we could assign them to groups based on their their demographic characteristics or some of their history.

1298
02:13:17,803 --> 02:13:22,423
Right. We can we can we can start to parse out folks and put them into groups based on that information.

1299
02:13:22,603 --> 02:13:30,792
But why randomization? What does that add? Despite some challenges, what does it add that we can't just do from taking a profile from a questionnaire?

1300
02:13:30,793 --> 02:13:37,103
Well, you know, the. Well, kind of, yeah.

1301
02:13:37,113 --> 02:13:44,752
It's all the intangibles. And the reason why I'm harping on this point right now is there is it's a big lift and it creates problems there.

1302
02:13:44,753 --> 02:13:52,893
There is always the concern that you have a very effective treatment that you might be dying or denying or those from not receiving that treatment.

1303
02:13:53,043 --> 02:13:57,873
We don't know at this point of randomization. We don't know if last year is making a difference in individuals.

1304
02:13:58,503 --> 02:14:03,183
But there are some programs with a lot of evidence base, and we might still be considering randomization.

1305
02:14:03,363 --> 02:14:06,152
We might find consent concerns. Well, wait a minute here.

1306
02:14:06,153 --> 02:14:13,533
You're telling me that I can get wraparound support services for my child if I'm in the intervention group, but not not if I'm in the control group.

1307
02:14:13,713 --> 02:14:18,153
That's a big concern. As a parent, you might be very upset about regarding whomever it might be.

1308
02:14:18,343 --> 02:14:23,642
Right. So it's never going to be a perfect strategy, but it is one of our best scientific and rigorous approaches.

1309
02:14:23,643 --> 02:14:29,193
So when you are weighing evidence, you're saying, okay, I have this study and it has a control group, it has a treatment group.

1310
02:14:29,463 --> 02:14:37,053
How is that control group derived? Is it a reasonable comparison or counterfactual to those that actually did receive the treatment?

1311
02:14:37,263 --> 02:14:44,703
Is there something other there? Why is t that might explain why there were these group differences 15 years later then

1312
02:14:44,703 --> 02:14:49,833
the fact that one get assigned to this group and the other was with treatment as usual.

1313
02:14:50,253 --> 02:14:54,923
Those are the kind of here's a great example of this, right? If you look at what was the cause of death, right?

1314
02:14:54,933 --> 02:14:59,003
That like a drug overdose, this was a major cause of death, right.

1315
02:14:59,013 --> 02:15:03,933
As JAMA article. Well, we weren't interested in substance abuse when we designed the study.

1316
02:15:04,203 --> 02:15:06,213
Not on our radar at all.

1317
02:15:06,663 --> 02:15:14,643
We were stratifying kids into the randomization sample by whether or not they'd made multiple attempts, like how serious was their risk?

1318
02:15:15,033 --> 02:15:21,093
We were stratifying like really trying to make sure in advance that our groups were equivalent on those things.

1319
02:15:21,453 --> 02:15:25,382
We don't think it's all about substance abuse. We weren't stratified based on that.

1320
02:15:25,383 --> 02:15:29,313
We were we weren't even measuring it that well at the beginning.

1321
02:15:29,313 --> 02:15:32,373
It ended up being like a major factor.

1322
02:15:33,213 --> 02:15:40,263
And, you know, it's just so important. And it should be able to show that your groups were equivalent at the beginning on things that you hadn't even.

1323
02:15:40,893 --> 02:15:49,382
Yeah. And there are through uranus's for that power analysis video and posted yet I will post I swear at some point in when you have more than 250,

1324
02:15:49,383 --> 02:15:53,703
you have 200 people. The likelihood that you're going to capture some people with a history of substance use

1325
02:15:54,213 --> 02:15:58,383
others with higher or lower in both conditions so that it more or less bounces out.

1326
02:15:58,533 --> 02:16:05,822
That's one variable, but there are innumerable characteristics that we could never control for in the way that we select individuals or we have

1327
02:16:05,823 --> 02:16:12,203
so small we'd have cells with so small numbers that we wouldn't be able to stratify them or assign them in the same way.

1328
02:16:12,203 --> 02:16:16,653
Yes. Here. So I only ask this because of a different class that was brought up.

1329
02:16:17,433 --> 02:16:26,823
What about quasi experimentation with like so is that possible because of how this was explained to us in graduate or this?

1330
02:16:27,363 --> 02:16:33,243
Dr. Daniel Lu I think he had to be, I guess like how we get things on our level.

1331
02:16:33,603 --> 02:16:39,893
But it sounds like you can like you can have them like have a comparison group of,

1332
02:16:39,913 --> 02:16:45,273
in the model of like people with like matching characteristics and then I'm doing it.

1333
02:16:45,783 --> 02:16:47,543
But is that like one way?

1334
02:16:47,553 --> 02:16:56,403
Is it, would that be useful in this area or is like, that's not for for me when I'm studying an intervention around suicide prevention,

1335
02:16:56,403 --> 02:17:00,813
for me, the biggest issue is who is the funder and what is the goal?

1336
02:17:01,113 --> 02:17:08,342
Okay, so this is an animation study, the goal with science, rigorous, rigorous science.

1337
02:17:08,343 --> 02:17:14,783
So that is a randomized controlled trial. When SAMHSA is funding the their goal is not science.

1338
02:17:15,123 --> 02:17:23,222
Their goal is get it out in the community, do it and learn something and please publish know then.

1339
02:17:23,223 --> 02:17:27,713
And so I am actually there is a restriction on that funding for year at least them realize

1340
02:17:27,723 --> 02:17:32,493
that I'm not allowed to randomize because that's research and SAMHSA doesn't fund research,

1341
02:17:32,493 --> 02:17:35,223
they fund program implementation and evaluation.

1342
02:17:35,583 --> 02:17:42,223
So for all of the things we publish, like around beekeeper training or that type of thing, those are quite the experimental design.

1343
02:17:42,233 --> 02:17:50,643
So we're using a pretest, a post chest and a longitudinal follow up, and we can randomize people, but it's not as rigorous.

1344
02:17:51,303 --> 02:18:01,443
But when you're, you know, with you learn how you can think, you know, I think that's what does it it's it's a fair question.

1345
02:18:01,443 --> 02:18:04,653
And it's kind of boils down to the strength of the evidence.

1346
02:18:04,863 --> 02:18:11,822
And it's not to say that quasi experimental designs can't be useful. You can use matched comparisons, you can use stratified non random sampling.

1347
02:18:11,823 --> 02:18:17,042
You can use the more convenient or convenient sampling could be snowball sampling.

1348
02:18:17,043 --> 02:18:20,823
It could have been the first 209 people that walked in were assigned.

1349
02:18:20,823 --> 02:18:26,073
Why is t all of what it really comes down to is how well or how equivalent these two groups are.

1350
02:18:26,073 --> 02:18:32,873
At the beginning. You might find that after a randomization procedure, these two groups looked entirely different by just.

1351
02:18:32,973 --> 02:18:40,473
Sheer luck alone. You ended up with, you know, a group that looks completely different across some of these key variables,

1352
02:18:40,473 --> 02:18:48,153
which is why stratified random sampling in this case can be valuable because, you know, you need to have history of suicide attempts demarcated.

1353
02:18:48,303 --> 02:18:52,173
And from there, you're going to make sure that both are represented within your treatment in comparison groups.

1354
02:18:53,073 --> 02:18:55,292
Just a note, because it was presented,

1355
02:18:55,293 --> 02:19:00,903
I think it's great to think again about the kind of data that people are pulling in and that you're using to make decisions.

1356
02:19:01,083 --> 02:19:07,443
And then when we do see 15 years later, there are these fantastic and blinded eyes in the effect size.

1357
02:19:07,593 --> 02:19:14,133
That's a monstrous effect size. Yes. I mean, you don't see that in social sciences all that often, which is wonderful.

1358
02:19:14,733 --> 02:19:19,503
But in order to make that that distinction, this is my treatment group versus my comparison group.

1359
02:19:19,623 --> 02:19:23,542
So much of it depends on well, wait a minute, what about these groups?

1360
02:19:23,543 --> 02:19:25,653
And they're originally 15 years before.

1361
02:19:25,923 --> 02:19:32,373
How could that explain why we might see some of these observed differences other than the fact that one of them had Westie?

1362
02:19:32,703 --> 02:19:38,282
So but congratulations. It is a really, really neat finding. And we didn't do a proper round of applause for this presentation.

1363
02:19:38,283 --> 02:19:41,463
And we're going to. But.

1364
02:19:41,733 --> 02:19:48,093
But since we're not done here, I promise you, because this could be more of an expert in screening procedures that I'm going to be.

1365
02:19:48,483 --> 02:19:51,722
We've already covered. We've already started this conversation about that.

1366
02:19:51,723 --> 02:19:54,873
It is a highly prevalent and important issue.

1367
02:19:55,083 --> 02:19:58,083
I'm going to make you work a little bit more. We got about 15 minutes left.

1368
02:19:58,353 --> 02:20:02,132
Grab a partner. So a universal screening can happen in a variety of places.

1369
02:20:02,133 --> 02:20:08,703
Both of us are interested in youth, and so we think about places where we're going to have a lot of contact with youth schools for sure.

1370
02:20:08,703 --> 02:20:11,732
Primary care, going to see your doctor emergency departments.

1371
02:20:11,733 --> 02:20:18,273
And he's mentioned about a place as a place for recruitment for some of the studies, you know, detention centers, foster care.

1372
02:20:18,573 --> 02:20:25,953
But I want you to think about it from a public health approach, whether these are the appropriateness,

1373
02:20:25,953 --> 02:20:36,093
the the the way why these facilities could be good or poor choices if you were going to try to identify those who might be at risk for for suicide.

1374
02:20:36,543 --> 02:20:44,163
Yeah. The wording given heterogeneity in suicide risk ideation or attempts, what is that implying?

1375
02:20:44,703 --> 02:20:49,193
Just differences. And they're okay, right.

1376
02:20:49,293 --> 02:20:52,743
Because we we're finding there's not profile. There's not a profile of individuals.

1377
02:20:52,743 --> 02:20:56,043
It's okay you are at risk versus not. So trying to understand through that,

1378
02:20:56,313 --> 02:21:03,723
where might some of these settings be more or less appropriate because we didn't talk about firearms being more at risk, right.

1379
02:21:03,783 --> 02:21:11,192
Yeah. So that's part of that's some of the heterogeneity by race and by sex, by location, by whichever and also the risk factor three.

1380
02:21:11,193 --> 02:21:17,373
So like, you know, when Cheryl does this time, she may say, like, you know, we I have two kids on the unit, right?

1381
02:21:17,403 --> 02:21:25,583
They both can do the thing like they were both mixed with. Each one is a 16 year old girl who's had chronic depression since she was 12.

1382
02:21:26,273 --> 02:21:35,943
I think, you know, suicidal ideation, multiple previous attacks and, you know, pretty dysfunctional family relationships.

1383
02:21:35,943 --> 02:21:44,133
Right. Her next door neighbor might be a 13 year old boy with no history of depression at all.

1384
02:21:44,463 --> 02:21:48,843
Very high functioning family. But ADHD and learning just got right.

1385
02:21:48,993 --> 02:21:54,963
So, like, it's just hard to figure out what kid you're trying to get help for.

1386
02:21:55,263 --> 02:22:01,503
Right. So, yeah, just real quick to just take a minute and just even from from a first blush reaction

1387
02:22:01,713 --> 02:22:08,013
why some of these places can be we can utilize versus concerns that's popping up.

1388
02:22:15,203 --> 02:22:20,133
I didn't know when you were asking about.

1389
02:22:21,703 --> 02:22:30,173
Right. It depends on what the seventh of her life is like, because that's not what this was all about.

1390
02:22:30,243 --> 02:22:38,543
Like I say, I didn't feel bad for public versus private school for her.

1391
02:22:41,303 --> 02:22:56,843
I just knowing that, you know, they would rather, you know, they would at least be like, yeah, it's like they're they're not.

1392
02:22:57,383 --> 02:23:01,073
They're not. Yeah. Family tells you something about your primary school.

1393
02:23:01,103 --> 02:23:19,343
Exactly. You know, I one thing in my life I've been able to ensure and also very quickly is what we have here in the United

1394
02:23:19,583 --> 02:23:36,493
Nations or even have a rule that like around you are you don't realize that you might have a lot of things.

1395
02:23:36,503 --> 02:23:42,263
That's true. I don't know. Yeah. Like a different culture.

1396
02:23:43,943 --> 02:23:56,773
Yeah. Yeah. But what I think, I think you'll call it or, you know, had their ideas already is other things like,

1397
02:23:57,943 --> 02:24:03,142
like for instance where we need to learn more about how to make money.

1398
02:24:03,143 --> 02:24:08,373
And this is a great idea.

1399
02:24:08,993 --> 02:24:14,003
I think on the one hand I don't want to be like, yeah.

1400
02:24:17,953 --> 02:24:22,053
To me it was like, Oh my God, I've never seen this.

1401
02:24:22,063 --> 02:24:25,113
Like, I know. But then I think they it's bad.

1402
02:24:25,123 --> 02:24:30,793
You know, some kids are nervous because it makes it all the most important now that, you know,

1403
02:24:31,063 --> 02:24:37,393
whatever happens, you know, you've got a place and it just makes them feel like, okay.

1404
02:24:38,773 --> 02:24:50,713
They don't understand that there is no filter that you can see on, but that's how they help.

1405
02:24:51,223 --> 02:24:58,423
I don't what I meant, but I think I've learned more than anyone and I think about them with my life.

1406
02:24:59,263 --> 02:25:04,843
So that just, you know, there's an election year by year.

1407
02:25:04,873 --> 02:25:08,663
So come here. I think if I had had an.

1408
02:25:09,303 --> 02:25:13,713
And there hasn't been good and bad for you when you get after there.

1409
02:25:14,563 --> 02:25:19,053
All right. I want folks that I know that said it was a lot of time, but I want you to just kind of keep them in your head.

1410
02:25:19,593 --> 02:25:23,312
It was schools, it was juvenile detention centers.

1411
02:25:23,313 --> 02:25:26,223
It was IDs. It was primary care.

1412
02:25:26,403 --> 02:25:32,883
They knew about some of these common problems or these common barriers to the screening, which Cindy was kind enough to foreshadow.

1413
02:25:33,273 --> 02:25:37,323
We're talking exclusively, explicitly about already. So thinking about again,

1414
02:25:37,893 --> 02:25:43,083
there is not a being a profile that there are a lot of different risks that might make it difficult to screen someone who who could be at risk.

1415
02:25:43,593 --> 02:25:48,722
We talked about just finding some of the variation from culture from across some of

1416
02:25:48,723 --> 02:25:51,693
the different demographics that came up in our conversation little bit earlier.

1417
02:25:52,233 --> 02:25:57,053
This one is one more kind of speak about an open city might be able to chime in just in terms of the sensitivity,

1418
02:25:57,063 --> 02:26:03,033
how well is our measurement instrument trying to think about what the kind of questions that we might be asking in our ability to,

1419
02:26:03,033 --> 02:26:07,443
one, identify those who might be at risk but then also not over identify.

1420
02:26:07,623 --> 02:26:15,002
So this is a big issue with almost any kind of screening. We deal with it with kind of firearm screens as well, too, but in this case as well.

1421
02:26:15,003 --> 02:26:21,633
And then so since you also kind of mentioned, you know, how and when you're providing this information.

1422
02:26:21,823 --> 02:26:26,573
I talked to a student on Tuesday. They might be very different than talking to them on Thursday.

1423
02:26:26,573 --> 02:26:30,783
Right. So all of these kind of intersect with those locations as well.

1424
02:26:30,783 --> 02:26:34,563
And I don't know if those are starting to kind of bubble up, how any of this could tell you.

1425
02:26:34,953 --> 02:26:39,093
I mean, who could look different in a school setting or in your primary care setting?

1426
02:26:41,073 --> 02:26:48,683
What about the time of year mattering? Because like you, that, you know, when are you going to school?

1427
02:26:48,693 --> 02:26:51,903
You're not going to school in America in the summer. Right.

1428
02:26:52,233 --> 02:26:58,863
Right. I mean, ask our friends and think of emergency services and right after parent teacher conferences.

1429
02:26:59,153 --> 02:27:04,263
Why is the time low key at this time of year?

1430
02:27:04,263 --> 02:27:07,653
Because everybody just did their conferences. First quarter is over.

1431
02:27:07,743 --> 02:27:11,043
People's grades aren't good. They got to make it to Christmas.

1432
02:27:11,283 --> 02:27:15,573
It's a rough time. Yeah, everyone's over that.

1433
02:27:15,613 --> 02:27:23,403
Like in Alaska, the being out of school is also just like increased period.

1434
02:27:23,643 --> 02:27:30,813
That's just high risk for youth. They don't have the structure and also the light because there's no sunlight.

1435
02:27:33,693 --> 02:27:40,873
And so there is like that you're losing in an area where you can scream, but you're also losing like that factor.

1436
02:27:44,013 --> 02:27:52,953
So what does this really look like? I am against the British tribunal because I'm not actually this is actually a fry from Cheryl via Kip Boner,

1437
02:27:52,953 --> 02:27:59,793
who is now up at Michigan State, but did a lot of work in the VA working with with individuals.

1438
02:28:00,243 --> 02:28:04,203
So it gave me a few of these slides in some of these specific screening questionnaires.

1439
02:28:04,773 --> 02:28:08,283
But so some of these questions and again, I do think about the setting.

1440
02:28:08,293 --> 02:28:10,683
I do think about the context in which these questions are asked.

1441
02:28:10,683 --> 02:28:15,633
And I really liked that point about just because you ask it in one day, at one given time,

1442
02:28:16,143 --> 02:28:21,183
we can assume that this is not true and that there that there's a validity to the way that people are responding.

1443
02:28:21,903 --> 02:28:22,812
But here's the thing.

1444
02:28:22,813 --> 02:28:29,763
You know, one of the things that we're working on with our science are going to be mentioning that information the department network gets around.

1445
02:28:30,903 --> 02:28:40,423
How are we in the health care system that might be, you know, trying to have better, better care for folks who are coming into our system.

1446
02:28:40,473 --> 02:28:47,793
Think about it. This is for sure one of those ways Jayco requires a joint commission that regulates health care setting,

1447
02:28:48,123 --> 02:28:52,952
requires universal screening for suicide risk, ages 12 and up.

1448
02:28:52,953 --> 02:28:56,432
I think this is one screener. It's free, it's publicly available.

1449
02:28:56,433 --> 02:29:00,242
You can Google. It is so interesting. There's like a whole care pathway.

1450
02:29:00,243 --> 02:29:08,423
You know what happened. So like in our hospital, what should happen is for sure in the emergency department, this is required by Google.

1451
02:29:08,433 --> 02:29:14,342
But really best practice is, you know, in all ambulatory care settings, you know, the pediatrician,

1452
02:29:14,343 --> 02:29:20,552
the dermatologist, like everybody, but like you walk in the door and the nurse should give you this.

1453
02:29:20,553 --> 02:29:22,743
You know, this is free, publicly available.

1454
02:29:23,673 --> 02:29:32,633
This is one of the more common because it was developed in an AMH for a pediatric population and, you know, has good psychometrics.

1455
02:29:32,943 --> 02:29:41,933
The Columbia suicide severity rating scale screener is the other one that is actually probably more widely used because I

1456
02:29:42,093 --> 02:29:48,992
guess Q is just for kids and a lot of health care systems want to use the same measure all the way through the lifespan.

1457
02:29:48,993 --> 02:29:53,613
So everything is in check, in the same language. And the Columbia, like it's just been out longer.

1458
02:29:53,613 --> 02:29:55,712
And so the ship is kind of sounds, quite frankly,

1459
02:29:55,713 --> 02:30:02,393
for a lot of health care agencies like it not they're like we've we've already got the CSF embedded in a bank.

1460
02:30:02,403 --> 02:30:06,903
That's what we're using, even if the data's coming out. But something else would be a lot better.

1461
02:30:09,903 --> 02:30:13,232
Like, Yeah, what else can I tell you? I see you.

1462
02:30:13,233 --> 02:30:17,663
I talked about this one. Do you go to services? Right. That's what I was thinking about in Flint.

1463
02:30:17,823 --> 02:30:21,603
Yeah, yeah. That's our study. Yeah, yeah.

1464
02:30:21,723 --> 02:30:28,623
I don't know what else to tell you. So the high risk screen is this idea that, you know, for the study of treatment plant, we asked depression,

1465
02:30:28,623 --> 02:30:38,693
we asked alcohol use, we asked the families to kind of put it together and try to figure out, I don't get it.

1466
02:30:38,703 --> 02:30:41,943
You answer like whatever questions you guys might I might have.

1467
02:30:42,693 --> 02:30:51,513
Turn that around. Okay. No, no, not that this. So some questions so sorry and some of those questions in kind of triggering.

1468
02:30:52,023 --> 02:30:57,753
That's very triggering, actually. Like, to me, it's like you're asking or you're asking somebody,

1469
02:30:58,713 --> 02:31:09,333
have you have you tried to tell yourself if yes, how you're asking them to think back to that state of mind?

1470
02:31:09,663 --> 02:31:11,853
And what method were you thinking of doing?

1471
02:31:12,243 --> 02:31:18,093
What are you going to do if they say, I was thinking of taking a bunch of ibuprofen, like just swallowing pills?

1472
02:31:18,183 --> 02:31:21,263
Are you going to tell them to get rid of the pills in their house? Yes. Yeah.

1473
02:31:21,963 --> 02:31:29,613
And that what you're saying and I'm glad you're using it in this passionate way, because this is the issue actually in our society.

1474
02:31:29,613 --> 02:31:35,972
And I just want to step back and say, like looking from a health care setting situation, you know,

1475
02:31:35,973 --> 02:31:41,042
if you like our my dear friend Brian on the down, because I have a sister who is the author of this paper.

1476
02:31:41,043 --> 02:31:50,283
Right. And, you know, you can look at these big data systems and Kaiser Permanente and they look at suicide mortality rates.

1477
02:31:50,643 --> 02:31:58,623
And there is a shocking and terrible number of people in this country who have died by suicide.

1478
02:31:58,863 --> 02:32:07,142
And they were in our office 30 days before they died, like a shocking number and we missed it.

1479
02:32:07,143 --> 02:32:17,763
And why did we miss it? Because you're a 75 year old man with chronic illness and your wife has passed away and your life isn't that great.

1480
02:32:17,763 --> 02:32:25,353
And you're in there for your cholesterol check or whatever, but you're not going to say, hey, busy primary care physician.

1481
02:32:25,353 --> 02:32:29,073
I think I am really struggling. I think I need some help.

1482
02:32:29,523 --> 02:32:32,853
That generation doesn't say things like that. It's not going to be that you.

1483
02:32:33,123 --> 02:32:40,923
It's our responsibility as health care providers to create a space where we are saying to people, I got this.

1484
02:32:41,133 --> 02:32:45,803
I got you. I can ask these questions because I can handle your answer.

1485
02:32:46,823 --> 02:32:50,783
I can handle your answer. And I'm creating a space where you can tell me.

1486
02:32:51,683 --> 02:32:56,512
Right. I mean, there's nothing more isolating as you go into a health care provider and really be in that

1487
02:32:56,513 --> 02:33:05,173
space and have them see it and not see your name when you leave and somebody didn't see it.

1488
02:33:05,253 --> 02:33:08,333
Like, you know what they're left to do, right?

1489
02:33:08,343 --> 02:33:14,793
So this is our responsibility. Now, it is not so easy as just shutting the door.

1490
02:33:14,903 --> 02:33:17,573
A lot of training for health care providers across the country.

1491
02:33:18,983 --> 02:33:25,552
And you've got to know that you're calm and compassionate and you can handle the answer and we can help people.

1492
02:33:25,553 --> 02:33:30,473
So don't be screaming. If you can't say, yeah, I can stay calm and I can say that I got it.

1493
02:33:30,623 --> 02:33:35,473
We're going to figure this out together. But we do have perceptions.

1494
02:33:35,483 --> 02:33:40,103
And so it's really important to ask, but it's hard.

1495
02:33:40,103 --> 02:33:47,663
And those reactions. That's why I want that screening, because it really comes back to that myth that if we ask somebody,

1496
02:33:47,883 --> 02:33:51,323
we're going to put the idea in their head and we're going to harm them inadvertently.

1497
02:33:51,323 --> 02:33:52,732
And that's what we're all worried about.

1498
02:33:52,733 --> 02:34:00,053
And that's how we don't we don't ask in school and then we're not asking the pediatrician and we don't ask because we're afraid.

1499
02:34:00,113 --> 02:34:07,583
That's a myth that's been studied. There's a paper out, you know, that that asking is not a Trojan.

1500
02:34:08,093 --> 02:34:13,723
Asking is the most caring thing that you mention for something because you are sitting there with those last few

1501
02:34:13,733 --> 02:34:23,093
months I did see you and every and yeah it's like oh I'm reading these questions actually reminded me a lot of them.

1502
02:34:23,093 --> 02:34:28,373
I was a resident assistant, my undergrad, and we had to go through mandatory QPR training.

1503
02:34:28,823 --> 02:34:32,723
Question Yeah, yeah. My question persuade and refer.

1504
02:34:32,903 --> 02:34:37,673
Yeah. Well, yeah, we talked a lot about that research that like it is,

1505
02:34:37,673 --> 02:34:43,523
it isn't usually considered a myth that like asking these questions will have a more detrimental response than a positive one.

1506
02:34:44,933 --> 02:34:49,642
I mean, like we're told, like, like if they're thinking about killing themselves right then and they're like,

1507
02:34:49,643 --> 02:34:51,683
you need to know, like you have to you have to,

1508
02:34:51,773 --> 02:34:58,703
like, you had to ask is very blunt and straightforward questions because, you know, like, what if they have a weapon in their room?

1509
02:34:58,703 --> 02:35:03,862
I mean, this is this was in college and they'd be able to go sharp if they had a razor in the room that they're going to cut their arm later like you.

1510
02:35:03,863 --> 02:35:05,272
Then you have the duty to remove that.

1511
02:35:05,273 --> 02:35:12,343
So like it's better to, I guess in response, better to be blunt and safe and know what to remove in a situation then.

1512
02:35:12,653 --> 02:35:24,983
Absolutely, yeah. When you don't ask, you can't help workers or how you approach families or what do you do to.

1513
02:35:26,943 --> 02:35:30,253
I have to ask my questions, too. But they're in denial.

1514
02:35:33,963 --> 02:35:40,363
So there's many different sort of like clinical considerations, right.

1515
02:35:40,403 --> 02:35:44,223
But in an ideal family, in an ideal situation, here's what happens.

1516
02:35:44,913 --> 02:35:48,633
You do universal screening for everything. So you're in primary care.

1517
02:35:48,843 --> 02:35:53,583
If you're interested in this, you take the American Academy of Pediatrics has an awesome USA cover blueprint.

1518
02:35:54,243 --> 02:35:59,103
You Google Pediatrics, they'll walk you through. This is the ideal scenario.

1519
02:35:59,103 --> 02:36:03,212
If you're ages 12 and up, you're going in through the child visits.

1520
02:36:03,213 --> 02:36:08,943
Every single can get this. If they score up there is a plan to make those claims that they didn't train.

1521
02:36:08,943 --> 02:36:12,383
That comes in next and does a risk assessment. So this is a screener. Okay.

1522
02:36:12,843 --> 02:36:16,922
And one of my issues with screening is that you're only screening for suicide related risk,

1523
02:36:16,923 --> 02:36:20,963
but there's like a lot of other non suicide related perspectives on that.

1524
02:36:22,713 --> 02:36:30,783
But then you do it with defensemen and kind of try to figure out what is the purpose of a risk assessment is not prediction.

1525
02:36:30,873 --> 02:36:38,403
You're going to dive the planning you're getting people, how you're figuring out how to get there, whatever resources they need.

1526
02:36:38,823 --> 02:36:40,623
And then finally, you know,

1527
02:36:40,623 --> 02:36:51,932
you're making a decision about what is going to be the hospital therapy referral and having conversation about what that's like.

1528
02:36:51,933 --> 02:36:55,083
The idea is thank you so much for telling me.

1529
02:36:55,713 --> 02:36:59,143
We're going to get you in here and your situation.

1530
02:36:59,323 --> 02:37:08,523
Now, you know, most clinicians have been in that situation and you just you usually can get folks to react.

1531
02:37:09,693 --> 02:37:12,713
You know, sometimes it's like who's in denial in life?

1532
02:37:12,723 --> 02:37:17,133
You just kind of get in there and tell it here. All right, folks, I'm so sorry.

1533
02:37:17,493 --> 02:37:22,023
We are at time severe. It would be okay if I shared your contact information.

1534
02:37:22,803 --> 02:37:28,183
Thank you once again. We really appreciate your time. A very difficult topic today.

1535
02:37:28,183 --> 02:37:34,662
You all for for joining us today and for that very we will see you not next week, but following week.

1536
02:37:34,663 --> 02:37:39,613
I will send you a note about kind of a hybrid environment that we're going to create with the folks from the CDC.

1537
02:37:39,983 --> 02:37:44,473
Have a great Thanksgiving, everyone. Stay safe travels. Don't go.

1538
02:37:45,253 --> 02:37:48,423
Yes. Oh, no.

1539
02:37:49,163 --> 02:37:52,613
Oh, yeah. Okay. Yeah.

1540
02:37:53,113 --> 02:37:57,643
You know, I feeling.

1541
02:37:58,573 --> 02:37:59,553
Oh, I.
