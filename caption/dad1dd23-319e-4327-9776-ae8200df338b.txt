1
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:15,052
In this video, I'm gonna describe some of the basic design elements of the new core.

2
00:00:15,052 --> 00:00:20,992
It has a lot of the elements that we saw in some of the interdisciplinary

3
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:25,534
competitors that I described in the previous video.

4
00:00:25,534 --> 00:00:30,565
And I think that you'll see that it actually has this sort of mutual or

5
00:00:30,565 --> 00:00:35,689
beneficial cycle of supporting students and supporting faculty that

6
00:00:35,689 --> 00:00:42,640
we hope is gonna actually make this a very fun and engaging core for everyone.

7
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,595
So in this slide we describe how the different elements of the core

8
00:00:47,595 --> 00:00:52,732
curriculum can come together and actually create something that is

9
00:00:52,732 --> 00:00:57,711
comprehensive and to be frank much more than the sum of the parts.

10
00:00:57,711 --> 00:01:02,684
I mean we believe strongly that the domain knowledge of our fundamental disciplines,

11
00:01:02,684 --> 00:01:07,250
whether or not it's Nutrition, Environmental Health, Health Behavior

12
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:11,542
Health Education, Biostats and Epidemiology needs to be sort of front and

13
00:01:11,542 --> 00:01:12,108
center.

14
00:01:12,108 --> 00:01:17,176
But those need to be applied and we need to pull out the analytical skills so

15
00:01:17,176 --> 00:01:22,159
that the students actually know, what do I need to do, how do I apply it,

16
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,740
and am I any good at it?

17
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:28,543
So those two go together and we think that's reinforced if we

18
00:01:28,543 --> 00:01:33,455
focus in on the modes of public health research and practice.

19
00:01:33,455 --> 00:01:38,638
What does public health today use in its major products and

20
00:01:38,638 --> 00:01:43,609
genres and the work outside of the school in the practice

21
00:01:43,609 --> 00:01:49,023
field can majorly inform how we put these courses together.

22
00:01:49,023 --> 00:01:54,049
But we recognize that the knowledge and the skills aren't enough these days.

23
00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:57,877
That we actually need to integrate into these courses an

24
00:01:57,877 --> 00:02:02,914
understanding of how students are actually professionals in training.

25
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:06,053
And so we need to be focusing in on the professional

26
00:02:06,053 --> 00:02:09,210
development of those students simultaneously.

27
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:14,038
And that includes things like, how do you work in a team and collaborate?

28
00:02:14,038 --> 00:02:16,059
How do you deal with conflict?

29
00:02:16,059 --> 00:02:19,297
We could go into many of them and actually in a few slides,

30
00:02:19,297 --> 00:02:23,885
I'll go into a little bit more of the detail, but that professional development

31
00:02:23,885 --> 00:02:27,611
actually will enable us to have a more of a sense of the community.

32
00:02:27,611 --> 00:02:31,225
If we ask every student to come in with this mindset,

33
00:02:31,225 --> 00:02:35,991
you're actually not a student, you're a professional in training and

34
00:02:35,991 --> 00:02:39,455
that's the way we're gonna treat and interact,

35
00:02:39,455 --> 00:02:43,543
and hope that we can actually get to a much higher level of engagement in

36
00:02:43,543 --> 00:02:48,343
the great problems that we're facing today as a school, as a nation, as a world.

37
00:02:48,343 --> 00:02:53,500
With this, we think that a necessary piece of the structure of

38
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:58,460
this core curriculum will also be investing in ways in which

39
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:03,420
students themselves can build their personal strength and

40
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,220
capacity to do some of this work.

41
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:10,446
I think a lot of us have seen that doing the work of public health can be

42
00:03:10,446 --> 00:03:13,355
heartbreaking and is incredibly difficult.

43
00:03:13,355 --> 00:03:20,122
It's not just a head job, it really is a work towards a better tomorrow.

44
00:03:20,122 --> 00:03:25,144
And so having us even talk about as faculty and as a school,

45
00:03:25,144 --> 00:03:31,722
the compassion, the caring, the empathy and the resilience that we need.

46
00:03:31,722 --> 00:03:35,853
And there are practices to get us there further and faster.

47
00:03:35,853 --> 00:03:39,493
If we integrate them into the core curriculum,

48
00:03:39,493 --> 00:03:45,317
because this is a chance to interact with a large number of students at once,

49
00:03:45,317 --> 00:03:48,138
all seeing and all understanding and

50
00:03:48,138 --> 00:03:54,149
all working together on building their personal and professional capacity.

51
00:03:54,149 --> 00:03:59,844
And then the last piece of this puzzle is the work towards increased health and

52
00:03:59,844 --> 00:04:00,640
justice.

53
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:06,335
So by having what we are teaching them and their experience in the classroom,

54
00:04:06,335 --> 00:04:11,943
be focused on making a difference, making a difference in their own lives,

55
00:04:11,943 --> 00:04:16,434
their communities and in, the dream of a more just society.

56
00:04:16,434 --> 00:04:22,468
We feel like all of this can now come together in a much more comprehensive and

57
00:04:22,468 --> 00:04:27,182
compelling way that is gonna make a mark for us as a school and

58
00:04:27,182 --> 00:04:33,029
will also sort of fundamentally change the way in which students see us and

59
00:04:33,029 --> 00:04:35,224
their relationship to us.

60
00:04:35,224 --> 00:04:39,694
Not just as sort of experts in classes, but

61
00:04:39,694 --> 00:04:45,542
now as guides and as help in their career trajectories.

62
00:04:45,542 --> 00:04:47,033
So how are we gonna do this?

63
00:04:47,033 --> 00:04:51,533
So we actually know that that's a big order.

64
00:04:51,533 --> 00:04:57,294
And that it's gonna take a real shift in the way that we think.

65
00:04:57,294 --> 00:05:01,042
So a lot of our focus at first is gonna be energizing and

66
00:05:01,042 --> 00:05:06,876
working with students in order to better understand what are their experiences and

67
00:05:06,876 --> 00:05:09,143
assets, what do they bring in?

68
00:05:09,143 --> 00:05:15,210
They're actually, in many cases, coming with a whole set of both educational and

69
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:20,326
professional backgrounds and experiences that could be utilized and

70
00:05:20,326 --> 00:05:26,498
nurtured, to be honest, to help the teams and the collectives in this work together.

71
00:05:26,498 --> 00:05:31,255
But we're gonna do this in the mindset of not just understanding, but

72
00:05:31,255 --> 00:05:36,334
then also creating clear goals and accountability, it's no longer gonna

73
00:05:36,334 --> 00:05:41,759
be okay for them to learn something in one class and kind of forget it in the next.

74
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,487
And I really feel like having something that is almost like

75
00:05:46,487 --> 00:05:50,345
a dashboard that we can see where are students,

76
00:05:50,345 --> 00:05:55,458
they can see what level they're at in different skill sets will

77
00:05:55,458 --> 00:06:01,075
enable all of us to actually build a better educational experience.

78
00:06:01,075 --> 00:06:06,407
Because if it's not visible where my deficits are, I'm not going to work

79
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:11,911
on them, but if it's clear, then I'm much more likely to put in the time and

80
00:06:11,911 --> 00:06:15,954
effort to actually do the work and get to the next level.

81
00:06:15,954 --> 00:06:20,503
And we'll have some other things that actually motivate them

82
00:06:20,503 --> 00:06:25,759
internally to do their best work which I'll save for a little bit later.

83
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,783
One of the things that we've heard over and

84
00:06:28,783 --> 00:06:34,495
over again is that the students really want to be working on today's problems and

85
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:37,776
they're kind of asking, when can we do that?

86
00:06:37,776 --> 00:06:41,891
And in some of your classes, you've done incredible jobs of creating

87
00:06:41,891 --> 00:06:44,553
opportunities for students to do that work.

88
00:06:44,553 --> 00:06:49,628
So we felt like we've already got some experience as a school doing it,

89
00:06:49,628 --> 00:06:54,282
let's bring it into the core and have the authentic public health

90
00:06:54,282 --> 00:06:58,444
products that people are gonna do in their everyday jobs.

91
00:06:58,444 --> 00:07:04,358
Be a part of what they're basically doing as a part of their training and

92
00:07:04,358 --> 00:07:06,240
as a part of this core.

93
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,703
So then the last piece that we're really working on and

94
00:07:10,703 --> 00:07:16,817
want to have a sort of wider interaction with the faculty who are interested

95
00:07:16,817 --> 00:07:22,251
in the core is how do we best support the work that is this transition

96
00:07:22,251 --> 00:07:29,267
from our regular kind of didactic teaching to a project based learning environment.

97
00:07:29,267 --> 00:07:36,214
So, lots of us actually have gone through cycles of development in our careers.

98
00:07:36,214 --> 00:07:39,785
And sometimes we need to kind of come back, reset and

99
00:07:39,785 --> 00:07:43,194
really think of, well what is my purpose here?

100
00:07:43,194 --> 00:07:48,579
And how could I actually go to the next level for me personally as

101
00:07:48,579 --> 00:07:54,993
well as to have it actually help the students in their own trajectories.

102
00:07:54,993 --> 00:08:00,320
So we're gonna work on how do we team teach in our lanes but together and

103
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:05,741
creating those conditions that's gonna allow us to have our key values

104
00:08:05,741 --> 00:08:12,084
of compassion and connection and hopefully a little bit more balance for faculty.

105
00:08:12,084 --> 00:08:16,415
Any of you that have built large classes or run large classes

106
00:08:16,415 --> 00:08:22,331
know, it's a huge lift and we've just let that be a single faculty,

107
00:08:22,331 --> 00:08:27,416
maybe team taught with two roles and responsibilities.

108
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:30,939
It seems much more sensible if we already know this is gonna be,

109
00:08:30,939 --> 00:08:34,073
260 students coming in for us to actually design it

110
00:08:34,073 --> 00:08:37,154
so that it's not a huge and lonely lift for

111
00:08:37,154 --> 00:08:41,293
single faculties in courses, but it's a joint lift and

112
00:08:41,293 --> 00:08:46,156
there's enough support so that it actually is fun and engaging.

113
00:08:46,156 --> 00:08:49,912
It'll still be work, but it'll be a lot more energizing and

114
00:08:49,912 --> 00:08:53,742
I think that we'll see the fruits of that as we work together on

115
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:57,440
figuring out just what we need and what will make it better.

116
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,726
So I'm gonna take a moment and talk about the two different types of course design.

117
00:09:02,726 --> 00:09:08,936
Most of us, including myself started with the understanding of how to teach

118
00:09:08,936 --> 00:09:15,360
from what was called or what has been called a teacher-centered course design.

119
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,270
I'm sitting there trying to conceptualize what do I know about

120
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:23,046
this important field and then how do I actually organize it

121
00:09:23,046 --> 00:09:27,789
so the students can get the maximal exposure to this information.

122
00:09:27,789 --> 00:09:32,192
And then after sort of lectures and readings and handouts and

123
00:09:32,192 --> 00:09:36,864
things like that, what do I need to assess some portion of that.

124
00:09:36,864 --> 00:09:43,347
Exams, quizzes, papers, other kind of problem sets or things like that.

125
00:09:43,347 --> 00:09:47,612
And then after kind of creating the course, I'll put on my syllabus,

126
00:09:47,612 --> 00:09:52,388
the learning objectives and like the big learning goals, but that's through

127
00:09:52,388 --> 00:09:57,181
a reflective process where I almost was saying, well, what did I teach them?

128
00:09:57,181 --> 00:10:02,740
What can they actually expect to get out of this course the way I've designed it?

129
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:09,365
Well, we're gonna have to shift to the student-centered course

130
00:10:09,365 --> 00:10:15,057
design in order for us to shrink down to the 12 credits.

131
00:10:15,057 --> 00:10:19,997
Which means that we're not gonna be able to lay out all of the different

132
00:10:19,997 --> 00:10:22,258
elements of our disciplines and

133
00:10:22,258 --> 00:10:26,799
like hopefully the students will pick up things and apply them.

134
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:32,781
What we are focused on in developing the new core are these public health products,

135
00:10:32,781 --> 00:10:35,515
the extensive literature reviews and

136
00:10:35,515 --> 00:10:40,726
understanding of the study designs and the statistics and the biases and

137
00:10:40,726 --> 00:10:45,954
the social determinants of health and the program planning and policy.

138
00:10:45,954 --> 00:10:53,986
Those attributes of what would be a public health career, sort of daily activity.

139
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:57,740
Well, we're gonna start with that as the learning goal and

140
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:03,241
we're gonna move back into what do we need as learning objectives to accomplish that.

141
00:11:03,241 --> 00:11:07,252
And the assessments will be designed to demonstrate to us and

142
00:11:07,252 --> 00:11:11,499
the student and hopefully some external partners ultimately,

143
00:11:11,499 --> 00:11:17,156
that they actually have accomplished that goal and that is actually what will drive,

144
00:11:17,156 --> 00:11:20,564
what are the learning activities and the content.

145
00:11:20,564 --> 00:11:26,276
So this will be a scaffolded movement of lectures and activities,

146
00:11:26,276 --> 00:11:32,396
basically exemplars in many case of what they're trying to achieve and

147
00:11:32,396 --> 00:11:39,440
then they'll be able to do it in teams, for the projects that they've selected.

148
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:46,140
So I've talked a fair amount about this team based or project based learning.

149
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:51,671
This has been known for a long time to be one of the best learner-centred approachs

150
00:11:51,671 --> 00:11:57,857
that really sort of get students understanding how important it is to know,

151
00:11:57,857 --> 00:12:03,308
to remember to practice and to become proficient as professionals.

152
00:12:03,308 --> 00:12:08,435
It starts with this product in mind, but it actually for us as educators,

153
00:12:08,435 --> 00:12:13,249
starts with the key sort of questions that are driving that product.

154
00:12:13,249 --> 00:12:15,561
Why do you need a literature review?

155
00:12:15,561 --> 00:12:19,940
Why do you need a program plan in a certain architecture?

156
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:23,500
And then we will create the sort of time and

157
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:29,220
the ways in which to move students through the sustained enquiry.

158
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:34,129
The understanding of sort of authenticity of what they're doing should

159
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:35,500
map to excellence.

160
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:40,437
Well, that actually needs often to go through a cycle

161
00:12:40,437 --> 00:12:44,935
of the students being able to say what they see and

162
00:12:44,935 --> 00:12:52,080
to select what they want from the kind of wild and wide world of public health.

163
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,540
So we're not going to ask them to solve climate change.

164
00:12:55,540 --> 00:13:00,429
The projects will be sort of circumscribed so that they're doable.

165
00:13:00,429 --> 00:13:04,323
But this whole process of going through all of this and reflection and

166
00:13:04,323 --> 00:13:07,896
then getting feedback and critiques is what will eventually,

167
00:13:07,896 --> 00:13:12,732
at the end of every semester, arrive at a place where the students have these

168
00:13:12,732 --> 00:13:15,726
products that they can feel very good about and

169
00:13:15,726 --> 00:13:20,639
actually use in their portfolios for internships or for jobs or for work that

170
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:25,656
they may be doing actually on the side with agencies to fund their education.

171
00:13:25,656 --> 00:13:30,505
So just a little bit of a drop down into the reality

172
00:13:30,505 --> 00:13:35,380
check of how large of a effort is this going to be.

173
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:40,711
According to my kind of back of the envelope calculations, we're talking

174
00:13:40,711 --> 00:13:46,125
about 260, 270, maybe it gets a little bit larger, but it's in that range and

175
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:50,973
it's not equally distributed across the different departments.

176
00:13:50,973 --> 00:13:53,885
At one point we were discussing whether or

177
00:13:53,885 --> 00:13:58,961
not to have kind of the interdisciplinary team architecture of somebody

178
00:13:58,961 --> 00:14:03,970
from every department on the radar for how we put these teams together.

179
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:08,626
But I don't really think that that will work given this distribution.

180
00:14:08,626 --> 00:14:12,773
So what you can expect is that there are gonna be some teams that have,

181
00:14:12,773 --> 00:14:18,295
Environmental Health, Nutritional Science and Health Management and Policy students.

182
00:14:18,295 --> 00:14:22,777
And some that will not and that there will be an abundance of Epidemiology and

183
00:14:22,777 --> 00:14:25,728
Health Behavior and Health Education students.

184
00:14:25,728 --> 00:14:30,750
And one of the things I would ask for all of you as well as our team is trying to

185
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:35,873
think of, how do we use this to the benefit of our design in our activities.

186
00:14:35,873 --> 00:14:39,478
Are there ways in which we might say, okay,

187
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:42,597
you are focusing on Biostatistics and

188
00:14:42,597 --> 00:14:48,458
Epidemiology in this particular, portion of the literature review.

189
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:53,765
So now go and find an epidemiologist who has a public health degree.

190
00:14:53,765 --> 00:14:58,791
We have a lot of students that come in with undergraduate degrees

191
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:03,281
that already have had a couple of epidemiology courses.

192
00:15:03,281 --> 00:15:05,419
And this might be a chance for

193
00:15:05,419 --> 00:15:11,042
them to actually give back into the collective, as I'll call it coaches.

194
00:15:11,042 --> 00:15:15,868
So we're thinking about this because we recognise that peer review is

195
00:15:15,868 --> 00:15:19,790
gonna have to be one of the things that we do that allows and

196
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:24,700
motivates reflection by students inside of their team projects before

197
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:28,245
they ever get to submitting a product for grading.

198
00:15:28,245 --> 00:15:36,134
The project itself is not been described in any kind of set way.

199
00:15:36,134 --> 00:15:41,990
But if any of you remember, we sent out a survey after a Fall faculty meeting and

200
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:46,962
asked you what you thought were the biggest public health issues,

201
00:15:46,962 --> 00:15:52,198
what are the pressing problems and we put a few of them here to represent

202
00:15:52,198 --> 00:15:56,950
kind of these big areas that we will have students select from.

203
00:15:56,950 --> 00:16:01,197
And each year we will solicit input from faculty and

204
00:16:01,197 --> 00:16:07,041
from the incoming students as to what are the most pressing problems

205
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:12,317
so that we can make sure that this list reflects what we as faculty could give

206
00:16:12,317 --> 00:16:17,593
as well as what might be arising that is caught the student's attention and

207
00:16:17,593 --> 00:16:23,147
in a sense, their energy, which is really what we're looking for in this core.

208
00:16:23,147 --> 00:16:28,398
We recognize that these public health issues are so large that in order

209
00:16:28,398 --> 00:16:33,740
to do a team project, we have to limit them in some ways to a doable size.

210
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:38,183
So we'll ask students and their teams to sort of make it

211
00:16:38,183 --> 00:16:42,156
concrete: what city, what county, what state.

212
00:16:42,156 --> 00:16:46,922
And in some cases a national view, especially if they're

213
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:51,298
looking to do an international kind of team project,

214
00:16:51,298 --> 00:16:57,154
what would be that right size for the geography of the team's work.

215
00:16:57,154 --> 00:17:01,118
But then also to pick a vulnerable population.

216
00:17:01,118 --> 00:17:05,777
We recognize that trying to get something that is across

217
00:17:05,777 --> 00:17:11,047
the entire life course or population just won't be feasible.

218
00:17:11,047 --> 00:17:15,143
So as we think about putting these projects together,

219
00:17:15,143 --> 00:17:19,772
we're going to help students right size in the first couple of

220
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:24,685
weeks of the semester in order for us to now have them be able to go

221
00:17:24,685 --> 00:17:29,440
and apply what they're learning in the core courses.

222
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,534
So in order for us to have this 12 credit MPH

223
00:17:34,534 --> 00:17:40,051
core satisfy all of the CEPH competencies

224
00:17:40,051 --> 00:17:43,024
and tied to a team based project,

225
00:17:43,024 --> 00:17:48,014
we've had to conceptualize this as basically a path and

226
00:17:48,014 --> 00:17:54,721
this wheel kind of represents the major modules in the team based project.

227
00:17:54,721 --> 00:17:59,574
We got this from loking at the 10 essential services.

228
00:17:59,574 --> 00:18:04,450
what does astro do in terms of managing chronic diseases but

229
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:08,936
this is not an unusual trajectory of act activities for

230
00:18:08,936 --> 00:18:11,590
a public health professional.

231
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:16,390
We often start with identifying the context of the public health problem?

232
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:20,360
What do we know about the biological, environmental,

233
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:25,006
nutritional, political, social attributes that are, or risk

234
00:18:25,006 --> 00:18:29,235
factors that are influencing that public health problem.

235
00:18:29,235 --> 00:18:35,070
What's the context and what's driving the problem in that location?

236
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:38,985
But we recognize that like looking at the literature and

237
00:18:38,985 --> 00:18:42,828
understanding is not enough for a professional to do.

238
00:18:42,828 --> 00:18:48,040
And so we're gonna move them to devising sort of key questions and

239
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:51,170
selecting data collection methods and

240
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:55,640
how would they take their problem and start to study it.

241
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:59,474
And then finally they have to have some competency in analyzing and

242
00:18:59,474 --> 00:19:00,712
interpreting data.

243
00:19:00,712 --> 00:19:04,550
And so either students will do this in Excel or

244
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:07,384
in R as a part of the fall classes.

245
00:19:07,384 --> 00:19:12,665
And so that little yellow rim around this wheel are the three

246
00:19:12,665 --> 00:19:17,640
fall classes that we envision covering these modules.

247
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:22,339
But then in the winter it's all about applying the knowledge that you've

248
00:19:22,339 --> 00:19:25,599
gathered and let's say analyses that you've done

249
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:30,251
to actually developing policies and interventions and program plans.

250
00:19:30,251 --> 00:19:34,134
Learning how to evaluate them and then learning how to advocate for them.

251
00:19:34,134 --> 00:19:39,164
So that will be the winter courses in sort of

252
00:19:39,164 --> 00:19:43,931
the parallel to the team based project.

253
00:19:43,931 --> 00:19:49,508
All along the way we recognize that communication to both professional and

254
00:19:49,508 --> 00:19:53,933
lay audiences is one of the most fundamental skills that any

255
00:19:53,933 --> 00:19:56,875
public health professional can have.

256
00:19:56,875 --> 00:20:04,640
And as we asked the students to do this around their chosen public health problem.

257
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:10,185
We're gonna ask them to choose different modes that are the typical

258
00:20:10,185 --> 00:20:16,410
ways that we're communicating in our everyday public health practice or,

259
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:22,946
in the school sense, in the work that we do as collaborators of practitioners.

260
00:20:22,946 --> 00:20:24,896
So, as I said earlier,

261
00:20:24,896 --> 00:20:30,160
many of you are already doing versions of this in your courses and

262
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:36,023
we're just going to make this a part of how we allow students to choose.

263
00:20:36,023 --> 00:20:41,112
And they are able to then utilize some of the skills that they're learning,

264
00:20:41,112 --> 00:20:44,863
for instance, maybe in your course, also in the core.

265
00:20:44,863 --> 00:20:48,268
And I think that once we start to do this,

266
00:20:48,268 --> 00:20:52,975
we'll see basically the creativity of the students and

267
00:20:52,975 --> 00:20:58,184
the ways in which what they have been developing in terms of a,

268
00:20:58,184 --> 00:21:02,709
kind of domain knowledge starts to really flourish

269
00:21:02,709 --> 00:21:09,838
as they're asked to kind of stand in the shoes of that professional mindset and

270
00:21:09,838 --> 00:21:16,440
to communicate out to the public or to other public health professionals.

271
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:22,053
So I hope that in listening to what we have designed along with kind of

272
00:21:22,053 --> 00:21:28,950
the input of the students and the faculty and our alumni and our practice partners,

273
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:35,282
is something that will really capture the imagination of faculty and

274
00:21:35,282 --> 00:21:40,632
students for us to give back in some ways to communities and

275
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:45,840
to the world for sort of the big problems that we see.

276
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:51,522
There's a lot of opportunity for us to build on our strengths in this and

277
00:21:51,522 --> 00:21:55,971
I think that, if we can, we would like to open this up for

278
00:21:55,971 --> 00:22:00,895
anybody, any faculty to give us ideas or provide templates or

279
00:22:00,895 --> 00:22:04,143
tell us what has worked in your class,

280
00:22:04,143 --> 00:22:08,538
because we know that there's quite a bit of good knowledge inside of our own

281
00:22:08,538 --> 00:22:10,300
school on how to do this well.

282
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:14,964
So please contact us or maybe we'll contact you.

283
00:22:14,964 --> 00:22:16,435
Thank you.
