1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:04,790
Well. Morning, everyone. Good morning. How's your semester going?

2
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:12,540
Would going in. You have a good sleep now that we're going to talk about sleep.

3
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:20,940
Okay. This is a new topic that I interviewed to for this year.

4
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,830
Um, you know, I think it's also highly relevant giving.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:41,350
We will see the problems associated with sleep disorders and then maybe we can try to understand a little bit more using again,

6
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:45,570
the evolutionary perspective that we have been using in this class.

7
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:52,050
Yes. Do we want to discuss this later in the second part of that class?

8
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:57,360
But it sleep has several functions.

9
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,150
Some of those are for example,

10
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:08,160
we have two that growth and development when went to the school that played it in class also related to immune function.

11
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:17,990
And now what I want to focus on when we went to discuss more this in the second part of the class that you put in front of my sleep,

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,370
why we sleep, how our sleep is.

13
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:26,460
The body differs really compared to other primates.

14
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:33,570
And now what I want to talk is a little bit about the problems associated with the sleep disorders.

15
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:42,570
Now there is a whole body of evidence that shows that sleep disorders are associated with type two diabetes,

16
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:50,100
cardiovascular diseases, mortality, hypertension, mental health problems.

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:01,820
That is that this is a problem that maybe we can use a little perspective, we can shed some extra.

18
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:09,750
So a new light in this problem. Then these are the recommended type office or hours of sleep, according to the CDC.

19
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:17,400
By age, you see that newborn babies, infants,

20
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:25,770
they usually they need more kind of an adult right now for our rule is we just recommended

21
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:30,570
that we we get seven or more hours per night of sleep of that you are getting those hours.

22
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:40,169
I know I know that. Now we are going to finalize final report paper thing, but at least try to get this this hour,

23
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:48,299
some of these hours but better night of sleep not what is the problem associated?

24
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:54,390
If we are asleep less hours then this is a prevalence of short duration in the United States.

25
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:59,640
I took this data from the CDC. Can you see the fig. there?

26
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:08,760
Yep. Okay. And then the figuring that left the prevalence of short sleep in high school students.

27
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:16,260
Now how they defined these short sleep duration is less than the recommended.

28
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:22,920
Then that would be less down for high school. As to the end would be less than 8 hours per night.

29
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:36,960
They are. You see from the last ten years the prevalence of sleep had been increasing in teenage years and now it's almost 80%.

30
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:41,550
Both are shortly prevalence among teenagers.

31
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:50,940
There are some differences by sex as you seen that in in among girls there is a slightly higher prevalence compared to two boys.

32
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:56,790
And but this is worrisome that teenagers are not getting in over time, both with sleep.

33
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:09,479
Now, among adults, the prevalence is about the this is the average in the United States that is about 18 40% of shorter sleep duration.

34
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:14,310
But you see that they are still in differences, geographical differences across the United States.

35
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:22,290
They are so in regions with we have almost 50% or prevalence of short sleep that

36
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:29,330
other regional all down either that is not enough data or the prevalence is lower.

37
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:42,840
But still this is a huge problem, 50% to 80% of certainly the ratio is a big problem given the problems associated with chronic diseases.

38
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:58,560
QUESTION So far. Why do you think like I noticed, like hunky West Virginia tennis, you have like very, very high, very, very high sleep deprivation.

39
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:04,860
So I would think like the lifestyle in places like that would be similar to that, like the Midwest.

40
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:10,150
Where it's so much lower. So I'm just wondering the reason for that.

41
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,360
Yeah. Yeah. It will be so related to to lifestyle,

42
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:24,190
but you would think the lifestyle would be pretty similar in places like West Virginia and like I don't know where Bettina compared to Montana.

43
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:34,639
Like C West Virginia with like the. Yeah. And very, very high like you would think the lifestyle would be similar to like the region.

44
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:39,430
That's all white. Yeah. The really low population that would be.

45
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:48,250
Are you are you able to get to speak to lifestyle are seemingly endless more rural regions across the country.

46
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:58,840
However I don't know whether all their social factors can be affecting these stress or I see that region of the Appalachians.

47
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:08,170
Usually these are very poor regions. Where you think it's pretty poor in other Midwestern states.

48
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:18,970
Yeah. This might not be enough data on the other states. Mhm. The other interesting thing I noticed was with Alaska because they have very um.

49
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:25,690
Because of how early. Like the suns. Yep. So I noticed parts of Alaska.

50
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:35,310
Alaska you see the high, high prevalence that will be also related I to this goes a little bit also to different colonial types.

51
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:47,590
How will be is the pattern can differ by from person to person but I think here in this because this again this is ah I

52
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:57,220
haven't researched these are the but because this is a on the Appalachian that's very severe economic censorship problems.

53
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:03,280
Ah, I think there could be something going on here besides the rural lifestyle.

54
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:13,030
Any other question? Okay.

55
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:17,310
Let me put the pointer. No.

56
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:22,270
Why not? This is just some of the problems associated with the cheap and easy.

57
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:36,640
For example, the racial disparities of every segment that novices are asleep and diabetes that as referenced here, they are using 7 hours per night.

58
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:45,400
This is a reference group that we don't see here. But what you see, what you see, that even a short.

59
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,190
Okay, we have a short time left off.

60
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:58,480
Well, we have almost a 50% higher risk of diabetes, but also too much sleep time is associated with an increased risk of diabetes,

61
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:05,170
almost 40% in high end increase diabetes six are what will be a little bit less than saving,

62
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:13,600
still are almost 20% more risk then it seems that both either a shorter sleep time

63
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:17,530
and a longer or still this time are associated at least with type two diabetes.

64
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:25,330
Now, these other meta results from that same analysis they look in to, it's a sleep quality.

65
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:28,960
They this based on questionnaires, self-report, data.

66
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:36,670
They ask participants about how they feel that they are sleeping, how many day they they awake in the night.

67
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:42,370
But overall, we see that poor sleep quality here.

68
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:49,000
We see that last role from the meta analysis is associated with 40% higher risk, again of type two diabetes.

69
00:08:55,020 --> 00:09:07,800
Obituary regarded apnea. Again, the results showed that having apnea is confirmed twice the risk of type two diabetes.

70
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:12,629
This is a very, very strong reasonably that the risk of type two diabetes and again DC hijacking for a

71
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:27,520
sex lifestyles then there is a high risk associated with diabetes and sleep work on.

72
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:37,219
Want to show you some results on a study they did also as unusable but cheap work was associated with 40% multiple higher risk of type two diabetes.

73
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:43,200
So with the sleep apnea and so did they, because it's like having diabetes increases your risk of getting sleep.

74
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:50,719
Yes. So do they measure that like, yeah, this is are this is insulin, diabetes, this is the before diagnosis.

75
00:09:50,720 --> 00:10:00,420
So that what they did before they beat it. Yeah. Because that is our feedback that if you back diabetes increases that risk of sleep apnea also I mean

76
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:05,639
for example with hypertension also there is a feedback mechanism but Ali for this meta analysis,

77
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:13,980
yet you see that we have just a few studies here because the requirement was apnea before diagnosis of diabetes.

78
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:20,550
Now also we need to take into account it will be some subclinical diabetes.

79
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,660
That may be the final day diagnosis of apnea.

80
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:34,230
There are some subclinical problems that really going on. But still that I think is pretty probing of disorders and complications.

81
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:45,250
Now, if work also was associated with high 40% higher risk of type two diabetes, again, disease incident, type two diabetes.

82
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:51,040
And I want to show you some results on a study that I did some years ago.

83
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:55,870
This is, again, in these big cohort of black women across the United States.

84
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:05,590
Then we had the hypothesis, okay, we wanted to test whether if work was associated with type two diabetes, incident type two diabetes.

85
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:16,990
Now, but also we were interested to know whether part of the association between work and diabetes could be related to lifestyle factors.

86
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:22,960
So let's work it out tonight, maybe. Are it more a night to list exercise?

87
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:26,080
Then we did this analysis.

88
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:41,919
We have this here the categories of time working in hip work that in our basic model we found out women have more than ten years working 94.

89
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,100
They have 42% higher risk of incident type two diabetes.

90
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:57,520
Now, once we adjust for lifestyle factors, we observe small attenuation 1.35 then suggesting that may be the association between,

91
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:03,850
say, work and injury and type two diabetes is related somehow also to changes in lifestyle factors.

92
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:12,820
But still we see that remains the association meaning that lifestyle factors, they don't explain completely the association.

93
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:23,950
And when we adjust for body mass index there was a gain and attenuation of the association between significant then these results suggest that

94
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:35,620
there is some biological mechanisms besides behavioral factors associated really explain the association between hip work and type two diabetes.

95
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:44,080
Now in this study, we didn't have biomarker, for example, to measure cortisol or other relevant biomarkers.

96
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:53,380
But athletic results suggest behavioral factors returning to the completely the the association question so far.

97
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:01,220
Okay. Now let's talk a little bit about the structure of the city.

98
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:10,309
Now, do you see how an example of, let's say, a normal sleep?

99
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:20,300
POTTER Then I went to sleep have to may your face is what is called the normal rapid eye movement phase or in R.E.M.,

100
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:28,730
REM, REM Engram and the other that diagram phase or rapid a movement.

101
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:43,130
Now the engram phase is the when we spend most of the time during a sleep between 75% to 80% of the total is the time.

102
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:49,339
There are two phases as one is two, three and four are initial.

103
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:55,360
They are deep asleep. That is one is what is called delay sleep.

104
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:05,930
Usually we can. So noise is getting a wake up at that face either as to face it when our muscle just shut down.

105
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:11,240
And that is three and that is for is what is called the dead sleep of usually

106
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:17,540
that brain activity on those and that is three and four is very ah is very low.

107
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,440
And also I think we went to discuss this,

108
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:37,520
but the arm these phase are the one that we think are associated with our body and then is also with the immune function.

109
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:51,740
Now the, the second phase, the ramp phase is about between one fifth to one quarter of our totality is the time usually that way when we are dreaming,

110
00:14:53,210 --> 00:15:03,920
our brain activity is similar to that waking state in that phase and also we can have volume movement in the face.

111
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:12,110
Now I using this graph ADC assuming um, let's say at least biannual seminar where we see that we have cycles.

112
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:18,410
Each of these cycles can last about an hour and we can see out, say,

113
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:25,060
without the cycle going in at night and you'll see that in our phase you that way

114
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:30,230
when we have also that that would include our ball movement of our body uplift.

115
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:32,840
And so far this is that the structure of the sleep.

116
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:44,870
Now there are different factors that would be part of our discussion later today in class that affect the quality and duration of our sleep.

117
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:53,590
One is that circadian rhythm. I want to talk a little bit about these, but also our demographic, our lifestyle,

118
00:15:53,600 --> 00:16:01,940
a six hour occupation and other factors that we are going to discuss today.

119
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:08,870
For example, diet, how we have changed our diet related to our ancestors.

120
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:24,050
What do you think? We have these bodies in class, but what changes of diet decided you'll find are affecting our sleep patterns.

121
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:26,030
Go back to our ancestors.

122
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:40,940
So when people eat a lot of sugar and they tend to have more kidney issues and they give up for people who have a sugar problem,

123
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:47,990
they tend to get up quite a lot to go wash at night. That's one thing you and I, they get up.

124
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,350
You also like sugar sweetened beverages. Mm hmm.

125
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:55,880
Large population, percentage of the population consumes, not contains caffeine.

126
00:16:56,270 --> 00:17:00,260
And we also, you know, we kind of live to work.

127
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:04,640
Mm hmm. And people drink a lot of a lot of people throughout the day.

128
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,110
And that leads to disrupted sleep patterns. Well, yeah, but.

129
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:13,760
Right. Yeah, yeah. To say, like caffeine to the life over eating too.

130
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:20,380
Yep. Yeah. We get exactly where do you think you are.

131
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:24,050
You bring up tonight even before just minutes before going to bed.

132
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:27,650
Some people you have so much longer. Mm hmm.

133
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,450
About what you just said.

134
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:40,610
About what we ate in the lab around 11 p.m. to 3 a.m. was the time that naturally our gallbladder was doing the self-cleaning.

135
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:48,740
Mm hmm. As part of the cycle. But during that time that people who just age so much in the evening, there's so much congestion.

136
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:53,930
And the liver was trying to do the work. And they woke up exactly during those time.

137
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:58,690
My clients. Because they have. Yeah. So kidneys problem?

138
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:10,030
Yep. Yeah. These continue. These continue eating almost 24 seven are not going to affect our sleep patterns compared to what ancestors know.

139
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,530
What is interesting is that this circadian rhythm that we can define,

140
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:21,760
circadian rhythm changes, cyclic changes during the 24 hour period of of of a day.

141
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:32,530
But they are very old in evolution, meaning that even are bacterias, fungi, plants,

142
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:43,240
vertebrates like ourselves from mammals in general mammals even in vertebrates like flies.

143
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:50,690
They have molecular mechanisms to regulate these cycles and rhythms and so on.

144
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:56,880
These proteins, the genes that you see here, they are conserved for during evolution.

145
00:18:56,890 --> 00:19:04,600
What I mean by conserved that they have similar functions from one group to the other one is basically all.

146
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:15,490
There are also the sequence of that gene or this, and that's equivalent to that within they have changed a little bit over time.

147
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:18,730
I mean, they are not exactly the same, let's say, if we compare.

148
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:27,760
This is called the the period, the gene that we are if we compare the sequence of our gene to amount, of course, that went to is one difference.

149
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:35,320
But they have a most they are very conserved, meaning that they have a very important following human evolution.

150
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:49,360
Now, as you can see in the field, you're one of the major factors affecting circadian rhythm of daylight is how we are exposed to light.

151
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:59,470
Yeah, right. Because some ancestors are also working the fields.

152
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:04,779
And when the sun is the most high in our traditional medicine,

153
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:17,290
Chinese medicine is the new is was is the that you know the signs Asia and noon is what our body is synchronize our body to address.

154
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:24,850
So to fix insomnia, the key is to go outside and the sun exposure.

155
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:31,180
I know, I know. The very interesting. And now we're all staying inside so we lose that regulation.

156
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:34,920
I know that also now the actual light. So this feelings.

157
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:38,950
Yeah we have to they simulate the you know spiritual also.

158
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:56,140
Yeah of course to go outside I think here but I no doubt there were so and yet at the school someone trying to do to see where they are using

159
00:20:56,140 --> 00:21:07,570
this flag in the office they improved the mood I'm certain biomarkers but I don't know what happened with that research at the end but but yes,

160
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:11,890
of course you'd better go into outside. But now we don't know that we are involved.

161
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:15,400
It will be useful. Is great. Yeah. Now.

162
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:24,480
This is not the let's say, the core mammalian clock.

163
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:31,120
And Amy is playing you a little bit about these. And again, these genes, they are acting all our teeth,

164
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:39,600
using all our organ because these are gathered rhythm we're going to show up here is working in differing organs,

165
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,380
liver brain of brain, more so adipose tissue.

166
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:50,370
But basically what we have here are these two genes, that clock and that BMAL, one gene.

167
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:54,540
These are transcription factors. They bound to the DNA.

168
00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:01,260
They bind to that DNA and they stimulate the expression of different genes.

169
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:13,020
One of these genes are DA, the b12 and thus are white one, two, and they accumulate in DC population.

170
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:18,240
And when they accumulate in the cytoplasm, they,

171
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:30,030
they form these dimer proteins and they go inside that nucleus and repress the action of that clock and animal one gene.

172
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:33,450
Then you'll see that this is a Fed feedback mechanism.

173
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:43,200
First, we start with the expression of the gene, but when that concentration in the cell is very high,

174
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:50,850
then these same genes in this case will be the proteins repress the expression of them.

175
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:58,770
Then this is a negative feedback mechanism and this cycle lasts about 24 hours.

176
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:07,230
Now there are other proteins in ball for all genes involved, but this is the, let's say, the core mechanism of the circadian clock.

177
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:12,889
Now, the circadian clock, again, I show you as I show you before in the field,

178
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:19,720
Europe is conserved among mammals, but also some of these proteins are present.

179
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:28,860
You know that organisms. There is a very old mechanism for the Guardian regulation.

180
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:38,670
Now, this is our example, massive colonialism, 24 hours, but these are not exact and so on.

181
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:42,440
I read some papers preparing this class down.

182
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:49,890
In the last more than 24 hour, 24 hours like the average.

183
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:54,400
But they are so they can have a little more than 24 hour cycles.

184
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:58,920
They're getting better. That can happen in less than 24 hour cycle by less.

185
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:02,879
Let's use that 24 hour cycles then.

186
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:11,700
So the importance point here, because those are important for thermodynamic metabolic complications that we will discuss.

187
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:21,840
One is that our lowest body temperature usually is in the A morning hours.

188
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:27,830
Usually they are about 2 hours before we feel like that.

189
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:39,450
Then they are about two hour before waking time. And then after that we have an increase of blood pressure.

190
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:47,549
We had a stop without the growth of melatonin or that the different changes then right now what I want you for you just to

191
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:55,740
ah to pay attention to this point the lowest body temperature that is more or less about two hour before our waking time.

192
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:59,430
Now how light is going to affect this Italian reason?

193
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:06,060
Then let me explain you the figure refer to the left, then this zero point here.

194
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:11,690
This is the point, let's say, out where we had the lowest body temperature,

195
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:18,720
let's say 40 number morning for more or less depending on that one DA and that person.

196
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:32,340
Now, if we are exposed to light before this law system, before this point,

197
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:40,200
let's say what is boiling that in range between 0 to 8 hours before the lower body temperature,

198
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:45,420
our circadian rhythm is going to shift, is going to have a delay.

199
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:51,620
That what you see here. Then what what will be the implication?

200
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:58,100
What happened or let me ask you this regarding is women dying how that is going to change.

201
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:06,030
They say we are exposed to light very late, like after evening or I have hard time falling to sleep and getting to.

202
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:11,100
And when you sacrifice a REM sleep cycle, like maybe you got push back, but you have to get up.

203
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:19,440
Mm hmm. Yeah, that that will will happen is, again, if we go back to this reason, then he's going to have achieved.

204
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:25,380
Then, in fact, the lower body temperature can achieve less.

205
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:28,440
It will be a little bit later. Then what?

206
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:32,580
What is going to have where when to wake later, when to go to sleep later?

207
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:39,489
That when we achieve the circadian reason you get exposed chronically to light prefers it.

208
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:42,540
Does this also affect the cortisol?

209
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:45,350
Yeah, you welcome in the morning even.

210
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:52,080
But these people, they wake up tired and then they are cortisol kicks in later and that may not be able to sleep.

211
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:58,920
Yeah. Then, then what I'm trying to, to, to show you here is that and this is one consequence of other life,

212
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:02,610
life that we are exposed to light even at night.

213
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:09,870
Then the one with the consequence of that what is sleep pattern, which is colonialism,

214
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:20,940
is going to be shifted to a delayed meaning go into the to bed later on are waking later to not on the other hand,

215
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:30,389
if we are exposed to light after this point or lower body temperature hours,

216
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:35,370
if there is something is going to happen, then bands is going to have an advance.

217
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:42,540
You're going to shift rather in the ending in the opposite direction, meaning that we're going to wake up every year and are happy.

218
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:46,460
You continued include insomnia when we are exposed to light,

219
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:52,020
say usually where we are sleeping, but we have to light through our windows and we're home.

220
00:27:52,290 --> 00:28:03,719
Then we wake up early. That will be the consequence of getting exposed to light after our body reaches the lowest temperature is clear.

221
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:11,070
This example then that is the effect of light, because light is one of the main invited.

222
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:17,910
That is, I don't know whether that may be one of the major factors affecting our current reason.

223
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:22,860
Now, also, exercise is one of the other factors affecting our circadian rhythm.

224
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:28,290
Also that timing of our of of eating is going to affect our circadian rhythm.

225
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:32,130
That that will depend where that this is happening.

226
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:38,880
Now then related to that, are you familiar with the concept of Chronotype?

227
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:47,220
Have you hear this concert. Morning types.

228
00:28:47,550 --> 00:29:05,280
The type. Yeah. Yeah. Because they are variation and this is normal variation and that's some persons they tend to go to bed early let's say 9 a.m.

229
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:10,800
Mhm. And, and they can even awake very early in the morning.

230
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:21,210
They are more active during the morning and is why this is that particular type of chronotype that is called the morning type.

231
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:34,850
Going to bed earlier and waking up earlier and they are more active during the morning hours that is.

232
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:38,189
Oh, they're tired. These are two extremes because in fact, this is continuous.

233
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:39,540
I'm going to show you some figures.

234
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:51,960
That is another title is called The Evening Type Late, rather, person going very late to bed on waking up very late during the day.

235
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:56,730
And they are more active during that evening or afternoon.

236
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:07,450
No. But in fact, all these you saw, he continued, I will show you.

237
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:13,480
But what is interesting is that they are so mean dealing like prototypes by Mendelian,

238
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:23,470
like what I mean is that they are genes that they are segregated in families, and these type are inherited from families.

239
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:32,570
But again, these are just some are a few Mendelian like these.

240
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:37,210
This is the advance. Is it fate that will be that morning type?

241
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:45,970
Is that so? Studies have found a prevalence of about a 0.5% in the population.

242
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:51,040
And again, they that these are family types and the refugee genes that have been found

243
00:30:51,070 --> 00:31:00,580
associated with these type of advances with face that delay its lead phase.

244
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:08,080
They are only one gene that had been found so far associated with these that is transmitted across farming families.

245
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:11,880
And there is another type of chronotype that is at very short.

246
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:21,460
It's the time that you see in the figure they can just sleep usually 6 hours at most per night.

247
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:27,640
And they are a popular gene that have been found associated with these type of of Aboriginal types.

248
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:39,450
Now, again, these are these are family types because in the in the in the overall population, what we offer is really this distribution.

249
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:54,060
The Western study here in the United States. Then what they asked participants is what time you are going to bed?

250
00:31:55,170 --> 00:32:05,580
And one time you wake up in week during weekends, under way in weekends, y'know, with these.

251
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:14,720
I you have more control over weekends versus weekdays. We can wake up for work or whatever.

252
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:17,840
Exactly. Yeah, we go for weekdays because of our obligation.

253
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:20,870
Maybe we need to eat.

254
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:25,160
I the idea that is not our nocturnal is the pattern.

255
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:31,760
During weekdays and during weekend, we have more control. Now, then you'll see what we have here.

256
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:37,610
That, Adam is little time during weekends for more than 50,000 subjects.

257
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:43,490
We see that moderate. I mean, he's about three in the morning.

258
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:51,170
However, we see a distribution. They are they are people in this trailer distribution.

259
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:56,630
They will be the anytime any type of persons because they have family.

260
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:07,459
Middle is the time about six in the morning meaning that they were very late to to bed but also we have so our morning types here but then really what

261
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:17,120
we have these are distribution is not that we had these two extremes rather we have had distribution of of of granola types in the in the population.

262
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:26,240
What is interesting and the comparison between are younger subjects, young adults, 20 to 24 years old.

263
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:30,410
I'm older of just 20 plus 22, 24 years.

264
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:39,500
What did you observe here and anyone is blaming the figure they went to their if this one.

265
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:44,240
Yeah older people get it earlier.

266
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:52,430
Yeah older people they get to bed to have more and more more and more morning type people.

267
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:56,450
But it's true.

268
00:33:57,710 --> 00:34:01,970
I think I'm getting longer to imagine that now.

269
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:05,240
Usually I go to bed sitting here.

270
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:10,730
Okay, bye bye. But but what is interesting also that these chronotype, they are not they are not freaks.

271
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:16,400
What I put up for aside. Yeah. Because they change over time, they the same person is going to change over time.

272
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:26,010
The Chronotype they are, they are some genetic factors but also they are other factors like age environment that are going to affect the chief.

273
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:31,159
Now comparing are among women.

274
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:45,470
I mean okay first this graphic that by the ability of chronotype they see that variability meaning that the wider the area,

275
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:51,500
the more body able they are. Then you'll see that basically are across different ages.

276
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:57,049
Divide the ability for each sex, I will say, is more or less constant.

277
00:34:57,050 --> 00:35:01,490
You see that that white on this graph, they are they seem to be more or less the same.

278
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:14,270
However, I think for let's say in 40 or less, you're all seeing the males.

279
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:25,879
And again, remember, these are standard deviation in the variability for males higher compared to to to female some time in the Middle Ages.

280
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:32,170
These are they tend to be about the same. And I will say that they remain more or less about the same for older age ages.

281
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:34,790
See some more is among the younger groups.

282
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:47,690
They think that means they have more variability in the good old type now and you see that type of chronotype again by age, comparing sexes.

283
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:52,040
Now what we observe here anyway, what happened there?

284
00:35:52,040 --> 00:36:04,270
Say too that 23 years old these. What is your interpretation looking at this part of the graph?

285
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:18,580
It's going to work. Yeah, but I mean, the comparing six is who has, um, a more morning type or who has a more evening type?

286
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:28,320
The ocean may shift more. Yeah, we see them in the green.

287
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:36,470
Mm hmm. Uh, dammit. Diameter sleep time is a little bit later that women want.

288
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:41,650
Meaning that, duh. This this graph would be a little bit to the right for.

289
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:50,820
For me. Mm hmm. They say in this age group, however, around the forties, there is a crossover.

290
00:36:51,240 --> 00:37:02,670
Mm hmm. And now in 40 plus 50 plus in our rather women that they have had distribution days, it rather a little bit shifted to that.

291
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:13,469
Right. Compared to me. Now again, these chronotype, they are no constant across ages.

292
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:20,640
We are we are changing and we are changing our history patterns and they are some genes associated with that.

293
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:28,799
Now, there was an a study that was done in these large studies for the UK Biobank is done in

294
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:37,320
the United Kingdom and they recruited almost half a million participants total here.

295
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:44,770
Wow. And they ask that question only about bring the sleep.

296
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:55,890
And they have you can imagine any type of up your interest in diabetes, mental health problems, cancers.

297
00:37:57,990 --> 00:38:01,830
These are these are very are very rich to study the information that they have.

298
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:11,160
And also they have genetic information. Now, therefore, for this study, they asked the participants how they ask the question.

299
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:18,350
Then you can ask what example ask do you feel more of a morning person or you feel more active in the evening?

300
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:21,929
Then, according to these self-reported answers,

301
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:28,709
you can classify each participant whether these are more the morning type or more

302
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:33,070
morning in the evening or more even in the morning then these are the number here.

303
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:37,980
You'll see that basically most of the participants, they they tend to be more morning types.

304
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:43,530
You see the number here of more or more 250,000 or more 50%.

305
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:48,900
And some of the characteristics, these are middle aged participants.

306
00:38:52,090 --> 00:39:04,890
Now and what we know so far. From these studies is that they are more than 351 genes associated with warning type.

307
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:10,950
Now, this graph let me read you this graph in that while you are in the x axis,

308
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:18,170
we had the chromosomes or the promoter from the one up to the X chromosome and the Y axis.

309
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:22,140
Well we had a B P-value and it because these are the statistical analysis.

310
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:31,110
What they do is they look into the whole genome and see whether they are genes or variants associated with being a morning type person.

311
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:40,020
And then these are the P values, but in algorithmic scale, meaning the higher the dot here in this case, the more significant it is.

312
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:50,980
Then so far, all this stuff that you see here over this line are genes associated with being a morning type person?

313
00:39:52,240 --> 00:40:01,410
No. Isn't a surprise that most of the genes associated with the chronotype are expressed in the brain.

314
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:08,010
They are hardly surprising in the brain. However, they are somewhat aged.

315
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:14,370
They are expressing their teachers, for example, overemotional, uterus, and even some in blood.

316
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:25,200
But most of them are genes highly expressed in the brain because the brain is the organ that is controlling the eye.

317
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,060
What is the pattern?

318
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:41,220
Now then, to finish my part in the second part, we are going to discuss how the mother temperaments are affecting our body, our carrying functions.

319
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:49,970
Then, as we discussed before, light is the major factor controlling our current reason.

320
00:40:50,370 --> 00:41:02,089
But now we have like 24 hours. Also, temperature is another factor affecting circadian rhythm.

321
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:13,610
But now we have a sea wall. We have heat that then we can more or less are constant ambient temperature and indoor exercise.

322
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:18,950
Affects also control circadian functions.

323
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:29,060
But now we tend to have more sedentary life food usually before.

324
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:38,320
When I was a kid, I was happy, usually just to be thankful for the breakfast, lunch, dinner.

325
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:43,030
But now we can have food almost continuously during the day.

326
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:52,450
Then imagine also how what the situation with our ancestors, our hominins ancestors.

327
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:56,290
The availability of food that was wasn't continuous.

328
00:41:56,740 --> 00:42:06,250
Rather, it was a more sporadic and also how they were active duty during day,

329
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:13,180
what their physical activity was during the day compared to our physical activity in their life.

330
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:21,860
And how all this is not only affected that our brain, but also remember all this clock.

331
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:27,920
They are acting in all the differing organs. That gene that I show you about, the circadian clock.

332
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:32,080
They are acting. All these are these are these sorry.

333
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:37,810
These organs and one. All of these are important.

334
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:46,089
For example, in the idea of adipose tissue, that is one with that function.

335
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:50,230
These are heat dissipation, calories burning.

336
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:57,010
Then how eating 24 hours is going to affect, for example, the function of burning adipose tissue,

337
00:42:57,430 --> 00:43:02,200
and that will be due date, for example, to the obesity epidemic that we are discussing.

338
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:09,610
How that is going to affect, let's say, I think in the microbiome cloud.

339
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:18,909
I want to discuss also how the microbiome can be controlling, affecting our current functions, then what we are going to discuss.

340
00:43:18,910 --> 00:43:22,750
In the second part, we are going to look at what other functions that sleep,

341
00:43:24,070 --> 00:43:31,570
how our sleep compared to the sleeping other primates, what are being the forces shaping the volume of your mind, sleep.

342
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:39,940
And also interesting to discuss how living in social and family groups affects what is sleep and also how affect asleep during your illusion.

343
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:52,749
And also we will discuss if this all of these sleep disorders are or their example of able to study mismatch and

344
00:43:52,750 --> 00:44:04,270
you are to have a brief introduction to the second part in one of the papers that we that we read for today.

345
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:10,600
One of the characteristics that were sleep compared to other primates is that

346
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:18,070
we sleep less than other primates are one example compared to the chimpanzee.

347
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:26,379
They say our losses are, they say relative to species they living in or in the species closest relative.

348
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:36,100
Right now, the chimpanzee, they will sleep almost 2 hours per day compared to, let's say, the average in humans.

349
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:43,090
These have also in ours. Okay, then please keep this keep this in mind because we are going to discover what I reason for these,

350
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:53,830
why we as humans replace them with primates, and what are the advantages to do that or is there is some advantages or rather these are harmful?

351
00:44:54,130 --> 00:44:57,700
Okay. Well then please keep that in mind for the second part.

352
00:44:58,810 --> 00:45:03,640
Questions. Question. Yeah, this sleep time.

353
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:17,950
Mm hmm. Statistic This part is done by because every season is different years, every sea, so many different.

354
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:22,390
And these are I see this, these, these,

355
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:30,009
these data is taken from I think they they do worldwide surveys and try to get moral is out over overall average by years.

356
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:36,460
You are right average executive but yet but by still not taking that average the mean

357
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:42,940
mean humanity different to the tool that is species to their pregnancy questions.

358
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:54,610
Okay, then let's take a break. Let me see what time you see I have 1050.

359
00:45:54,610 --> 00:45:57,700
Then let's get back 1055. Okay.

360
00:45:58,270 --> 00:46:03,790
Okay. I send you 24 hours of schedule per Chinese medicine?

361
00:46:06,264 --> 00:46:10,014
Okay. We are going to continue with the second part of our discussion.

362
00:46:10,014 --> 00:46:13,734
Then that team is going to lead that discussion.

363
00:46:19,724 --> 00:46:24,054
Oregon. Yes. Okay.

364
00:46:24,484 --> 00:46:33,734
Thank you. So very nice and daunting.

365
00:46:35,594 --> 00:46:39,344
So our has already shared so much about sleep ablution.

366
00:46:39,794 --> 00:46:44,534
I'm going to talk a bit more about this hobby. So let's go.

367
00:46:45,284 --> 00:46:53,384
There is still debate over how sleep works. Various viewpoints address the problem of sleep functions in different ways.

368
00:46:53,594 --> 00:46:59,054
In this first presentation, we will discuss how we measure sleep and sex.

369
00:46:59,054 --> 00:47:06,284
Proposed hypothesis of sleep functions, differences of human sleep compared to sleep in other primates,

370
00:47:06,854 --> 00:47:14,534
and how living in social family groups may have moderated sleep strategies during human evolution.

371
00:47:14,594 --> 00:47:19,834
Finally, we will also discuss how evolutionary mismatch plays a role in sleep disorders.

372
00:47:23,944 --> 00:47:29,314
So how do we measure sleep? Although there isn't a simple single way to measure sleep.

373
00:47:30,004 --> 00:47:37,714
Various characteristics can be used to identify arousal levels till more physiological and

374
00:47:37,714 --> 00:47:42,634
behavioral indicators that are associated with sleep are used to identify sleep state.

375
00:47:43,774 --> 00:47:50,994
A sleep state is usually correlated with EEG electromyography behavioral amplitude of air,

376
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:57,514
peace bursted, pulse patterns of action potentials, rest of the flurry rate and the gene expression.

377
00:48:01,624 --> 00:48:05,404
Additionally, unlike most other physiological processes,

378
00:48:05,644 --> 00:48:13,954
sleep can be defined at multiple organizational levels individually or various levels simultaneously.

379
00:48:17,014 --> 00:48:22,414
So there are six proposed functions we hope we will discuss in this presentation.

380
00:48:23,494 --> 00:48:35,464
So first, sleep serves and IMU function sleep have has long been recommended by medical professionals to help patients recover from illnesses.

381
00:48:36,364 --> 00:48:42,904
This is very strong evidence that immune system parameters are impacted by sleep or lack of sleep.

382
00:48:43,354 --> 00:48:52,684
For instance, our reduction in subsequent immunization induced antibody response is correlated with sleep deprivation.

383
00:48:53,764 --> 00:49:00,964
Additionally, several studies showed that sleep patterns vary as infectious disease progresses.

384
00:49:03,074 --> 00:49:12,764
A correlation between strong sleep response to an infectious challenge and decreased morbidity and mortality was subsequently demonstrated.

385
00:49:13,424 --> 00:49:21,734
That relationship implies that sleep does AIDS that in the body a body's ability to heal from infectious disease.

386
00:49:23,594 --> 00:49:31,094
This explanation of sleep function does not, however, explain why sleep is paired with unconsciousness.

387
00:49:32,024 --> 00:49:38,594
The concept does provide benefits for evolution, save calorie in case of intense energy needs.

388
00:49:38,834 --> 00:49:52,334
For example, fever. The BNR address is higher than the whole body metabolic rate during sleep in mammals.

389
00:49:52,874 --> 00:50:03,164
Now rapid eye movement sleep regulates body and bring temperature at a lower level and her heaven nation is initiated by now.

390
00:50:03,674 --> 00:50:06,514
Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Sleep Supplements.

391
00:50:06,524 --> 00:50:15,534
Waking a stored energy cell theory is associated with the hypothesis of sleep to reduce energy consumption.

392
00:50:19,484 --> 00:50:28,154
The isms cannot continue to extend the same amount of energy while sleeping as it does while awake,

393
00:50:28,544 --> 00:50:33,674
because it will not be able to catch up with the energy supply.

394
00:50:34,154 --> 00:50:40,574
The reduction in energy expenditure during sleep is likely to confer adaptive benefits.

395
00:50:41,594 --> 00:50:48,974
Even microbes use the rest activities thermal to serve energy and avoid predators.

396
00:50:50,084 --> 00:50:54,854
Sleep and sleep and the rest circle complement each other.

397
00:50:55,664 --> 00:51:02,564
However, it is unclear whether a calorie restriction is the crucial factor for the formation of sleep.

398
00:51:03,584 --> 00:51:13,184
In addition, it's unclear, as stated, why this function requires a reduced response to environmental cues.

399
00:51:17,424 --> 00:51:22,184
Then sleep also restores bring energy to stores.

400
00:51:24,774 --> 00:51:32,724
Positron Emission Tomography Tomography Studies in human supports.

401
00:51:32,724 --> 00:51:38,244
The hypothesis that sleep has a distinct metabolic function for the brain,

402
00:51:39,354 --> 00:51:47,934
showing that the brain utilizes most twice as much glucose as awake as it does during slow wave sleep.

403
00:51:49,554 --> 00:51:56,784
Since metabolic rates are higher during rapid eye movement sleep than they are during awake,

404
00:51:57,294 --> 00:52:09,084
if downregulation of brain metabolized is a sleep function, it appears to exclusive to rapid knockout the rapid eye movement.

405
00:52:15,714 --> 00:52:27,794
Let me repeat with an apology for the hypothesis, actually, one of the four families to have that brain tumor, worst of all entities.

406
00:52:28,554 --> 00:52:35,954
Now, however, we know what brain is bigger than all the primates brain that.

407
00:52:37,044 --> 00:52:47,634
Then the expectation, according to the theories, will be that we need to see more the presence of primates than we observe the the opposite.

408
00:52:47,814 --> 00:52:52,794
Yes. That was replaced with new things.

409
00:52:53,274 --> 00:52:59,394
Do you do you think that that then is enough to reject the hypothesis useful?

410
00:52:59,904 --> 00:53:04,014
What are your thoughts to that? To the over to what way we sleep?

411
00:53:04,494 --> 00:53:08,844
Yes. Even when our brain is being monitored.

412
00:53:10,134 --> 00:53:13,134
I have a question. Okay. To all the time.

413
00:53:14,484 --> 00:53:17,994
Do we sleep less now than we were before?

414
00:53:20,544 --> 00:53:25,624
Let's go back to one tiny historical time.

415
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:34,584
Yeah, yeah. It was like, oh, no.

416
00:53:35,204 --> 00:53:39,354
Hmm. Is there a way to know how much we slept? Yeah, I don't know.

417
00:53:40,394 --> 00:53:44,364
How about before the lights? How long was Kindle like before science?

418
00:53:44,754 --> 00:53:48,564
Good navigation. Documentation. What do we know?

419
00:53:48,744 --> 00:53:51,774
Is there any evidence? Yeah, I think we don't know.

420
00:53:52,644 --> 00:53:59,124
I imagine that is during these difficult times and it is writings.

421
00:53:59,514 --> 00:54:05,454
We can have some kind of evidence. But before writing, I don't know.

422
00:54:05,454 --> 00:54:13,644
How can we get that evidence? But. But right now, why?

423
00:54:16,924 --> 00:54:26,274
Because I you're in one not that big but I think they got the data from hotter than it is and would be more this is big in the past.

424
00:54:27,484 --> 00:54:31,704
And they they did they they sweep this same and out to sea.

425
00:54:31,954 --> 00:54:40,014
Then the whale is now all their fragments. And how do you make it happen?

426
00:54:40,414 --> 00:54:43,734
If these hypotheses make sense, given the fact that we think this.

427
00:54:46,064 --> 00:54:51,484
And again, I would say that. Right.

428
00:54:52,044 --> 00:54:56,994
And that's like compared to other families. I mean, you like it's been.

429
00:54:58,524 --> 00:55:02,274
To restore their memory and to.

430
00:55:03,864 --> 00:55:08,284
To their friends. We got our dining room and get that.

431
00:55:08,344 --> 00:55:12,833
That's the reason our diet is provided.

432
00:55:12,834 --> 00:55:17,964
That takes right. Then we don't need a lot of sleep.

433
00:55:18,654 --> 00:55:22,214
I think where went to this was also, as we called it associated.

434
00:55:23,364 --> 00:55:27,954
These is not. A trade off but happy with sleep too much.

435
00:55:28,974 --> 00:55:32,204
You might need that fast. Predators.

436
00:55:32,754 --> 00:55:43,104
Predators. So it's like yeah yeah you you remain in the past where they thought for me they went to sleep in the background.

437
00:55:43,764 --> 00:55:50,334
Then there is cooperation with these high intensity by a lot and also the cost associated with air pollution.

438
00:55:51,724 --> 00:56:02,244
Okay. And also like one possible reason for why we sleep last and other primates, I will discuss later in the presentation.

439
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:17,604
Thank you. So the proposed emphatic function of sleep is dependent upon enhanced conduction flow from the brain to the circulation during sleep.

440
00:56:17,934 --> 00:56:26,184
The convection flow would drag toxic foxing and other boring products, thereby removing them from the brain.

441
00:56:27,414 --> 00:56:35,484
Increased cell activity associated with wakefulness increases the conversion of a large substance to smaller molecules,

442
00:56:36,114 --> 00:56:40,224
thereby increasing cell cellular osmotic pressure and volume.

443
00:56:41,154 --> 00:56:47,124
Because the brain is a closed compartment and water is essentially not compressible,

444
00:56:48,024 --> 00:56:56,034
cell activity is associated with changing ratios of cell volume to extracellular food for volume.

445
00:56:56,454 --> 00:57:08,244
Increased brings cell activity also includes transient local increases in blood flow in the brain,

446
00:57:08,514 --> 00:57:12,534
thereby increasing local extracellular fluid volume.

447
00:57:13,854 --> 00:57:26,994
The idea that sleep serves a democratic function currently needs more investigation, including this question between the states of our knees,

448
00:57:27,524 --> 00:57:41,184
these fish and sleep, and addressing the issue of rapid states changing characteristics of poly basic sleep of most vertebrates.

449
00:57:41,964 --> 00:57:49,614
It is also unclear if this proposed function is directly linked to sleep homeostasis.

450
00:57:54,124 --> 00:57:57,454
So to. Next one.

451
00:57:58,144 --> 00:58:02,254
Lack of sleep can cause cognitive and behavioral problems.

452
00:58:02,644 --> 00:58:07,144
This is observed at a level of cognitive behavioral across the organism,

453
00:58:08,134 --> 00:58:18,394
as well as and cognitive performance paradigms that relies on activation of single sensory cortical colors.

454
00:58:19,024 --> 00:58:23,404
So get into impact dependency and use dependance.

455
00:58:23,724 --> 00:58:29,764
This was the level of empowerment after sleep deprivation.

456
00:58:29,974 --> 00:58:35,404
Performed, recovers, performs. Recovered in a sleep dose depending on weight.

457
00:58:36,604 --> 00:58:41,694
Sleep is therefore considered to have the ability to restore peak performance.

458
00:58:46,224 --> 00:58:49,224
The next two one sleep connections.

459
00:58:49,464 --> 00:58:58,343
Maser may serve neural function by the dynamics of neural pathways plasticity mechanism in

460
00:58:58,344 --> 00:59:06,324
the notion of recognizing the logical development of the cognitive system and development.

461
00:59:07,734 --> 00:59:12,024
Spontaneous connection between neurons and glial cells.

462
00:59:12,024 --> 00:59:23,214
Cells creates cellular networks that control molecular interaction via synopsys and extracellular impulses between neurons.

463
00:59:23,754 --> 00:59:30,684
And this figure shows the sleep associated chemicals and molecular molecules

464
00:59:30,744 --> 00:59:36,384
connected to neural connections are changing as a result of cell activity.

465
00:59:37,674 --> 00:59:47,784
The principles of active activity driven modification in small neural networks is shown by this reduced molecular network.

466
00:59:52,234 --> 01:00:02,354
Gene expression influences these processes and the signaling molecules and synapses that are impacted.

467
01:00:02,884 --> 01:00:05,104
Modify. Modify. Network Features.

468
01:00:05,584 --> 01:00:17,374
Many of the genes involved have have activity, dependent expression and are implicated in the control of connection and sleep.

469
01:00:18,484 --> 01:00:28,324
This diagram depicts how activity dependent mechanisms involve involving cytokines and neural neurotrophic influences.

470
01:00:28,324 --> 01:00:41,244
A small network. So now let's talk about how on how humans and other primates sleep differences are different.

471
01:00:42,474 --> 01:00:53,394
So the study of sleep in the study, the paper in the in canvas, it explores the developed development of human sleep patterns,

472
01:00:53,664 --> 01:01:01,734
focusing on total sleep duration, rapid eye movement, sleep duration, and now rapid eye movement sleep.

473
01:01:02,364 --> 01:01:07,074
And also the proportion of sleep in rapid eye movement sleep.

474
01:01:12,954 --> 01:01:19,244
As a theological I feel a few of.

475
01:01:21,734 --> 01:01:30,764
I saw the traffic. Approach is used to take you really put human features together in the context of a large primate comparison.

476
01:01:32,054 --> 01:01:37,694
So the study used two different based basing approach.

477
01:01:37,724 --> 01:01:42,853
One is based on generalized, at least a square prediction,

478
01:01:42,854 --> 01:01:52,454
and the other OAU evolution model is based on random drift and statically select selected multiple states.

479
01:01:56,834 --> 01:02:05,234
So out of the 30 investigated primates, humans have the shortest leap every 20 for a period time.

480
01:02:05,714 --> 01:02:17,804
And the approaches show that humans sleep less than would be predicted for weight, predict predation,

481
01:02:17,804 --> 01:02:25,544
threat, brain size for fear of gauging needs, sexual selection and primate diets.

482
01:02:26,534 --> 01:02:33,134
These findings also suggest that humans have surprisingly higher rate of rapid eye movement sleep when they

483
01:02:33,134 --> 01:02:41,774
have less sleep overall because they are reducing now rapid eye movement sleep rather than increasing it.

484
01:02:42,584 --> 01:02:46,724
The findings are largely supported by the new model,

485
01:02:46,904 --> 01:02:56,774
which deduced that the ratio of now rapid eye movement sleep to rapid eye movement sleep has changed over the human evolutionary lineage.

486
01:02:57,314 --> 01:03:04,304
While the ratio of rapid eye movement has not, I don't remember.

487
01:03:05,354 --> 01:03:18,464
When do they propose any reason why the round proportion of that round spacing remains longer and they're pregnant?

488
01:03:19,454 --> 01:03:20,894
I don't think they have that part.

489
01:03:22,394 --> 01:03:31,304
Yeah, and if we did, then what you think would be the advantages with a longer round period, but that short term total time.

490
01:03:37,684 --> 01:03:45,964
Well, I'm going to do that. I'm okay.

491
01:03:46,034 --> 01:03:49,924
Romney's excited that this day when we are dreaming it.

492
01:03:52,164 --> 01:03:55,734
I know friends. Yeah, I know. Yeah.

493
01:03:55,994 --> 01:03:59,884
I don't know whether we are going to be meeting up with these.

494
01:04:00,544 --> 01:04:04,944
But as you well know, where you live is longer, proportionally longer.

495
01:04:05,794 --> 01:04:13,524
I know that, Prime Minister. We just. I think one more relaxed state.

496
01:04:13,884 --> 01:04:17,064
And I think there's a down regulation.

497
01:04:17,394 --> 01:04:21,344
Like rural fire. Yeah.

498
01:04:21,634 --> 01:04:25,074
It would be a long laundry. Yeah.

499
01:04:25,644 --> 01:04:27,824
So it takes a while for us to come out of.

500
01:04:33,414 --> 01:04:43,554
What I would do, but because that is the kind of actually connect with the higher power and then the way I am done with it,

501
01:04:43,554 --> 01:04:46,614
I know exactly who I am saying is true.

502
01:04:47,344 --> 01:04:50,454
And so on.

503
01:04:50,484 --> 01:04:57,264
The discussion part actually solved the question I was just asked like why we sleep less than the other primates.

504
01:04:57,624 --> 01:05:04,224
The risk and opportunity cost of sleep are responsible for shorter sleep duration in humans.

505
01:05:04,824 --> 01:05:14,154
The risk can come from sleep other such as like predators and sleep time and also be used to do other things like study,

506
01:05:14,814 --> 01:05:17,544
making, material goods and stuff like that.

507
01:05:22,264 --> 01:05:28,983
To study how living in social and family groups may have modulated sleeping strategies during human evolution.

508
01:05:28,984 --> 01:05:33,904
We also need to study whether sleep is selfish or altruistic.

509
01:05:34,714 --> 01:05:43,564
The two graphs explained that the amount of sleep a person gets depend on how closely related individuals are to each other in the group.

510
01:05:43,924 --> 01:05:45,454
Individuals in group.

511
01:05:45,454 --> 01:05:57,694
A sacrificed more sleep when relatedness was strong, which was the case with lower female dispersal to keep the vigilance to hazard.

512
01:05:58,774 --> 01:06:07,114
Consider a person who is naturally drawn to sleep more. If this result is in a game in their own productivity,

513
01:06:07,114 --> 01:06:15,334
success and a loss in the productive success of their social partners, this sleep approach may be defined as selfish.

514
01:06:16,474 --> 01:06:23,554
Whereas a person whereas persons who sacrifice sleep may be described as altruistic.

515
01:06:24,424 --> 01:06:35,674
So in graph B, individuals give up more sleep where relatedness is lower, which occurs when female dispersal is higher.

516
01:06:36,094 --> 01:06:47,694
If an individual who sleeps comparatively more experiences a loss of productivity success and benefits their social partners,

517
01:06:47,914 --> 01:06:51,304
they are considered to be acting altruistically.

518
01:06:51,784 --> 01:06:56,824
We are also an individual who sacrifices sleep is doing selfishly.

519
01:06:57,094 --> 01:07:05,764
But actually I have a question for you to discuss, like why these two situations happens at the at the same time.

520
01:07:07,774 --> 01:07:11,364
You ask, do you understand this graph?

521
01:07:11,404 --> 01:07:20,794
The group work where they are playing this game. Let me rephrase a little bit that we can take to ask about this question.

522
01:07:22,894 --> 01:07:27,784
The question is, okay, I think this or even that rule.

523
01:07:28,234 --> 01:07:31,774
I might do that, but then I decided to be blessed.

524
01:07:32,854 --> 01:07:40,544
Now I am doing that because if we stick to the same, we are a social family rule for myself,

525
01:07:40,544 --> 01:07:46,534
then we'll go back to sleep in a while and do the other way to protect ourselves.

526
01:07:47,794 --> 01:07:51,234
Then that would be an easy behavior.

527
01:07:51,334 --> 01:07:54,664
On sacrificing my seat to help protect my family.

528
01:07:55,354 --> 01:07:59,254
Now the the other graph that went to my right e-tolling rather.

529
01:07:59,624 --> 01:08:12,273
I think that if I could sleep in a safe way because I want to read reviews more, then maybe I'm going to take advantage of people that are sleeping.

530
01:08:12,274 --> 01:08:19,834
And for example, you might see insomnia. That makes them both right and good to me.

531
01:08:20,074 --> 01:08:23,524
We will therefore be more than that with yoga.

532
01:08:23,794 --> 01:08:29,794
What are the factors that that affect in human human evolution?

533
01:08:30,184 --> 01:08:37,414
That the things that we are going to sacrifice is leave these people that we are in our group,

534
01:08:37,714 --> 01:08:48,104
they are more related to this idea and then losing that way applies to your writing.

535
01:08:48,214 --> 01:08:55,014
That's more selfish because like in primate groups, they aren't as socially structured.

536
01:08:55,864 --> 01:09:00,693
So like humans, it's like more of a complex structure.

537
01:09:00,694 --> 01:09:05,004
So like remembering productive capabilities, definitely.

538
01:09:08,514 --> 01:09:09,824
I don't know if.

539
01:09:11,154 --> 01:09:24,434
Somebody going to bed or needing to take place, especially because we have such a long gestation period in terms of also taking care of the child is.

540
01:09:29,914 --> 01:09:38,834
Yeah. That never seems like a kind of far fetched argument because also, like, if one man goes and improved things, all the females and.

541
01:09:39,264 --> 01:09:47,374
The Beverly Hills, it seems like for nine months now.

542
01:09:48,114 --> 01:10:03,614
Yeah, but but if I recall they say okay fair to say the had to rethink behavior that particularly that was the behavior like the

543
01:10:03,684 --> 01:10:17,094
eve because by eat by the people is not like me and where you have a health problem they say yeah but I think this is a bad.

544
01:10:17,394 --> 01:10:24,833
However, in my opinion is protecting and saving my kids and my grandkids think it will

545
01:10:24,834 --> 01:10:27,984
be fine if you always say that that behavior is going to be advantageous,

546
01:10:28,314 --> 01:10:40,074
because I'm happy that that might be the bottom line. Now, the problem is in that group, there is no one who dated who they are.

547
01:10:40,074 --> 01:10:43,914
Yes, they did not.

548
01:10:43,914 --> 01:10:50,334
They don't. Chairman, then there is not a regular family for you because they are 19th.

549
01:10:50,954 --> 01:10:55,523
You have to think the concept of like a singular family makes pretty recent too.

550
01:10:55,524 --> 01:10:59,774
Like if you look at like tribes back in the day, like everyone's kids.

551
01:11:01,094 --> 01:11:04,304
Everyone wants. And other kids.

552
01:11:05,224 --> 01:11:11,043
So I don't see the like you don't see that as much with primates.

553
01:11:11,044 --> 01:11:17,794
I mean, you see it with some primates like and or something will take care of the kids like you often see like somebody going.

554
01:11:18,474 --> 01:11:27,024
Sometimes I kill you. And I don't think you can see that in the structure as much as that person would be like he's out of the group somehow.

555
01:11:27,984 --> 01:11:31,974
And then you just. Yeah.

556
01:11:32,974 --> 01:11:38,164
Yeah. Um, what do you think about the other an idea rather than, uh,

557
01:11:40,294 --> 01:11:46,834
and I think most likely it was thinking again in what we've done in the past of these selective forces.

558
01:11:49,954 --> 01:11:58,624
The sacrifice in my sleep, I think rather to behavior to improve my chances or option that was,

559
01:11:58,804 --> 01:12:04,194
is what happened in the past because, um, and I think that the type of,

560
01:12:04,984 --> 01:12:10,214
of situation that we call is gun violence selection that,

561
01:12:10,214 --> 01:12:18,124
that is afraid of sometimes certain behavior can be these advantages that they are from beneficial to that behavior.

562
01:12:18,514 --> 01:12:26,374
Then at the end there is like that point that we the optimum fitness for that for this species yet those are some of these

563
01:12:26,374 --> 01:12:38,433
the action theoretical discussions but they are based on some other type of theory that we know that I think that we found

564
01:12:38,434 --> 01:12:49,204
that we try to was quite late relative or we were really we think we are that we are being said which is to pass our genes

565
01:12:50,434 --> 01:12:57,514
then and I think that that made good idea of these he knew how deep sacrifice was be said if you choose rather than.

566
01:13:01,804 --> 01:13:06,963
Yeah. Let's talk about our last topic.

567
01:13:06,964 --> 01:13:16,714
How sleep disorders may be due to evolutionary mismatch like sleep is critical for memory retention, concentration and the immune system.

568
01:13:17,104 --> 01:13:25,684
Having sleep disorder may cause immune system failure, causing infections, inflammatory response, and some kind of cancer.

569
01:13:28,504 --> 01:13:35,044
50 to 70 million people in the US are experiencing chronic sleeping disturbance.

570
01:13:35,674 --> 01:13:44,704
So actually this, this part is my favorite. So yeah, so the first sleeping disorder we got talk about is insomnia.

571
01:13:45,064 --> 01:13:51,244
The the prevalence for insomnia is around 10% and it is described as having trouble

572
01:13:51,244 --> 01:13:56,794
falling or staying asleep despite having plenty of time or a good environment to sleep.

573
01:13:57,904 --> 01:14:03,124
It is also linked to considerable functional impairment or decreased quality of life.

574
01:14:04,024 --> 01:14:13,224
There is evidence to suggest that hyper activity, which includes several alterations such as sympathetic, sympathetic nervous systems,

575
01:14:13,534 --> 01:14:23,884
nervous system activation and a reduction in the need for sleep through to homeostasis is frequently linked to insomnia,

576
01:14:24,424 --> 01:14:31,624
stress and excessive or altered alertness related to external stress.

577
01:14:31,924 --> 01:14:36,334
Stress of May might lead to insomnia.

578
01:14:37,384 --> 01:14:42,034
It also may work as an adaptive trait that helps people cope with threats.

579
01:14:43,204 --> 01:14:45,063
From an evolutionary standpoint,

580
01:14:45,064 --> 01:14:56,014
it makes a lot of sense that having this system that expressed the urge for sleep when making a threat such as the presence of a predator is present.

581
01:14:56,254 --> 01:15:07,084
However, these stretch threats have significantly diminished in recent times when it comes to staying vigilant to physical.

582
01:15:08,374 --> 01:15:15,844
Physical threats. Sleep deprivation brought on by enzymes during stressful occasions is rarely beneficial.

583
01:15:16,234 --> 01:15:25,714
Therefore, we are in a situation where many people live in a safe environment, no longer benefit from potential adaptive solution from our ancestors.

584
01:15:28,814 --> 01:15:35,984
Exactly that the affluent view that people on the farm associated with this whole new things and they feel that it is

585
01:15:36,164 --> 01:15:44,674
an ethical body that makes sense given the hypothesis that it is a selective advantage in the past for having insomnia.

586
01:15:45,344 --> 01:15:58,333
But I have seen a lot of specific works like 1924 and six of those people who have insomnia and they have a high level of that in their head,

587
01:15:58,334 --> 01:16:01,444
in the brain, in the hair and the head there.

588
01:16:01,534 --> 01:16:04,663
Yeah, that means that in the brain and most people,

589
01:16:04,664 --> 01:16:12,074
particularly in sleep when the night comes and the copper toxicity, make them all rethink where they're sleeping.

590
01:16:12,734 --> 01:16:18,254
So these two things, they're imagining toxins. We also know, especially in Michigan,

591
01:16:18,254 --> 01:16:27,314
because a lot of the car manufacturing used to use that they in these that the plus for plastics charges as a part of the production of the car.

592
01:16:27,644 --> 01:16:32,354
So more people in this region anticipation them with.

593
01:16:36,374 --> 01:16:39,464
So slipping to us is a problem.

594
01:16:40,814 --> 01:16:42,734
Too much. It might be possibly a problem.

595
01:16:43,154 --> 01:16:52,874
So narcolepsy present another interesting situation from an evolutionary point of view where the cost does not match the new environment component.

596
01:16:53,324 --> 01:16:58,424
Narcolepsy affects only about 0.02 or 2.03% of the US population.

597
01:16:59,714 --> 01:17:05,773
Such a low prevalence suggests that narcolepsy itself is now adaptive and instead we

598
01:17:05,774 --> 01:17:12,464
need to consider how evolution has made human humans susceptible to the disease.

599
01:17:13,574 --> 01:17:17,264
People with this condition experience excessive daytime sleepiness.

600
01:17:18,524 --> 01:17:23,894
Narcolepsy offers to evolutionary perspective to to explore.

601
01:17:24,704 --> 01:17:30,914
Several studies have identified genetic variation associated with narcolepsy,

602
01:17:31,154 --> 01:17:38,384
including variations in human leukocyte antigen site associated with immune response.

603
01:17:38,714 --> 01:17:46,154
Although this genetic studies could explain the link with narcolepsy and potentially other autoimmune diseases,

604
01:17:46,454 --> 01:17:50,744
it is unclear whether these alleles were favored by natural selection.

605
01:17:52,364 --> 01:17:59,353
Alternatively, it is possible that narcolepsy and related genes reflect ancient adaptations that

606
01:17:59,354 --> 01:18:04,004
are no longer related but have been carried down due to a low selection pressure.

607
01:18:05,984 --> 01:18:15,704
The second idea is a evolutionary mismatch. In addition to genetics, environmental factors also seem to be important in narcolepsy.

608
01:18:16,124 --> 01:18:24,524
Evidence for this idea includes inconsistency in gene variants and disease among different populations as well,

609
01:18:24,554 --> 01:18:30,404
as well as low inconsistencies in narcolepsy among identical twins and other family members.

610
01:18:31,934 --> 01:18:32,624
In addition,

611
01:18:33,344 --> 01:18:44,924
narcolepsy has been thus documented in humans and domesticated animals that have close and frequent contact with people such as dog horses and sheep.

612
01:18:46,334 --> 01:18:54,434
Infectious agents are thought to be one of the environmental cause of narcolepsy.

613
01:18:57,094 --> 01:19:02,284
Overall, we believe that narcolepsy is a disease with ancient genetic roots,

614
01:19:02,824 --> 01:19:09,544
some genetic variants that until now have not had sufficient environmental triggers to express themselves.

615
01:19:10,774 --> 01:19:15,654
When these genetic variants were expressed in our evolutionary history,

616
01:19:15,664 --> 01:19:20,794
they would have been removed from the population under low levels of perception.

617
01:19:26,744 --> 01:19:31,814
So we talked about circadian rhythms in the first part of the lecture.

618
01:19:32,144 --> 01:19:39,043
The difference between people's natural sleep schedule and the sleep schedule that is

619
01:19:39,044 --> 01:19:45,104
preferred due to does due to social factors is known as circadian rhythm disorder.

620
01:19:45,554 --> 01:19:54,464
The mismatch between different types of sleep that characterize circadian disorder includes very delayed sleep phase syndrome,

621
01:19:54,614 --> 01:20:05,924
advanced sleep phase syndrome, and irregular sleep wake patterns, which we have discussed on genetic factors underlying these circumstances,

622
01:20:06,254 --> 01:20:10,784
which are controlled by environmental and developmental variables.

623
01:20:11,474 --> 01:20:18,404
They only represent diseases in the sense that society's best precise sleep wake patterns.

624
01:20:19,094 --> 01:20:29,354
But these people are the January normal variant in the sense that they have no symptoms if they are permitted to sleep on their desire to schedule.

625
01:20:30,194 --> 01:20:39,314
It can be claimed, however, that various sleep wake rhythms are advantageous to many people and communities,

626
01:20:40,544 --> 01:20:44,204
enabling them to perform crucial functions of society.

627
01:20:45,134 --> 01:20:53,354
This applies to those who work shifts, night shifts or requires a lot of overtime to get enough rest.

628
01:20:54,734 --> 01:20:58,934
Give always somewhat variable day and nights.

629
01:20:59,384 --> 01:21:06,554
So of course may be beneficial from an evolutionary point of view as well as their communities.

630
01:21:07,034 --> 01:21:15,164
Even among hunter gatherers, diverse sleep samples may have been advantageous in our evolutionary past,

631
01:21:15,704 --> 01:21:23,144
just as different jobs exist today to fulfill the demands of economic growth and around the clock security.

632
01:21:26,714 --> 01:21:30,364
A Seasonal Affective Disorder is true for Assadi.

633
01:21:30,394 --> 01:21:38,344
It is defined by the onset of depression symptoms that require each winter and subside each summer.

634
01:21:38,704 --> 01:21:49,804
The prevalence of Sadie is less than 1% in the US, according to some evidence, Sadie is essentially a circadian disease,

635
01:21:50,074 --> 01:21:57,664
since those who have it produce more melatonin, which is repressed by light exposure.

636
01:21:58,444 --> 01:22:05,194
It has been hypothesized that, as is adaptable in hardy seasonal environments,

637
01:22:05,704 --> 01:22:15,003
that getting more sleep during the winter preserves energy and maintains thermal regulation that ends up getting more energy.

638
01:22:15,004 --> 01:22:25,624
And the capacity to walk during warmer, more productive months would be advantageous before the before the electric light.

639
01:22:25,804 --> 01:22:30,264
It is easy to see the adaptive benefits of this feature in agriculture.

640
01:22:30,274 --> 01:22:32,434
Agricultural civilizations,

641
01:22:33,574 --> 01:22:45,094
where food production was concentrated in the small part of the year and winter were long as any would apply to a relatively small and

642
01:22:45,094 --> 01:22:56,194
decreasing population proportion of the total population who live in high latitudes without accessing or without access to modern light,

643
01:22:56,494 --> 01:23:08,674
and thus could be an example of an evolutionary mismatch if more research to support the concept yields a personality story.

644
01:23:09,394 --> 01:23:13,064
Story. When I move to the United States, I'm focused every day,

645
01:23:13,714 --> 01:23:22,084
every time that is not is keeping life believing that you are not even immobilized within that longer than 30 minutes.

646
01:23:23,794 --> 01:23:29,644
Then that may that we get here. And I just tell you what's important was I got depressed.

647
01:23:29,644 --> 01:23:33,604
What's your depression? I feel bad now.

648
01:23:33,664 --> 01:23:37,114
I get more used to that by gum. Yes.

649
01:23:37,114 --> 01:23:47,514
I don't know whether people living in the tropics, the genes we have, the somehow we are not even highlighted what we are getting in the.

650
01:23:47,854 --> 01:23:52,954
No, but yes, I remember the first week that was difficult.

651
01:23:53,494 --> 01:24:02,914
Well, I to me to in the entire world we hardly ever hurt anyone before anybody move to New York.

652
01:24:03,394 --> 01:24:10,684
Oh, my goodness. Oh, Toronto. That's so important.

653
01:24:11,044 --> 01:24:15,874
When I moved back, I'm from Toronto. I lived in Miami for.

654
01:24:15,934 --> 01:24:26,163
Oh, yeah, yeah. So I got that when I came back to Michigan is bad less last year even this year they know I can't just you it's like kind of

655
01:24:26,164 --> 01:24:35,644
like the you think of like the the phenotypic plasticity that that you can you can you can shift depending on the environment.

656
01:24:36,154 --> 01:24:42,754
You're going to shift one way to another, deport back home.

657
01:24:42,964 --> 01:24:48,244
There was nobody in high school and taking the pressure pills home.

658
01:24:48,934 --> 01:24:55,774
And everybody's advancing outside because, you know, I want to say my life,

659
01:24:56,224 --> 01:25:03,094
although part of that is because also before I think there was my wiring awareness about mental problems.

660
01:25:03,874 --> 01:25:14,073
I remember also when I was a kid, this is when people misbehave or nobody wants to go to class.

661
01:25:14,074 --> 01:25:18,934
It's just good that people that not just these mean behavior, but I do know what I saw.

662
01:25:18,934 --> 01:25:25,054
So we were there wasn't only awareness about also the mental problem.

663
01:25:28,134 --> 01:25:34,584
Nobody agree with you it for that good. You really can exert physical activity that everybody just wants to follow.

664
01:25:34,884 --> 01:25:46,074
It was hard, more fun. It's more fun for you to actually go and then people work because it is much easier, right?

665
01:25:47,334 --> 01:25:50,574
We like to do here is even more entertaining.

666
01:25:50,624 --> 01:25:54,684
The professor's a little bit. Not as great back.

667
01:25:54,984 --> 01:25:58,894
Okay. Let's hope so. So I do think maybe even higher.

668
01:25:58,914 --> 01:26:02,084
Still more depressed. Even more depressed here.

669
01:26:02,664 --> 01:26:07,164
I mean, same people. They are harder environment, but we are not as depressed.

670
01:26:10,424 --> 01:26:14,624
So the vast sleep disorder we're going to talk about is sleep apnea.

671
01:26:15,644 --> 01:26:21,704
And it is characterized by a succession of brand breathing patterns while sleeping.

672
01:26:22,124 --> 01:26:28,634
This type of sleep apnea occurs when the upper airway squatting muscle drops while sleeping.

673
01:26:29,444 --> 01:26:40,214
Therefore, constructive sleeping apnea may be seen as an illustration of either evolutionary mismatch disease, where too much high calorie food,

674
01:26:40,784 --> 01:26:52,604
alcohol, a sedentary lifestyle and smoking contribute to the rise of this disorder, especially in older persons post productive ages.

675
01:26:55,094 --> 01:26:59,534
So here is a discussion question for us to talk about.

676
01:27:00,164 --> 01:27:05,364
So what are some good ways to treat or reduce the symptoms of the disorders?

677
01:27:07,454 --> 01:27:16,394
Anyone? Less technology has been dying yet.

678
01:27:17,834 --> 01:27:20,744
Yes, that's true. Seriously?

679
01:27:21,164 --> 01:27:28,754
I think that's a really broad question because each disorder has a different mechanism and some mechanisms are unknown and misunderstood,

680
01:27:28,754 --> 01:27:31,364
like narcolepsy. Well, you know, why does that happen?

681
01:27:31,594 --> 01:27:39,614
I say there are things you can do to be safe if you do have narcolepsy, but it's like they can't drive cars like they can.

682
01:27:41,324 --> 01:27:44,324
It's just not well understood.

683
01:27:44,654 --> 01:27:52,634
I think that the mechanism of narcolepsy and the reason why people have narcolepsy is very different than like reasons why people develop sleep apnea,

684
01:27:52,634 --> 01:28:03,704
which could be due to like, you know, overdevelopment of subcutaneous fat in that part of the body due to potentially lifestyle factors,

685
01:28:04,614 --> 01:28:10,304
you know, obesity, which is highly heritable due to environment interactions like this.

686
01:28:10,634 --> 01:28:13,604
Just a very broad question. Yeah, you know, it is.

687
01:28:13,634 --> 01:28:23,354
And I think that but it is important that we see the difference between that division that will be harder for these more people out there,

688
01:28:24,074 --> 01:28:24,654
for example,

689
01:28:24,684 --> 01:28:34,934
yet inadequately thinking and maybe just well with income, even quality length a lot then that then maybe the idea that there is a mental trigger,

690
01:28:34,934 --> 01:28:41,444
the actual person, they're more susceptible to all that too. And then under these trigger, these is not collective OCD.

691
01:28:41,444 --> 01:28:47,353
Exactly. We don't know. Maybe for all the disorder, for example,

692
01:28:47,354 --> 01:28:53,384
the insomnia underneath the hypotheses through the insomnia is what's that mechanism

693
01:28:53,384 --> 01:28:58,004
in the past to be alert think it will reduce in type for example these way to.

694
01:29:00,504 --> 01:29:08,414
I look at all. To do some kind of therapy or intervention through the society that they're really using, Sophia.

695
01:29:11,404 --> 01:29:13,604
Yeah, that's exactly. I think that depends on that.

696
01:29:13,614 --> 01:29:20,794
Also that particular event in person, because that's a disorder at the very closest event in person.

697
01:29:21,354 --> 01:29:28,944
But but at least we have these are these all their approaches or their point of view that ruminates on what you want.

698
01:29:28,944 --> 01:29:32,663
Answers. Visual primate yourself.

699
01:29:32,664 --> 01:29:37,464
Your descendants live longer. Other people don't pose criticism.

700
01:29:37,824 --> 01:29:42,624
But oh, here is this stigma. And you see, the longer that you're lazy.

701
01:29:44,064 --> 01:29:49,104
So, like, it's the same thing. Yep.

702
01:29:50,364 --> 01:29:53,744
All the responsibility. I had to go early because my kids will be.

703
01:29:53,754 --> 01:30:01,044
They're not here. I said, even I don't comes as closely to when I feel like yeah.

704
01:30:01,254 --> 01:30:09,114
So yet there is some way that these at least they they show you that that they as a person but we think it's important to

705
01:30:09,114 --> 01:30:19,013
weaken that they that we are to see more or not doing it that weakens they are we less less I mean we don't have to go to war.

706
01:30:19,014 --> 01:30:23,214
We don't have to go to school. That will be we like at say I we're not worried about it.

707
01:30:23,634 --> 01:30:30,323
But then because I was going to bed, I mean, that's like pretty dark, you know what I mean?

708
01:30:30,324 --> 01:30:40,094
So it's really the natural pattern in person. Three or four years ago.

709
01:30:40,694 --> 01:30:45,564
That was the average time. And so the it's a 5%.

710
01:30:48,854 --> 01:30:53,504
That's really frustrating. So what's the weather like?

711
01:30:53,534 --> 01:30:59,444
Even if you were to wake up that like, okay, you could wake up in nine, but then you're only getting.

712
01:31:02,094 --> 01:31:05,934
And a study showed that even if you get hit or split, it was different.

713
01:31:06,804 --> 01:31:18,564
You can never make up for long hours in the good hours because there's different time of the days for all the regulation that our nose and nose.

714
01:31:18,894 --> 01:31:23,154
But you miss the lows and you just catch up your 10 hours during the day.

715
01:31:23,584 --> 01:31:31,644
That was the study has shown that that does not recover when you miss your travel recover during that weekend.

716
01:31:32,784 --> 01:31:38,484
Yes. The study says those recovery is not correlating to what you missed,

717
01:31:39,354 --> 01:31:45,424
but that's what I'm saying is if you're going to bed every day and how you recover was really not recovered.

718
01:31:45,684 --> 01:31:53,184
How was your recovery? Only partial? Because if you're going to bed at 30, like the only places open on the stars or your eyes.

719
01:31:53,934 --> 01:32:04,784
Yeah. It's like I. Any more comments.

720
01:32:05,144 --> 01:32:10,244
So there are some simple ways to make to this question.

721
01:32:10,774 --> 01:32:17,474
So clinically, the this query suggests that to effectively treat insomnia,

722
01:32:17,744 --> 01:32:23,354
medical professionals should like find ways to reduce factors of anxiety and pressure,

723
01:32:23,354 --> 01:32:31,394
which is actually is the one of one of the solutions I would just talk about and understanding the evolutionary roots of the condition.

724
01:32:31,574 --> 01:32:42,044
They also aid patients who in overcoming insomnia like for circadian rhythm disorders affected individuals can correct their sleep wake

725
01:32:42,344 --> 01:32:51,374
rhythm with the aid of currently available medications to reduce the symptoms of circadian rhythm disorder that go along with it.

726
01:32:51,854 --> 01:32:55,093
The ideal approach, though, might be help people have.

727
01:32:55,094 --> 01:33:01,574
Most people make lifestyle decisions that best suit their initiate circadian rhythms.

728
01:33:03,134 --> 01:33:13,124
And for sleep apnea, patient with a patient may prevent their condition by a good diet, exercise and some medication.

729
01:33:14,894 --> 01:33:18,014
So thank you for a great.

730
01:33:20,984 --> 01:33:32,054
Again, before we let me say, I think next week we have human reproduction, hopefully.

731
01:33:32,774 --> 01:33:36,974
Okay, then give me one second consists of this.
