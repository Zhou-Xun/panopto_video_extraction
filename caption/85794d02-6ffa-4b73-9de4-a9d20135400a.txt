1
00:00:05,463 --> 00:00:08,600
In the last module we learned that
our body deals with a stressor

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,690
through the stress response.

3
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:13,530
Sometimes this stress
response is adaptive, and

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,960
that it helps us deal with the stressor.

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,790
Other times the stress
response is non-adaptive,

6
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:23,020
meaning that we can shut down functions
such as growth and reproduction so

7
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:27,420
that we can focus our body's energy
in dealing with the stressor.

8
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:33,380
When dealing with a stressor our body
works very hard to maintain homeostasis.

9
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,540
Many of our homeostatic mechanisms operate

10
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,350
through systems called
negative feedback mechanisms.

11
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:45,360
Negative feedback mechanisms are ways
in which our body initiates a change in

12
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,320
our physiology that is opposite to what
is happening due to the initial stressor.

13
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:56,420
This initiation of corrective mechanisms
whenever we have a deviation from normal

14
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:00,450
is a critical way in which
homeostasis functions.

15
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:04,210
These responses often involve
input from the nervous system and

16
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:08,010
the endocrine systems through
a package called the hypothalamic

17
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:12,800
pituitary adrenal axis, or the HPA axis.

18
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:19,180
The goal of our homeostatic responses
is to prevent sudden drastic changes.

19
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,500
Think about the thermostat in your home.

20
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,050
We could think of this system
as a homeostatic system.

21
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:28,460
You want to set your thermostat for
a specific temperature.

22
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:32,640
During the winter months, if you're like
me, you like to keep it pretty warm.

23
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,080
That set temperature in your home
will stay constant until perhaps

24
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,540
the temperature outside begins to drop,

25
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,470
which then causes the temperature
in your home to start to drop.

26
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:47,550
That drop in temperature will
stimulate your furnace to kick in

27
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:51,950
just a little bit to raise the temperature
up to where you set it to be.

28
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:56,780
When a temperature is achieved its normal
set point, the furnace will turn back off

29
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:03,020
and allow your body or your house to
maintain that normal temperature.

30
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:07,820
Let's look at the mechanisms that are used
for homeostatic control in our body.

31
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:10,250
First, we start with a stimulus.

32
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:13,920
A stimulus is the factor that has
changed in your environment that causes

33
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,950
a disruption in homeostasis.

34
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:20,520
One stimulus that you might have
experienced is high temperatures.

35
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,100
If you're in an area where
the temperature is quite warm,

36
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:28,850
your body will signal that as a disruption
to your body temperature in homeostasis.

37
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:32,450
The presence of this stimulus
is received by receptors.

38
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:36,830
Receptors are structures or organs that
monitor changes in the environment and

39
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:39,930
sends the information
to the control center.

40
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:43,290
The way in which your body
senses changes in temperature

41
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:46,490
is due to thermoreceptors in the skin.

42
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:50,070
These thermoreceptors are in
the epithelial layer of your skin and

43
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:53,440
can sense temperature changes.

44
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,790
Receptors signal the control center
of changes in your environment.

45
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:02,030
So the thermoreceptors would signal the
control center that you are an environment

46
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:04,330
that is particularly warm.

47
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:08,420
The control center is where our body
is able to analyze information about

48
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:13,340
a response to a stressor and
coordinate an appropriate response.

49
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:16,960
For many of the homeostatic
mechanisms in the human body,

50
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,880
our brain works as the control center.

51
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:25,960
Once the control center processes this
information it signals an effector organ

52
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,900
or an effector structure
to carry out the response.

53
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:35,030
An effector is where the prescribed
response is carried out to counteract

54
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:38,990
the impact on the body
experienced by the stressor.

55
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:43,330
So in our example of high temperatures
that are sensed by the thermal receptors

56
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:48,420
in your skin, the brain might trigger
sweat glands in your body as an effector.

57
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:51,510
The sweat glands will begin to sweat, and

58
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:57,330
that sweating process will cool your body
to get it back to homeostatic levels.

59
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:01,730
Your body constantly evaluates
the receptors to determine whether or

60
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:07,630
not additional action needs to be taken
to undergo getting back to homeostasis.

61
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:12,730
So if the system is back in balance,
the response by the effector will subside.

62
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:16,640
If the system i still imbalanced
the effector will persist.

63
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:21,110
So you can imagine and think about what
might happen if the imbalance is now

64
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:23,860
contrary to that original stimuli.

65
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:29,890
Remember that negative feedback systems
work to counteract the original stimuli.

66
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:34,200
So if the stimuli is still present, if
the temperature is still sensed to be very

67
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:40,940
warm, your body will respond in a way to
counteract that increase in temperature.

68
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:45,753
However, if the temperature now becomes
quite low, your body will then counteract

69
00:04:45,753 --> 00:04:51,416
in a different way to be able
to handle that low temperature.

70
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:55,791
So when we look at this figure, we can
think about what happens if the imbalance

71
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:58,890
is now contrary to the original stimuli.

72
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:02,460
Our body might undertake
additional actions

73
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:07,230
through this stress response in
a way to get us back to baseline.

74
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:11,770
Homeostatic control mechanisms in our
body are not only highly specific and

75
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:15,980
complex but also incredibly efficient.

76
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:20,610
One way that our body increases efficiency
is by responding to stressful stimuli,

77
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:25,590
through the utilization of something
called multiple effectors.

78
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:29,780
Multiple effectors are when the control
center is able to direct multiple

79
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:34,700
structures or organs to carry out
actions to restore the balance.

80
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:39,000
So there could be a coordinated
effort of negative feedback.

81
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,360
This use of multiple effectors not only
arise the system to restore balance more

82
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:49,980
quickly, but also safeguards against the
possibility that one effector might fail.

83
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:54,060
So looking at this slide, let's examine
the way in which our body uses multiple

84
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,950
effectors to maintain homeostasis.

85
00:05:56,950 --> 00:06:01,110
Consider this situation of an individual
who has low blood pressure.

86
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:05,240
This stimulus of low blood pressure
is identified by various specialized

87
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,460
receptors in the aorta
called baroreceptors.

88
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:13,950
Baroreceptors have an amazing ability
to sense changes in pressure within

89
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,520
the vessel walls.

90
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,740
These receptors then send a message to
the brain that blood pressure is low.

91
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:24,210
The brain then takes this information
from the baroreceptors and

92
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:29,370
directs multiple effectors to work
in a way to increase blood pressure.

93
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:34,600
For example, the brain can tell smooth
muscles in the vessels to contract,

94
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,760
causing vasoconstriction and
an increase in blood pressure.

95
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:43,400
Another way is that the brain might
direct the cardiac muscle in the heart to

96
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:47,920
increase its contractility, thereby
pushing blood through the aorta with

97
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,960
greater force and
thereby increasing blood pressure.

98
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,870
The brain might also direct the pacemaker
of the heart to increase cardiac

99
00:06:55,870 --> 00:07:01,630
conduction thereby increasing the heart
rate and increasing blood pressure.

100
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:04,910
In our review of the homeostatic
control mechanisms,

101
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:10,240
we learned that the control center in the
homeostasis process is often the brain.

102
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,740
The role of the brain in this
stress response is incredible.

103
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:19,500
It not only is able to analyze data from
receptors to identity a stressor as such,

104
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,820
but it's able to synthesize that
information and use hormone signalling to

105
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:29,400
trigger the autonomic nervous system
to communicate with effectors.

106
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:34,850
The amygdala, this small structure located
deep within the brain is where the stimuli

107
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:40,320
is identified as a stressor based
upon information from the receptors.

108
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,210
The hypothalamus,
another part of the brain,

109
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:47,360
plays a crucial role then in many
important body functions through

110
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,370
its ability to release hormones which can
act upon the autonomic nervous system.

111
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:57,970
The hypothalamus secretes catecholamines
such as epinephrine and norepinephrine,

112
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:01,715
which can do things like increase
heart rate, increase blood pressure,

113
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:06,980
increase respiratory rate,
dilate your pupils, and induce sweating.

114
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:11,450
All of these symptoms are things
called the fight-or-flight response.

115
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:15,800
This is something that our body undergoes
in response to an acute stressor.

116
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:22,369
In doing so, it activates the HPA axis.

117
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:26,512
As we live and interact within our
environment, we are undoubtedly going to

118
00:08:26,512 --> 00:08:30,960
experience stressors that threaten
the homeostasis of our system.

119
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,890
Thankfully, your body has many control
mechanisms in place to counteract

120
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:41,360
these disruptions so that we can
maintain our health and function.

121
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,680
Disease begins when our body is no
longer able to maintain homeostasis.

122
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,860
So understanding what
stimuli can make us sick and

123
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:54,470
how those stimuli cause failure of
our mechanisms as we help develop

124
00:08:54,470 --> 00:09:00,180
strategies to compensate for the control
of the mechanisms is critically important.

125
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:03,380
For example,
if a particular receptor fails,

126
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:07,750
we may use regular testing to
monitor these levels in one's body.

127
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,240
Or if an effector organ fails we may

128
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,270
take a medication that will help
mimic that response of the effector.

129
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:21,027
Knowing about how our body works helps us
understand how to fix it when it fails.
