1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:06,630
Oh, it's so funny. You should, like, make a t shirt and run your hair.

2
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:21,480
It's like, I was, like, migrant workers to be like, okay, are you happy?

3
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:30,660
Oh, yes. You're supposed to be mourning everyone.

4
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:37,280
Even today. I'm here today, at least.

5
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:49,980
So today we are going to wrap up our discussion about interventions.

6
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,300
And today we're going to talk more specifically, not more.

7
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:58,770
We're going to talk specifically about culturally centered.

8
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,410
And we're going to talk about in the context of traditional foods.

9
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:08,160
It's going to take us a bit to get to traditional foods because I feel like we need to kind of read these concepts.

10
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:15,380
But all of this just sort of circling back to our discussion of nutrition interventions and so forth.

11
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:28,100
So before we begin, it's just a reminder that next Monday and Wednesday are students oral presentations.

12
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:36,180
If you have not signed up, please do so. Signup sheet is on canvas and do the assignments for oral presentation.

13
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:46,889
And I just want to highlight that those of you presenting on Monday need to spend not only upload

14
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:51,870
your slides to canvas because you're uploading your assignment and the oral presentation,

15
00:01:52,200 --> 00:02:01,130
you also need to send the slides to me and you need to do it before 730 Monday morning because there is a class in here before us.

16
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:09,720
So I need to come down and what I do is I upload all of your presentations on the desktop so that we don't have,

17
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,350
you know, flash drives having to be taken out, put back in.

18
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:22,140
And so it actually makes things go very quickly. But I need to get your slides by the morning that you're presenting.

19
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:30,030
So if you're presenting Monday morning, you need to send them to me no later than 730 so that I can come down here and upload them.

20
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,560
If for some reason you forget, then just make sure you have it on a flash drive.

21
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:44,550
Or you can do. I mean, you can access it through Google Doc or Google Slides, but it takes a little bit, so we just need to make this expedient.

22
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:53,040
Likewise, those of you presenting on Wednesday 12 seven, same thing, you're going to upload your slides to canvas,

23
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,930
but you also need to send them to me so that again by 730 Wednesday morning

24
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:02,430
I can get them all uploaded to the desktop so that when class comes around,

25
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:09,240
you guys have all your presentations right there. For those of you presenting on Thanksgiving, does that make sense to everyone?

26
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:21,480
Everyone's advocacy? One pager is due on Monday, and I know some of you are presenting on the seventh.

27
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:33,750
It's not fair for you to get a couple extra days. So everybody has to submit their advocacy one pager by and also I don't it's not in the instructions

28
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:40,530
for your oral presentation but if you have room and you want to add an additional slide,

29
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:44,280
a screenshot of your one pager is always nice.

30
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,660
Students like to see what their fellow classmates have done for a one pager,

31
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:53,520
so if you want to include it in your slide, that that'd be great students.

32
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:57,329
And often we'll do it at the end. You don't have to worry about it.

33
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:01,560
But if you happen, always nice to see what everybody has developed.

34
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:08,760
I think that's it. That's all I have for oral presentations.

35
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:20,490
There are many, many questions. Okay,

36
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:29,550
so today we're going to we're going to go start back at the basics again and just kind of review culture and some terms that you're going to see,

37
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:39,809
especially those of you in dietetics, but just in public health in general, some of the terms up here you'll see and papers and so forth.

38
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:43,680
So I just want to go through those and we're going to talk about them in the context

39
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:51,000
of interventions and in particular a specific approach that involves the community.

40
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:59,700
And this approach is a model that fosters a more culturally centered.

41
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:11,730
EPA's intervention. Okay, so we'll go over that idea and then we'll talk just about traditional foods in the Traditional Foods Project.

42
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:22,920
So I didn't go over the components of an intervention when we talked about it feels like several weeks ago.

43
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:29,130
But just in general interventions, you know, there's types we have randomized controlled trials we have.

44
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,920
Quasi experiment, your mental. And so forth.

45
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:47,020
And one of the other intervention study types is this community based, participatory approach, which we're going to just touch upon today.

46
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:54,730
So that's another type of intervention. And then other components of the intervention design intervention targets.

47
00:05:55,420 --> 00:06:03,310
Does the intervention specifically target behavior? Is it target environmental or structural components in the community?

48
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:14,260
Oftentimes, they may have multiple targets. And then there's outcome measures, which is another key component of an intervention.

49
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:24,040
The other two components here that I've just highlighted in National Academy in one of their workshop reports, really stressed.

50
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:31,180
And I think today it's just understood that if we're going to spend the money on an intervention,

51
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:35,440
it needs to have a built in sustainability component.

52
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:40,330
And also, it needs to be culturally sensitive for center.

53
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:45,340
So this is just coming from the Academy report.

54
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:51,040
Just emphasizing that, yes, we have these other sort of broad components of an intervention,

55
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:57,730
but sustainability, culturally relevant, centered, is also a key.

56
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:13,499
So just to get our brains engaged, defining culture, I think, is really challenging.

57
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:21,750
So instead when when you hear the word culture, what words come to mind and just go ahead and share, going to raise your hand.

58
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:25,420
So I say the word, What is culture? What comes to mind?

59
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,520
Beliefs and customs. Policing. Customs. Food.

60
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,570
Food Tradition. Tradition.

61
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:39,050
Way of life. Way of life. Yeah. Intersection of religion.

62
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:42,180
Yeah. Yeah. Language.

63
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:51,290
Language. I would say it's passed down through generations.

64
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:56,420
The beliefs, traditions. Yes, it's it's learned.

65
00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:03,350
It's an important component. It's very individualized to each community.

66
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:08,390
Mm hmm. Yeah. Anything else?

67
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:17,570
You guys really pretty much hit all the key aspects of culture.

68
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:27,600
So these are some different definitions that came from various sources that are on the bottom here.

69
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:37,230
Very simply, at the top, culture is a socially transmitted knowledge of behavior shared by some group of people or a group of people.

70
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:46,500
And then we get into some more complex or maybe more detailed definitions, complex,

71
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:52,260
whole that includes knowledge, belief, art, law, morals, customs and other capacities.

72
00:08:54,150 --> 00:09:04,440
And this one down here, this is a definition that was from an earlier sort of a paper that looked at all the different

73
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:11,280
sort of definitions of culture and looked at what themes came out of all of those definitions.

74
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:17,160
What merged and what they found is that what merges culture is learned.

75
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:22,140
It is associated with groups of people, and its content includes a wide range of phenomena,

76
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:28,950
including norms, values, shared meanings and pattern and ways of behaving.

77
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:34,950
So of all the various of all the different cultural definitions.

78
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:42,410
This is sort of the common theme that kind of trickles out. And I think, you know, all of you sort of highlighted.

79
00:09:47,160 --> 00:10:00,120
So I want to just touch upon some terms that we see in articles, and I think it's important to think about them.

80
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:09,309
As practitioners too, just it's easy to read them and just kind of say, Oh,

81
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:13,870
I know what they mean without really thinking about them a little bit more deeply.

82
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:23,590
So cultural sensitivity actually was defined by Ken Resnick, who's a researcher here at the University of Michigan.

83
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:31,510
And I really liked his definition. I just felt that it encompassed a lot of what we defined in the previous slide.

84
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:37,180
So it's the extent to which ethnic, cultural characteristics, experiences, norms, values,

85
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:47,559
behavioral patterns and so forth are incorporated into the design, delivery and evaluation of targeted health promotion materials and programs.

86
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,650
So we can think about it in the context of any intervention.

87
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:58,030
And so this is thinking about cultural sensitivity in the context of an intervention program.

88
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:06,520
So it's not just thinking about culture in the context of the materials, is it in the language of the community?

89
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:11,170
Does it have imagery that would be consistent with the community?

90
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:21,610
It goes beyond that. It gets to their beliefs, values, norms, and it's included.

91
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:30,640
It's taken into account in every aspect of intervention, the design, implementation, evaluation and so forth.

92
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:39,460
So I would say this is fairly synonymous with culturally centered interventions,

93
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:51,910
and this is a diagram that highlights culturally sensitive interventions and it talks about it, it presents it in two different levels.

94
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,440
So here on the far left, we have surface structure intervention components.

95
00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:06,100
So again, this taking into account cultural sensitivity are culturally sensitive, culturally centered here.

96
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:16,120
It's you know, we talk about surface level, we're talking about messaging, education, materials, you know,

97
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:24,940
how messages are delivered, how materials are delivered, very surface level aspects of the intervention.

98
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:37,100
So again, education materials, is it in the language? Does it have imagery that's consistent with the community and culture?

99
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:41,510
On the far right is deep structure.

100
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:51,740
This is where the intervention takes into account attitudes, perceptions, beliefs, norms, values.

101
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:59,690
If there's stressors faced by the community, if there's a history of trauma.

102
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:05,060
And so it's important to recognize that this isn't sufficient.

103
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:13,190
And if you look historically at how culture was incorporated in interventions, oftentimes this is very surface level.

104
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:18,740
This is what interventions need to strive for is this deep level.

105
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:36,199
Okay. And then to our terms, this is in terms of these are definitions that I feel that really are specific to practitioners,

106
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:41,000
whether you're a dietitian or a health public health professional and so forth.

107
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:48,530
So cultural competence is the capacity of individuals to exercise cultural sensitivity.

108
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:54,200
It refers to practitioners where in how they practice.

109
00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:01,969
So can you want to say that they're culturally competent in terms of do they

110
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:09,470
understand the traditional foods of their client or if they're working with a group,

111
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:14,330
that might be how one defines competence.

112
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:18,559
In contrast, cultural humility,

113
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:28,100
which I personally feel is it resonates with me more so because it refers to the

114
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:37,669
ability to appreciate patients or clients expertise in their own cultural context,

115
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:43,250
social context, openness to power balance.

116
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:56,840
If you're the dietician, you're not the know all of the appropriate foods that this person should be consuming to reduce their risk of diabetes,

117
00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:10,040
that it's a bi directional relationship of you as the practitioner learning about your clients their needs.

118
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:20,350
Their values, the norms and so forth.

119
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:33,790
And this one is the other aspect to this is cultural humility means admitting that one does not know all and is willing to learn from their client.

120
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:38,800
Okay, another definition.

121
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:42,750
That paper that I put on, it's one of your readings.

122
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:48,270
I really like it. It's in the context of medical practice.

123
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:55,530
Practice. It was written for the medical field, but it's it's translated.

124
00:15:55,540 --> 00:16:05,020
It's translatable to any other profession. And the point they make is that confidence sort of insinuates a mastery.

125
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:13,330
So maybe you understand the foods that may be consumed by a client or patient.

126
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:19,630
But is that enough? I would say no. Right.

127
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:27,430
And I think cultural humility is something that we all need to embrace and recognize when

128
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:40,040
we're working with patients and clients on optional readings is a article in a magazine.

129
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:47,760
It's an article in today's dietitian. And even though it's for dietitians, it's relevant for all public health professionals.

130
00:16:47,770 --> 00:17:00,070
I encourage you to read it because it really provides examples from practicing dietitians of how cultural humility is is applied in practice.

131
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:07,510
So again, even though it's from a dietitian standpoint, it's applicable to all public health professionals.

132
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:16,270
So I encourage you to take a look at it. It's one of the first optional readings in today's class.

133
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:26,490
Okay. Does anybody have anything more they want to add or anything they want to comment about between cultural competence and cultural humility?

134
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:37,860
I love that question. But do I remember a few weeks ago you mentioned also like when you're evaluating the effectiveness of intervention programs,

135
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:42,270
that's also part of including cultural competency.

136
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,020
Is asking the community like, does this work?

137
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:50,909
Because it could seem like it worked on your end, but did it actually make a difference?

138
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:54,690
Did it actually make a difference? And that's exactly that's a really key point.

139
00:17:55,350 --> 00:18:04,229
Sometimes we think of culturally centered interventions in terms of maybe the design and maybe the implementation,

140
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:11,580
but we forget that the evaluation is just as critical for those very reasons and that the

141
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:17,220
at the end of the class or the presentation where we get into the traditional food project.

142
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:25,600
To me, that's a great example of how an intervention can be assessed, not by traditional means, right?

143
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:32,370
We're not looking at Oh, okay, they grew some of their traditional foods.

144
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:37,349
Are we going to then look at pre versus post dietary intake and see if we see an

145
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:41,490
improvement in the number of healthy foods that are incorporated into their diet?

146
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:51,809
That could be considered a very classic evaluation where instead it might be the community is interested in was there

147
00:18:51,810 --> 00:19:02,010
an increase in connectedness or cultural identity or tribal identity that that may be a more important outcome.

148
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:22,300
So, yes, that's a really important point. So I want to give you an example of why it is so important for communities to be involved in interventions.

149
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:33,580
So this is an example of I can't remember if this is a collection or if this is a specific Native American tribe named American Group.

150
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:38,150
But I love the example. It's physical activities, not food related.

151
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:42,580
But nonetheless, it highlights important concepts here.

152
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,700
So this is interventions that promote physical activity.

153
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:54,310
So Native Americans have very high rates of type two diabetes.

154
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:03,970
And so interventions that can promote physical activity have been implemented.

155
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:12,280
And this is a nice example of why the community has to be involved, has to be centered.

156
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:17,680
The development and implementation evaluation.

157
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:27,700
So in this particular community, it was recognition that friendly competition is important.

158
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:40,120
And there's a long history of competition just from a history of competing with other indigenous communities and so forth.

159
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:55,450
And the physical activity is health promoting, right? So drawing upon historical precedents of physical activity was one strategy, this intervention.

160
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,580
The other is collective efficacy.

161
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:15,160
So in this community, improvement individually is less important than collective efficacy.

162
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,060
So if.

163
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:29,480
It's been a while since I've read the paper, but what I do remember is that individuals were waiting to see if there was improvement in weight loss.

164
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:39,990
But it wasn't the individual weight loss that was recorded or highlighted.

165
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:49,770
It was the team's weight loss. So everybody was in a team and they would have been weighed.

166
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:58,830
But the key outcome was the team weight, not the individual weight of each person in that team.

167
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:08,250
So collective efficacy is very important and defining progress as a group.

168
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:21,060
And so these types of approaches promote and strengthen community solidarity, unity and cohesiveness and connectedness.

169
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:27,120
And that's very important value and norm for this community.

170
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:37,230
It was to the point that having a truck, for example, was a status symbol.

171
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:47,240
So there was a quote that, you know what, walking no truck, you know, no work, no vehicle at one time,

172
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:53,909
not having a vehicle would have been considered but maybe flipped that having a vehicle,

173
00:22:53,910 --> 00:23:00,209
especially a truck was was associated with status here and the norm was shifting.

174
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:04,110
That walking is now associated with status.

175
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:10,500
And that's what you hope to see over time is some shift, but it has to come from within the community.

176
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:22,560
Right. So viewing the community as a collection of individuals, which is what the common interventions are.

177
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:34,220
Right. You do the classic pre and post measurement of BMI, weight, triceps, skin, fold, measurements, blood,

178
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:42,450
and we get a mean and then we look at the pre and post, whereas here it's social, here it's group.

179
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:48,230
So social cohesion and collective efficacy focus on the whole rather than the individual.

180
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:53,220
And that's a really important cultural value in Indigenous communities.

181
00:23:54,480 --> 00:24:06,480
So what was key here is that the the community was involved in developing those interventions because somebody from the outside would not know,

182
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:12,690
would not be aware, not understand the significance of those norms and values.

183
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,240
So I like this example.

184
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:26,790
I think it highlights why communities need to be involved in intervention, development, implementation, television and so forth.

185
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:37,170
Just a side note. So I was just talking about social cohesion and collective efficacy from an indigenous community standpoint.

186
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,339
But I also want to point out that this has been shown in other studies that

187
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:47,460
social cohesion has been associated with achieving physical activity levels.

188
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:56,219
So neighborhood factors are obviously a determinant social determinants of health and neighborhood and social cohesion,

189
00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:02,550
which in this case is an element of social environment, is perceived as connectedness and among neighbors.

190
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:08,249
And there's been studies that show that social cohesion in neighborhoods has

191
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:12,720
been associated with greater odds of achieving physical activity guidelines.

192
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:24,170
So social cohesion is not unique to indigenous communities that we see it in other communities.

193
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:37,009
I just want to take another side note. So we've been talking about intervention, development and so forth.

194
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:43,130
But I also want to just highlight it's not just the intervention phase that the community should be involved.

195
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:45,830
They should also be involved in the assessment phase.

196
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:55,579
And this is an example of a different indigenous community that was involved in the actual community assessment.

197
00:25:55,580 --> 00:26:07,580
They directed it. They were guided by a university researcher in Shona, but they directed the assessment.

198
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:18,620
And the important point here is that outsiders may document all the visible aspects of the community and certainly the assets,

199
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:22,910
resources, things that are visible. But they would miss.

200
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:30,760
Factors such as social cohesion. The significance of elders.

201
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:32,080
And so forth.

202
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:42,430
So again, this is a nice example of why it's so important for communities to be involved in both the assessment as well as the intervention.

203
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:50,970
Anybody been involved in an intervention that was culturally centered?

204
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,760
I wasn't involved in an intervention,

205
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:06,470
but I did do alternative string theory working with the farmworker community in the neighboring community where I went.

206
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:15,670
So I got a little sense of like, let's listen to what you have to say about the issues that are going on in this community.

207
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:32,140
So my intervention. And the last bullet point is just highlighting that oftentimes you have to take a qualitative approach.

208
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:41,379
A lot of work is very quantitative, right? Think of many outcome measures and stuff.

209
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:44,560
Their quantitative but qualitative approach is what I'm talking about.

210
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:48,610
Qualitative again, what am I talking about? What approaches might be involved?

211
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:58,240
This is going to occur. Even this can occur even if it's not a community assessment.

212
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:03,850
There may be a formative assessment before an intervention is designed.

213
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:11,840
So what kind of qualitative methods might be used or approaches might be used to find out?

214
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:18,260
Is this even a concern of the community? Does the community have the capacity for these groups?

215
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:23,180
Focus groups is one, although. But surfing surveys.

216
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:28,210
Just like listening to stories. Yeah. Yeah.

217
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:35,020
So it's really critical that, you know, we we often think of the quantitative approaches,

218
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:46,690
but we have to remember qualitative is really an essential component to get out those sort of deeper level factors.

219
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:47,830
Okay.

220
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:56,890
So there's community involvement in intervention development, improve outcomes without even looking at the slide, what would be your gut reaction?

221
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:01,180
Yes or no? Yes. Yes.

222
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:06,670
Yeah. So community involvement does improve outcomes.

223
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:15,519
So this was a systematic review of 49 diet related intervention studies of indigenous populations

224
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:24,069
in the U.S. And ultimately what they found was that interventions were generally successful,

225
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:31,750
resulting in changes in knowledge, behavior of help and over 50% studies reported significant changes in outcomes,

226
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:37,960
using three or more approaches that involve the community in the development of the intervention.

227
00:29:50,420 --> 00:30:00,220
Okay. So the type of intervention that I just want to introduce is community based, participatory research, CPR.

228
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:06,260
Have you guys learned about this in any of your public health courses at.

229
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:14,750
So community base. I would have to look.

230
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:18,660
Participatory research is.

231
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:26,930
We have a researcher here in Barbara Israel.

232
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:35,059
And I can't remember if she's still. She's still on the faculty or if she's retired.

233
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:42,120
But she was a leading researcher in CB,

234
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:50,180
PR and I they used to teach a course in community based participatory research that some of our students used to take,

235
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:56,900
especially those who really were interested in working on programs at the community level.

236
00:30:57,830 --> 00:31:03,950
So for those of you that might that are interested, it would be worth to look to see if they still offer a course.

237
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:09,200
I would be shocked if they didn't. Even if Barbara Israel isn't teaching it, somebody else is likely.

238
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:18,950
But the the important concepts here are that it's equitable partnering of both the community and the researchers.

239
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:26,990
Right. It's not that the university having the power to then determine what the intervention looks like.

240
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:30,020
It's again this bi directional dialog.

241
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:42,860
So shared power, shared resources and collective decision making, discussing community concerns, develop solutions and utilizing local assets.

242
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:52,220
And the approach is associated with improved health outcomes, reduced health inequities and community empowerment, improved community empowerment.

243
00:31:56,330 --> 00:32:03,890
So this approach is one that is associated with, as I said, reducing the inequities.

244
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:12,860
So you'll see references to CB, BPR, and I'm seeing more and more of it in the literature.

245
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:19,880
This is a very busy model of community based participatory research,

246
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:27,290
but I wanted to include it this I'm going to put this on your campus page for today down on the optional.

247
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:34,680
For those of you interested, it has a really nice explanation under each of these sort of domains.

248
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:48,290
Everything from the context of the partnership and just understanding the context of the community at the time of partnership processes,

249
00:32:49,550 --> 00:33:01,400
intervention and research and then the outcomes. So this is a group out of the University of New Mexico that partnered with a Native American

250
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:10,550
center to actually develop this model so that it could be used by other communities.

251
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:21,740
And again, I'll post it because it's too involved for me to get into all the different domains, but it very nicely has a box under each,

252
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:33,920
and it just explains all the different aspects of each of those domains and how it can be utilized as a framework for an intervention.

253
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:45,440
Okay. So that's the background that I wanted to go through to then talk about that Traditional Foods project.

254
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:52,460
So you had a reading that actually reviewed this. It's no longer.

255
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:01,690
Being implemented. But there's a lot of great information coming out of it.

256
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:08,180
And so I see aspects of it still continuing and there's publications coming out and so forth.

257
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:11,330
So I think it's an important project to go over.

258
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:16,310
So the Traditional Foods Project was from 2008 to 2014.

259
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:29,480
It used a community based participatory research approach, and the whole point of it was to support traditional,

260
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:39,020
sustainable and ecological approaches to reducing type two diabetes risk in indigenous communities.

261
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:44,920
So this map shows all the different communities that were involved.

262
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:49,999
They started with 11 and they got up to, I think it was 11, and then they increased to 17.

263
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,950
Different communities became involved.

264
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:08,499
But before we talk about some of the outcomes, I just want to just touch upon what we mean by traditional foods.

265
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:11,530
And really what we're talking about is traditional food systems.

266
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:17,560
So it's not just the foods. It's the cultivation of foods.

267
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:28,840
We're talking plant based. It's the acquisition or the cultivation, the harvesting.

268
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:38,560
The preservation and preservation is not just preserving food, but then preserving seeds to be used the following year.

269
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:47,740
But this can also apply to those communities that may hunt or fish.

270
00:35:48,740 --> 00:36:09,400
Right. These are beans that are that were grown in the Cherokee grow the year old beans and beans.

271
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:21,040
I don't look it up because I know it was kind of cool to see that they're a type of black bean that was grown by Cherokee community.

272
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:28,930
Okay, so we just pull out.

273
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:51,040
So the purchase objectives of this project were to support sustainable ecological approaches that can be evaluated,

274
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:55,479
to reclaim traditional foods, to encourage local practices,

275
00:36:55,480 --> 00:37:02,860
to increase access to traditional foods, to revive and create stories of healthy, traditional ways,

276
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:08,650
and to integrate the culture and history to promote health and prevent type two diabetes.

277
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:19,370
So for those of you that have opportunity to read the article, what sort of programs were developed through this project?

278
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:30,310
Anybody remember? So there were 17 different communities that were involved that developed various interventions.

279
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:39,850
Again, using this PR approach, in this case, it wasn't specifically a researcher,

280
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:47,230
it was partnering with the CDC of a little bit might have been local partners.

281
00:37:50,940 --> 00:38:00,040
I can remember I wrote this on Monday, but as then they bring a lot more of those like community grown foods the previous

282
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:06,100
indigenous food stems from so that they get them the food secured insecurity,

283
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:13,510
the population total. So they weren't solely relying on like grocery stores and that kind of stuff they don't have as much access to.

284
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:19,030
Yes, they were. They were boosting their own food supply with traditional.

285
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:23,200
Yeah. Is that what you were? Yes. Sorry. Yeah, yeah.

286
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:32,150
Yes. Any other projects that any one of his members.

287
00:38:51,080 --> 00:39:04,730
So for some of the communities, it was finding ways to develop sustainable dryland agriculture and is a great example of

288
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:11,720
perhaps from in history they may not have had the sort of present day composting methods,

289
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:17,300
but the example they used is that they were using historical approaches to planning.

290
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:23,329
Coupling it with present day composting approaches because they found that

291
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:31,100
the corn that they grew was actually not at a height that elders remembered.

292
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,590
And so members then learned.

293
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:38,210
I think this in this example, one of them became a master gardener,

294
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:44,450
learned about composting approaches, and in fact, improved the actual growth of corn.

295
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:52,909
And that got high. And I guess the elders were very, you know, thrilled about what the composting did.

296
00:39:52,910 --> 00:40:00,170
So that's a great example of mixing traditional agricultural approaches with present day strategies.

297
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:07,670
So learning to be able to grow produce with dry land systems.

298
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:17,900
It was for one community. They installed greenhouse gardens to extend the growing season and so forth.

299
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:31,610
Others were promoting and revitalizing the gathering of indigenous foods like berries and nuts and other foods that it's sort

300
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:43,460
of basically reclaiming and revitalizing those that knowledge and applying it to preserving Native American heirloom seeds.

301
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:47,330
So there's a number of initiatives that have come out from that where they're

302
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:50,870
preserving and there's other organizations that have been working on this.

303
00:40:51,110 --> 00:41:00,320
Native Seed Search is one organization is working on these seeds, establishing seed banks, school curriculum,

304
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:05,750
traditional foods, native language and help, as well as traditional games of physical activity.

305
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:15,470
Some of a couple other aspects reconnecting community members to actual ancestral gathering lands.

306
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:24,920
So they were to at least to communities that were involved in actually changing the policy of access to their ancestral lands,

307
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:31,250
one, in terms of preserving fishing rights and the other to be able to gather on that land.

308
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:41,090
So, you know, a very broad spectrum of intervention programs that came out of this project.

309
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:58,550
Why the interest in traditional foods? There's healthy foods in the U.S. food supply.

310
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:07,850
Why, why? Why all this effort to reclaim, revitalize traditional foods, foodways,

311
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:15,260
food systems and most marginalized communities happen to be immigrant communities.

312
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:23,340
So. Saarinen's Alley may have the best opportunity cut out of it.

313
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:33,310
Oftentimes, they want to suffer malnutrition because they'd rather not eat something that's not common to them.

314
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:37,590
Yeah, yeah, yeah. What else?

315
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:52,920
I know that in something that I learned about Indigenous communities, the diabetes rate said it was when the food commodity was processed,

316
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:59,240
food was introduced to that community that changed the way they eat and that affected their diabetes risk.

317
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:06,160
So introducing foods that weren't a part of their culture because in these communities as well.

318
00:43:06,610 --> 00:43:15,670
Yeah, yeah. That's an important point that the histories that can pass down the level of the chronic diseases so low

319
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:27,130
when they were engaged in and you know traditional foodways or food systems and that the foods that.

320
00:43:31,510 --> 00:43:40,749
In some cases, they were they were told they couldn't leave their communities to hunt and gather or to engage in the

321
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:46,630
agriculture practices that they would have because they had to rely on these commodities that were delivered.

322
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:51,010
And so then we see this increase in chronic disease over time.

323
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:53,760
What else you say?

324
00:43:53,800 --> 00:44:02,860
Kind of similarly, having those things taken away like food is a big part of storytelling and that everyone getting together and sharing traditions.

325
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:08,920
So it's kind of reclaiming their tradition and reclaiming things that were historically too.

326
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:14,950
Yeah. And so there's actually been several or not just several,

327
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:23,079
a number of studies that have shown that it's not just the traditional foods themselves being more often,

328
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:26,800
not healthier options where you see improved health outcomes,

329
00:44:27,130 --> 00:44:38,530
but the consumption of traditional foods also increases their sense of cultural identity or community or ethnic identity.

330
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:51,160
And that in itself has been associated with reported increases in well-being and feeling healthier, which I think is huge.

331
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:54,520
I mean, that's so empowering. Yes.

332
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:59,830
I think to kind of go off that point, it also helps with education as well.

333
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:09,129
I know like I came from a very rural community and so me just being the way I am informed about what I ate,

334
00:45:09,130 --> 00:45:12,160
what I brought to lunch, you know, I wasn't ashamed about what I was eating.

335
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:18,580
So just saying, oh, this is like a cultural dish. It kind of educated everybody around me and then normalized the food that I ate as well.

336
00:45:18,610 --> 00:45:22,570
Yes. And that's a key point is normalizing, right.

337
00:45:22,810 --> 00:45:30,640
So for many of these communities, it's reclaiming revitalizing these food systems and then normalizing it again.

338
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:40,239
And that's an important point. Yeah, I think also food ritual is tied into education lot, the ritual and religion and so on.

339
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:45,400
You can access those foods. You're also separating people from their faith, which can be incredibly stressful.

340
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:54,580
Yeah. So one of the important points that I want to stress here is that the traditional

341
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:59,110
foods that we're talking about today are with indigenous populations.

342
00:45:59,350 --> 00:46:10,450
But it's really important to understand that this is not just about indigenous people, that traditional foods are found in many cultures, right?

343
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:20,560
Well, I would argue that that synonymous in cultures, they have cultural based foods and like lead more traditional.

344
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:30,810
And the health benefits are seen also in other populations.

345
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:41,010
So, for example, of this issue, this point of increased consumption of traditional foods has been reported to be

346
00:46:41,010 --> 00:46:47,639
associated with an increased report of cultural identity or ethnic identity,

347
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:50,970
and that's also been observed in not just Indigenous.

348
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:54,360
One study found among African-American adults,

349
00:46:54,960 --> 00:47:08,970
consumption of traditional foods was but resulted in increased ethnic identity and improved physical activity levels and healthy diet scores.

350
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:21,190
So I think traditional foods, it's not just the health benefit of the actual nutrient composition of the foods.

351
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:24,940
There's a lot more to it than just the food itself.

352
00:47:25,690 --> 00:47:31,870
And that's, I guess, what I'm trying to stress. And it's translatable to many different cultures.

353
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:34,390
Yeah, I think that's also something interesting to say.

354
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:43,990
Like in the United States, like prided itself on being such a cultural mixing pot for so many years that it kind of led to just white assimilation.

355
00:47:45,010 --> 00:47:48,399
My roommate is in like the library studies program here.

356
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:57,040
And so we're she was at a seminar a couple weeks ago talking about how like for collecting things like

357
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:03,129
museum curation and how seeds were so important and like incorporating that back into the communities.

358
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:12,070
And she was able to see it from like my perspective too, of like adding these lifelong nutritional practices that we stripped away from these people.

359
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:20,200
Like introducing that again, it's like it's okay to have different identities and we're not just all going to be this

360
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:26,020
whole American idea of it's not what we originally thought it was so many years ago.

361
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:29,170
Right. Right. Yeah. Yeah.

362
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:35,770
I still say, like, it also helps to diversify the foods that you're eating because like a lot of cultural

363
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:40,410
foods that are traditional foods incorporate a lot of different ingredients.

364
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:42,550
So when you don't have a lot of those ingredients,

365
00:48:42,970 --> 00:48:51,160
a lot of the nutritional value is taken out of your diet or replacing it with like more processed foods than that.

366
00:48:51,190 --> 00:48:59,700
But even more so, it reduces that. I also feel like there's an equalizer in foods telling them that they shouldn't be eating their cultural,

367
00:49:00,790 --> 00:49:04,659
really traditional foods in a kind of personal relationship with food in general.

368
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:11,160
Because then they start like negatively associating their culture and the like norms we've set.

369
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:20,649
Yeah. Yeah. And I think if you read that article by the today's dietitian, that's one of the key points they make.

370
00:49:20,650 --> 00:49:25,900
And actually, we were talking about this a couple of weeks ago when I asked you about, you know, well, dietary.

371
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:29,200
Oh, I know it was with the Dash diet. Many of you spoke.

372
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:37,510
I wouldn't take any food away. I would add food. And I was like, yes, yes, I know that.

373
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:48,339
And I would say that that has. Yes, the whole point is, is that you don't want to take away the foods.

374
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:56,230
Right. Many of these foods are good. Right. It might be encouraging to add to their diet, but not taking away.

375
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:06,700
Right. Yeah. Yeah. I also recently read a book called Braiding the Sweetgrass, which is super interesting and talks about like Native American,

376
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:15,760
like growing practices and how like certain foods should be grown together because it enhance like the nutrients of all of the foods.

377
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:24,520
And so it's been interesting to see that perspective just sitting in this class to of, I mean, like soil properties and growing long term.

378
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:32,440
It's like we I come from a family who we have a farm, we grow corn and soybeans like every other year to replenish the soil.

379
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:40,809
But it like stripped the land so much because we're not engaging in these older practices, the more traditional practices,

380
00:50:40,810 --> 00:50:46,830
and by incorporating into like all the lands for enhancing like cross-pollination and all that kind of stuff too.

381
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:50,259
And super interesting to see that. Respect it. Yeah. Yeah.

382
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:56,079
And I, I tried to find that article once.

383
00:50:56,080 --> 00:51:01,300
It was on the radio with NPR, but there was a I think it's a USDA.

384
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:16,629
USDA official in Colorado has been communicating with Pueblo leaders, and it carried out before it was the Hopi about their agriculture practices,

385
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:31,630
because more and more states are seeing more and more droughts and the Indigenous folks in the Southwest have learned how to deal with dry,

386
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:33,310
dry land agriculture.

387
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:45,430
And this official from I think it was the USDA in Colorado was just highlighting we have so much we can learn from their agriculture practices.

388
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:55,570
And they just highlighted some of the strategies. Again, I think it was Hopi that they use because they're used to growing in dry conditions.

389
00:51:57,010 --> 00:52:09,040
And so one of the points that highlighted that was highlighted in this traditional food project is revitalizing those traditional ecological methods.

390
00:52:10,930 --> 00:52:23,649
Right, because they had years and years, decades and decades to perfect rowing conditions are growing in suboptimal conditions.

391
00:52:23,650 --> 00:52:30,490
So yeah, I just wanted to I thought that when I heard that on the radio, I said, oh my gosh,

392
00:52:30,490 --> 00:52:41,950
this is I love the fact that they're listening and even talk about how growing like crops together actually reduces the water needed for the plants,

393
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:45,639
which is like such an inverse concept that like you don't grow up with.

394
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:56,830
But yeah, it was super interesting. I highly recommend. Yeah, it was also a salt water natural and indigenous foods are actually protective.

395
00:52:56,830 --> 00:53:05,950
Like there's a population invasion each particular like black rice or most aren't all races that naturally has that and and statin drugs.

396
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:12,399
So they this entire population is very low cholesterol because of what's naturally in their food.

397
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:20,889
So if you stripped that away and they're more likely to end up with diseases that they wouldn't in their population because their food is,

398
00:53:20,890 --> 00:53:23,920
you know, naturally protected. Yeah.

399
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:31,120
There was a paper that looked at traditional foods of indigenous populations around

400
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:37,929
the world and they looked at just did some chemical analysis of these foods.

401
00:53:37,930 --> 00:53:45,580
And many of these foods are really high in phytochemicals and, you know, polyphenols and so forth.

402
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:51,190
So and not only that, but nutrients.

403
00:53:51,430 --> 00:54:01,390
So they were preventative, you know, they prevented disease and so forth just based on their various chemical properties.

404
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:07,120
The last thing is just the food sovereignty.

405
00:54:07,690 --> 00:54:12,040
Sovereignty, right. I was a believer that word.

406
00:54:12,310 --> 00:54:19,780
That was another important aspect to the interventions in this overall project.

407
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:30,249
And this is just a organization that promotes food sovereignty among Native folks.

408
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:35,740
But I just want to highlight that there's a number of agent organizations.

409
00:54:36,490 --> 00:54:42,580
We have efforts for food sovereignty and sovereignty in Detroit.

410
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:54,069
Right. And for those of you that maybe are aren't clear what the term is is here, the definition is that it goes beyond,

411
00:54:54,070 --> 00:54:57,940
well, ensuring that people have enough food to meet their physical needs.

412
00:54:57,940 --> 00:55:03,880
It asserts that people must reclaim their power in the food system by rebuilding the relationship between people,

413
00:55:04,030 --> 00:55:14,590
the land and the food that it provides. And there's another organization that has a nice definition of.

414
00:55:23,610 --> 00:55:28,320
So this is from the U.S. Food Sovereignty Alliance.

415
00:55:28,350 --> 00:55:33,270
Food sovereignty is the right of people to healthy and culturally appropriate food produced through

416
00:55:33,270 --> 00:55:40,080
ecologically sound and sustainable methods and their right to define their own food and agriculture systems.

417
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:48,530
I think that's key, right? They have the right to define what their agriculture practices look like.

418
00:55:48,530 --> 00:55:56,360
It puts the aspirations and needs of those who produce, distribute and consume the food at the heart of food systems and policies,

419
00:55:56,930 --> 00:56:00,950
rather than the demands of the markets and the corporations.

420
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:09,130
So that's another important aspect to this traditional foods project.

421
00:56:10,570 --> 00:56:16,930
Here are some resources for those of you that want to explore further.

422
00:56:18,010 --> 00:56:25,870
But again, the reason for going over this is not just to highlight this traditional food project with indigenous communities,

423
00:56:25,870 --> 00:56:35,290
but again, this translates to many other populations in cultural communities.

424
00:56:37,570 --> 00:56:45,820
It's a lot of concepts that as practitioners we can translate and use practice.

425
00:56:47,530 --> 00:56:59,380
Any thoughts, observations, comments? Yeah, I just wanted to know if anyone is interested in community based participatory research there in Detroit.

426
00:56:59,410 --> 00:57:07,270
There is a group that does focus on that. There's actually like a committee that's built up of community members where they assess different

427
00:57:07,270 --> 00:57:14,020
research studies and then essentially give them like a thumbs up or whatever and kind of review them.

428
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:24,700
And so that is through I believe it's connected to the Urban Research Center, if anyone's interested in opportunity through Detroit.

429
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:28,630
So is that can they find the link through?

430
00:57:28,990 --> 00:57:36,310
If you Google like Detroit community based participatory research, it should be the first thing that comes up.

431
00:57:37,150 --> 00:57:43,000
But you can also look up urban, the Urban Research Center, and they also work on community assessment as well.

432
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:50,300
Now. And their thoughts.

433
00:57:58,260 --> 00:58:05,970
All right. That's all I have. I will hang around for a bit.

434
00:58:06,710 --> 00:58:10,470
She can answer. Anybody has any questions about their.
