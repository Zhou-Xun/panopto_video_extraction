1
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:24,960
Let's go to the bag and you announcements.

2
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:35,190
So I sent in I guess that I camp is that I have my office hours set right now 3 to 4 on Thursdays.

3
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:41,490
If that doesn't work for anybody, let me know with respect to your, of course, schedules and work schedules.

4
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:51,060
Happy to meet in other times I've Tuesday for friends 3 to 4 also works and it's in general Tuesday and Thursday afternoon.

5
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:55,290
Tomorrow unfortunately I have to take my cat to the vet.

6
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,790
That's a long time ago. So Thursday 3 to 4 doesn't work then.

7
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:04,290
So again, if you want to talk tag, we can do that.

8
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,660
You just need an email address.

9
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:15,590
One of the ways that you can hear people back here is this like working notes.

10
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:22,000
Okay, so. That's my office hours.

11
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:27,909
There is some questions about the logistics of the homework and the exam.

12
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:31,390
The exam? The first two exams are in class.

13
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:35,169
They're basically multiple choice. True, false.

14
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:39,220
Some short answers. The third exam will be a take home exam.

15
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:48,679
Homework. Will be releasing the homework you promised me a few weeks before it's due.

16
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:56,659
So next week or the newly released homework one. And then as I went through all your questions,

17
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:05,990
a lot of excellent questions and many of the questions we'll be addressing in lecture, in subsequent lectures.

18
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:14,870
There were also a lot of questions about very interesting questions about the politics

19
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:20,090
and cultural aspects of infectious disease transmission and prevention and control.

20
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:30,380
We'll be touching upon those in class and maybe even more so in the discussion sections and discussions.

21
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:32,300
But again, feel free.

22
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:40,040
I am not going to be able to answer all the questions, but feel free to contact me and office hours and we can discuss a lot of those questions.

23
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:52,489
Again, very good detailed questions. There is one question that that came up backed by a number of people.

24
00:02:52,490 --> 00:03:01,830
So I just wanted to touch upon that, which is. Distinction between infectivity, pathogenicity and virulence.

25
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:09,510
And so I'm going to kind of present what we're going to use in this class.

26
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:16,769
You're going to see a lot of variation in in the literature about how these things are defined.

27
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:20,400
So there's not really a clear and distinct definition.

28
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:24,879
In my mind, infectivity is for me at least the clearest.

29
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:31,660
But again, it gets fuzzy because a lot of times pathogenicity and infectivity are conflated.

30
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:37,840
But infectivity is simply the ability of an infectious agent to establish an infection.

31
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:48,540
So it may be in May, the person may have symptoms, may not have symptoms, may cause ethology, may not cause pathology.

32
00:03:48,930 --> 00:04:03,300
But if the faction is established in that person, then that is considered infectivity are that are the often it's term the probability.

33
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:06,700
Infection given exposure.

34
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:18,799
There's a lot of studies, dosing studies, where they actually dose people with different amounts of a pathogen like norovirus,

35
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,400
cryptosporidium and such, and they measure like a dose response.

36
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:26,600
So it's a probability infection as that dose increases.

37
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,020
And that's the classic kind of definition of infectivity.

38
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:37,310
So pathogenicity is the ability of a pathogen to cause disease.

39
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:47,580
And again, there's many ways to quantify that. But in this class, to make it simple, it'll be the case infection ratio.

40
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:51,090
So the number of cases per 100 infections.

41
00:04:52,340 --> 00:05:01,610
How do we measure that? You know, it becomes very not that easy to identify infections, but there are different ways you can do that.

42
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:10,010
Serology is one way you can actually measure the the level of the number of cases per infection.

43
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:18,830
There's estimates of that for, you know, polio, it's often it's a wide range, some people say, from hundreds to thousands of.

44
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:29,700
Infections. Or that until you get a case and a case for polio is defined as acute flaccid paralysis.

45
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:37,990
So there are. It's not an easy measure to make, but it is doable and people have estimates of that.

46
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:44,960
So then virulence is not just the ability to cause disease, but the severity of that disease.

47
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:48,610
And again, lots of ways to measure that severity.

48
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:58,150
It doesn't have to be mortality, but, you know, case fatality ratio is the way we will define virulence in that case.

49
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:04,810
So. Any questions on the stages of this?

50
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:15,279
Again, the literature will go all over the place and conflate these and talk about

51
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:21,609
pathogenicity as the ability for a pathogen to infect a host for this cause.

52
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:32,170
We want to consider that infectivity in not. So I think hopefully this kind of leads delineates the differences between these concepts.

53
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:43,600
We are recording. So with that moved to the.

54
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:54,860
So today and Monday, we're going to be covering this topic of transmission systems.

55
00:06:54,900 --> 00:07:04,070
I mentioned in the introduction the two ways in which infectious diseases are unique or distinct from, let's say,

56
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:14,480
chronic diseases is the ability of us to be able to ability for pathogens that cause disease to transmit from house to house, person to person.

57
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:21,710
And so transmission is a big part of that, and we're going to cover that in two lectures.

58
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:26,090
The other unique property is is conferred immunity and protection.

59
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:37,880
And so that following two sections we add immunity and vaccination are both natural and artificial ways to induce protection in immunity.

60
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:48,890
So we, we talked about that disease triad and that's an important way to start to think again about.

61
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:57,230
Transmission, disease, causation. And again, the fact that it's real, it's the interaction of.

62
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:08,120
Post agent environment that results in, transmission that results in and can result in disease and is not one or the other.

63
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:16,850
And I think that's where a lot of people get confused in a lot of ways in which which how it's written up in the media.

64
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:27,110
It gets confused because there's often, you know, they think it's all about the variants of the agent or all about the host,

65
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:34,190
but it's actually not just so it's not just how virulent the agent is,

66
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:39,560
but how susceptible is the host, how what kind of co-morbidities does the host have?

67
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:46,489
And it's not just about the immune status of the host and the variance of agent, but also the environment.

68
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:49,790
What kind of dose is being delivered to the person?

69
00:08:51,500 --> 00:09:00,290
Is it a lot of environmental injustice happening with respect to the fact that some neighborhoods may be more exposed in other neighborhoods to.

70
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:07,830
Two. Two stressors are infectious agents or any kind of disease agents.

71
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:15,570
And so the environment plays a huge role in also whether or not transmission occurs,

72
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:19,830
whether or not transmission is sustained, and whether or not what the disease burden has.

73
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:29,550
So we can look at that with an example of malaria and hear malaria.

74
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:36,660
One interesting aspect of malaria is that immune immunity is short, short lived.

75
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:50,140
That's generally true with pathogens that are more complicated organisms like we call them parasitic pathogens, which are a variety of malaria.

76
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:56,640
One of them, as opposed to viruses and bacteria where immunity tends to be lower, longer lasting.

77
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:05,610
So this has huge implications where we've seen a lot where so low levels of transmission in that community can actually be protective.

78
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:11,550
Low levels of transmission keeps that immunity in the population.

79
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:17,460
Often people come in and do an eradication effort and then leave.

80
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:29,850
And the consequence of that often is a more severe outbreak that comes later on, that causes more severe disease than there was before.

81
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:36,929
So it's important to understand for malaria, that immune status is short lived and it's partial.

82
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:43,110
It's not. And therefore, it's been very complicated to develop vaccine for malaria.

83
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:50,130
They've been working at it for decades and decades and still then able to come up with a vaccine that works for malaria.

84
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:59,480
Malaria has four there's four species of malaria that are circulating in some places, multiple species are circulating.

85
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:04,850
Sometimes there's cross immunity with these species.

86
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:09,170
Some of these species that we talk about later, but vivax, for instance,

87
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:17,990
can cause re-occurrence of disease so it can actually stay dormant in your liver for quite a while and then come up years later.

88
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:22,910
Some like falciparum is much more pathogenic can cause cerebral.

89
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:32,150
Much more virulent can cause cause mortality and cerebro technologies.

90
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:42,550
So a mosquito transmits malaria. It happens that this mosquito, anopheles mosquito that transmits malaria.

91
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:48,420
Their nighttime biters very different from dengue, which has eight apparent daytime biters.

92
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:54,180
So bednets work can work well for malaria and not so for dengue.

93
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:07,590
Anopheles also breeds in very distinct places edges of lakes and ponds and areas in swamps and marshes.

94
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:12,959
And therefore, it's very susceptible to activities like deforestation,

95
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:19,050
where you can actually create more breeding sites and therefore bigger abundance of mosquitoes.

96
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:27,930
Due to the deforestation event or changing the landscape of an area in a way that's not true for, again,

97
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:33,540
dengue, which is the household reading mosquito repellent containers using artificial containers.

98
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:43,440
So understanding how understanding the host environment agent for malaria becomes critical and thinking about how best to intervene.

99
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:51,160
Another example is influenza. Where influenza.

100
00:12:53,200 --> 00:13:01,929
Is a viral strain that actually drifts and mutates really very quickly and can adapt to different host systems.

101
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:13,750
So there's many different animal hosts that can can harbor different strains of influenza and the ability for influenza to spillover.

102
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:27,100
And that's the term we use to go from one animal species to another, is its ability to, you know, to mutate and adapt to the other host.

103
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:34,480
And so we have seasonal influenza, which is an influenza strain that's been adapted already to humans.

104
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:39,340
But then we have every year spillover events that occur usually in Asia.

105
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:47,170
And that's how the news new vaccines is developed every year by trying to guess

106
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:54,250
which of those new strains of influenza will actually make it across globally.

107
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:58,910
And sometimes those guesses are good and the efficacy of that vaccine is good.

108
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:15,940
Sometimes they're not so good. So we're going to spend most of this lecture using this chain model of transmission to better understand how

109
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:27,430
the transmission system determines the ability for a pathogen to sustain itself in a given environment.

110
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:30,160
Transmit and cause, again, cause disease.

111
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:47,980
So we've got here sexual host, microbial agent, a reservoir or source where the microbial agent and can reside a portal of exit from a host.

112
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:51,850
Some mode of transmission vector waterborne.

113
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,670
And then a portal of entry back into the central host.

114
00:14:55,670 --> 00:15:00,640
So this does a good job in showing the interrelationship between.

115
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:07,690
Again, it's a it's a little bit more complicated model than the triad of host, agent and environment.

116
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:21,970
And so again, if we use malaria as an example, we've got susceptible hosts often there infants and children who are susceptible in an endemic area.

117
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:26,230
Adults tend to be protected.

118
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:38,030
Pregnant women are going to be more at risk. I mentioned before, there's four species of Plasmodium falciparum vivax, Ebola and malaria.

119
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:43,430
Malaria falciparum and vivax are the most prevalent.

120
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:48,680
Vivax is the one that can actually is less serious than falciparum,

121
00:15:49,040 --> 00:16:01,250
but can become dormant in your liver cells for a period of time and then actually reemerge even years later and cause causing disease.

122
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:09,200
Whereas falciparum it's much more virulent and has a higher mortality rate than vivax.

123
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:15,400
So malaria is a human disease.

124
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,969
It's basically transmitted human to human. There's not an animal reservoir.

125
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:27,970
Host So humans are the reservoir. But the portal and exit is going to be the skin through a bite of the mosquito.

126
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:34,269
So a mosquito is, if you use an infectious person,

127
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:46,150
will have malaria infected with Plasmodium in their blood and the mosquito will take a bite and become infected with that.

128
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:51,220
So and then the mosquito over a period of time.

129
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:55,300
And we'll talk about this in a few slides later, Will.

130
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:04,870
You become infected and then infectious with the malaria parasite.

131
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:14,830
And once it's in its salivary glands, the mosquito then is infectious, and then through a subsequent bite to another susceptible person.

132
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,670
Well, then, in fact, it's a central host.

133
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:27,140
So we can go again and look at a sexually transmitted disease like gonorrhea.

134
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:30,319
Now, susceptible hosts are sexually active humans.

135
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:38,840
Somebody that's not sexually active will not be in the risk group, are susceptible or part of the transmission system.

136
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:44,870
We've got a bacteria that is the microbial agent. Humans, again, are the reservoir host.

137
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:49,430
This is a human disease. No animal host.

138
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:59,000
General secretions will be the way in which an infectious person will transmit the disease through sexual contact.

139
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,959
And then the general track is also the port of entry.

140
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:09,860
So this is how a sexually transmitted disease is transmitted in a population.

141
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:22,379
Honda virus, an example in which the actual disease system and the transmission system is not doesn't include the human.

142
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:26,100
The human is what we call accidental or dead end host.

143
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:30,210
So you've got to have a Honda virus as a microbial agent.

144
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:37,620
Rodents tend to be the reservoir in this case, and there is transmission within rodents.

145
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:41,850
And generally run reservoir hosts don't see any pathology.

146
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:50,100
So they're basically harboring the pathogen and the transmission system occurs through the reservoir.

147
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:56,060
HOST But they themselves are not. Don't get sick or disease.

148
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:03,200
It's a urine in the feces of the rodents. That is the port of exit from the reservoir.

149
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:08,659
Host And then the motor transmission is actually airborne because it's what happens

150
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:14,600
is that urine and feces contaminated with the virus then dry in in dust particles

151
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:20,419
in the dust particles aerosolized a plastic way that's happened in the southwest is

152
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:24,790
that you just get a lot of dust and people cleaning off in their garage and stuff.

153
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:34,040
Aerosolized dust particles, entry is through inhalation and then humans get the disease, get infected.

154
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:37,580
They can't transmit the host, they can't transmit the virus.

155
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,479
And so they are called, again, a dead, dead end host.

156
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:50,840
It's often also called an accidental ghost. So that's these are three examples using this chain model.

157
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:55,300
So now we're just going to go into more detail.

158
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:07,740
In each aspect of this chain model. And so first, what is an infectious disease agent, a microbe that can cause disease?

159
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:18,450
It can infect a host. And so mostly what we're talking about are bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa, helminths, but they can.

160
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:30,479
So the infectious agent, again, can be carried by hosts and not necessarily cause disease y and but they can these hosts can transmit to others.

161
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:38,490
So that's why we're very concerned still about those that are infected and infectious, even if they're not causing disease.

162
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:46,790
So really what where we want to think about is that agents,

163
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:51,019
these disease agents are looking basically for homes and looking for ways in

164
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:57,200
which they're looking for ecologic niches in which they can sustain themselves,

165
00:20:57,530 --> 00:21:11,720
they can multiply and they can transmit. And so and the ability for these pathogens to adapt increases their flexibility.

166
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,820
But other there are other agents like malaria.

167
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:24,040
I mean, malaria measles is a good example of a disease agent that doesn't really adapt that much, but it's so infectious.

168
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:35,420
That it's able to sustain itself and it can it can survive in air, in the aerosolized particles for a fairly long time.

169
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:42,230
And it's able to just sweep through a population very quickly and cause lots of disease and lots of complications.

170
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:49,040
And then those come back communities potentially completely as herd immunity.

171
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:55,820
But then it just moves into another community and does the same thing. So it doesn't influenza are much less infectious,

172
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:06,350
but it's it's it's niches that it's able to adapt and mutate continuously to invade the immune system.

173
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:12,180
TV is an example where it's not that infectious. Its infectivity is low.

174
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:16,530
That it can stay latent in a human for decades.

175
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:31,280
So each avenue. Creates its sort of ecologic niche and its and and finds its success and able to sustain itself in a population.

176
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:38,500
So here's an example with for malaria,

177
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:55,209
where it's just a single amino acid difference can be the difference between an influenza virus that attaches to a human cell versus a navy.

178
00:22:55,210 --> 00:23:12,760
And so so here again, influenza uses this amazing ability to mutate and drift and shift to actually find alternative homes in in different host.

179
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:18,600
A zoonotic disease and there's a lot of them here.

180
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:31,620
Toxoplasma, Gondii and Kitten Caucus, you kind of caucus are ones in which they maintain their maintaining themselves in mammalian hosts like canines,

181
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:36,930
intermediate host, like rodents and then humans.

182
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,480
Can accidentally get infected. Talk to an advocate.

183
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:51,200
Dr. Plasma Gandhi is a great example in which humans often get it from their past like cats in dealing with.

184
00:23:51,530 --> 00:24:01,190
And it's transmitted fairly early. So dealing with litter boxes and stuff is one way in which humans can be infected with Toxoplasma.

185
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:06,710
So Reservoir we talked a little bit about reservoirs.

186
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:17,180
Again, Reservoir can be any person, animal, arthropod or environment in which the infected agent can live and can multiply.

187
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:29,390
So an agent relies on this reservoir for survival and for the ability to transmit to humans can be,

188
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:36,170
as we talked about, it can be that reservoir host and that's going to be for sexually transmitted diseases.

189
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:41,240
Humans are the reservoir host. Water can be a reservoir.

190
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,880
Cholera is a great example of that.

191
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:58,280
Cholera is a bacteria that can thrive in different kinds of water conditions and actually sustain itself and then infect humans.

192
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:02,540
And it can also be moving from human to human through infection,

193
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:11,450
both fomites and other other means that water becomes a very classic reservoir of reservoir for for

194
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:21,409
cholera bats turned out to be great reservoirs for and with respect to human disease and two reasons.

195
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:25,879
One is bats are flying mammals. So being a mammal,

196
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:30,290
they're more closely related to us and they're very in the fact that they can

197
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:39,109
fly means they can actually spread pathogens throughout a given region fairly,

198
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:51,090
fairly readily if that's actually have a wide. Species diversity, which also allows them to be for pathogen to find niches in bats.

199
00:25:51,300 --> 00:26:04,830
So bats are a major reservoir hosts for a lot of diseases and a lot of our hemorrhagic diseases that we think that bats are connected to,

200
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:14,550
such as the virus, is one example of that and livestock are another classic example of a reservoir host.

201
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:24,510
And again, ever since the advent of agriculture, where humans have intimate contact with with livestock and with animals,

202
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:30,450
has created a lot of spillover events from domestic animals to humans.

203
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:40,649
And with the intensification of agriculture we talked about last time, it continues to create different niches for different kinds of pathogens.

204
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:51,330
E.coli 157, the culprit of the outbreak in Wendy's restaurants, you may have heard in Ohio and Michigan,

205
00:26:51,720 --> 00:27:00,720
is a good example of an emerging pathogen that has occurred due to the intensification of agricultural practices in the US and the world.

206
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:10,120
Again, the example of humans being a reservoir host.

207
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:16,150
Salmonella. Salmonella can actually reside in humans for long periods of time.

208
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:28,809
We're not causing disease. And so is Noroviruses is maybe more modern day example of that where people can harbor norovirus a long time

209
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:35,710
after they've recovered from an illness and send food handling is is where superspreading events can occur.

210
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:40,180
And we've seen that a lot with norovirus for the past decade or so.

211
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:47,820
So we can classify transmission cycles by their reservoir.

212
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:55,890
Host So again, we talked about reservoir hosts in which humans are the primary reservoir.

213
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:08,700
So these are called anthro oases and go to 19 is now an example even though it was a there was a recent spillover event from animals.

214
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:15,540
Right now it is a anthro zoonosis, as is malaria.

215
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:23,950
And there's a lot of examples of that. Zoonosis is one in which and again,

216
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:30,370
here's where the definitions are a little fuzzy and you'll see a lot of different ways in which zoonosis to define.

217
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:41,050
But here we're going to find it where animals are the primary host and where this transmission system doesn't require humans.

218
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:48,730
Examples of that are Lyme disease and rabies. And then there's a term that's not used as much in the literature,

219
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:58,270
but zoo anthropologists are ones in which animals and humans are transmitting the pathogens of cryptosporidium,

220
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:05,320
different E.coli and appetites for examples where transmission can be occurring and E.coli

221
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:12,700
often evolves to actually be more readily transmitted by humans and also through livestock.

222
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:18,239
So again, there's a lot of conflation between zoo zoonoses and zoo.

223
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:26,430
And these are. Is there another example?

224
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:31,930
And there was this was highlighted in Monkey Pox in the New York Times not that long ago,

225
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:38,770
this idea of reverse zoonosis, where there is potential for humans to infect animals.

226
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:48,580
And this is a great you can a great video abstract for you to look at later on.

227
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:55,090
But it actually highlights the importance of this reverse zoonosis for influenza,

228
00:29:55,540 --> 00:30:00,550
where there's evidence that there's much more transmission from humans to pigs.

229
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:08,440
And that's where the influenza virus combines and actually changes and mutates and

230
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:17,350
then reinfect humans and can then cause further spread and further epidemics.

231
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:30,970
And so when we talked about the H1N1, they may call this swine flu, if it looks like it happened through first humans infecting pigs and then pigs.

232
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:43,740
Transmitting the virus and causing certain mutations, which then resulted in this novel strain of influenza that spread readily out and globally.

233
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:50,460
So what is a host?

234
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:57,270
So any animal or plant that harbors and provides and can sustain another organism.

235
00:30:57,390 --> 00:31:03,250
In this case, a parasite. And so we talk about and there's two definitions of host.

236
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:14,130
One is a definitive host. And that's technically where the parasite attains sexual maturity and is able to replicate.

237
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:23,820
And then there's an intermediate host where the parasite must pass through for one or more of its asexual stages.

238
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:36,200
So often intermediate hosts are examples of intermediate hosts are rodents and other kinds of.

239
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:44,540
Animals where? And you, in that case, humans or other mammalian hosts are the definitive host.

240
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:54,489
Malaria is actually interestingly distinct in that technically, based on this definition,

241
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:58,300
a mosquito is the definitive host because that's where sexual reproduction happens.

242
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:05,540
The Plasmodium parasite and humans are technically intermediate host because that's where asexual transmission or.

243
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:15,700
Its occur in. For malaria in the last days we talked about the dangers to host.

244
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:20,190
That's a host can get infected and get disease.

245
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:25,740
I can't pass on the pathogen to let them know if I should ask questions.

246
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:32,219
Oh, yeah. But what? That means that a plague could be considered an intermediate host for influenza.

247
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:37,590
Or is it not considered intermediate because it's not a necessary part of the life stage?

248
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:46,550
Well, if it is. It's definitely a host.

249
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:57,710
And whether or not it's an intermediate host, Senator Inhofe, depends on with respect to the sexual and sexual maturity for viruses, that means less.

250
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:02,810
Apparent this definition. So it's it's clearly a host.

251
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:06,530
Because it is it sustains transmission.

252
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:24,500
But in an example of a anthro zoonosis zoonosis, where both humans and in this case, pigs or other animals can readily transmit the pathogen.

253
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:30,200
So, yeah, they're both they're both they're both going to be hosts in that case.

254
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:36,940
Yeah. Oh, it's a parasite. In the context of this slide, are you referring like pathogen?

255
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:43,330
Yes. In this case, it's going to be okay. So yes.

256
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:50,750
And as also can be using his parasite often is used to be distinct from viruses and bacteria.

257
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:54,740
So protozoan pathogens like Chiari is a protozoan.

258
00:33:55,190 --> 00:34:00,620
Here it is considered a parasite. So that's also confusing in the literature.

259
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:13,150
In this case, we're talking about pathogens. So now we heard when we started to think about Port of Entry and Portland exit,

260
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:19,050
there are many ways in which how does the pathogen enter into how its human host?

261
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:22,460
In this case it'd be through broken skin.

262
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:32,140
Often when we talk about droplet transmission, there's, you know, it could be that droplet transmission usually occurs.

263
00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:36,700
The deportable entry is usually through a membrane.

264
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:43,570
So you sneeze and somebody, you know, it hits their high membranes nose or even if it enters their mouth.

265
00:34:43,930 --> 00:34:49,180
It's the membrane, you know, it's the membranes within the mouth that results in infection.

266
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:58,360
And for sexually transmitted diseases, going to be a number of genital membranes that result in infection.

267
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:03,930
So that's the port of entry or exit is fecal oral.

268
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:08,980
It's going to be feces again, mouth and nose through sneezing.

269
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:15,550
It can be through with monkeypox, through lesions and broken skin.

270
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:24,250
So there's same with staphylococcus, which is which in which is transmitted through the skin.

271
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:31,090
So there's many different again, the pathogen is exploiting different portals of entry and exit.

272
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:40,450
Some pathogens can exploit multiple pathways with portals, entries or exit.

273
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:48,340
So influenza, for instance, or this idea is that again, you can be infected through inhaling influenza virus,

274
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:55,480
but also you can get infected through membrane so that through the eyes, nose and mouth.

275
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:06,820
The ban. We talk about modes of transmission. We've got direct.

276
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:14,260
We talked about this. Most STDs are the classic example of direct transmission, our skin to skin contact.

277
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:27,350
Fomite transmission one can again sneeze and cough or just through contaminated hands from a fecal oral pathogen can infect surfaces.

278
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:38,780
Some of these antigens can live, maybe live for hours if it's COVID or influenza or weeks if it's an entire pathogen like giardia or rotavirus.

279
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:46,160
And then people touch that, those contaminated fomites and then touch their mouth and their eyes and the nose and.

280
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:55,850
Right. And that's another very distinct mode of transmission, food or water, usually associated with fecal oral transmission.

281
00:36:56,360 --> 00:37:01,070
Another source, airborne. Again, we talked about the distinction between aerosolized.

282
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:06,880
Talk about that in a future slide and droplet spread. Vector borne.

283
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,060
We've talked about that with respect to mosquitoes,

284
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:20,710
but ticks also are for diseases like Lyme disease can vector and disease from from becoming

285
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:27,970
infected by biting an infectious host and then transmitting it to the susceptible host.

286
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:40,690
And then there's perinatal another form, I think, of direct transmission where whether it can be utero transmission from the mother to the fetus.

287
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:56,700
So. Just going in a little bit more detail in these direct different modes of transmission.

288
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:05,550
And we talked about, uh, we can distinguish, I guess, between what we're considering direct and indirect.

289
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:11,700
So fomites and vectors would be an example of indirect transmission risk.

290
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:16,500
There is battery fecal, oral sexual blood borne man in a child.

291
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:18,840
Examples of direct.

292
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:28,739
And another definition, distinct definition is we have horizontal transmission where there's transmission among those in the same generation.

293
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:37,920
And then vertical transmission is, again, maternal to fetus transmission that can occur with various pathogens.

294
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:40,440
And a lot of examples like for rubella.

295
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:52,900
That's where that's the serious disease burden is when a mother transmits it to the fetus and causes congenital episode disease and otherwise,

296
00:38:52,920 --> 00:39:00,030
the pretty mild symptoms, the disease that occurred that conveys mild symptoms to most people.

297
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:15,630
FOMITES There's a lot of factors that are involved, that are involved in what makes a fomite transmission occur more readily.

298
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:22,740
So we've got environmental factors such as the humidity, air temperature, UV exposure.

299
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:30,930
We've got properties in the fomite a porous fomite that would be like clothing or any kind

300
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:37,870
of fabric is going to be very different than a non-porous fomite such as a tabletop.

301
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:42,900
You know, wood, wood, wood could actually be considered more porous.

302
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:46,200
That steel kind of tabletop can be non-porous.

303
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:56,730
What kind of moisture is present or not present is going to determine the survivor survivability of that and persistence of the virus.

304
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:00,990
And then there's virus properties with respect to this strain and type.

305
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:04,439
Some viruses are more readily able to survive.

306
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:08,879
There's a lot of when COVID came out, there was a lot of studies on, you know,

307
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:17,280
the sort of how long would would COVID survive on different properties, different surfaces, plastics, wood, metal.

308
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:21,390
And so that is a big factor in how.

309
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:32,420
The ability of a given pathogen to exploit to. Yeah.

310
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:37,730
So basically that's. Well, my transmission.

311
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:46,160
So fecal oral transmission is all our waterborne and foodborne pathogens and there's

312
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:51,530
multiple pathways of transmission that occur can occur with waterborne pathogens.

313
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:59,120
Resistance, though, and feces can from an infectious individual can contaminate water sources.

314
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:04,160
Those water sources can be transported from upstream to downstream communities.

315
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:15,200
It can, in fact, infect the sewage, which can then contaminate your range through floods, for instance, can contaminate the environment.

316
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:19,579
Being contaminated hands is another way in which you can get contaminate.

317
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:23,000
Fomites and trends are directly transmitted.

318
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:32,120
People are contaminate. Food supplies are an interesting example that we call flies vectors, but they're mechanical vectors.

319
00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:41,870
That is, they're just they're landing on feces and they're basically they're they're just moving that contamination to another spot as

320
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:51,890
opposed to a mosquito which actually takes in that and internalizes the parasite and biologically transforms the parasite.

321
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:58,639
And then and which is an essential part of the parasite's lifecycle and then transmits through another bite,

322
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:03,290
that's the biological vector flies or mechanical vector.

323
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:11,370
And so this is called the F diagram for the different fluids, fingers, flies, fields, food.

324
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:22,399
And it's a very classic diagram to show the different ways in which waterborne pathogens can be transmitted via

325
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:30,710
the environment from an infectious person to a susceptible person and intervening the classic ways you intervene,

326
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:41,240
treating the water, improving the sanitation. So improving sanitation minimizes these arrows going from this infectious person to the environment.

327
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:45,829
Treating the water specifically deals with water contamination.

328
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:50,630
Hand hygiene is specifically addresses contaminated hands.

329
00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:57,950
And so water, sanitation, hygiene are really classic ways in which we intervene.

330
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:03,740
But food hygiene is also another area that people focus on for food borne pathogens.

331
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:11,800
So a few more of these before we start for the discussion.

332
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:17,260
Airborne versus droplet, we've talked about that a bit already.

333
00:43:17,770 --> 00:43:23,139
So when you cough or sneeze that a virus, for example,

334
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:31,390
adheres to particles and the size of the particle adheres to depends on whether or not the virus will be aerosolized.

335
00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:39,250
So if it adheres to particles that are less than five microns, it'll be aerosolized and can travel far distances.

336
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:45,340
So you could be on one side of an restaurant and an infectious person at the other side and potentially get infected.

337
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:58,269
And so aerosolization is a property that not all viruses will can persist in on adhering to small particles,

338
00:43:58,270 --> 00:44:03,520
so that there is a question on whether or not COVID was actually aerosolized or simply droplet spread.

339
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:08,380
But so droplet spread is the other mode of transmission.

340
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:14,440
That's when the virus or the pathogen adheres to particles that are greater than five microns.

341
00:44:14,770 --> 00:44:16,549
That means they're not able to aerosolize.

342
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:27,460
They're too heavy, and they'll either directly through a sneeze or cough, directly expose somebody that's close by.

343
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:35,440
And that's the three dividers that we came up with, six feet for COVID as a rough.

344
00:44:36,370 --> 00:44:38,319
You know, that's the assumption.

345
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:48,460
And that's got to be safe from droplet transmission so they can also land on surfaces, those droplets and then resulting fomite transmission.

346
00:44:50,350 --> 00:44:57,100
So this is a pictorial it's different sized particles that will move different distances.

347
00:44:58,390 --> 00:45:09,660
And if it's smaller particles, it becomes aerosolized. So biological vectors, we've mentioned the difference in biological mechanical.

348
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:16,680
So we talked a lot about this through. With respect to malaria, this is a very malaria has a very complicated lifecycle.

349
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:26,280
And here we see that an fact a mosquito that fights a human becomes in fact,

350
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:38,169
did and through various biological stages becomes in fact when the spores enter into the salivary glands of mosquito and then mosquito bites,

351
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:42,959
the human, human becomes infected. And there's two major cycles.

352
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:53,160
I mentioned this liver cycle where for vivax it can become dormant in this liver cycle, but it's this blood cycle here that results in pathology,

353
00:45:53,730 --> 00:46:01,860
that that parasite infects red blood cells, multiplies, they burst the red blood cells,

354
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:12,480
and then at some point, they these parasites move into this sexual stage, the gamma sites,

355
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:21,510
which then the speed of the bites of human that has these parasites, the human is then infectious and can infect again.

356
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:27,240
So this is a pretty complicated lifecycle, pretty complicated organism.

357
00:46:28,110 --> 00:46:33,260
So you can imagine, again, dealing with designing vaccines becomes very, very complicated.

358
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:40,980
We talked about mechanical vectors, so I'm going to maybe end here.

359
00:46:42,450 --> 00:46:52,590
So we've got different ways to categorize transmission cycles as being direct or indirect because he is a human exposed to a source.

360
00:46:53,040 --> 00:47:02,669
Environmental source is a lot of noninfectious ways in which a human can become disease by contaminated source.

361
00:47:02,670 --> 00:47:15,749
But tetanus is a good example. The bacteria that is, and humans are again, these dead end hosts, there's indirect transmission through that.

362
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:20,670
Is the pathogen used through some sort of vehicle or vector.

363
00:47:21,090 --> 00:47:26,040
And Legionella is an example of that. We've got the anthem.

364
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:38,290
Anodic infections. Again, these are human derived either directly human to human or STDs or good examples,

365
00:47:38,810 --> 00:47:47,360
hepatitis B, measles and or it can be mediated by a vector mosquito bacteria.

366
00:47:47,770 --> 00:47:59,540
In the case of malaria and dengue, and then we have the zoonotic infections here where we're defining this as humans are, again, our dead end hosts.

367
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:07,730
But again, as we know, Ebola there can be human to human transmission in very specific situations.

368
00:48:07,730 --> 00:48:14,300
And that's what caused the huge epidemic in West Africa in 2014.

369
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:22,850
And again, Lyme disease, the kind of virus that is indirect infection that there there's an intermediate host.

370
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:27,860
There is a vector involved in maintaining the transmission in animals.

371
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:38,540
Humans, again, that knows. So, you know, and they're and we'll go we'll talk a little bit more about that,

372
00:48:39,110 --> 00:48:49,760
lot more about environmental transmission and then way metrics in which we can quantify transmission.

373
00:48:49,970 --> 00:48:56,210
And so we'll talk about herd immunity and are not reproductive number next, you know, next week on Monday.

374
00:48:58,250 --> 00:49:02,330
Any questions? Yes.

375
00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:09,790
So. For the discussion in question,

376
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:20,649
I thought that each of the groups could talk about use the chain of transmission model and where it is

377
00:49:20,650 --> 00:49:26,110
going to be discussed in lecture to discuss the ecological niche of a particular infectious disease,

378
00:49:26,950 --> 00:49:33,460
then choose an anthropometric stressor. So we talked about that a little bit last week, slide 18 of last week's lecture.

379
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:40,270
So it could be agriculture, intensification of agriculture,

380
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:48,940
it could be climate change effects, any kind of water, dams, lots of different urbanization,

381
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:56,230
lots of examples of what we call anthropogenic anthropogenic stressors, human caused stressors,

382
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:00,820
and how those stressors may exasperate transmission and disease burden.

383
00:50:02,890 --> 00:50:06,550
That's a discussion question, too. Two part discussion question.

384
00:50:07,090 --> 00:50:15,550
And for variety, I thought that each group could focus on a different transition mode.

385
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:23,860
So group one itself can take a vector borne disease group to a waterborne group or an airborne sexually transmitted,

386
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:29,440
and then six and seven zoonotic either humans being dead end host or what we call

387
00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:36,160
to anthro zoonosis to humans and animals can transmit equally transmit and well.

388
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:42,570
And you'll find that, you know, there are some waterborne diseases in food or disease that are also cirrhotic.

389
00:50:42,850 --> 00:50:52,950
So there's a these are really completely distinct categories, but choose within that, you know,

390
00:50:52,960 --> 00:51:01,030
try and choose within that category to discuss this question about both ecologic niche for the particular

391
00:51:01,030 --> 00:51:08,560
infection system and then also how some sort of stressor can result in exacerbating transmission.

392
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:17,630
Okay. So does everyone have their group member and maybe.

393
00:51:18,730 --> 00:51:30,590
Okay, so we'll give about 20 minutes and then or so and then we'll have maybe 10 minutes to.

394
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:40,240
Wisconsin's very easy to do.

395
00:51:42,810 --> 00:51:51,970
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, I was like, I.
