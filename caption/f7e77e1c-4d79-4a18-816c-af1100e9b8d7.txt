1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:11,810
I end up finding the window all the way that I was the last thing that you really want to have somebody like that.

2
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:16,130
So, yeah. Yes.

3
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,290
Oh, well.

4
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:38,460
Well. So this rather as much as we saw today, pretty soon, to be honest, got a lot of experience with these systems that they can't rely on response.

5
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:43,589
So that's good. And so we're really lucky to have the insights.

6
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:50,580
We have this experience in the context of what you've done being that global health space.

7
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:56,610
And I was pleasantly surprised to find we have a lot of nice folks in the cohort who are really engaging.

8
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:03,180
Robopocalypse So it's up to you to I'm going to hand over to Frasier if you need me to consult.

9
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:12,550
So I didn't think anyone had me.

10
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:13,870
So I guess I'm the class.

11
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:23,830
Obviously my name is pretty funny and I'm so excited about global health and we're going to cover a lot of material today in about 15 minutes.

12
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:27,810
So I'm going to go pretty quickly through these lines if you have questions.

13
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,550
And then there's also the kind of recommended reading that I added for today's call.

14
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:36,660
So please have a look at that, especially if you're interested in global health against us.

15
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,170
So first, we're going to talk about what is global health.

16
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:46,350
And so I know a bunch of you are in the global health region with an MPH program.

17
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:50,130
So like what is different people with health, global health and national health, etc.?

18
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:55,230
So public health tackles issues of population health that cover any territory.

19
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:00,970
So for example, the Flint water crisis would be a public health issue.

20
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:06,180
COVID 19 is a public health issue. It doesn't cover the scale of the territory then it covers, right?

21
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:12,090
Global health are issues that affect health to transcend boundaries, right?

22
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:19,229
So COVID 19 is an example of that. Ebola is an example of that, and malnutrition is an example of that which we'll get into later.

23
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:24,490
In the lecture, international health focuses on issues affecting low and middle income.

24
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:33,700
So while global health is trying to include like upper income countries within that,

25
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:36,869
there's a lot of global health still looks a lot like international.

26
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:40,020
So something you should be aware of if you're getting into the fields.

27
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:46,799
Comparative health is a lot of what some we do, which is comparing health systems across country.

28
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,570
So you might have noticed when we were talking about Medicare for All, they think about like,

29
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:55,170
okay, how does the US health care system compare to the case, for example?

30
00:02:55,170 --> 00:03:01,229
So that's an example of health and then health management and policy and health services.

31
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:06,630
Research is a study and practice of the financing and the delivery of healthcare services specifically.

32
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:15,220
Interestingly, how is Medicaid funded or how is Medicare or any of those programs like funded is limited.

33
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,030
That's health services. All right.

34
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:23,970
So what will help specifically here is they have a one health organization.

35
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:34,139
What summarization basically acts as like a monitoring body slash advisory body slash large donation in practice.

36
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:43,950
And you also have the World Bank and IMF, which saw which acts as organizations that give money to countries to address problems.

37
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:50,910
You have. The EU is becoming increasingly important because of their research and because of the policies they in.

38
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:57,720
That tends to serve as like good practices for other countries to take on.

39
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:05,040
For example, you have donors which include countries like the US, like U.S. is the biggest donor in global health currently.

40
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,300
But then you also have organizations like the Gates Foundation and others.

41
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:14,219
You have nonprofits or INGOs, which could be international NGOs,

42
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:20,670
they could be local NGO is that they work a lot in enacting interventions in global health.

43
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:21,870
And then you have country governments,

44
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:31,709
which you can really take all the policy recommendations from world leaders where people can work independently on your intervention,

45
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:35,580
make your own very quick overview.

46
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:43,080
So now we're talking about malnutrition. So malnutrition, as we discussed, is one of the issues in global health.

47
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:51,450
I take this one because it's an interesting area that's had a lot of research and development recently and also because I worked a lot in this space.

48
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:54,989
So if you're interested in nutrition, let me know. Okay.

49
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:59,830
So non-decision currently is defined as undernutrition and it is to do with being overweight.

50
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:08,130
Both are included in the definition of transition within the reason shift that's happened previously used to only focus on undernutrition.

51
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:15,100
So undernutrition includes stunting, raising, being underweight, having micronutrient deficiencies and insufficiency.

52
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,080
Overweight is issues related to obesity and diet related.

53
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:28,740
You might have if you read the materials for class, you'll notice that a big issue right now is the problem of malnutrition.

54
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:36,300
So this basically means in the same households, their members that are undernourished and members who are overweight.

55
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,800
And that's really interesting, right? Because like, how does that happen and why does that happen?

56
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:46,650
And there's an interesting dynamic. So to address that, we can look at the causes of nonfiction.

57
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:54,000
So if you look at the first or left that we will notice that they seem to be in nutrition.

58
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:01,170
And so being overweight, so poor access, poverty and lack of purchasing power for access to adequate and appropriate care,

59
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:05,490
insufficient education, malnutrition, they currently have problems.

60
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:12,810
Well, this is why you might end up being a household name, both both types of substance.

61
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:20,490
However, you have different models as well. Undernourished undernutrition could be related to the ability to start fresh.

62
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:30,090
You want some example? If you are living in a like a desert environment like Morocco, this is a big problem in very rural areas.

63
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:36,300
Like if you have ration at store, it has a little bit of everything that's not very far to get fresh moving at four,

64
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:41,700
then you may not have least as of like storage capacity.

65
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:45,990
For example, lack of access to clean water sanitation is a big problem.

66
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:52,530
So especially when you're looking at young children, if you don't have water,

67
00:06:52,830 --> 00:07:04,290
you might be infections and we might have 300 light years which prevent your ability to your nutrients which that nutrients.

68
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:09,299
Right. So they could treated produce an agricultural yield.

69
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:14,880
So for example, if you're going through a drought and you live in a president sort of a community or subsistence farming community,

70
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:20,790
you may not have you'll stay here and earn an income in America because you're not able to provide.

71
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:27,290
Climate change is a big hole in nutrition, like, for example, in Pakistan right now there's a lot of plants.

72
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:35,660
So that means for people who are, you know, agricultural and even if not, the floods are caused by climate change.

73
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:41,700
So overweight, you have increased.

74
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:46,050
Okay. So the paper talks about increasing accessibility and affordability of processed foods.

75
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:53,700
So this has been it's a very interesting dynamic of where trade policy and corporate interest intersects with nutrition.

76
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,399
So if you're in, for example,

77
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:04,100
if you go to a Starbucks or if you go to a 7-Eleven and you'll find that like a pack of chips is cheaper than normal, well,

78
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:08,459
there's incentives to buy a pack of chips instead of an apple to then that the

79
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:13,410
increased accessibility and affordability kind of replaces what your choices,

80
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:26,520
which might feel good corporate incentives that might push people first but something you also think about like opera amplification.

81
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:33,510
So if you're living in like a suburb of Michigan, like in Canada or something and everything out of the way,

82
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:38,430
but if you are living and I'm not sure like what the walkability there is, right?

83
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:43,950
Like how many sidewalks are there? Can you really walk from your house to the grocery store or would you take a car?

84
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:52,920
So where there are incentives can be cars or to take basically cars instead of walking, instead of taking public transportation or busses,

85
00:08:53,970 --> 00:09:05,160
the lack of physical activity that's built into the system might be a cause for either systemic problems that are causing undernutrition and.

86
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:12,260
So these are just a few examples. But the fun part that we're going to be doing is systems mapping.

87
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:21,110
So you guys are going to be thinking about like creating your own systems and the reasons for why nonfiction might be happening in certain areas.

88
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:33,560
So to do that, we're going to do it consistently. So this mapping basically identifies like a pattern of behavior that's common, right?

89
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:44,390
So, for example, in malnutrition, this might be like the poor, like infrastructure system within your state is causing people to be all right.

90
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:52,340
So how does that happen? And you like map that back. So a system is the overall life cycle and a pattern of behavior are like

91
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,210
specific variables and how they change and how they interact with one another.

92
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:00,380
And the event is the problem or the intervention that you're interested in.

93
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:04,480
So why is it important to do systems mapping? So you want to address hydration.

94
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:09,650
But again, if you just provide like for example,

95
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:14,960
one of the things that happens is that people provide like food aid for a short amount of time, which is great.

96
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:19,160
But if you want to prevent maltreatment from happening in the future, you may want to look at like,

97
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:23,920
okay, what is the system of behavior that's causing migrations happen in the first place?

98
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:34,830
And can we tackle some problems that are happening upstream which have a higher impact or like may have more memory for a long lasting change?

99
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:41,120
Right. So you want to address the system and kind of working backwards might help me get to what that intervention might be.

100
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:47,390
That makes sense since this exact thing is a tool that's often used in global health to

101
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:51,270
identify new upstream interventions and to identify feedback loops outside feedback.

102
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:57,830
That's why usually when you do this, what happens is there's workshops where people will be like,

103
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:02,980
for example, in if you're addressing an issue in South Africa that want to address like HIV in South Africa,

104
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:07,520
there's workshops where local ideas, community members, country governments,

105
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:14,929
international NGOs working on this topic that might show representatives they might meet and try to build the system together.

106
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:22,190
So you understand all the different aspects that are causing your issue and then identify like sometimes intervention, right?

107
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:28,120
So this is a tool that is used a lot in global problems and things.

108
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:30,740
And this is an example of what a systems map mostly.

109
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:40,380
I cannot take credit for this, though I do know what I like so everybody know like my intervention is like work, right?

110
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:44,840
So I want to do more work and I want to be successful and work well.

111
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:50,720
Okay. So that's like what I'm focusing on, but what are the inputs and outputs of my work?

112
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:54,829
So on the left side you'll see like so if I'm interested in the topic,

113
00:11:54,830 --> 00:12:02,090
like I'm interested in teaching because that will encourage me to work and the work will need to have results like you guys would be like,

114
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:08,660
that was a great model. So that leads to success, which then leads to more interesting like, Oh, maybe I'll teach another time.

115
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:10,900
So then it leads to more work. Right?

116
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:18,800
So you end up with this feedback loop where there is like reinforcing behaviors that make sense, which leads to me working more.

117
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:22,999
Or on the other side you have a balancing. So I work for them.

118
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,910
I get bored of them like, Oh, how long am I going to talk about malnutrition?

119
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:33,229
So then it's like more that and that makes more 100 topics like, oh, maybe I should think about vaccines or something else.

120
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:41,540
And then it's about interest and other things, which then might lead me to work less on the area that I want to work or I think I'm guilty about.

121
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:45,380
Like, no, keep doing nitrogen and then I'll work more.

122
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:51,980
Right? So there's like different things that might be positively impacting,

123
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:56,750
like the outcome of interest or they may be negatively impacting the outcomes of interest.

124
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,620
And why it's important to address these beliefs is like, for example,

125
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:06,420
if you have an issue like undernutrition, for example, and you have poverty, that's the time.

126
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:15,770
Nutrition, which leads to lack of access to health care, which leads to an impression when you identify a reinforcing.

127
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:20,930
Right. So you want to interrupt that pattern later on, right?

128
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:26,340
So it helps you identify what the system is and where your intervention might be.

129
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:27,160
Right.

130
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:36,799
So like in this case, I want to keep doing work and we want to address like this issue, like other interesting things, like stop reading papers.

131
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:45,510
I'm not really myself, which is a bad example. I wasn't reading because I did not realize it often, but is an example of what I might use for that.

132
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:49,730
But does that make sense? You guys have any questions about that?

133
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:57,260
Okay, cool. Well, you're going to be doing your own exercise I mentioned before.

134
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:05,400
Like, usually when people see people who are experts in your country and you work on this, you guys don't have the advantages we might have.

135
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:12,820
I'm certainly. But it's still a fun exercise to think about. So for this exercise, you're going to break up into groups of six.

136
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:23,350
You'll see on the canvas there is a job word already open. I'm going to try to build our assistance maps for this issue for the country that your

137
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:28,990
designs and I want you guys to think about like how do you identify any feedback loops,

138
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:34,720
articles ever negative? Are there any policy interventions that might disrupt these behaviors that you're finding?

139
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:40,660
And then based on your sense that one or two or three policies or interventions that might be most effective,

140
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:49,560
and then if you identify and surprising, interesting people is now under par.

141
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:54,670
Okay. So if you could break up into groups of works.

142
00:14:54,970 --> 00:15:05,980
Yeah. Five or six, five or 6000i have done there.

143
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:19,600
So yes, I think I would love to touch them.

144
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:32,799
So you can use the chance that you can use it.

145
00:15:32,800 --> 00:16:12,630
You know, I think to myself, first of all, I'm sorry I never got you know, I never really thought about that.

146
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:26,230
And I'll go do that or anyone else.

147
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:29,760
See, I guess.

148
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:38,380
Thanks, Alex. Where I was in the crowd.

149
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:49,350
Just because I think that's what I was excited for, you guys would start with.

150
00:16:49,870 --> 00:17:00,570
So definitely I think no one tries making on their knees and when you want to solve this problem and it was done here,

151
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:06,549
I believe this is what they ended up with. So we take it like very, very, very complicated.

152
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:14,230
And what you'll see is like sometimes they'll bracket out like, like like 310 might be behaviors and one region might be like physiology.

153
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:21,760
One reason might be health care. So you can start like mapping, like clouds of things that might be affecting your house.

154
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:27,580
So I decided to show you that I also instructions for your systems map like how do we even get started with this?

155
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:31,629
Start with your issue. So like compared to that,

156
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:40,990
but I think if you add a signal that says like under undernutrition and then try to think

157
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:46,450
of like what are some inputs that are causing undernutrition and what are some outputs?

158
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:52,900
And then just start building from there. So like started the first level like a lack of access to nutritious food for example.

159
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:56,290
And then think about, okay, what's causing lack of access to nutritious food.

160
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:03,760
You see what I mean? Like build your inner circles and then start working and think about inputs and outputs that make sense.

161
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:07,719
And and I'll be carrying around if you have a connection. Yes.

162
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,990
So we're supposed to be doing a systems map on our work.

163
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:17,950
That's the end goal. Yes, that is the end goal. And the idea is like the system's not should need you to identify like two or

164
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:22,420
three interventions that you might do to address this problem in your country.

165
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:30,610
And also, you're not a country expert. So please like Google and like do research on your country to figure out because for example,

166
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:35,650
the causes of malnutrition in Mali are very different from the cause of in India for example the like.

167
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:46,090
Yeah, so, but this is nothing what you see, we're not expecting you to be experts today,

168
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:52,030
but it does get used a lot in advocacy settings, but also in policy analysis and research.

169
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:56,330
If you want to find out more about systems mapping, there are some great sound system.

170
00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:03,390
So you connect your team and also encourage you to go find out for engineers in the department.

171
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:07,990
But also this get you in here is policy.

172
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:16,790
What we talk about policy feedback loops all the time. So how does something how is something causing the outcomes that you're seeing?

173
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:22,290
And then what are the countervailing forces that are making progress towards that outcome?

174
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:26,240
So it's really helpful to thinking complicated systems like this.

175
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:31,230
So we just want you to have a little go in it and we'll be coming around to give you a hand.

176
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:35,860
Okay. How long do they have to make everyone exhale.

177
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:44,400
Double check. 5.00.

178
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:50,770
Okay, great. Thank you so much. Okay, we'll give it to them.

179
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:59,010
So this is like significant control.

180
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:11,230
Right. Well, you know, it's also.

181
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:20,550
I know. I know. Well, like, I mean, I know that that's like two years ago.

182
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:26,700
Oh, yeah.

183
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:34,780
Well, it's another kind of other research, but we're not doing it right now.

184
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:39,270
So I thought I was.

185
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:55,380
But I think it's just like I think I forget how long the ship movement is going down,

186
00:20:56,430 --> 00:21:10,640
like the accident, but it's always maybe it's not scary, but you're like, you think.

187
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:15,400
I think it's going to be like that.

188
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:19,300
No, it's not going to be safe.

189
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:32,070
So the question is not really which.

190
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:40,060
And so I think this.

191
00:21:44,090 --> 00:22:07,860
It's about the uniform of France and also affected by the U.S. tax issue.

192
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:14,450
But this article was like this for one day.

193
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:31,620
Well, what happened, though, is that there was like, oh, there was all sorts of access to information.

194
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:48,920
Right now, this is just so we might get worse with the increases.

195
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:56,350
I mean, along the lines of those fireworks today anyway.

196
00:22:56,660 --> 00:23:02,660
Yeah. It is like when you're not.

197
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:22,520
I'm sorry. I don't know. You're going to let me ask you something about that and then maybe I'll combine that with.

198
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:26,090
Yes. So there's like last name tags.

199
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:51,380
And right now it's like, wow, I have some leads to my favorite part.

200
00:23:51,390 --> 00:24:09,130
So it's going to be like saying that with the drought has brought this is just that.

201
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:15,850
So the pirates, I'm not sure.

202
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:26,780
But the problem is they don't do anything on all of this.

203
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:49,330
It's interesting because I like to ask you about this whole thing because you guys have been married.

204
00:24:50,360 --> 00:25:11,320
So when I go to the records, like I just that there has to be some kind of like especially and in the end, it's going to be very nice to see it.

205
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:15,660
Exactly. That's been seen in the polls in low income neighborhoods.

206
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,350
Okay. No regulation restrictions.

207
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:48,650
It just has to be certain, like every other house needs to be called, you know, just make a note saying like Dawson's Creek housing market, right.

208
00:25:49,930 --> 00:26:00,870
The water rights so that it can help people.

209
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:06,740
You know, the next article with these Massachusetts protected areas.

210
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:14,510
Yeah. Yeah, that's crazy.

211
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:31,090
Yeah. High prices for a lot of us.

212
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:39,320
And we still need to figure out what is like a lot of students.

213
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:42,690
I think my sample might have been poor and I notice.

214
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:53,200
I think. They come from a circle, so it doesn't have to be. So I'm going to show you anything in here.

215
00:26:53,950 --> 00:27:01,450
Right. It could just be like a sign of, like, what's causing undernutrition, like access, like health care.

216
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:05,680
Right. So, like this center. Like this. Right. Like anything you can think of.

217
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:11,670
Like, are they leading to undernutrition or they're not like a result of.

218
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:18,820
I mean, because they might be like. Like it might lead to, like, poverty.

219
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:24,590
Right. So think about, like, if you are like, we are unable to work, it might lead to more poverty.

220
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:28,570
Right. Which then might lead to a lack of access, which then needs identify.

221
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:32,240
Right. So many of the same books coming in. Right.

222
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:36,040
Also need to think about the consequences that outcomes outputs.

223
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,320
And then you can start to make some connections between them. And I think these groups on this side are already doing that.

224
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:48,910
So feel good about them even though you don't have to make I don't start with this or things just start being like we're all in what are all out.

225
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:52,630
And then you'll see some circles start to form after that.

226
00:27:52,780 --> 00:28:00,970
Does that help? Yeah. So to have you tell us about.

227
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:09,230
I. Now.

228
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:14,320
I was interested to see how they interact with.

229
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:30,670
I was thinking about. That's good.

230
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:57,490
That's amazing. So, yeah, I hear her and I got a letter, Professor Vibes, and we hope you guys are there.

231
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:10,250
So I said, okay, all right.

232
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:28,470
So if you've got something to say, yeah, I ended security because it's not working misconceptions or anything.

233
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:47,220
Yeah, yeah, I think. And that's why together I was just like, this is developing without anybody speaking to flexibility.

234
00:29:50,240 --> 00:30:06,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, I mean, it's still like, oh, nice to see you again.

235
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:13,520
Just like one of the things I do have to do with the policy,

236
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:35,060
but it's one of the things he's coming in and making cheap food available, but a big multinational figuring out how to do that.

237
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:50,050
And so you find their health sector opened up quite quickly, if you will.

238
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:56,370
Of course, calorie dense foods and then that culture.

239
00:30:56,740 --> 00:31:01,270
So they like we have 2 hours, so to speak.

240
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:09,830
Yeah, I don't know that important to us.

241
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:17,720
Like if you can get get these foods like pretty quick.

242
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:30,490
In the absence of media, the media is like shea butter,

243
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:44,470
and I like to think that they can produce as much grades and stuff because there are some outside investors.

244
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:52,659
It is largely agriculture raising a lot of questions,

245
00:31:52,660 --> 00:32:05,970
which I have to say I'm trying to figure out our vaccination and also the Indian Health Service of IS.

246
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:23,760
You know, we started speaking to people at the restaurant in New York, but I have a lot of support from society.

247
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:43,910
And so it's no wonder that basically aligns with exactly how we they're just not meeting audiences right now.

248
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:47,850
I think that's all we need for this kind of work.

249
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:59,560
And I just want to get together in your meetings, and I think some of us have a lot of insecurities.

250
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:13,090
Mostly we're just having a hard time with what has happened.

251
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:18,460
I think there's like buckets of sprinklers.

252
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:31,390
Just one day you have this like set setting where you're like, Let's all go out and do something together.

253
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:42,670
We are just all you can dropped to the thousands of times instead of saying yes but much.

254
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:55,239
But I think that someone is going to be more like that.

255
00:33:55,240 --> 00:34:00,150
And that's just like the drought.

256
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:14,830
Oh yeah, we're a little more commonly used and I think that's right.

257
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:32,710
Yeah, well, it's just so much caused by smoking is like, I just like mainstream.

258
00:34:34,410 --> 00:34:38,559
I know.

259
00:34:38,560 --> 00:35:04,300
It's like, it's like really easy to use looking like, what have you got?

260
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:18,820
Something like what I did when I was like I was like,

261
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:50,950
I'm never going to be like I was going to be like, oh, yeah, something like riding my bike like this.

262
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:56,940
I thought it was terrible.

263
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:09,970
And they said like, I think just so I guess I'm not sure about that.

264
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:21,000
You that I was just trying to believe that.

265
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:33,660
At least I don't think it directly connects to what I'm saying.

266
00:36:34,560 --> 00:37:06,510
You know, you've got to have something like something fresh because somebody may be here or, you know.

267
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:20,370
Oh, yeah, I think when that happens and then you get out there, you know, and just have.

268
00:37:23,910 --> 00:38:25,870
I think I would want to be like your audience and all the things like these people who've been through a lot of hundred 75.

269
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:49,020
That's how I feel that, you know, there's a helping hand maybe.

270
00:38:49,020 --> 00:39:01,760
I think it was like, oh, yeah, sure.

271
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:07,870
On some level, yeah.

272
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:13,580
I'm so sorry.

273
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:25,190
Yeah, I think it's awesome.

274
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:43,860
But this is a pretty you know, there's a lot of props and expression throughout this.

275
00:39:46,010 --> 00:40:00,350
Like, you know, you hear these things go, Hey, I was interested in what they said.

276
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:09,540
I guess there's a big crisis.

277
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:29,460
You guys are a large group of maybe not a few seconds.

278
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:35,490
Exactly. So they're making a lot of money?

279
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:52,420
Yeah, definitely. I mean, I just think that like a lot of we don't sound.

280
00:40:52,470 --> 00:41:00,430
But there are things going on in this country, you know?

281
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:10,540
How do I do that?

282
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:18,620
I mean, what it needs are older, like if they have like a connection, but like, you know, just finally, I can't tell you.

283
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:26,480
Sit down. I take it all back.

284
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:33,790
No concerns. Hang on. How are you doing?

285
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:39,540
It's all good. What's the difference between questions? So what else would make it interesting?

286
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:45,360
I don't always agree.

287
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:59,870
I mean, I'm so excited to see my family, to see them brace themselves for the first time.

288
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:15,110
Okay. So you know how to ride the sidewalks like these.

289
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:19,370
So I know how you want to find a halfway.

290
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:33,700
Halfway. Here right now.

291
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:41,830
I want this to work out. I love this idea.

292
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:54,750
So there's this economic stimulus. I know. Surface to air report.

293
00:42:55,030 --> 00:43:34,290
So is there a layperson that's also saying how could we see so much revenue again, like every year we automatically come right back?

294
00:43:35,950 --> 00:44:15,060
Yes. I don't see that happening all the time in a place like, hey, I got like this version of this story is what sounds like a good one.

295
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:22,470
That doesn't seem like an Arab advance.

296
00:44:24,430 --> 00:45:18,420
I think that was nice. And I don't think I was crazy about how I think I think I have to say this is nice.

297
00:45:18,970 --> 00:45:31,690
And I was trying to say.

298
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:39,749
Yes, that's right.

299
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:45,840
I mean, all of the talking to our party time, the largest one is China.

300
00:45:45,840 --> 00:46:05,380
That's something that's we're doing things like what I would call my immediate response.

301
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:58,650
Apparently, it's like, oh, I we're just going to add in part to how we balance you, which of course is always connected.

302
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:12,680
We don't like to do that.

303
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:24,180
And I think the idea that you're trying to be or you can try to position yourself.

304
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:42,820
You know, we have our man and we have my brother and sister.

305
00:47:44,300 --> 00:48:04,080
But it's hard for me, to be honest, if everyone is starting to know what's going to be the diversity of this question.

306
00:48:05,770 --> 00:48:43,610
Because if he is only talking about 311 and the two things like what kind of hero is very likely that it's not necessary?

307
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:48,970
It's possible that they're not going to do that.

308
00:48:50,910 --> 00:49:00,540
We were thinking that things would come out.

309
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:14,780
That's why we have to talk about it.

310
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:33,630
If the 38 was his or her husband, you know, I'm never going to read that.

311
00:49:33,630 --> 00:49:55,610
You're looking at that. And it's not easy to see how, you know, I know what you're thinking when I said you wanted to be here.

312
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:31,200
Now, you were you were sort of like, oh, I know, I like talking to you, but I think this does a pretty good.

313
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:44,610
Yeah, that's all. So what did you think when you found out?

314
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:49,240
I guess I was like, Think?

315
00:50:57,700 --> 00:51:00,620
No, I wasn't very well.

316
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:10,900
Thank you very much for working on your exercise and helping things around and design and what fallacies you guys came up with,

317
00:51:10,910 --> 00:51:15,230
if there was anything interesting that you found, any feedback loops, etc.

318
00:51:15,830 --> 00:51:21,680
So let's start with the United States. I mean, I love you guys, but peace and quiet.

319
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:27,930
Well, we would just simply thank you. Oh, my God.

320
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:33,270
So he has the United States undernutrition. And as you can see, it's pretty complicated.

321
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:43,920
I guess we kind of organize what you eat a little bit. So I would just hop right beside of tasks like transportation barriers and living in rural

322
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:49,440
areas are going down along the socioeconomic status and that leads to a lot of that.

323
00:51:50,070 --> 00:51:57,440
We didn't have like a feedback loop with undernutrition leading to like lack of energy and poor health and least like the inability.

324
00:51:58,620 --> 00:52:04,830
And then attacks can lead to poverty, inability to generate income, which leads back to undernutrition.

325
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:13,530
So that was like feedback loops we had, we also had behind social media mental health line over on the left side.

326
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:20,249
So we talked about like social media influencing like what an ideal body type looks like.

327
00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:26,380
And that can influence eating disorders which raise undernutrition, which can in turn fuel eating disorders.

328
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:31,290
So that's also an interesting specific reasoning we had.

329
00:52:31,290 --> 00:52:41,130
And then we also had kind of the poor education about nutrition and isolated poverty and also like the lack of healthy food programs in schools.

330
00:52:41,910 --> 00:52:49,649
And then some of the policies we came up with was protecting like paid lunch time at work because we talked about it in our group a little bit.

331
00:52:49,650 --> 00:52:58,070
And a lot of us work in cases where lunchtime work isn't paid or is like very short and actually undernutrition and also poor eating habits.

332
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:04,020
Like if you have to show your food in 30 minutes and then we talk about

333
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:10,889
incentivizing fresh food stores in like poor zip codes to help deal with like food

334
00:53:10,890 --> 00:53:16,320
deserts and then using schools as platforms to educate students on nutrition to

335
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:22,500
kind of intervene in the whole like poverty and poor education sort of category.

336
00:53:22,890 --> 00:53:32,940
And then to deal with the social media and mental health impacts we talked about like parents monitoring social media use and also maybe I mean,

337
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:41,729
this is hard to regulate, but looking at the types of messages that are out there for kids on social media and trying to influence those or at

338
00:53:41,730 --> 00:53:50,460
least educating them about what those messages mean and how to kind of deal with the messaging that is coming from that.

339
00:53:53,210 --> 00:53:56,220
Well done. Well done. Great job.

340
00:53:56,850 --> 00:54:01,890
One thing I want you guys to keep in mind as you representing and right are there particular are three lines

341
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:06,950
as we talk about like different countries facing the same and human nutrition and also what's different.

342
00:54:06,970 --> 00:54:12,120
Right. So like the social media is really confusing and that's causing undernutrition

343
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:16,889
and people having eating disorders and getting rich foods and things like that.

344
00:54:16,890 --> 00:54:22,830
But like, is that the issue, for example, in Mali, may I be thinking about like why role hungry?

345
00:54:24,390 --> 00:54:28,500
Like how like these things or lack or difference free money.

346
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:38,339
Okay, so we had the United States but overweight and we were just kind of talking about some of like the main

347
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:44,100
things that are contributing to overweight is like the U.S. supermarket portion sizes or you know,

348
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:54,330
also there are a lot of like places that just aren't walkable, are getting food and exercise in general.

349
00:54:54,480 --> 00:55:01,890
And then also the for food, if you're out with kitchens or something like that, you can't really get the same.

350
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:09,090
Foods like healthy food, and you're getting food that you're not perishable.

351
00:55:09,490 --> 00:55:11,640
It's not good for you that you can last a long time.

352
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:24,200
To a magazine goes to being overweight and then it just kind of like a vicious cycle because if you're overweight, you can't work.

353
00:55:24,210 --> 00:55:29,430
If you have like some sort of disease, like obesity or like diabetes.

354
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:40,730
And then since you can't work, you're so poverty is in museums and you can't cook a food for one of those houses that on began.

355
00:55:41,010 --> 00:55:47,190
As you said, many schools provide healthy lunches and that also does education because it's kind of starts

356
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:54,570
when you're young so that you can like and so that habits and the importance of eating healthy.

357
00:55:55,810 --> 00:56:09,880
Two kids. So and like, don't underestimate how messed up the funding application is in school meals.

358
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:13,920
It's really cool and a lot of lobbying around that too.

359
00:56:13,930 --> 00:56:20,680
So food producers like to lobby to try and make sure that their stops on the menu.

360
00:56:21,850 --> 00:56:29,739
So it like a comprehensive policy issue. And then also I think the money is very important so that the education,

361
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:35,080
the messaging and all of that stuff is a part of this, but also follow the money too.

362
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:47,229
I think that's really key, right? So overall, we had India under nutrition and we basically started from under nutrition.

363
00:56:47,230 --> 00:56:56,380
And then that leads to reduced growth and development and reduced productivity and that just feeds back into lack of infrastructure in India.

364
00:56:56,680 --> 00:57:02,170
And that goes back to how many people not being able to properly build an infrastructure.

365
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:07,930
And that also can contribute to access to world vision, water and abilities.

366
00:57:07,990 --> 00:57:14,920
Our food and the unstable climate conditions also contribute to the lack of infrastructure with poor sanitation,

367
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:19,090
infectious diseases stemming from the poor sanitation and all of that.

368
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:23,800
The economic inequality, poverty and low purchasing power.

369
00:57:25,630 --> 00:57:30,190
Some policy interventions we love that were in the amul scheme, the National Food Security Mission,

370
00:57:30,190 --> 00:57:41,510
and one that we found an article in 2013 that discussed the $106 million money initiative called the Integrated Child Development Services that's

371
00:57:41,530 --> 00:57:51,640
funded by the World Bank and had disclosed how some of the malnutrition and breastfeeding in young babies and young children and their eating habits.

372
00:57:53,320 --> 00:58:00,129
And also we just really focused on strengthening basic infrastructure and that would also increase job opportunities.

373
00:58:00,130 --> 00:58:03,370
And people are raising income as well.

374
00:58:05,870 --> 00:58:10,530
Great. Well, then I actually worked with IBM as an engineer.

375
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:16,670
And one of the things to consider a big issue in India is like coordination across all of the different,

376
00:58:16,670 --> 00:58:19,910
because there's so many people working on an interesting issue,

377
00:58:20,090 --> 00:58:24,700
but like what's happening at the national level and coordinate with what's happening on the state level,

378
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:33,200
what is that coordinating what's happening at the time? Because I know that a lot less and then a lot of the gaps as well because targeting the same

379
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:41,830
populations over and over and over again and not like the government response or so technology so well,

380
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:49,750
but it's in line with the other two groups. If you're dealing with a big federal country, country with a lot of diversity,

381
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:55,070
all the different local and state governments, you're going to have that problem, but also a cool back.

382
00:58:55,370 --> 00:58:59,870
Notice how to the focus on events and not so much on maternal health.

383
00:59:00,290 --> 00:59:05,089
So hopefully you remember me talking about in the previous class, I think global health.

384
00:59:05,090 --> 00:59:10,249
There's also that problem of mothers versus body and infant health.

385
00:59:10,250 --> 00:59:16,250
And where do you draw the lines of the boundaries of your program and where who the funding can go to?

386
00:59:16,550 --> 00:59:28,190
The problem is problematic. So took it in the microscope because that's what he thinks can affect you and then you can go to the back.

387
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:37,759
Yeah, sure. That's the way it is.

388
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:46,820
And we're also told some chapters, not very much start with lot of these kinds of things.

389
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:51,469
So those are our main two focuses on sedentary lifestyle can also be called side

390
00:59:51,470 --> 00:59:54,860
of increase motorized transport as well as an increased use of technology.

391
00:59:56,420 --> 01:00:04,040
We also looked at how older populations tend to get less flat in the globe due to physical working entity with younger people.

392
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:07,400
And then like sort of that's sort of goes both ways.

393
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:17,810
You know what obesity causes? We put down cardiovascular disease as well as neurologic with type two diabetes and a lower life expectancy in general.

394
01:00:18,910 --> 01:00:27,430
Going over to processed foods. One of our main sources, I guess, is that rich Western countries are selling processed foods to India,

395
01:00:27,430 --> 01:00:32,649
which leads to an increase in advertising for foods leading to increased consumption.

396
01:00:32,650 --> 01:00:37,540
And then as more people buy more Western countries myself, so that was one of our positive feedback loops.

397
01:00:38,230 --> 01:00:44,770
And then looking at interventions which are great Post-it notes, we wanted to focus on of these interventions for children.

398
01:00:45,130 --> 01:00:47,770
So increasing health, education, getting them free playtime,

399
01:00:47,770 --> 01:00:53,450
sort of introducing exercise and education into their school time and then also increased education for

400
01:00:53,470 --> 01:01:00,760
general population with either primary care providers or general practitioners with processed foods.

401
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:10,510
We thought about supporting local farms so that they have fruits and vegetables and they're also supporting local economies with sedentary lifestyles.

402
01:01:10,510 --> 01:01:15,190
We're looking at encouraging untraditional practices such as yoga, meditation and dance,

403
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:20,740
using media to spread awareness and campaigns for healthy and active lifestyles.

404
01:01:24,550 --> 01:01:31,300
One element. One thing I want to point out that you guys have committed a fine is that increases of operations,

405
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:36,340
both in terms of calls in India, which obviously are an input into obesity.

406
01:01:36,340 --> 01:01:42,249
But on the other side, motorized transport is also leading to really high levels of carbon emissions in India,

407
01:01:42,250 --> 01:01:46,920
which is also willing to address health restrictions like that.

408
01:01:46,970 --> 01:01:54,730
So think about like. So like maybe that is an area to target with the policy interventions that might have multiple outcomes for home.

409
01:01:55,960 --> 01:02:02,340
Yeah, there's many ways to link these. So you can see how this content might be helpful to identify those goals.

410
01:02:04,210 --> 01:02:07,360
Yes, I think positive.

411
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:13,180
I think. Yeah.

412
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:18,130
All right. So we had Somalia and under-nutrition.

413
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:22,500
Let's see. So the biggest things we identified in our system is bad.

414
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:26,320
I know we didn't do it like the rest of you, so it's a lot harder to read. I apologize.

415
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:27,820
And it's my handwriting. Goodness.

416
01:02:29,050 --> 01:02:35,230
We have civil wars of the upper left, which is leading to a lack of farm workers, also poor distribution of resources.

417
01:02:36,310 --> 01:02:43,990
And that whole top section basically along with this, is focused on crop access and low crop yields, which leads to nutrition.

418
01:02:43,990 --> 01:02:52,480
In Somalia. We found that the war in Ukraine is leading to a lack of crops imported because a lot of their wheat actually gets imported from.

419
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:57,610
From the warriors and yeah. That's wheat more under nutrition.

420
01:02:58,270 --> 01:03:01,960
Drought in the upper right is just the biggest natural disaster.

421
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:09,580
And this leading to increased locust populations, which leads to low crop yield as well as directly means low crop yield and nutrition.

422
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:17,380
And we have general economic activity, lack of production of the left and then of lack of quality health care in the lower left.

423
01:03:18,670 --> 01:03:23,230
Lower right, we have a bit of basically maternal health focus.

424
01:03:23,860 --> 01:03:33,370
It is a result of and a cause of nutrition. Some of the policy solutions we identified and looked at were basically focused around water,

425
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:39,940
a lot of them like desalination plants, because Somalia is bordered by an ocean.

426
01:03:39,940 --> 01:03:46,090
So like they have a lot of water that they can access, but obviously it's ocean water, so it's not drinkable or usable for crops as it stands.

427
01:03:46,450 --> 01:03:54,540
So yeah, we focused on that possibly improving infrastructure in the country to move water throughout the country and move water from elsewhere.

428
01:03:54,550 --> 01:03:59,950
There are some fresh, fresh water bodies to the left over like near Kenya.

429
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:06,550
And so we're thinking possibly this could be sources of water moving into the country and then employing

430
01:04:06,550 --> 01:04:12,550
the U.N. to find other sources of wheat to ship into Somalia and working on trade in that regard.

431
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:19,860
But yeah, yeah. And like Somalia is very interesting because a lot of the reasons for an invasion in Somalia,

432
01:04:20,890 --> 01:04:26,660
like the wars are like they're important for human relations in the country,

433
01:04:26,710 --> 01:04:31,450
is the fact that they don't have a national government that's it's in Somalia.

434
01:04:31,510 --> 01:04:37,870
It's a big issue. So like, how do you allocate resources and it's not easy for them to be their slaves.

435
01:04:38,830 --> 01:04:44,930
Yeah, I mean, they should always be the source of, of the intervention that you know.

436
01:04:46,990 --> 01:04:59,170
Well then I so we did, we did Tonga and we got a little caught up in circles first.

437
01:04:59,170 --> 01:05:08,530
So we kind of turned in the last minute because, you know, Tonga is a really tiny little island in the middle of nowhere.

438
01:05:09,420 --> 01:05:14,379
And so colonialism kind of, I think was probably the start of everything,

439
01:05:14,380 --> 01:05:19,450
which led to a lot of rejection of cultural natural foods, which, you know, made them, you know,

440
01:05:19,450 --> 01:05:23,050
more expensive domestically as domestic vegetables and that sort of thing,

441
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:36,069
which led a lot of importation of processed foods and also led to the misconception just through advertising and education,

442
01:05:36,070 --> 01:05:42,730
that foreign foods were superior in their domestic food were inferior, which kind of led to a dependance on imported foods,

443
01:05:43,330 --> 01:05:49,809
which led to an overconsumption of processed foods which led to or health outcomes, disease number one,

444
01:05:49,810 --> 01:05:56,709
cause of disease which increased costs of expensive health care, which led to a lot more poverty.

445
01:05:56,710 --> 01:06:04,900
And so 20% of the folks that live in Congress are below the poverty line, which also leads to insecurity,

446
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:11,740
because now they can't afford the more expensive and healthier domestic foods which increases their reliance,

447
01:06:11,740 --> 01:06:22,750
which you can see that kind of downward spiral circle. And so that to a lot of people to be overweight and all these bad conditions associated with.

448
01:06:23,670 --> 01:06:33,990
And at the same time you've got urbanization, which has led to decreases in activity of sedentary lifestyles, which also increased or you awake.

449
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:42,310
So the policy edge of the interventions that we came up with, one was, you know, education about how to maintain a more healthy lifestyle.

450
01:06:43,050 --> 01:06:45,030
Invasive urbanization and things like that.

451
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:54,570
Also education on maintaining a proper diet and more focus on production of domestic goods so that they're not

452
01:06:54,570 --> 01:06:59,790
reliant on foreign products that have to be imported and become very expensive and are oftentimes very processed.

453
01:07:01,230 --> 01:07:05,020
Well, then the timing is really interesting because the issue,

454
01:07:05,070 --> 01:07:13,020
a big issue here is the effects of colonialism on the behaviors of the population there, which is like very negative effects.

455
01:07:13,290 --> 01:07:21,540
One of the interesting interventions that Australia is actually trying in solving to address this is they have a like a reality TV show,

456
01:07:21,810 --> 01:07:29,580
but it's focused on cooking like natural, like original, like Congolese cuisine and like making that cool again.

457
01:07:29,580 --> 01:07:33,690
So like amateur comes to like come on TV and they cook like traditional food as

458
01:07:33,690 --> 01:07:38,310
opposed to maybe like cool and people and make it because you're watching TV like,

459
01:07:38,650 --> 01:07:48,660
like one way or like even intervention on health or, or entertaining in the kitchen.

460
01:07:48,660 --> 01:07:54,360
I like it. Yeah. Down. And then we're very quickly out of time.

461
01:07:54,360 --> 01:08:06,420
So maybe just like kind of like hit your policy points and the feedback that we think that we are really overweight.

462
01:08:06,580 --> 01:08:14,190
On London, 85% of the population in Mongolia is overweight, which is one of the highest in Asia.

463
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:23,280
A few of the main positive moves into that problem are the main one is for urban harmonization.

464
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:32,880
45% live in the capital city, lack of quality foods, poor nutrition and extremely high alcohol and tobacco use.

465
01:08:33,300 --> 01:08:36,630
So we identified a few key policy interventions.

466
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:46,800
One is promoting investments in primary care for screening for non-communicable diseases, the expansion of production of produce and healthy foods.

467
01:08:47,460 --> 01:08:54,780
We have a National SALT strategy to reduce the amount of salt in foods and lower fat content.

468
01:08:55,170 --> 01:08:58,319
And then we had a few interventions for alcohol and tobacco use.

469
01:08:58,320 --> 01:09:05,820
So increasing taxes, banning advertising and banning smoking in public places like that.

470
01:09:05,910 --> 01:09:13,830
And another issue in Mongolia, which was and there was a lot of the population of lawyers, nomadic.

471
01:09:13,860 --> 01:09:24,680
So like, what does that do to like your food and like maybe you want to like process easier to travel with writers in place and oh, I like that.

472
01:09:25,890 --> 01:09:32,940
I forgot. I think these guys, Michelle Dockery, the next time we do this, we'll start this site.

473
01:09:32,940 --> 01:09:41,579
And so one time I have yeah, oh, I'll try to make this brief, but there's a lot of very complex, intertwined issues.

474
01:09:41,580 --> 01:09:47,940
So we have very little and a lot of it is very a lot of the cost of undernutrition are very upstream.

475
01:09:47,940 --> 01:09:53,700
It kind of starts with the fact that there's an economic crisis that leads to high food prices.

476
01:09:54,060 --> 01:10:00,629
And on top of that, you know, their import export trade policy and that kind of stuff leads to increased exports

477
01:10:00,630 --> 01:10:05,850
of food and like lower availability of food resources for the domestic community.

478
01:10:05,850 --> 01:10:14,160
And that's it's back to shifts in power that cut programing that allows for food access in little areas.

479
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:19,710
There's also a really disparate distribution of wealth in Brazil.

480
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:27,930
All of this leads to poor food access, which leads to undernutrition on the other side of it, global warming and the hot climate in Brazil.

481
01:10:28,740 --> 01:10:33,840
It leads to lower appetite, increased alcohol intake, one motivation to kind of do things.

482
01:10:34,890 --> 01:10:36,870
And there's also rapid urbanization.

483
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:43,770
So that causes a lot of people to move to cities and then there's not enough housing or infrastructure to kind of hold them there.

484
01:10:43,770 --> 01:10:49,900
And that leads to poor sanitation, which also contributes. So, yes, I think.

485
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:58,660
We should read it. Thank you so much for posting this.

486
01:10:59,170 --> 01:11:03,130
And I just want you to take away from this. This is a way of thinking.

487
01:11:03,550 --> 01:11:07,480
It's a way of organizing complexity. That's why it's valuable to me.

488
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:14,260
And I hope that by understanding other countries, it can help you reflect through on the communities or places in the United States.

489
01:11:16,150 --> 01:11:19,420
You know, you guys, if you get the phones, the travel agency.

490
01:11:33,870 --> 01:11:37,800
Tiny Parsons. Charlie, congrats.
