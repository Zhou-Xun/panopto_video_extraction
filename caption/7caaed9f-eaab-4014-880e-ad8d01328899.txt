1
00:00:00,039 --> 00:00:18,309
Frederique Laubepin: All right, um I think we may still have more people join, but um I don't want to wait too long, so we're gonna we're going to get started, my name is Frederick i'm the assistant director of instructional services and instructional designer here at the school of public health.

2
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:35,649
Frederique Laubepin: The first thing that we're going to use a sort of an icebreaker is i'm putting the link in the chat i'd like you to indicate what worries you or what causes you anxiety.

3
00:00:35,649 --> 00:00:49,659

Frederique Laubepin: Little green plus side sign to add stickers to the board.

6
00:01:09,639 --> 00:01:18,069
Frederique Laubepin: And then, if anything, that's getting posted there resonates with you, you can also upload that.

7
00:01:18,069 --> 00:01:40,239
Frederique Laubepin: that particular point.

8
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:57,309
Frederique Laubepin: Alright, so yeah we have a lot of very legitimate concerns or worries there definitely you know balancing your job as a dsi with your own school work something that's.

9
00:01:57,309 --> 00:02:11,079
Frederique Laubepin: very valid and and understandable teaching can can take a lot of can take a lot of time and grading equal equally and fairly that's a that's a very good, very good thing to be concerned about.

10
00:02:11,079 --> 00:02:16,749
Frederique Laubepin: So I don't know that we'll talk too much about this today, but.

11
00:02:16,749 --> 00:02:27,159
Frederique Laubepin: you're always welcome to reach out to us for help and support on anything that's teaching related.

12
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:32,829
Frederique Laubepin: You know, some Internet connectivity definitely For those of you teaching remotely.

13
00:02:32,829 --> 00:02:39,219
Frederique Laubepin: that's that can be a big thing time management.

14
00:02:39,219 --> 00:02:42,879
Frederique Laubepin: And yes, that's a you know not.

15
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:46,089
Frederique Laubepin: feeling like you may not have an immediate.

16
00:02:46,089 --> 00:02:52,149
Frederique Laubepin: answer to students questions is also a common.

17
00:02:52,149 --> 00:03:03,819
Frederique Laubepin: A common concern or worry about teaching, especially for people who may not have a lot of teaching experience right so.

18
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:07,929
Frederique Laubepin: So you know this this exercise is.

19
00:03:07,929 --> 00:03:12,009
Frederique Laubepin: meant to unearth some of these.

20
00:03:12,009 --> 00:03:27,819
Frederique Laubepin: worries and anxieties and also to show you that you're not alone in having these concerns that you know they're usually widely shared among.

21
00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:30,069
Frederique Laubepin: among your peers.

22
00:03:30,069 --> 00:15:59,487
Frederique Laubepin: So excellent so i'm going to share my screen and we're gonna do a little bit of presenting.

23
00:03:43,059 --> 00:03:51,969
Frederique Laubepin: One alright, so today the session is about resilience teaching and we'll talk a little bit about what that means.

24
00:03:51,969 --> 00:04:01,029
Frederique Laubepin: We only have an hour so i'm going to apologize right off the BAT because we're not going to have a lot of time to get into a lot of details about.

25
00:04:01,029 --> 00:04:05,349
Frederique Laubepin: What i'm you know what i'm going to talk to you about.

26
00:04:05,349 --> 00:04:18,249
Frederique Laubepin: Fortunately, we have two more sessions on canvas and on teaching in zoom there are tomorrow, so I would encourage you to if you haven't already to sign up for those sessions.

27
00:04:18,249 --> 00:04:28,539
Frederique Laubepin: And in those sessions you'll get a lot more detail on at least, these two these two topics, so we already did the icebreaker.

28
00:04:28,539 --> 00:04:43,149
Frederique Laubepin: The goal for this session is to help you prepare for falling winter courses for teaching them and we're going to do this by exploring how to use the CDC trauma informed approach.

29
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:54,699
Frederique Laubepin: To build a resilient teaching mindset and to support students needs, so what and since there aren't that many of us on the.

30
00:04:54,699 --> 00:05:06,579
Frederique Laubepin: You know, in the meeting today, maybe we can just do this verbally, as opposed to putting this in the chat What would you say is different about teaching during a pandemic, if anything.

31
00:05:06,579 --> 00:05:08,559
Abby Loe-Biostat 521: I think, with.

32
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:16,809
Abby Loe-Biostat 521: Like the in person activities seem to matter, a lot more to students and they seem to be like really enjoy those a lot.

33
00:05:16,809 --> 00:05:22,659
Frederique Laubepin: Yes, there's definitely you know, so it was always something that the students liked, but there's.

34
00:05:22,659 --> 00:05:41,709
Frederique Laubepin: there's a greater need for these in person activities now because I think we've you know we felt deprived in so many ways, and so this is something that people are really craving absolutely.

35
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:47,829
Frederique Laubepin: Anything else that's different about teaching during the pandemic.

36
00:05:47,829 --> 00:05:58,209
Isabel Gomez (BIOSTAT 501): I think it's more difficult to gauge how much a student is understanding something because you're not there with them and sometimes.

37
00:05:58,209 --> 00:06:05,049
Isabel Gomez (BIOSTAT 501): they're not asking the questions.

38
00:06:05,049 --> 00:06:13,449
Frederique Laubepin: Yes, absolutely and it's also a lot harder for instructors to sort of.

39
00:06:13,449 --> 00:06:30,579
Frederique Laubepin: Have a finger on the pulse of the class and and notice if somebody dropping out right if if somebody is kind of like feeding into the into the background so whether it's you know when you're teaching let's aim zooms and sort of you're going to be teaching remotely.

40
00:06:30,579 --> 00:06:43,509
Frederique Laubepin: You know, and you know you're okay with your cameras off right now right, but if I were teaching some content I wouldn't be able to you know I am not able to gauge your your responses to what i'm saying.

41
00:06:43,509 --> 00:06:47,439
Frederique Laubepin: You know, some people become very, very silent.

42
00:06:47,439 --> 00:07:02,469
Frederique Laubepin: In in these circumstances, and so it's a lot harder to gauge if you know you still have the class with you, if people are understanding to the level to the degree to which you want them to be understanding the content.

43
00:07:02,469 --> 00:07:16,149
Frederique Laubepin: So that's definitely a challenge and something that we need to keep in mind, so that we can teach effectively and we can support the students effectively as well.

44
00:07:16,149 --> 00:07:21,189
Frederique Laubepin: Anything else that comes to mind about teaching during a pandemic.

45
00:07:21,189 --> 00:07:42,309
Abby Loe-Biostat 521: I think there's also like a lot of trauma and uncertainty and, like so many people have just had like social upheaval like people have been dying, so I think understanding, like the place that students are coming from mentally that way too.

46
00:07:42,309 --> 00:07:51,669
Frederique Laubepin: Absolutely there's a lot of there's a lot of trauma from you know experiencing.

47
00:07:51,669 --> 00:07:57,909
Frederique Laubepin: deaths in in your in your circles or or serious illness.

48
00:07:57,909 --> 00:08:00,849
Frederique Laubepin: You know, having a life that's been.

49
00:08:00,849 --> 00:08:04,359
Frederique Laubepin: offended by economic.

50
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:11,739
Frederique Laubepin: You know, a people on this, you know there's there's a lot of.

51
00:08:11,739 --> 00:08:18,009
Frederique Laubepin: There are a lot of things that we've been exposed to that have a very.

52
00:08:18,009 --> 00:08:25,629
Frederique Laubepin: tangible effect on our ability to learn effectively, for example, or to function effectively.

53
00:08:25,629 --> 00:08:36,849
Frederique Laubepin: And that's that's something that, as instructors, we have to keep in mind there's also you know people are way more anxious, you know sort of our ability.

54
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:46,869
Frederique Laubepin: or mental health is not what it used to be prior to the pandemic there's a lot of anxiety that we have to you know we're all dealing with.

55
00:08:46,869 --> 00:09:01,839
Frederique Laubepin: And that carries over into into the classroom as well, so you might find that students are get overly anxious about things that they would not have been anxious about before, for example.

56
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:12,189
Frederique Laubepin: Anything else you'd like to bring up about what's different about teaching during a pandemic.

57
00:09:12,189 --> 00:09:22,389
Nicky Wakim (Biostat 521): A little more centered around the teacher themselves it's hard to create a work life balance, when you don't quote unquote leave the office.

58
00:09:22,389 --> 00:09:25,149
Nicky Wakim (Biostat 521): So you can easily.

59
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:37,689
Nicky Wakim (Biostat 521): Just that barrier, even though most things are already on our technology that we bring home with us, you know it's no longer closing the door locking your office and leaving for the day.

60
00:09:37,689 --> 00:09:49,719
Frederique Laubepin: yep and I was just a few minutes before the session started, I was actually having this exact conversation with a colleague and now back in my office at the school of public health.

61
00:09:49,719 --> 00:10:02,739
Frederique Laubepin: But you know, maintaining a good work life balance, while working from home is is definitely challenging and we can talk a little bit about.

62
00:10:02,739 --> 00:10:23,499
Frederique Laubepin: You know why setting proper expectations is is good, and that includes you know getting people to understand that you know you may not respond to emails at 1am you know, on a Saturday night, for example, that you know it's okay to have.

63
00:10:23,499 --> 00:10:29,229
Frederique Laubepin: Specific hours, this is specific work hours so.

64
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:38,349
Frederique Laubepin: You know this question of what's different about teaching during a pandemic, the answer is really you know, on some level, nothing is different about teaching.

65
00:10:38,349 --> 00:10:48,879
Frederique Laubepin: During a pandemic, in the sense that every best practice that applied pre pandemic, we should still and in and.

66
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:54,519
Frederique Laubepin: We should still apply now and there's even more importance on applying these best practices.

67
00:10:54,519 --> 00:11:02,139
Frederique Laubepin: But the, the answer is also everything is different different about teaching during a pandemic right and for the reasons that we.

68
00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:14,379
Frederique Laubepin: We just covered a little bit so um you know students have have needs, and we, we need to do our best to address these needs.

69
00:11:14,379 --> 00:11:28,089
Frederique Laubepin: The way we, the best way for us to do this is by using student focused course design and teaching practices, and this will help us on in a few different ways.

70
00:11:28,089 --> 00:11:44,979
Frederique Laubepin: It will help us to support the students academic success and a big part of our job is to help them stay motivated, because these are challenging times and it's very easy for for people to become demotivated.

71
00:11:44,979 --> 00:11:49,449
Frederique Laubepin: So our job is to you know, help them stay on track.

72
00:11:49,449 --> 00:12:04,269
Frederique Laubepin: it's also to help them navigate through stressors and as well as building a peer network that can provide support so some of this happens in the classroom.

73
00:12:04,269 --> 00:12:11,169
Frederique Laubepin: As I mentioned the the framework that we're using is a framework that's.

74
00:12:11,169 --> 00:12:21,189
Frederique Laubepin: derived from the substance abuse in mental health archive some saw.

75
00:12:21,189 --> 00:12:27,999
Frederique Laubepin: framework for trauma informed care it's also on the CDC website.

76
00:12:27,999 --> 00:12:36,399
Frederique Laubepin: And I provided links to to both the website, the CDC website, as well as the Samsung.

77
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,149
Frederique Laubepin: brochure on trauma informed care.

78
00:12:40,149 --> 00:12:48,519
Frederique Laubepin: But basically, this is a framework that has six guiding principles that we can then.

79
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:51,519
Frederique Laubepin: apply to teaching.

80
00:12:51,519 --> 00:13:08,409
Frederique Laubepin: These six principles are safety trustworthiness and transparency peer support collaboration and mutuality empowerment voice and choice and attention to cultural, historical and gender issues, I would add.

81
00:13:08,409 --> 00:13:17,349
Frederique Laubepin: Especially, especially because it's been such a an important part of the conversation in the last year, and you know attention to.

82
00:13:17,349 --> 00:13:21,969
Frederique Laubepin: race Racism and Anti racism.

83
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:29,949
Frederique Laubepin: So i'm safety is pretty straightforward right, but when it comes to.

84
00:13:29,949 --> 00:13:45,759
Frederique Laubepin: To applying this to teaching, we need to think about it, both in terms of you know people's physical safety, as well as you know, psychological and emotional safety, so you know, be sure to to think of it.

85
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:47,649
Frederique Laubepin: Broadly.

86
00:13:47,649 --> 00:13:56,349
Frederique Laubepin: trustworthiness, and transparency is also pretty straightforward and we'll talk a little bit about how we can infuse some of this or where it intersects.

87
00:13:56,349 --> 00:14:15,009
Frederique Laubepin: with various aspects of the of our teaching or course design and peer support fairly straightforward collaboration and neutrality is something that we only we tend to only think about in.

88
00:14:15,009 --> 00:14:30,279
Frederique Laubepin: You know collaboration between students and mutuality between students, but the piece that we often forget, is the collaboration and mutuality between the instructor and the students right, so how can you build.

89
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:34,479
Frederique Laubepin: An environment in your classes.

90
00:14:34,479 --> 00:14:53,709
Frederique Laubepin: of collaboration between you and your students of mutuality between you and your students and permanent voice in troy's is you know pretty straightforward as well and i'm sure I don't need to introduce you to the need to.

91
00:14:53,709 --> 00:15:06,789
Frederique Laubepin: be mindful of cultural his historical race and gender issues so before we go any further.

92
00:15:06,789 --> 00:15:13,179
Frederique Laubepin: Give me just one, second, I have another.

93
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:18,999
Frederique Laubepin: More to share with you.

94
00:15:18,999 --> 00:15:34,269
Frederique Laubepin: And so i'm going to put this in the chat as well, and what i'd like you to do here is, you know it's the same principle you click on the little plus sign i'd like you to start thinking about the different ways.

95
00:15:34,269 --> 00:15:46,419
Frederique Laubepin: In which you can infuse i'd say safety into a course right, what does that look like when you're teaching or let's say collaboration and mutuality so feel free to you know pick.

96
00:15:46,419 --> 00:15:59,487
Frederique Laubepin: Whichever one you want to you want to start with, but i'd like you to start thinking about how this framework can be can be applied to various aspects of courses and teaching.

97
00:16:13,241 --> 00:16:20,561
Frederique Laubepin: Speaking of connectivity issues am at the school and yet my wireless network.

98
00:16:20,561 --> 00:16:25,031
Frederique Laubepin: Was was acting up so you never know.

99
00:16:25,031 --> 00:16:28,421
Frederique Laubepin: what's going to happen.

100
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:33,101
Frederique Laubepin: So you guys already brought up a lot of good.

101
00:16:33,101 --> 00:16:52,031
Frederique Laubepin: Good ideas on the board in terms of how to you know enhance safety or what that might mean and you're absolutely right that being vulnerable as an instructor on you know and making making that okay.

102
00:16:52,031 --> 00:17:08,081
Frederique Laubepin: For you, as well as for the students is a big part of establishing a safe environment where people feel free to ask quiet, you know, whatever question they have but also, I would encourage you to think.

103
00:17:08,081 --> 00:17:12,701
Frederique Laubepin: Also, about creating an environment where it's.

104
00:17:12,701 --> 00:17:23,141
Frederique Laubepin: Where it's safe to fail right for the students, where it's safe to admit that you, you know you you didn't answer something correctly, you are not.

105
00:17:23,141 --> 00:17:45,011
Frederique Laubepin: You know, happy you don't master the content enough to be able to solve the problem you know the the your classes should be an environment where it's safe for the students to fail in this way, so that they can learn what they need to learn, and then they can perform on the exam or whatever.

106
00:17:45,011 --> 00:17:49,181
Frederique Laubepin: high stakes assessment.

107
00:17:49,181 --> 00:18:00,671
Frederique Laubepin: You know there isn't a class where they actually have to perform well in will you know we can talk about a lot of other aspects of.

108
00:18:00,671 --> 00:18:23,291
Frederique Laubepin: A lot of other ways to bring in safety obviously there's also the physical safety, and you know, making sure that we follow the school and the university guidelines in terms of you know, being safe in the classroom wearing masks you know the school has a three foot distancing.

109
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:29,561
Frederique Laubepin: guideline for things so you know if you have students who.

110
00:18:29,561 --> 00:18:39,581
Frederique Laubepin: Have anxiety around you know sort of like their physical safety, making sure that we abide by the guidelines and make them feel physically safe in the classroom.

111
00:18:39,581 --> 00:18:44,111
Frederique Laubepin: Not just emotionally or psychologically safe.

112
00:18:44,111 --> 00:19:01,451
Frederique Laubepin: trust and transparency is hugely important and we'll talk a lot more about this in in some stuff i'm going to touch on next, but there are there are different ways of establishing trust and you've mentioned some of them on.

113
00:19:01,451 --> 00:19:13,871
Frederique Laubepin: On the board, just like there are many different ways of establishing transparency in your teaching and, and this is this is super important.

114
00:19:13,871 --> 00:19:17,321
Frederique Laubepin: I would definitely.

115
00:19:17,321 --> 00:19:22,541
Frederique Laubepin: You know, avoid the admit when you do not know the answer to your question.

116
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:29,081
Frederique Laubepin: This is absolutely Okay, you know you're not expected to be Google.

117
00:19:29,081 --> 00:19:37,901
Frederique Laubepin: And it's absolutely fine to say if some somebody asks you a question you don't know the answer to to say I don't know the answer to this question.

118
00:19:37,901 --> 00:19:49,121
Frederique Laubepin: But i'll look into it and i'll get back to you right by the time we meet next or i'll email you or you know, however, you want to handle this but.

119
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:55,961
Frederique Laubepin: It is absolutely fine to admit when you do not know the answer to a question.

120
00:19:55,961 --> 00:20:07,691
Frederique Laubepin: expectations and abiding by them, whether it's you know your expectations of the students or letting them know what expectations, they can have you.

121
00:20:07,691 --> 00:20:14,111
Frederique Laubepin: is also a really good way to establish trust in terms and transparency.

122
00:20:14,111 --> 00:20:22,661
Frederique Laubepin: You know, having sort of a you know, an open welcome you know welcoming.

123
00:20:22,661 --> 00:20:30,971
Frederique Laubepin: sort of approach to teaching where you know you're you're inviting people to come and talk to you.

124
00:20:30,971 --> 00:20:38,951
Frederique Laubepin: is also very good lots of ways to introduce peer support.

125
00:20:38,951 --> 00:20:43,781
Frederique Laubepin: And we'll talk a little bit about that as well.

126
00:20:43,781 --> 00:20:48,911
Frederique Laubepin: Collaboration and mutuality.

127
00:20:48,911 --> 00:20:56,141
Frederique Laubepin: Yes, again know being afraid of admitting when you don't know when you don't know, an answer.

128
00:20:56,141 --> 00:20:58,121
Frederique Laubepin: But.

129
00:20:58,121 --> 00:21:02,951
Frederique Laubepin: I would also encourage you to think about.

130
00:21:02,951 --> 00:21:04,871
Frederique Laubepin: What.

131
00:21:04,871 --> 00:21:09,371
Frederique Laubepin: What does collaboration with students look like when you're teaching.

132
00:21:09,371 --> 00:21:18,251
Frederique Laubepin: Right and you'll notice that some of these principles of the trauma informed framework.

133
00:21:18,251 --> 00:21:31,721
Frederique Laubepin: kind of go hand in hand right So if you work on collaboration and mutuality you're also kind of working on empowerment voice and choice right, so, in what ways can you invite voices in.

134
00:21:31,721 --> 00:21:47,771
Frederique Laubepin: In what ways can you give people choices right, how can you approach teaching more as a partnership, then as a hierarchical kind of relationship where the instructor is on top, and the students just follow.

135
00:21:47,771 --> 00:22:05,771
Frederique Laubepin: Quite So how can you, you know how can you empower people to be partners in in that learning teaching and learning relationship, and we can talk a little bit more about this culture reason gender.

136
00:22:05,771 --> 00:22:12,341
Frederique Laubepin: This you know we could teach many sessions on on just this but.

137
00:22:12,341 --> 00:22:20,441
Frederique Laubepin: You know this can go from you know learning how to pronounce people's names and use the correct pronouns.

138
00:22:20,441 --> 00:22:33,491
Frederique Laubepin: To an examination of the content that is taught in the course the kinds of readings that are assigned or their voices that are missing from those conversations and can you bring them in.

139
00:22:33,491 --> 00:22:45,191
Frederique Laubepin: You know other in class discussions or in additional readings, can you collaborate with the students to bring in their perspectives can you empower them.

140
00:22:45,191 --> 00:22:54,731
Frederique Laubepin: To you know, to add their voices to what what is being taught in your in your courses.

141
00:22:54,731 --> 00:23:00,671
Frederique Laubepin: I forgot to tell you that the last one questions and concerns was more for you to.

142
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:04,511
Frederique Laubepin: to let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

143
00:23:04,511 --> 00:23:13,691
Frederique Laubepin: You know, there are other people on my team who are in this meeting today and we're here to support you, so if there's anything that.

144
00:23:13,691 --> 00:23:22,841
Frederique Laubepin: That you need from us don't hesitate to let us know because we'll be happy to to try and provide it so whether it's you know technology support or.

145
00:23:22,841 --> 00:23:37,691
Frederique Laubepin: pedagogy or you know, whatever the case, might be so feel free to come back to the board, and you know it's going to stay up so if you want to share some questions or concerns feel free to to do that.

146
00:23:37,691 --> 00:23:47,261
Frederique Laubepin: Alright, so we're going to go back to the presentation.

147
00:23:47,261 --> 00:23:58,481
Frederique Laubepin: Okay, so, as I mentioned earlier, we only have one hour, so I selected for different aspects of the course and of teaching.

148
00:23:58,481 --> 00:24:00,611
Frederique Laubepin: where we can.

149
00:24:00,611 --> 00:24:07,301
Frederique Laubepin: We can make some changes that can you know we can apply this framework of trauma informed.

150
00:24:07,301 --> 00:24:17,411
Frederique Laubepin: care and we can actually with fairly little effort, have a significant impact on the students learning experiences.

151
00:24:17,411 --> 00:24:28,811
Frederique Laubepin: The very first area is the syllabus and I understand that you know, as do sighs you may not have any site and what syllabus the instructor rights and gives out to the students.

152
00:24:28,811 --> 00:24:44,951
Frederique Laubepin: I know, in some cases geoscience get to write their own syllabus for their own discussion sections or some version of the syllabus right that includes maybe some course policies or you know, whatever.

153
00:24:44,951 --> 00:24:56,921
Frederique Laubepin: But something for also for you to keep in mind is that you should think of yourselves as part of the teaching team, so you know, yes, you have to follow what your instructor.

154
00:24:56,921 --> 00:25:06,401
Frederique Laubepin: Is sort of a sort of tanya but but really it should be a collaboration between you and them, and if you see.

155
00:25:06,401 --> 00:25:09,071
Frederique Laubepin: If you see opportunities.

156
00:25:09,071 --> 00:25:29,801
Frederique Laubepin: To enhance what they're doing or to do some slight course corrections, you know if there's a way for you to sort of like a nudge them towards some of these principles, including for things like this little bit I would encourage you to to do so or to suggest that they reach out to us.

157
00:25:29,801 --> 00:25:34,601
Frederique Laubepin: And we'll be happy to to work with them as well.

158
00:25:34,601 --> 00:25:37,061
Frederique Laubepin: So.

159
00:25:37,061 --> 00:25:50,381
Frederique Laubepin: The way we typically think of the syllabus, which is the syllabus is a contract between the instructor and the students is fairly counterproductive when it comes to when it comes to one right establishes the.

160
00:25:50,381 --> 00:25:54,131
Frederique Laubepin: You know, learning as a transaction.

161
00:25:54,131 --> 00:26:01,391
Frederique Laubepin: Which is not really what it's about it tends to use very cold impersonal language, which we know.

162
00:26:01,391 --> 00:26:23,141
Frederique Laubepin: is not very effective in creating you know, an inclusive kind of environment in helping to bring students in it sort of establishes this relationship, this antagonistic right there's you know the instructor in the students are on two different sides as opposed to partners in.

163
00:26:23,141 --> 00:26:26,891
Frederique Laubepin: In the teaching and learning relationship.

164
00:26:26,891 --> 00:26:40,841
Frederique Laubepin: It kind of sets up implicit assumptions that students are are going to break the rules when you know, as opposed to an assumption that everybody does their best right and sometimes.

165
00:26:40,841 --> 00:26:49,661
Frederique Laubepin: For various reasons, we can't do our best, but the assumption is that everybody, you know sets out to do their best.

166
00:26:49,661 --> 00:26:59,171
Frederique Laubepin: You know this idea that you know if you don't do your best if you don't abide by the rules, then the consequences will be drastic now you're going to lose so many points you're going to.

167
00:26:59,171 --> 00:27:10,451
Frederique Laubepin: feel the you know the assignment, you know all these really terrible things are going to happen to you, it leaves no room for ambiguity and flexibility.

168
00:27:10,451 --> 00:27:19,691
Frederique Laubepin: it's very unilateral right the students have no say and the course happens at dumb not with them.

169
00:27:19,691 --> 00:27:22,541
Frederique Laubepin: And and.

170
00:27:22,541 --> 00:27:37,781
Frederique Laubepin: Something that also kind of important is that you know we spend a lot of time time students, would we expect of them and no time telling them what they can expect of us, so, if you look at the way we typically.

171
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:52,571
Frederique Laubepin: approach the syllabus and you go back to the So you can see that we're violating already a number of these principles of trauma informed care right.

172
00:27:52,571 --> 00:27:58,841
Frederique Laubepin: there's not that much transparency and trustworthiness.

173
00:27:58,841 --> 00:28:15,311
Frederique Laubepin: there's no collaboration and mutuality there's no one permanent voice and choice you know, safety, you know is questionable whether this type of syllabus establishes a you know sort of a safe.

174
00:28:15,311 --> 00:28:23,651
Frederique Laubepin: Environment for people, so this this way of thinking about the syllabus is not very, very useful.

175
00:28:23,651 --> 00:28:36,311
Frederique Laubepin: So, instead, I would encourage you to think of the syllabus as a partner roadmap for success right so it's the document that you give the students to explain to them how you're going to work together.

176
00:28:36,311 --> 00:28:49,781
Frederique Laubepin: To get them to a successful outcome in the class so whether that means you know they aced the exam or they they they learn what they need to learn and they're able to apply it.

177
00:28:49,781 --> 00:29:07,391
Frederique Laubepin: As you've said out in or as the instructor has set out in learning objectives for the course and there's there's a number of things that can be done in the syllabus that range from you know fairly small tweaks to extensive revisions.

178
00:29:07,391 --> 00:29:14,261
Frederique Laubepin: And you know, depending on, you know how much effort you want to you want to put in, you can you can do.

179
00:29:14,261 --> 00:29:19,571
Frederique Laubepin: You know a number of things in that on that spectrum.

180
00:29:19,571 --> 00:29:28,301
Frederique Laubepin: Like I said, you know, I understand that you may have no control over whatever syllabus the instructor is giving the students, you know for the the course as a whole.

181
00:29:28,301 --> 00:29:39,071
Frederique Laubepin: But you may want to hand out your own sort of like you know mini syllabus to your students that does some of these things.

182
00:29:39,071 --> 00:29:44,891
Frederique Laubepin: You know if they're not done in the in the main course syllabus.

183
00:29:44,891 --> 00:29:58,691
Frederique Laubepin: So you know some very small tweaks and you know very low hanging fruit is to use warm supportive language, so the typical syllabus is very impersonal it says, you know students will learn.

184
00:29:58,691 --> 00:30:15,041
Frederique Laubepin: You know the course shall address these topics and just by changing the language, a little bit by saying you will learn, we will do you're establishing you know, using warm language you're establishing a.

185
00:30:15,041 --> 00:30:24,011
Frederique Laubepin: A kind of environment that's already a lot more supportive and a lot less impersonal.

186
00:30:24,011 --> 00:30:32,771
Frederique Laubepin: Making sure your hold office hours in your invite students students to come, so I understand that you know, sometimes it's.

187
00:30:32,771 --> 00:30:49,661
Frederique Laubepin: You know, saying that you know you're going to have office hours on Thursdays, you know between two and four and not seeing anyone it's not the most productive use of your time, but when you say that your office hours are by appointment, basically, what you're saying is you know I.

188
00:30:49,661 --> 00:31:01,421
Frederique Laubepin: i'd rather not see you right as opposed to you know my door is open just stop by I you know I am here for you.

189
00:31:01,421 --> 00:31:12,311
Frederique Laubepin: Some you know bigger tweaks you can make are rewriting the course description in a way that is more engaging and something that you can do.

190
00:31:12,311 --> 00:31:36,821
Frederique Laubepin: You know, for your own discussion sections is is thinking about the course policies and the expectations right where can you infuse some flexibility, how can you invite collaboration from the students, how can you incorporate their voices or choice for them right.

191
00:31:36,821 --> 00:31:47,201
Frederique Laubepin: Is there going to be just you know is participation, going to be evaluated in just one way or you know, will you make provisions for.

192
00:31:47,201 --> 00:31:54,941
Frederique Laubepin: You know, for students to participate in in various ways, this can be very important for.

193
00:31:54,941 --> 00:32:10,031
Frederique Laubepin: International students, for example, you know whose English may not be may not be the best and who may not feel comfortable speaking up in class right so, can you provide a different way for them to participate and start earning those participation points.

194
00:32:10,031 --> 00:32:34,631
Frederique Laubepin: Can you actually create the course policies with the students right, so you know together as a class, can you, you know, have a conversation and agree on what delete policy is going to be what the you know, so you know, is there any way where you can infuse some of these principles.

195
00:32:34,631 --> 00:32:44,651
Frederique Laubepin: into this section of the syllabus same thing with trust and transparency right, so you know how can you infuse transparency into.

196
00:32:44,651 --> 00:32:52,031
Frederique Laubepin: into the policies, for example, and then you can you know you can move toward more extensive.

197
00:32:52,031 --> 00:32:57,101
Frederique Laubepin: changes such as you know, sharing your teaching philosophy with students.

198
00:32:57,101 --> 00:33:07,511
Frederique Laubepin: Right we'll talk a little bit about assessments and how we can revise them to being way, more transparent and therefore way more.

199
00:33:07,511 --> 00:33:26,921
Frederique Laubepin: helpful for students, providing grading rubrics is is one important way, as well as mapping, whatever it is that you're doing to the course learning objectives or your learning objectives for that particular class session.

200
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:32,771
Frederique Laubepin: So I could I could spend a lot of time talking about these different.

201
00:33:32,771 --> 00:33:36,671
Frederique Laubepin: These different things we have to move.

202
00:33:36,671 --> 00:33:41,471
Frederique Laubepin: You know fairly quickly but i'm going to see this.

203
00:33:41,471 --> 00:33:52,571
Frederique Laubepin: You know throughout the session never hesitate to reach out to us like hey Can you help me, you know i'd like to i'd like to do X Can you help me with this or.

204
00:33:52,571 --> 00:34:05,261
Frederique Laubepin: You know how can you, you know, can you help me implement some of these principles, so if you have questions about this, or if you if you would like some help please reach out to us.

205
00:34:05,261 --> 00:34:25,211
Frederique Laubepin: So the goal in everything is to infuse you know safety trustworthiness trust trust where trustworthiness collaboration and mutuality empowerment voice and choice, as well as attention to cultural historic one gender issues so that last piece.

206
00:34:25,211 --> 00:34:38,021
Frederique Laubepin: I would encourage you to think about both in terms of what are the implicit expectations that you have a students and how might those be shaped by culture.

207
00:34:38,021 --> 00:34:43,271
Frederique Laubepin: For example, right, so we, we expect.

208
00:34:43,271 --> 00:35:00,971
Frederique Laubepin: Certain behavior from people and those expectations tend to be very white and middle class right they may not reflect how some other cultures express themselves or participate.

209
00:35:00,971 --> 00:35:13,031
Frederique Laubepin: So paying attention to this, as you define as you define and evaluate participation in the chorus is really important, as well as what I meant what I was mentioning earlier.

210
00:35:13,031 --> 00:35:27,401
Frederique Laubepin: Evaluating the content that you're teaching for on these issues and seeing how you know, are what are the voices that are represented in what you're.

211
00:35:27,401 --> 00:35:42,641
Frederique Laubepin: In what you're teaching and what you're discussing who's missing, and how can you bring those other perspectives or voices in and that that can be sort of you know more generally out in the in your field.

212
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:53,321
Frederique Laubepin: As well as the actual students in the class right who is whose voice is not being heard in.

213
00:35:53,321 --> 00:35:55,211
Frederique Laubepin: In what you're.

214
00:35:55,211 --> 00:35:58,061
Frederique Laubepin: Discussing.

215
00:35:58,061 --> 00:36:06,491
Frederique Laubepin: So another really important piece of teaching as the assignments that we use and i'm going to send you because I.

216
00:36:06,491 --> 00:36:14,741
Frederique Laubepin: don't have time to get into the too much of the details here so i'm going to i'm going to share some resources with you.

217
00:36:14,741 --> 00:36:20,021
Frederique Laubepin: But this is a really important place where you can have.

218
00:36:20,021 --> 00:36:24,671
Frederique Laubepin: A significant impact on your students.

219
00:36:24,671 --> 00:36:28,931
Frederique Laubepin: Learning experiences and you're.

220
00:36:28,931 --> 00:36:49,181
Frederique Laubepin: particularly well positioned to help the course instructor to improve the assignments in the chorus and The reason I say you're particularly well positioned is because you're still students yourselves and, as such, you still you're closer to.

221
00:36:49,181 --> 00:37:03,011
Frederique Laubepin: You know, remembering what it's like to not be an expert in in this particular topic so the you know our faculty or they've spent years and years, developing some expertise and.

222
00:37:03,011 --> 00:37:14,471
Frederique Laubepin: It does suffer a lot of times from the experts blind spot, which is you know it's it becomes really hard to remember what it's like to not be an expert right so.

223
00:37:14,471 --> 00:37:23,591
Frederique Laubepin: to remember what what it's like to be a beginner and the result, sometimes the assignments are written in such a way that beginners have.

224
00:37:23,591 --> 00:37:29,201
Frederique Laubepin: struggle to understand what's expected of them, or how to do it well.

225
00:37:29,201 --> 00:37:39,191
Frederique Laubepin: And this shows, these are all quotes from I think last fall, you know of course evaluations.

226
00:37:39,191 --> 00:37:53,171
Frederique Laubepin: Were you know, and you, you, you may have contributed, you know some of these some of these comments, where we have many, many students talking about how you know.

227
00:37:53,171 --> 00:38:04,661
Frederique Laubepin: When things are unclear it's really difficult for them to understand what they need to do you know how to be successful in the class.

228
00:38:04,661 --> 00:38:11,501
Frederique Laubepin: You know the the the lack of clear expectations or goal posts or.

229
00:38:11,501 --> 00:38:15,611
Frederique Laubepin: You know description and outlines.

230
00:38:15,611 --> 00:38:18,011
Frederique Laubepin: it's a.

231
00:38:18,011 --> 00:38:30,581
Frederique Laubepin: big challenge for people and, as you might imagine it also causes a lot of anxiety for students unnecessarily so right so.

232
00:38:30,581 --> 00:38:38,771
Frederique Laubepin: You know, for all kinds of reasons, we need to pay a lot more attention to the assignments that we give them.

233
00:38:38,771 --> 00:38:40,661
Frederique Laubepin: one.

234
00:38:40,661 --> 00:38:46,121
Frederique Laubepin: really helpful framework to applying to assignment is called transparent assignment design.

235
00:38:46,121 --> 00:38:51,941
Frederique Laubepin: And, basically, and this is where I you know i'm not going to talk too much about it, but I will send you some resources.

236
00:38:51,941 --> 00:38:59,201
Frederique Laubepin: it's really not rocket science basically it involves clarifying the purpose the task and the criteria of assignments.

237
00:38:59,201 --> 00:39:09,851
Frederique Laubepin: So people often confuse the purpose in the task right, so you know if you say what is the purpose of the assignment are going to be like well you know the purpose is to calculate a P value.

238
00:39:09,851 --> 00:39:21,521
Frederique Laubepin: that's actually the task right the purpose, it might be to analyze data and interpret the results and write up you know something.

239
00:39:21,521 --> 00:39:38,261
Frederique Laubepin: But um the purpose is most often missing from the assignments that we give people usually we just focus on task you know this assignment has five parts and you know here's what you need to do also missing his criteria.

240
00:39:38,261 --> 00:39:44,681
Frederique Laubepin: For evaluation, so this can be in the form of grading rubrics.

241
00:39:44,681 --> 00:39:48,671
Frederique Laubepin: You know, providing some examples of good.

242
00:39:48,671 --> 00:39:56,771
Frederique Laubepin: submissions to an assignment like this one and ideally going over these.

243
00:39:56,771 --> 00:40:06,431
Frederique Laubepin: Examples with the students and really pointing out, you know what is good about it, what you know what did this person do that was.

244
00:40:06,431 --> 00:40:12,131
Frederique Laubepin: That was particularly that was particularly good so.

245
00:40:12,131 --> 00:40:17,801
Frederique Laubepin: Something that also we tend not to do because.

246
00:40:17,801 --> 00:40:22,961
Frederique Laubepin: We we sort of approach things from the perspective of.

247
00:40:22,961 --> 00:40:25,301
Frederique Laubepin: This is a little bit of.

248
00:40:25,301 --> 00:40:29,411
Frederique Laubepin: You know, you need to figure this out by by yourself, but.

249
00:40:29,411 --> 00:40:39,641
Frederique Laubepin: You know, so we we we give people tasks here here are the steps, I want you to complete for this assignment, but we don't often talk about the pitfalls.

250
00:40:39,641 --> 00:40:59,351
Frederique Laubepin: You know and as you do this be sure you avoid X be sure you, you know so both giving people sort of productive stuck steps to follow, but also counterproductive takes counterproductive steps to avoid is something that.

251
00:40:59,351 --> 00:41:04,031
Frederique Laubepin: is really helpful to students so.

252
00:41:04,031 --> 00:41:13,961
Frederique Laubepin: I would encourage you, if you see assignments, that the instructor has written where you know the purpose is missing, and there are no grading criteria, and this also goes to.

253
00:41:13,961 --> 00:41:19,901
Frederique Laubepin: You know, a comment that somebody made earlier in the icebreaker about how to grade fairly.

254
00:41:19,901 --> 00:41:39,581
Frederique Laubepin: For example, right if if you have no grading criteria if there's no transparency around this not only is it not transparent to the students but it's you know within the teaching team on that's not a you know, this is not a particularly helpful thing either.

255
00:41:39,581 --> 00:41:53,351
Frederique Laubepin: So i'll be sending you some resources that include a lot of examples of assignments that have been rewritten so pre applying the transparent Simon design framework and then post.

256
00:41:53,351 --> 00:42:03,521
Frederique Laubepin: And if you have any questions or, if you would like some help applying this framework to assignments feel free to let me know.

257
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:12,071
Frederique Laubepin: Another important aspect of the course and fairly easy place for you to.

258
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:18,431
Frederique Laubepin: You know tweak things and have a big impact is the actual canvas site.

259
00:42:18,431 --> 00:42:31,841
Frederique Laubepin: Some time in some courses, the jazzercise actually do the work of maintaining the canvas site in which gives you have a little bit more power to to set things up correctly in other cases, the instructor.

260
00:42:31,841 --> 00:42:43,871
Frederique Laubepin: takes the lead and you may be just asked to you know do a little bit, but even if that's the case if you see something on the canvas side that could be improved.

261
00:42:43,871 --> 00:42:52,571
Frederique Laubepin: You know, please bring it up to your instructor or bring it up to us, and I promise we'll reach out to the instructor I never mentioned your name.

262
00:42:52,571 --> 00:42:59,771
Frederique Laubepin: And offered to help them, improve the you know their canvas sites, but basically what we know from research.

263
00:42:59,771 --> 00:43:06,551
Frederique Laubepin: As well as surveys that we do every year of students here at the School of Public Health about canvas.

264
00:43:06,551 --> 00:43:18,911
Frederique Laubepin: Is that what works best is a canvas site that is clear, organized easy to navigate and consistent and that convey, you know that that does many things, including conveying.

265
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:29,141
Frederique Laubepin: That the instructor actually cares about the student experience on the opposite end if you have canvas sign to there are confusing inconsistent disorganized.

266
00:43:29,141 --> 00:43:39,581
Frederique Laubepin: it's both effective and efficient it causes the students, a lot of anxiety because there for ever, you know clicking around to try and figure out, you know.

267
00:43:39,581 --> 00:43:57,791
Frederique Laubepin: where things are and whether they're they're missing something important and they kind of conveys that either the instructor doesn't care or they're just struggling with the technology right so obviously we want to aim for the first before.

268
00:43:57,791 --> 00:44:04,061
Frederique Laubepin: This takes the form of a great landing page that.

269
00:44:04,061 --> 00:44:14,831
Frederique Laubepin: You know where everything the students might need is available, right from the right from the homepage right, so you don't have to wonder, you know if something is buried under a menu somewhere.

270
00:44:14,831 --> 00:44:31,091
Frederique Laubepin: All the most important parts of the course are available, right from the homepage the navigation is very down to the essential so you're not clicking around on on to like empty navigation links in the course navigation.

271
00:44:31,091 --> 00:44:35,891
Frederique Laubepin: The text of the syllabus is actually available on the canvas site.

272
00:44:35,891 --> 00:44:52,601
Frederique Laubepin: So that if somebody wants to quickly reference you know let's say, of course, policy, they can find it very quickly and easily, but they can also download the actual document if they want to so both are available.

273
00:44:52,601 --> 00:45:02,201
Frederique Laubepin: And then we can help you add tabs to a page, for example, to make navigation around that page.

274
00:45:02,201 --> 00:45:23,891
Frederique Laubepin: even easier and then you know whether you're using pages or modules making sure that everything that students need for one given week or one given class session is all available in one place right So here we have you know there's an overview of what.

275
00:45:23,891 --> 00:45:38,411
Frederique Laubepin: The class session or the week is going to look like links to the slides links to the readings links to the assignments for that course so for that session so the students don't have to click around.

276
00:45:38,411 --> 00:45:49,181
Frederique Laubepin: You know, different various places in order to figure out what they need to do for that for that week, everything is is centralized in one place.

277
00:45:49,181 --> 00:45:58,871
Frederique Laubepin: And the assignments include you know the description, the evaluation criteria expectations.

278
00:45:58,871 --> 00:46:07,181
Frederique Laubepin: it's it's kind of crazy that this is often missing from the actual assignment.

279
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:15,911
Frederique Laubepin: You know in canvas and so students have to go somewhere else to find the instructions for that assignment, for example.

280
00:46:15,911 --> 00:46:21,971
Frederique Laubepin: So if you're working in a course where the the instructor hasn't included this, for example in the assignments.

281
00:46:21,971 --> 00:46:29,531
Frederique Laubepin: You might want to kindly suggest that we you know let's let's add the instructions to the to the assignment and.

282
00:46:29,531 --> 00:46:46,331
Frederique Laubepin: You know, can we can we create a rubric and share that with the students right So even if you're not in total control what happens on you know, in the canvas side there are ways, where you know you can help nudge the instructor to you know toward.

283
00:46:46,331 --> 00:46:48,641
Frederique Laubepin: Best practices.

284
00:46:48,641 --> 00:47:01,241
Frederique Laubepin: So, at the end of the day, you want to remember that organization, consistency and clarity are what you should be aiming for that you know, this is what we know from research, this is what the students are telling us.

285
00:47:01,241 --> 00:47:10,931
Frederique Laubepin: And you know as you might imagine this helps infuse some safety for the students.

286
00:47:10,931 --> 00:47:20,561
Frederique Laubepin: Right or enhance their sense of safety if if they know that there's there's a solid canvas side they they know what the expectations are.

287
00:47:20,561 --> 00:47:42,791
Frederique Laubepin: You know they don't have that anxiety of hunting down information all the time, so you know I don't have time to get into too much of the details, but you can probably see how this helps to address several principles in the in that trauma informed framework.

288
00:47:42,791 --> 00:48:02,831
Frederique Laubepin: I would also encourage you to attend the session on canvas tomorrow, where Joanna will go into a lot more detail, including you know sharing this canvas course checklist that will help implement some of these.

289
00:48:02,831 --> 00:48:12,791
Frederique Laubepin: Best practices and something that I didn't talk about here, which is but it's that super important, which is, you know how do we make sure that the canvas sites are accessible.

290
00:48:12,791 --> 00:48:24,941
Frederique Laubepin: And so there's a number of things that number of tools that you can use and or encourage your instructor to use so.

291
00:48:24,941 --> 00:48:31,421
Frederique Laubepin: I would encourage you to attend tomorrow's canvas session if if you're able.

292
00:48:31,421 --> 00:48:40,361
Frederique Laubepin: The last piece is you know what you're doing in the actual class session right the the class activities.

293
00:48:40,361 --> 00:48:48,431
Frederique Laubepin: So um it's often helpful to remember that the purpose of these sessions is.

294
00:48:48,431 --> 00:48:53,411
Frederique Laubepin: You know, to offer an opportunity to connect.

295
00:48:53,411 --> 00:49:01,991
Frederique Laubepin: To clarify course content to collaborate to apply, you know what people are learning to.

296
00:49:01,991 --> 00:49:17,081
Frederique Laubepin: deepen discussions but it's not meant to be is another lecture on class content, especially if some of it is already I know if people have attended a lecture in zoom or watched recordings.

297
00:49:17,081 --> 00:49:26,351
Frederique Laubepin: it's not meant to be all group work and it's not meant to be this like you know, a more focus office hours just you know come with your questions.

298
00:49:26,351 --> 00:49:38,741
Frederique Laubepin: So here's here are some best practices and i'll be sharing the slide deck with you so um you know start by thinking about your learning objectives for that session.

299
00:49:38,741 --> 00:49:50,021
Frederique Laubepin: Based on what's being done, you know that week in the course, what are the major concepts, you need to focus on what are the essential skills that students, need to be practicing.

300
00:49:50,021 --> 00:50:03,131
Frederique Laubepin: And where might they be struggling right, so what is the best use of your session to help them with these right and then, once you figure this out.

301
00:50:03,131 --> 00:50:22,271
Frederique Laubepin: Then come up with a plan, so what kind of activities are our best going to help them toward the mastery of the content and the skills, what is the most valuable use of this session in terms of advancing student learning and then.

302
00:50:22,271 --> 00:50:35,171
Frederique Laubepin: You know, can you provide the students with an agenda either ahead of time or the beginning of the session so you know, there is some structure, they know what to expect.

303
00:50:35,171 --> 00:50:46,121
Frederique Laubepin: And they have some clarity around this if you can and understand that it depends on on what you're teaching right and in biostatistics this may not be.

304
00:50:46,121 --> 00:51:05,321
Frederique Laubepin: As applicable as and some other courses, but try to mix it up use a you know mix of activities small, large group discussions i'm not saying don't lecture at all just don't spend the entire time lecturing.

305
00:51:05,321 --> 00:51:18,641
Frederique Laubepin: You know, be explicit about what it means to participate in the in the class and if you can, as I mentioned earlier, provide multiple ways for people to participate.

306
00:51:18,641 --> 00:51:30,521
Frederique Laubepin: And if you have you know if you if you want ideas about this, or if you have questions about this there's another session tomorrow on how we teach and zoom.

307
00:51:30,521 --> 00:51:47,501
Frederique Laubepin: Where Monica is going to cover some of this, we also have the an account a school account for poll everywhere, if you're interested in using poll everywhere in your classes feel free to send us an email and we'll add you to the account, which will.

308
00:51:47,501 --> 00:52:10,331
Frederique Laubepin: You know, give you access to to our license as well, as you know, other tools so here in this session, for example, I use this this tool called idea boards, which is super straightforward to set up really easy to use, you know, provides an opportunity for people to participate in.

309
00:52:10,331 --> 00:52:17,261
Frederique Laubepin: You know, in a more low stakes way then raising a hand and speaking up in class, for example.

310
00:52:17,261 --> 00:52:22,331
Frederique Laubepin: So if you if you want more ideas.

311
00:52:22,331 --> 00:52:36,911
Frederique Laubepin: If you want to talk about you know how to use some of these tools, you know you can attend the session, you can also reach out to us and we'll be happy to discuss various options and best practices.

312
00:52:36,911 --> 00:52:45,431
Frederique Laubepin: group projects are a big thing at the school and they're also a big pain points, the big pain point for the students.

313
00:52:45,431 --> 00:52:54,191
Frederique Laubepin: whenever you can, if there's a an opportunity to carve out time during class whether that's an in person class or a class on zoom.

314
00:52:54,191 --> 00:53:12,941
Frederique Laubepin: for students to work together on their on their group projects as opposed to having them try to figure out how to do this, outside of class which becomes very difficult when people are scattered across time zones and with various class schedules.

315
00:53:12,941 --> 00:53:15,431
Frederique Laubepin: You know, please do so.

316
00:53:15,431 --> 00:53:20,471
Frederique Laubepin: And you know, try to try to help them out.

317
00:53:20,471 --> 00:53:35,951
Frederique Laubepin: That way it's also a good opportunity for them to get support from you as they're working on their on their group projects to build those peer networks, as well as leverage peer support so.

318
00:53:35,951 --> 00:53:46,391
Frederique Laubepin: keep that in mind, and because we're out of time, I will just say that, please remember that there's a lot of support available to you and mean on it.

319
00:53:46,391 --> 00:53:57,311
Frederique Laubepin: If or when you need it, so this is, you know comes in the form of your fellow GS eyes the course instructor him or herself our team.

320
00:53:57,311 --> 00:54:09,191
Frederique Laubepin: You know, we have an instructional technologist we have several instructional designers we have a lot of resources, right here at the school in we're just an email away.

321
00:54:09,191 --> 00:54:24,461
Frederique Laubepin: As well as university resources, such as the CRM at the Center for research and learning and teaching so don't you know don't struggle with stuff alone and lean on the support that is that is available to you.

322
00:54:24,461 --> 00:54:33,131
Frederique Laubepin: You can reach us at SBA dot instruction that creates a ticket in our system and anybody on the team.

323
00:54:33,131 --> 00:54:41,951
Frederique Laubepin: can see it and and respond to it or feel free to reach out to me directly, as well, so.

324
00:54:41,951 --> 00:55:55,603
Frederique Laubepin: I apologize.

325
00:54:44,621 --> 00:54:58,271
Frederique Laubepin: For being over time i'm happy to stay on, and you know if you have any questions or you can reach out to me separately as well.

326
00:54:58,271 --> 00:55:01,271
Abby Loe-Biostat 521: Thank you very much.

327
00:55:01,271 --> 00:55:02,651
Abby Loe-Biostat 521: alright.

328
00:55:02,651 --> 00:55:08,921
Frederique Laubepin: So i'll um i'll be sending you know these these.

329
00:55:08,921 --> 00:55:09,851
Frederique Laubepin: hear what you said.

330

Frederique Laubepin: Wanting to participate as well.

332
00:55:15,401 --> 00:55:24,281
Frederique Laubepin: i'll be sending these the you know the side as well as some other resources that I mentioned in the session so.

333
00:55:24,281 --> 00:55:33,101
Frederique Laubepin: You know if you if you want more information or there's something that i'm not sending you but you want more information about feel free to.

334
00:55:33,101 --> 00:55:34,571
Frederique Laubepin: email me.

335

Frederique Laubepin: So with that I will let you, you know get on with your day, we look forward to working with you Thank you so much for the work that you will be doing.

336
00:55:47,231 --> 00:55:51,611
Frederique Laubepin: With the you know with the students, we appreciate it.

337
00:55:51,611 --> 00:55:55,603
Frederique Laubepin: And I will talk to you later.
