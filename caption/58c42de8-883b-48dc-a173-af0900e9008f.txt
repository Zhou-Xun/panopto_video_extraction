1
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:18,170
Okay. Well, good morning, everyone. So before we start, I'm going to cook up a whole work for you and post it today, so watch for my announcements.

2
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:22,240
It's going to be due two weeks from now. On Wednesday. Any time.

3
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:29,840
And I prefer if you just hook up a PDF through electronic submission.

4
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:34,640
If you prefer paper, you can just show with them to my door if I'm not in the office.

5
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:42,560
So any time the Wednesday after next is going to be good.

6
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:56,660
So let's first refresh what we have last time.

7
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:10,530
So we were looking to characterize the domain for the probability measure, even though we have defined what that matters.

8
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,760
But from your previous courses, like six or one,

9
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:23,790
we remember that it consists of should consist of all sorts of events in which we could do countable operations of unions,

10
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:37,380
intersections and accomplishments. And so with that in mind, we just followed that logic to, uh, constructively define the domain for the probability.

11
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:50,759
We're just taking some basis sets and then throwing in all possible countable or is results of countable operations of unions,

12
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:55,920
intersections and compliments. And we call that an algebra.

13
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:01,229
And when that operations extended to the infinitely countable.

14
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:09,600
So we call that a sigma algebra. Okay, then what else did we do?

15
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:20,370
We uh, and so now that we started talking about countable operations, we have to define countable sets.

16
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:25,230
And these were sets that we can index right by a natural number.

17
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:30,510
And I don't care whether this is kind of an infinite set of natural numbers.

18
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:34,620
So all of them or just a subset if my set is finite.

19
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:41,940
But what we wanted is that there is a unique index to each of the sets and in a countable collection,

20
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:46,469
and these forms the basis for countable operations.

21
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:56,530
Right. So if I, if I say I am having a countable operation, then there is no other way is,

22
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:03,150
is to say that this operation is basically on account of a collection of sets because otherwise that doesn't work.

23
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:08,400
Right. Um, okay.

24
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:17,700
Um, then what else we, we kind of in passing defines uh, uh,

25
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:30,839
a measure from the measure theory and it did not have the main axiom then differentiates it from the probability measure which is the normalization.

26
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:39,570
Right. So in advance I can say that we'll just define a probability as a measure such that the measure of the how long ago is one.

27
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:47,490
And even though it looks trivial, we will see that it has consequences for continuity, for example.

28
00:03:50,540 --> 00:04:02,760
Then, since most of our, or at least a large part of our examples of sense of probabilities will be concerned with numbers.

29
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:12,859
So we went a little bit into the number theory and rephrased that there are rational numbers that come to prove that

30
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:22,850
they are countable and there is kind of a visual proof to that where we literally did a spiral counting all of them.

31
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:34,580
Right, or indexing all of them. Then the irrational numbers are harder to grasp, but we basically defined them as anything other than rational.

32
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:40,880
On the real line, we define a measurable space as a combination of all.

33
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:50,660
I'm a guy in a sigma algebra and later on when we add the probability to it, will extend it and call it the probability space, right?

34
00:04:52,250 --> 00:05:04,510
Which is a starting point of any modeling. Then so we started talking about generating sigma algebra and these work kind of a constructive argument.

35
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:17,479
So we're basically start with any basis set basis because this is we basically like, like a culture in the dish, right?

36
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:27,980
So it just let it multiply without countable operations and look at what, what define the sigma,

37
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:32,420
the resultant sigma algebra as a collection of all of the results of these operations.

38
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:44,350
Sometimes we say that for finite sets it's easy to visualize, but for infinite sets, it's harder to visualize.

39
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:48,950
So it's defined just constructively in such a manner.

40
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:58,660
Uh, we kind of took a sketch of how we would, uh, generate a sigma algebra from a final, uh, finite collection of samples.

41
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:09,140
These were just three intervals. And then finally so we defined probably the most important sigma algebra, at least four continuous variables.

42
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:14,660
Uh, we called it Braille and said that it's going to be generated by open intervals.

43
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:25,729
And that was it to. So let's continue with the burial.

44
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:30,410
So burial is, by the way, an example of how sigma algebra that's hard to visualize.

45
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:40,220
So it was sad that. Well said my algebra.

46
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:56,490
He's generated. By collection of open intervals.

47
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:05,720
A less equal be in both of them part of car.

48
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:13,820
Right. So even though we kind of define it in this general way, so depending on the context,

49
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:24,500
we could say that this is open intervals within, let's say an interval zero one or so, not necessarily on the full real really.

50
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:36,220
Okay. And this was just a definition. And in some sense, this definition is excessive, right?

51
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,630
So this is a what we call basis sets.

52
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:52,610
Generating. See my algebra.

53
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:00,750
Right. So in the spirit of our constructive definition.

54
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:13,440
So just take all sorts of open intervals, the accountable unions and the sections complements and throw them all into a collection.

55
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,660
And this is going to be the Burrell Sigma algebra.

56
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:28,830
So it's excessive in the sense that we actually don't need both ends to be variable for that thing.

57
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:32,160
It's too big a set of basis sets, actually.

58
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:44,400
But historically, this is how it was defined. So let's consider an example of how we can work with Liberal Sigma algebra and let's show.

59
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:58,160
That's. The open intervals.

60
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:12,190
He's not the only. They said.

61
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:18,690
Offsets rights that generates burials.

62
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:28,020
And so we usually do fancy objects with a script notation.

63
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:35,610
So it's going to be. Beautiful B that I will use for burial.

64
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:43,020
So that generates. But while.

65
00:09:45,550 --> 00:10:01,290
Right. And this is at the same time an example. So let's say I'm taking Ahmed as an interval zero one close to one.

66
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:08,540
And let's say I'm taking a different collection of base assets.

67
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:19,790
I'm taking a collection where the right end of the interval was fixed and it's along the left.

68
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:23,210
Then there's going to be variable and that's a.

69
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:35,170
And I mean, that is between zero and one and it's a number.

70
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:40,300
So let's see if, uh, if this generates the variable sigma algebra.

71
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:43,430
So how do we do that? Right.

72
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:50,770
So we need to show that using the tools available to me, which is countable operations of the kinds,

73
00:10:51,580 --> 00:11:05,649
I can actually use these half open intervals with the right hand being fixed to acquire the set of open intervals.

74
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:09,700
And then I know that we're working further with the set of open intervals.

75
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:15,850
Of all open intervals. I will have a better outlook emerging from this generation.

76
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:29,340
Right. So we need to show. Need to show that so accountable.

77
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:36,510
Unions. Intersections compliments of.

78
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:46,300
Sets in these bases set heights will generate.

79
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:58,060
The set of open intervals and if so, the basis sense.

80
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:08,460
Like these, we'll also generate Braille.

81
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:25,340
Okay, so let's do that.

82
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:29,960
Um, so first I'll take the compliments of a one.

83
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:36,819
Right. So then he had a temperament.

84
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:40,780
This is to the fore long ago, which is a01 interval.

85
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:50,740
Right. So as a result, they will have anything in zero one that does not belong to the half open interval from 8 to 1.

86
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:55,840
And that's anything from zero to E and A is included.

87
00:12:56,270 --> 00:13:01,960
Right. So we have six left and.

88
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:11,950
Intervals. So that's I'm using compliments.

89
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:24,780
Fixed left and closed right tenths.

90
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:35,510
And we are able. Right.

91
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:42,020
So I know that these kinds of intervals are also going to be in my sigma algebra that I am generating.

92
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:52,970
Uh, so now let's use countable intersection and I'm going to take the intervals like this.

93
00:13:55,910 --> 00:14:01,370
So B minus one over M countable intersection.

94
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:11,580
And from, let's say, some C to infinity one, the one is closed.

95
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,900
So what's what's the result of that?

96
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:29,810
Now, I need to start with some C, depending on what B is, because I can't have something larger than the original I omega from zero one.

97
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:37,810
And if is b small then so for small and I will have a negative on the left end of the interval.

98
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:44,780
I don't want that. So other than that. So this is just a technical thing.

99
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:52,860
So we say that C's large enough. And fixed so that.

100
00:14:55,650 --> 00:15:01,860
B minus one over and does not exceed my own income.

101
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:12,060
Okay. So I'm having an intersection right over of N and that means.

102
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:16,680
So what kind of numbers does this intersection consist of?

103
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:24,030
So it consists of numbers that belong to every single interval.

104
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:32,730
Right. So I have accountable set of intervals to every single interval, no matter how large and these.

105
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:44,100
Right. And it's clear that this is going to be the point B on the left and the one on the right.

106
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:49,770
Right. So if I go anywhere left of B right.

107
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:57,740
Then I will have N large enough so that B minus one over and will exclude that point.

108
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:05,490
Right. So, uh, it's kind of a, uh, uh, a contradiction argument, right?

109
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:11,730
So you say suppose it's not closed at the B on the left.

110
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:18,000
So then a point left of B is going to be a part of that interval.

111
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:26,040
And then I can take and large enough so that b minus one over here is going to be to the right of it.

112
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:31,980
And then it cannot belong to the intersection.

113
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:43,230
So I don't care whether you do kind of a chain.

114
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:52,800
A logical chain is as long as the one I just reproduced because mathematicians would probably do that.

115
00:16:53,820 --> 00:17:00,830
But I'm fine if you just have intuition for what this is. Okay.

116
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,700
So that would be what, closed on the left?

117
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:16,210
And the variable rate. And closed.

118
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:22,820
On the left. And picked up the right.

119
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:45,200
I know that as a result of this exercise, I know that these kinds of intervals will also be in my sigma algebra case so I can again take compliments.

120
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:57,640
Uh, so from of the intervals that, uh, just showed up in my sigma algebra, I take a complement of it.

121
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:05,770
And as a result, I will have the interval that's closed on the left, but open on the right.

122
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:23,020
They? So how do I get an interval with both hands being variable so I can do like this?

123
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:29,700
I can see that this is the interval zero to be right.

124
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:37,240
So I know that these kinds of intervals already in my sigma algebra I can do an intersection

125
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:46,299
with another interval like that e to one and this time so I'll take a less equal.

126
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:58,480
B Right. So what's going to happen is I have one interval like this from zero to B and another one from E to one.

127
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:20,810
Right. And I'm doing an intersection of the two. So that's going to generate the interval right here as an intersection.

128
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:25,820
That's easy to be both in schools.

129
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:38,320
So now I've got not the open intervals that we defined burial with, but I got close the intervals with both ends being variable.

130
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:45,650
It's part of my sigma algebra. So how do I get to open intervals?

131
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:51,520
I'm almost there. Right. So I need to draw up the A and the B from the ends of the interval somehow.

132
00:19:52,870 --> 00:20:05,200
Right. So first the close the interval would just have allows me to say that singletons are also in it because.

133
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:07,720
I can take.

134
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:23,910
This interval where he is equal to these events going to be the single right point of the interval will degenerate into the points of singletons.

135
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:34,920
Art also in its. In the sigma algebra I'm generating.

136
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:45,200
So once I have singletons, uh, so I can do the open intervals a, b, I can do it two ways.

137
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:55,489
Uh, so I can either define, uh, I can literally get them from closed intervals by dropping a,

138
00:20:55,490 --> 00:21:03,650
and the, uh, but for that, I'd have to define the difference between sets.

139
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:22,030
So A minus B. Is.

140
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:31,050
The intersection would be complements.

141
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:40,170
So as you can see, there are other operations that are consequence of unions, intersections of accomplishments that we can define.

142
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:44,460
So this is one of them. So you want to visualize what happens, right?

143
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:54,150
So if I have a sit in A said B and C, I want to subtract D from E.

144
00:21:54,300 --> 00:22:02,850
Right. Uh, so if you put this in words, I want to exclude from e all the elements that belong to be.

145
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:10,150
Right. And this is virtually, uh. This is exactly what's the right side of the equation is.

146
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:15,249
So that's a set like this. Right.

147
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:19,840
And if I applied to intervals, right.

148
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:29,110
So if I have a closed interval and I want to subtract from the close interval a single time,

149
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:34,630
which is the right and then as a results, I'm going to get an interval like this.

150
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:39,310
And if I subtract both the right and the left, then.

151
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:48,140
So I'm going to get the, uh, closed, the open interval on both ends.

152
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:59,970
So that's one way. Okay. So that's the closed interval.

153
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:10,650
A B minus the single E and minus the single.

154
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:18,030
Then the. And there are other ways to get it right.

155
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:24,660
So I could say that. Uh.

156
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:33,030
Let's see. So here is my zero one.

157
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:45,510
I have, let's say, one interval from zero to a.

158
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:53,480
And another interval from B to one.

159
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:07,310
I can take a union of them and do a compliment of that union.

160
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:20,840
So zero to a union with B to one accomplishment of that thing.

161
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:30,559
So what I'm going to end up with is all the points in zero one that do not belong to the union.

162
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:38,320
That's on the second line. Right. And this is exactly the opening interval from A to B.

163
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:51,390
You can probably find other ways to get it right.

164
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:58,710
But once I have open intervals like these, so they define be.

165
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:08,710
The barrel thing. My algebra and I managed with a different collection of sets to arrive at those.

166
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:17,490
Now, if I continue my operations, I already know that if I only look at open intervals, that's by definition is going to be the algebra.

167
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:37,570
Okay? Yep. Can I speak louder?

168
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:55,280
When I drop one of them's or. That's the.

169
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:03,510
So this this one. Still up.

170
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:11,020
This one. This one.

171
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:30,650
Oh, this one. Okay. Uh. So you could use intuition to come up with it, right?

172
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:35,099
Yeah, well, it's.

173
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:40,980
It's true. Uh, so it is intuition that drives everything, at least in my head.

174
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:44,690
I always have intuition before a formal statement.

175
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,750
Right. So by definition.

176
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:51,770
So the countable intersection like these. Right.

177
00:26:51,780 --> 00:27:02,490
Is a set of points that belongs to every single set in the sequence from one to M, no matter how large M is.

178
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:11,880
Right. And, uh, so the intuition tells me that this is going to be a closed D on the left.

179
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:15,329
Right. Uh, it's.

180
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:22,240
It's. And this actually follows from a formal argument now.

181
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:33,220
Not not the intuition there. If I define an interval anywhere with the left hand, anywhere left of V that open or closed right,

182
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:38,170
then there will be points in that interval that are not part of this countable intersection.

183
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:47,710
Because if they were and now there's an argument that goes by contradiction, if they were,

184
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:54,190
then I would take in large enough so that B minus one over an is going to be larger than that point.

185
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:10,590
And if it's larger than point, that point will not be part of the interval, and that contradicts the definition of the countable intersection.

186
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:14,220
So let's let's write it down now that you have a question, right.

187
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:31,710
Any interval open or closed from sea to one does not belong.

188
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:41,999
Where C is less than B does not belong to you.

189
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,920
I already have C, I need something else. A, b, c, d.

190
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:55,559
Does not belong to the counter.

191
00:28:55,560 --> 00:29:06,560
Both union. Because.

192
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:25,460
For any d such the d is less than b there exists in am large enough.

193
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:38,800
Such that B minus one of em is going to be larger than D.

194
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:53,670
And from these it follows that for such an.

195
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:10,600
I will have d not belonging to the interval b minus one over m to one.

196
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:25,480
Right. And since, by definition, the countable intersection is a collection.

197
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:44,250
These are set right. Of numbers.

198
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:51,530
Such that they belong.

199
00:30:56,160 --> 00:31:05,330
To every. Interval B minus one over and two one.

200
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:16,110
No. I'll do a key.

201
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:21,860
Right. Four came from 1:02 p.m.

202
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:32,130
No matter. A large.

203
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:42,110
And he's. So that's that's a formal argument, right?

204
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:50,480
I won't drill into things like that in the future because it takes a lot of time,

205
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:58,130
but it doesn't give much because the starting point is the inflation rate.

206
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:06,350
And yes, as some of you are doing such spell out for the first time.

207
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:11,270
So I actually encourage you to do it until you get comfortable with it.

208
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:19,580
So you get a feeling that any of your intuition, if needed, can be spelled out and into something like that.

209
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:22,700
Right. That's not the only case where we'll have that.

210
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:42,660
Okay. Any any other questions? Okay.

211
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:46,830
So we introduce singletons, right?

212
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:56,310
So these are uh, uh, single numbers, uh, uh, and, uh, treated as a sense, as an object, right?

213
00:32:56,550 --> 00:33:01,170
Some sense consisting of single numbers. Yeah.

214
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:08,580
And, uh, so I'm going to show that, uh, this is so we're now walking around the barrel sigma algebra,

215
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:13,680
developing some intuition on the non trivial things, right?

216
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:23,220
Uh, so at first glance, uh, uh, you might get an impression that if I take all singletons, right?

217
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:28,200
Uh, certainly the union of them will make the full real line.

218
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:39,500
Right? But that union won't be counted. All right, so that, that is, uh, asset rich enough, uh, that can generate moral.

219
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:49,020
But that's not true, right? So what we are going to show is that the set of all singletons is actually too small,

220
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:56,070
uh, to generate, uh, a Brown Sigma algebra if I uses it as a basis set.

221
00:33:56,100 --> 00:34:03,000
Right. So I'm basically trying to develop some intuition and characterize the overall sigma algebra, right?

222
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:08,820
So we defined it as the one generated by open intervals within show.

223
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:17,760
That's some more primitive sense than the set of all open intervals with variable ends also generate moral sigma algebra.

224
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:20,940
So I'm approaching it from above.

225
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:28,290
Right? But then as another example, we're going to have a set that's a set of old singletons.

226
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:32,790
That's not going to be enough to generate the rules. Right? So that's the logic.

227
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:43,470
So let's. So that's.

228
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:54,060
The South. Of all singletons.

229
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:05,040
He's too small. You could put small in quotes, right?

230
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:12,030
Because we haven't defined the how to characterize sizes of assets.

231
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:25,630
To generate. The algebra.

232
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:45,319
Yeah. I again, I'm kind of an early intuition that's not formalized, is that if I'm using singletons now,

233
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:52,730
if I'm going to try to generate a sigma algebra, all of them, I'm going to have to use the.

234
00:35:53,990 --> 00:36:02,990
So if I take just finite operations like one singleton union with another or intersection with another, I come i.

235
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:07,160
The result is a very primitive sample that's still singletons, right?

236
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:13,640
Then sigma algebra allows me to use countable operations.

237
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:24,440
So if I use countable union intersection of singletons, then so what I'm going to get.

238
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:30,080
So we discussed that I can only use countable operation, unaccountable collection of sets.

239
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:36,910
So I have to take a countable collection of singletons and then account of union

240
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:41,030
and intersections and so on of them will still give me a count of itself.

241
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:49,040
So I'm not getting in doubles out of it. So the only way I'm getting intervals is when I take complements.

242
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:59,150
Right. So I can take a bunch of points that are singletons and then a complement of them will certainly have some kind of interval.

243
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:06,950
So uncountable sets in it. But that's not enough for what I'll write because in the browser,

244
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:12,110
if I have an open interval, then it's part of the Brian Sigma algebra and the complement.

245
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:18,380
There's also some kind of an interval or a union of them that's also part of the sigma algebra.

246
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:24,049
So I'm not getting that from this collection because it looks like what I'm getting is either

247
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:32,450
accountable set or a complement of accountable set in my sigma algebra if I try to generate it.

248
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:44,280
And that intuition is correct. But before we go there, so let's give a definition for that sets we just mentioned.

249
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:53,890
Right. So a set is called. Hold accountable.

250
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:04,890
So notation for accountable sets will be C.

251
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:12,230
Um. So comfortable.

252
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:23,070
And countable have notation. C. C. If it's compliment.

253
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:46,480
He is accountable set. So C, C and C are classes.

254
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:49,890
Right? So CS is. Uh huh.

255
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:55,890
Just a shorthand for, uh, uh, countable sets and ceases.

256
00:38:57,810 --> 00:39:02,270
Short for a certain Saddam belongs to the class of Kolkata since.

257
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:17,460
Then. Uh, so we have the fact that, uh, I just discussed them laying out the interrogation for the result that's going to come, uh.

258
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:27,460
They can certainly be proved and spelled out right. But they are obvious.

259
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:35,330
So unions. In two sections.

260
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:49,590
Of countable sets. Uh, still accountable.

261
00:39:54,040 --> 00:40:01,850
All right. So I can't go out of the class of comfortable SATs if I'm using unions and intersections.

262
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:13,190
And also unions and intersections can only work.

263
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:22,140
This is by definition. On accountable.

264
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:33,409
Collection of sets. Right.

265
00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:36,620
And another language for that would be sequences, right?

266
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:51,780
Since. And here is theory.

267
00:40:54,540 --> 00:41:01,200
So he or we just stayed the intuition, as is a theorem.

268
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:16,590
So suppose I have. This is a sigma algebra generated by a single.

269
00:41:22,490 --> 00:41:25,880
So when I say singletons and words, you can.

270
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:40,860
So this is a collection of comedies when on and girls are in the center of real numbers.

271
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:45,630
So that would be a formal invitation for what they meet as singletons.

272
00:41:56,050 --> 00:42:01,600
And the theorem actually states that the test consists.

273
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:17,210
Of either. Countable SATs or coal counts and all sense.

274
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:36,440
And the corollary would be that this is too small for a liberal.

275
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:49,980
So let's do a proof. So we need some notation for.

276
00:42:53,580 --> 00:43:03,600
So I would say that if he's sad of all C or c, c.

277
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:15,540
Sets. And we need to show.

278
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:39,600
That's. It is is a subset of half and half is a subset of us, which makes them equal rights.

279
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:44,340
And it would follow that. Yes. And therefore the same thing.

280
00:43:52,350 --> 00:43:55,500
So let's start with the first thing.

281
00:43:57,310 --> 00:44:03,500
So show that. Yes.

282
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:25,180
He's part of this. So I need to take any said from F and show that this will be part of the sigma algebra that I generate from singletons.

283
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:35,760
No countable sets of numbers will be singletons.

284
00:44:35,770 --> 00:44:44,450
Right? So if I take, uh, accountable self.

285
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:52,140
See my e uh.

286
00:44:52,500 --> 00:45:09,920
E is accountable. Union of Singletons. Right.

287
00:45:09,950 --> 00:45:15,440
And as such, it will be part. Yes.

288
00:45:15,770 --> 00:45:22,410
Right. So if I take a comfortable SEP from F it is part of this.

289
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:26,030
Right. But they have consists of two kinds of them.

290
00:45:26,050 --> 00:45:30,240
Right. So now I need to take the co countable set.

291
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:39,720
So a is cc. You can tell me that it's the compliment that will lead me to a a statement.

292
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:46,740
Right. Then a complement is countable.

293
00:45:50,930 --> 00:46:01,640
And from there I get that a complement belongs to S and S is a sigma algebra also a.

294
00:46:05,270 --> 00:46:09,780
Compliments of a compliment also must be part of this is a.

295
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:24,110
Right. So we've shown that any kind of a sap they take from health is going to be in the house.

296
00:46:24,230 --> 00:46:27,230
So that means there is a subset of us.

297
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:38,650
So the second statement, we show that.

298
00:46:45,620 --> 00:47:02,390
This is going to be a subset of us. And there consists of two parts.

299
00:47:02,410 --> 00:47:08,050
So the first one I need to show that half is a sigma algebra.

300
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:20,180
And secondly, I need to show.

301
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:27,440
Uh. That, uh. If contains.

302
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:41,140
All subsets. Consisting of singletons.

303
00:47:58,150 --> 00:48:04,920
And then I will say. Then we can see.

304
00:48:09,870 --> 00:48:15,120
That's. Yes.

305
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:19,570
He's the smallest.

306
00:48:25,370 --> 00:48:31,830
Sigma algebra. Containing six singletons.

307
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:38,860
By definition, right? Cause that's how sigma algebra is defined.

308
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:48,010
And it's f is another sigma algebra containing singletons.

309
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:52,120
Then it would follow that. Yes.

310
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:59,430
Is part of f is the smallest one. These smallest.

311
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:09,620
Sigma algebra. This is some simple algebra.

312
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:18,960
Okay. So that's that's just logic of of the proof.

313
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:34,150
To show. A and B, and then the logic leads us to the statement that we want to make.

314
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:41,930
Okay, let's do a five minute break and then fill in the gaps.

315
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:27,050
Mm hmm. Yeah.

316
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:33,340
We would expand. So we are for a what?

317
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:36,780
For a long time. We are in the real life. Right.

318
00:50:36,790 --> 00:50:43,480
But then we will have like the value of random variables that's more and see algebras and how they are defined.

319
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:54,020
I won't spend much time on it, but it's basically. Products of all the products that exclude the.

320
00:51:17,670 --> 00:51:23,360
Is. Right.

321
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:33,620
So the I'm using it as an illustration that there are non-trivial sense there are two sort of generating, but.

322
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:37,220
Right. Even though you perceive them as being large enough.

323
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:46,330
Sort of. Right. And it's.

324
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:53,850
And what. Oh, it is.

325
00:51:54,230 --> 00:52:01,640
Well, I'm just showing that. I'm characterizing the sigma algebra that they can generate from old singletons.

326
00:52:02,450 --> 00:52:07,940
And this algebra will contain either countable or core countable sets.

327
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:15,060
And that's not enough for burial. So it serves my purpose.

328
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:19,100
Right. But but this is a statement interesting in itself. How does it look like?

329
00:52:19,110 --> 00:52:23,760
Right. So the segment appears that's based on all singletons.

330
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:27,670
How does it look like as a collection of sense?

331
00:52:31,710 --> 00:52:36,280
Right. And I'm showing what it is, right? This is what the theorem is about.

332
00:52:36,330 --> 00:52:41,940
Right. And then I'm able to say, look, it's it's not all of it, but now that I know what it is.

333
00:56:11,540 --> 00:57:36,380
The other one. So.

334
00:57:58,730 --> 00:58:15,370
So. That's.

335
00:58:56,840 --> 00:59:09,310
Okay. Shall we continue? So, um, so we have A and B, right?

336
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:19,700
So to prove it, we need to show that F is closed with respect to operations of unions, intersections and complements.

337
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:30,830
Right. And B follows from the fact that, uh, countable sets and therefore.

338
00:59:38,150 --> 00:59:45,320
Our collections are countable unions and intersections of single class.

339
00:59:53,720 --> 01:00:03,320
Because they have consists of countable sets and their complements and countable

340
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:09,530
sets will be comfortable unions of singletons in this context and for the day.

341
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:21,650
So I needs to do exercises like this so we can do one of them and you can fill in the others.

342
01:00:22,370 --> 01:00:32,600
Let's see if I have a countable said right and another countable set of them.

343
01:00:34,220 --> 01:00:42,860
So unions of countable sets and intersections of countable sets are going to be still countable.

344
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:53,460
So it's closed with respect to a pair of operations like this fight.

345
01:00:53,510 --> 01:00:58,560
And so we can do similar arguments for the other ones.

346
01:00:58,630 --> 01:01:11,550
So if I have a CO accountable E and a CO accountable B then so my E bar is going

347
01:01:11,550 --> 01:01:18,690
to be accountable and my compliments to it is going to be accountable as well.

348
01:01:23,890 --> 01:01:33,420
And so I can consider the intersection of A and B and the complement of that and by the rules of the complement.

349
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:39,210
I have A with the bar union, B with the bars.

350
01:01:39,390 --> 01:01:51,600
Each of them is countable by definition of a countable set, and then the union of two countable sets is still countable.

351
01:01:53,320 --> 01:02:04,730
Yeah, that would mean the intersection with B is called countable if its complement happens to be accountable sets.

352
01:02:04,860 --> 01:02:10,079
Right. Uh.

353
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:19,170
What else? So we can do a mixture. Let's say A is countable, B is co countable.

354
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:32,940
Then here we can say that E intersection B, so an intersection has a property there.

355
01:02:33,030 --> 01:02:40,230
It's smaller. It's a subset of any of the sense that that comprised that operation.

356
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:50,370
So it's going to be in particular, uh, uh, parts a subset of E and he is countable.

357
01:02:51,400 --> 01:03:00,540
Well, this would mean the E intersection B is also countable because a subset of accountable services do countable.

358
01:03:03,940 --> 01:03:10,990
And that would mean that, uh, intersection is also parts of health.

359
01:03:14,350 --> 01:03:18,690
And so for the union, um,

360
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:30,040
so if I have a union be where is countable and these co countable so I can represent that union

361
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:37,330
is a complement of the intersection with complement of B and a complement of the whole thing.

362
01:03:39,530 --> 01:03:45,320
Right. Again, using the rules of compliment since these operations now.

363
01:03:46,730 --> 01:03:51,170
So a compliment is called countable because a is countable.

364
01:03:52,130 --> 01:04:00,710
Uh, they become, uh, becomes element is countable because these call countable again by definition.

365
01:04:03,540 --> 01:04:07,680
So I'm having a Saab.

366
01:04:08,430 --> 01:04:20,760
That's right here. That's an intersection of countable and countable that were just considered on the previous couple of lines.

367
01:04:21,270 --> 01:04:24,990
So that's going to be accountable set.

368
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:31,740
And a complement of accountable set is called countable.

369
01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:38,640
So this is then the whole thing is called countable and then it follows that.

370
01:04:40,830 --> 01:04:47,010
So such sets by definition of yes are part of its.

371
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:59,780
Right. And then the final thing we just did four pairs of of operands here and we can say that we can use induction.

372
01:05:06,870 --> 01:05:14,470
To expand its. To counter both.

373
01:05:17,810 --> 01:05:27,420
Operations. Okay.

374
01:05:27,660 --> 01:05:44,100
So what did we do? Uh, we characterized how the sigma algebra, uh, looks like that's being generated from all sorts of singletons.

375
01:05:45,540 --> 01:05:51,650
And we found that this is a sigma algebra that only consists of countable and countable sets.

376
01:05:51,660 --> 01:05:58,260
Right? So either countable sets or sets whose complements are countable, right.

377
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:06,210
And barrel. So if I take an open interval so we can see that there is a corollary to this.

378
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:18,400
Morale? Yes. Sets units in particular.

379
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:27,140
It's. That's.

380
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:40,840
Are not accountable. And do not have accountable.

381
01:06:43,540 --> 01:06:58,500
Compliment. Right.

382
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:05,120
And we don't need to go far to get an example of we would just take an open interval.

383
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:11,220
Example, open interval. AB right.

384
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:20,230
So where e. Is strictly smaller than the right.

385
01:07:20,260 --> 01:07:27,160
Neither is this countable nor its complement to the full on the greatest countable right.

386
01:07:27,910 --> 01:07:31,870
So it's not in the yes.

387
01:07:32,050 --> 01:07:36,430
Or if it is, we define the bust, right?

388
01:07:36,910 --> 01:07:44,560
And it follows that yes equals if is smaller.

389
01:07:49,830 --> 01:07:53,520
Well, then, Burrell. So it's not enough.

390
01:07:55,550 --> 01:07:56,580
That's an example.

391
01:07:56,910 --> 01:08:10,980
Singletons are an example of a set that, while being pretty flexible and large at face value, is yet not enough to generate Burrell Sigma algebra.

392
01:08:19,910 --> 01:08:24,020
Okay. So now the next topic.

393
01:08:26,490 --> 01:08:32,760
So we are working the theory that has analogy in the usual calculus.

394
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:38,640
Right. Because we defined domains, we characterize them somehow.

395
01:08:39,210 --> 01:08:47,350
Right. And now we drag other calculus notions into it and find analogs of off limits.

396
01:08:47,370 --> 01:08:50,370
Right. Then later, continuity. And so on.

397
01:08:50,660 --> 01:08:59,100
Now. So the next thing we want to consider is defined limits of sense.

398
01:09:04,090 --> 01:09:12,470
So now actually, if we look at the stuff that we have today, we already have an example of a limit of cents.

399
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:19,880
Right. And that's. So where was that?

400
01:09:19,970 --> 01:09:23,720
That's. That's right here. Right. It's this one.

401
01:09:30,010 --> 01:09:45,069
We just haven't defined it as such. Uh, and from this, you get an impression that countable unions of nested SATs will be defined as a limit of sense,

402
01:09:45,070 --> 01:09:55,950
and also countable and section of nested sets, but in the other direction will also and also be defined as limits of sense.

403
01:09:56,110 --> 01:10:06,700
This is what I am doing. So we are starting with defining, decreasing or increasing sense.

404
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:12,490
So suppose. We have a sequence.

405
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:30,350
In other words, accountable collection of sets. So a K where he goes from one to infinity.

406
01:10:32,390 --> 01:10:37,130
And we would say that this sequence is, uh, decreasing.

407
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:54,710
If. Each next set in the sequence is actually a subset of the previous one.

408
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:05,070
Now, that is for any case. And on a similar fashion the increasing.

409
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:22,580
It's the other way around. If a key is part of a key plus one, and that is for any key.

410
01:11:23,150 --> 01:11:36,440
Now, at this point in time, careless about being a subset and perhaps whether this being a subset allows that the two sets are equal or not.

411
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:46,850
So there are special notations for that. Sometimes they put a bar over the subsets side to indicate that to have it as analog,

412
01:11:46,850 --> 01:11:51,860
less of equal or greater or equal versus strictly less, strictly greater.

413
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:57,349
So when it matters, I will get into details like that.

414
01:11:57,350 --> 01:12:01,660
But for some time we are just not right.

415
01:12:02,990 --> 01:12:12,610
Strictly being a subset and not strictly. Either way, in this type of interpretation, then.

416
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:18,230
Um. So another definition.

417
01:12:22,410 --> 01:12:34,950
So let's define the limits. So I will only define limits for either increasing or decreasing sets.

418
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:42,090
So limits of, uh, decreasing sense.

419
01:12:49,470 --> 01:13:03,730
The M. As in Girls to Infinity is defined as the countable intersection.

420
01:13:03,850 --> 01:13:18,760
And from one to infinity, the aim. And limited and goes to infinity B and of increasing SATs.

421
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:35,340
Will be defined as a union and from one to infinity, the EP writes.

422
01:13:35,340 --> 01:13:41,520
And there's a clear intuition to that. So if SATs are decreasing, then in the limit, I have the core.

423
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:45,360
That's part of every single set in the sequence.

424
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:49,110
So that's the infinite, that's the countable intersection.

425
01:13:49,620 --> 01:13:56,759
But if the SATs are expanding, right, increasing, then the limit will be the union of all of them.

426
01:13:56,760 --> 01:14:01,470
Right? Because each next step is a larger one.

427
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:10,080
And so I will finish at this point for today,

428
01:14:11,190 --> 01:14:19,079
but we will later on look at other concepts related to limits and most notably the limits superior limit,

429
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:28,320

01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:31,370
Okay. That's it for today.
