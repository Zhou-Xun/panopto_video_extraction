1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:09,850
A test result is something someone takes seriously.

2
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:26,670
The chief lecture this morning, he said, would say, I think you're going to hear, as I say, Texas, where are we talking about?

3
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:44,220
So what I would say, you know, I thought that was at least five pages from the start.

4
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:54,870
But some of the kind of things that I didn't know, she said things that really coded.

5
00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:17,849
So I think that so I think that you may have to update or are going to have to wait unless I don't you know,

6
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:24,380
people are unnecessarily, you know, just like I think because you have to go online to download it now.

7
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:32,400
But there's no reason why it shouldn't just be available to do something with it.

8
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:42,300
Like took me like a half an hour to figure out how you could just click okay you announcements you know

9
00:01:42,300 --> 00:02:03,090
homework to again is due next week 26 and we're going to post results and at one point you have any questions.

10
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:09,060
Yeah everyone had a good right away.

11
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:24,299
So this week or today, we're going to focus on infectious disease transmission modeling at its most very nice fall semester course.

12
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:38,980
And also the fact I teach this course site it challenging to try and put this all together in one so and basically when I,

13
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:46,499
I don't want you to get out of this lecture is, you know, the concepts of what transmission modeling do.

14
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:52,500
There's some details on the equations and such, many of which are there.

15
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,340
And just again, show you how these transmission models work.

16
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:09,450
So the first first point here is to be able to just how we formulate infection and the models and how we use what's called the

17
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:21,000
theory of mass action to modify transmission from susceptible from an infected person to an infectious person per susceptibles.

18
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:33,870
We'll talk about seeing our models for that, the classic model that we use in transmission modeling to model outbreaks and endemic situations.

19
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:39,780
And there's a lot of extensions to that and we'll explore some of those extensions also in this lecture.

20
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:52,049
So first, a little history. We get some of this history in that first lecture, but it connects also with this area of mathematical terminology,

21
00:03:52,050 --> 00:04:01,860
which is a broader area within which transmission models within that so designed in the 19th century,

22
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:06,270
there were these two main theories miasma and contagion theory.

23
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:12,160
Both were connected with environment. You connected the environment with how my asthma is.

24
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:18,930
It's that was this idea that there was some filth in the putrid air which people

25
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:22,709
were exposed to and that caused disease as opposed to contagion in theory,

26
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:30,520
which was this idea that there was some agent in the environment which people were exposed to.

27
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:37,620
And so there were different people in different camps that because during this century,

28
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:45,030
William find an example of someone that was embraced the miasma theory he was.

29
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:58,510
Somebody who statistician who kept track of mortality of different diseases, any modeled epidemics using these data that he collected.

30
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,950
He basically said normal curves is epidemic mortality and each.

31
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:12,100
He is what we call somebody that used more traditional statistical analysis to analyze the data.

32
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:22,180
And some of the theories that he developed, which we'll talk about a little later, was really based on the fact that he embraced this miasma theory.

33
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:28,600
And in contrast, we had John Snow, who actually embraced the contagion theory.

34
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:35,110
And we know about John Snow and his research with cholera transmission.

35
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:47,530
And and I mentioned before this idea that he really took the other route where he was more of a deductive type of scientist.

36
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:54,340
But he used what he observed in autopsies and of people that died of cholera.

37
00:05:54,730 --> 00:06:01,970
He saw that the mythology was happening in the gut, and he surmised that something must take.

38
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:05,650
Some people must be ingesting something that is causing that pathology.

39
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:10,329
And that led him to thinking that cholera was waterborne.

40
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:20,170
There were some agents in the water that was causing disease. William Farr was more of an induction as he was observing patterns of disease and

41
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:24,819
trying to fit that to data and then kind of to develop conclusions from that.

42
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:29,530
Who is more observing epidemiologic patterns?

43
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:39,249
So in the 20th century, where germ theory becomes a prevailing theory of disease causation,

44
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:45,970
this leads to this theory of mass action, of transmission of disease.

45
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:54,070
And the idea here is that the number of new cases is proportional to the product of the current number of cases and susceptibles.

46
00:06:54,550 --> 00:07:01,840
Again, the idea that Susceptibles come in contact with cases and that's how transmission occurs.

47
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:11,050
So that's that's the theory. And then William Hammer in the early 1900s uses this idea to model measles epidemics.

48
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:14,140
And here is his basic equation.

49
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:23,620
And this is going to be the really the crux of transmission modeling, the number of cases at some future time, C of T plus one.

50
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:30,390
It's going to be proportional to the number of susceptibles it's at time t the current time.

51
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:37,370
Most times the number of cases, times this transmission rate.

52
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:47,010
And so you use this equation to model measles epidemics in the early 1900s.

53
00:07:49,650 --> 00:08:00,930
And so Sir Ronald Ross takes this same idea, the same mass action idea, that it's the number of susceptibles times, the number of cases at a time.

54
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:05,850
T that allows you to predict what's going to happen and keep one.

55
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:11,670
He takes this idea and uses it to model malaria transmission.

56
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:22,410
And he's actually the first person that came up with the idea that you didn't actually have to eradicate mosquitoes in order to control malaria.

57
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:29,650
You just had to bring the density of mosquitoes to a lower threshold in order to eliminate malaria.

58
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:33,659
So that's very much like this herd immunity concept where you have to bring the

59
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:39,660
number of susceptibles below the threshold by vaccinating people or herd protection.

60
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:44,610
We need to protect enough people and to.

61
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,130
Limit the amount of transmission in order to protect the unprotected.

62
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:57,110
Same concept. He is one of the first to actually think about this idea of a threshold threshold effect.

63
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:09,140
And so. He, when we talked about this in the study design, distinguish between dependent independent happenings.

64
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:18,770
And he develops this conceptual model that says at time transmission occurs, a susceptible person becomes infected.

65
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:24,210
When you do that proportional to this dependent happening,

66
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:30,480
that is and that's basically the rate of acceptable individual coming in contact with an infected.

67
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:35,669
So he was thinking about this. As a directly transmitted process.

68
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:39,930
Even those thinking about malaria, which is really indirectly transmitted, that is,

69
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:49,200
the humans get in contact with mosquitoes, infect mosquitoes, infected mosquitoes, then contact other humans.

70
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:59,730
But it would this was a much simpler model that he was using originally and then becomes this recovery rate,

71
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:06,690
eventually affected people recover and become susceptible again. They didn't include immunity in this process at all.

72
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:14,530
But this model was able again, for him to think about and postulate that, oh,

73
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:23,580
there's a threshold effect that we need to bring the mosquito population down to a lower threshold in order to control malaria.

74
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:36,809
The later McKendrick comes up with the same model, and that's the idea that we got susceptibles in the population.

75
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:46,320
If they contact an infectious person, so susceptibles become infectious or infected here and over a period of time they

76
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,910
recover and become immune and then are no longer part of the transmission process.

77
00:10:52,620 --> 00:11:01,499
So he again comes up with this threshold effect that there's a threshold density of susceptibles needed to cause an epidemic.

78
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:12,030
If you can bring this to that susceptible population below that epidemic level, you can prevent an epidemic in that happens through vaccination.

79
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:21,150
Of course, in the 1920s he was more thinking about how measles epidemics explode and then they crash.

80
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:24,479
And the reason why they crash is that there's no more susceptibles in the

81
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,680
population are not enough susceptible in the population to sustain transmission.

82
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:35,800
So epidemic size increases with population density and that there's a threshold a factor of the two insights that.

83
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:41,720
He came that he developed because of this through this model.

84
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:46,640
And he debunked a couple of theories that actually William FA had, where,

85
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:52,580
first of all, the Susceptibles always need to be exhausted for the epidemic to.

86
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,430
Terminate. And we know now that that's not true, actually.

87
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,800
You can have a few susceptibles out there,

88
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:09,700
but once the probability that an infectious person contacts of susceptible drops below a certain level, that's when you see an epidemic.

89
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:18,490
And also there is any theory that, you know, the virulence of an organism was going to change and decreased during the course of an anti the epidemic.

90
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:22,060
And that's where it would drop the number of cases.

91
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:29,940
So it's this same model that stole the basis for all of the transmission models

92
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:34,080
that we're using today and all the transmission models that are used in COVID.

93
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:43,920
I really, based on this fundamental principle, there a lot more complicated because they take into consideration different networks of transmit

94
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:54,960
transportation networks or social networks when they're projecting and predicting future epidemic patterns.

95
00:12:55,890 --> 00:13:00,430
But fundamentally the base of the model is still the CSIRO model.

96
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:08,650
And so this idea that Susceptibles. Coming in contact with infectious individuals is what causes a transmission event.

97
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:19,929
And this all comes this all this idea comes from the law of mass action through studying chemical reactions.

98
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:29,409
So chemists have had have had this theory for a long time that if you put chemical A and chemical B in a,

99
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:35,230
in a, in a solution, you mix it homogeneously.

100
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:45,580
That the range in which you'll get a product out of that is the rate in which chemical A and B come into contact with each other in the solution.

101
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:50,080
And so that idea, that's where the idea of mass action comes about,

102
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:55,900
that the rate of chemical reaction proportional to the product of the masses of A and B.

103
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:05,330
And so and that's sort of the fundamental model, again, of how we see transmission occurring in populations.

104
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:21,719
So we have this basic model here again and this mass action model, which is basically this product of case, the number of cases a time,

105
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:28,410
T times the number of susceptibles and then this transmission rate,

106
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:35,100
which is basically a proportionality constant, is used to predict the future number of cases in the population.

107
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:40,920
And so this product here is.

108
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:50,339
Is that part of the model that results in this interdependency that is your the risk of

109
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:58,830
susceptible of becoming infected is very much dependent on the disease status of the population.

110
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:11,040
And so that is and so we have a disease that's the population represented by a C and therefore the risk of a susceptible becoming a case is,

111
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,310
is dependent on the disease status.

112
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:23,550
And again, that goes contrary to what you learn in episode 600 with respect to calculating relative risks,

113
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:32,129
where you're actually getting information about each individual and their risk factors and

114
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:36,630
you're looking statistically whether or not they're at risk of people that are exposed,

115
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:41,220
you know, what's the relative risk to those that are exposed versus those that are unexposed?

116
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:45,750
The assumption is that everybody's outcome is independent of each other.

117
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:55,200
So this is a very much different model of risk where we are assuming that because it's a contagious disease,

118
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:00,120
that there is a tendency with respect to cases in the population.

119
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:09,450
So just kind of going through how this model works, this different equation model.

120
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:17,430
How do we calculate the future number of cases and susceptibles and are the recovered?

121
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:23,880
Once we have the current number of susceptible cases and the recovered.

122
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:28,550
So here is the basic equations that we would use.

123
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,710
So at a time step.

124
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:43,710
So some time t plus one in the future, the number of susceptibles decreases by the amount of transmission that occurred during that time step.

125
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:54,810
And that's basically this are times c, t, times SD So we lose just this number of susceptibles and all of those susceptibles now become.

126
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:57,910
KS Future cases cases a time t plus one.

127
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:09,300
And that's. And the assumption there is that all cases from prior cases that occurred in prior times that all recovered.

128
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:19,290
And so that's where we add the current number of cases t to the recovered state.

129
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:30,840
And then so we can just iterate this over time. And you can basically use this model to model actually a epidemic that occurs.

130
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:36,090
You could introduce one case into a population and see what happens.

131
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:44,250
Four different values of transmission rate. So the transmission rate is going to be the transmission potential of the pathogen.

132
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:52,030
So this is a pretty simple model and what are the assumptions of this model?

133
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:59,349
And so we'll go over those. The first assumption is basically homogeneity that we assume that everybody is

134
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:04,030
equally susceptible to infection and everybody has equal capacity to transmit.

135
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:15,820
We know that's not true. But in modeling large population processes like measles outbreaks or the COVID 19 outbreak,

136
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:23,380
often it's an assumption that's acceptable to get out projections in large populations.

137
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:29,830
But often these assumptions have to be dealt with by building in heterogeneity,

138
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:35,620
which we'll talk about later in the class in this lecture that time stat.

139
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:38,300
Is equal to the incubation period.

140
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:47,470
So basically what you're saying is that there is this contact that occurs at time t a transmission event occurs at time t,

141
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:52,960
but it takes one timestamp for those people exposed to now become cases.

142
00:18:54,080 --> 00:19:02,840
So that timestamp is our incubation period for measles and that's what William Hamer used as assumed maybe a week or so.

143
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:14,810
That timestamp was a week and then he had to organize his data into week timestamps in order to use this model to analyze the data.

144
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:24,140
As I mentioned the cases recover the very next times that so we assume that their recovery is quick.

145
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:32,459
Infection. And so again, we're assuming infection spreads directly from case susceptible.

146
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:41,880
So this model is not about a vector borne disease or it doesn't or it doesn't take into account that a vector borne dynamic

147
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:48,900
or a waterborne disease where people shed into the environment and then other people are exposed to the environment,

148
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,059
and then individuals have fixed probability of contact to each other.

149
00:19:54,060 --> 00:20:06,060
So we don't have a social network where we might think about how different people are connected to people depending on social structure.

150
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:10,980
So all that's assumed to be fixed in this model.

151
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:16,679
So again, when we think about these models,

152
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:24,990
we just we want to always be aware of the assumptions of each of these models in order to know how applicable that is working in question.

153
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:30,110
Because as you know, all models are wrong, some are useful.

154
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:33,180
And so that's that's the spirit of these kinds of transmission models.

155
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:38,340
Is this a useful. This is. Are these assumptions okay?

156
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:42,450
And is this system simplified model useful in a given question you're asking?

157
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:53,020
And if not, you've got to make you've got to add in some. Added heterogeneity or complexity into the model.

158
00:20:53,740 --> 00:21:01,900
So I think I showed this earlier, but this is the basic idea of how these our models are built.

159
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:09,370
And so there's there's similarities in transmission processes across most infectious diseases.

160
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:14,840
So you start with susceptible people, which you can be susceptible for years.

161
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:21,889
There's at some point an infection that occurs and then there's this latency where the virus,

162
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:26,330
in this case we're talking about viruses are slowly starting to increase in the body.

163
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:35,610
At some point, there's enough virus in the body, that person's infectious, and you can be infectious prior to being ill.

164
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:41,340
But there are some diseases where you're not infectious until you become ill.

165
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:47,250
But at some point you're you become infectious and at some point you become symptomatic.

166
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:54,030
So this is so latency would be this period in which you from point an infection to

167
00:21:54,030 --> 00:22:00,540
being infectious and incubation is from the point of infection to become symptomatic.

168
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:07,320
And at some point you recover and your the viral load starts decreasing.

169
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:10,860
At the same time that your antibodies start increasing,

170
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:19,350
at some point you become immune and that immunity can last for different periods of time depending on the disease.

171
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:24,390
So this gives us our, you know, our SARS model.

172
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:31,470
If we include latency in the model, we actually call that in our model.

173
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:35,880
So being exposed but no, it's still not infectious.

174
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:41,220
If we ignore the latency, then we go from susceptible to infectious symptom.

175
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:51,740
To me, and that's your last, I guess our model. So this is the basic natural history of most viral and bacterial infections.

176
00:22:53,170 --> 00:23:01,210
And so how do we how do we differentiate between one disease process or another?

177
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:05,810
So there is parametric parametric ways we can distinguish them.

178
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:13,220
So, for instance, measles confers like lifelong immunity as a long latency periods you may include.

179
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:22,190
So you incorporate that into the model by having assuming that once you become you're in the removed state, you stay there for life.

180
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:33,270
Typhoid fever confers just short term immunity. So you may have an arrow that returns people from the state back to the state.

181
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:39,510
Polio confers lifelong immunity and short latency, and gonorrhea confers no immunity.

182
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:46,770
So we can make we can model each of these separately by just changing the parameter values of our serum model.

183
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:52,200
There's also structural differences that.

184
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:57,720
Happen are true for these different disease processes.

185
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:00,480
Gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted disease.

186
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:12,360
So there's a reason, first, to stratified these social social groups in order to account for the sexual transmission.

187
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,529
Cholera is a water borne disease. You may want to model the environment.

188
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:22,920
We'll look at that briefly and think about the environment as a reservoir for pathogens.

189
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:29,940
Dengue is a vector borne disease. You may want to incorporate the mosquito in the model.

190
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:35,430
And so those are structural ways in which you can distinguish between two diseases.

191
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:44,700
And so we'll look at both the parameters and the structure of the model in these kind of slides.

192
00:24:48,600 --> 00:25:00,419
So here's our Syria model. And what we have in is, is three state variables that, as I add, are your state variables.

193
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:08,700
That is the number of susceptibles in the population, number of infections in the population, number of removed or immune in the population.

194
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:17,490
So we're assuming people that are latent aren't latently exposed but not infectious, are not included in this simplified model.

195
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:23,360
So we're assuming that latency is short. And then we have three parameters in the model.

196
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:30,070
You actually have new data and delta.

197
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:38,770
The MEU is basically represents the birth and death rate.

198
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:43,150
The people are born and this becomes important because for measles.

199
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:49,290
A measles epidemic will crash. Because there's not enough susceptibles.

200
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:53,840
Way in which will get you get susceptibles is when you get a newborn.

201
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:58,100
So over a year or so or two years as.

202
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:05,650
As you get newborns, there's new susceptibles into the pool. Viruses like dengue are similar to that.

203
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:13,479
You'll get a dengue outbreak. Most of the population is immune over years to, let's say, a dengue serotype.

204
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:20,469
Dengue one over years with a birth rate of you start gaining and increasing the number of

205
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:24,970
susceptibles and that population becomes susceptible again for an out to an outbreak.

206
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:36,250
So immune is an important parameter in these models. It's it keeps track of the population dynamics of the of the population.

207
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:39,970
Death rate could also be migration rate. You're leaving the area.

208
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:50,230
You could also represent and you could also represent interest in being introduced into the risk group.

209
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:56,050
So for a sexually transmitted disease, you know, that's in people that become sexually active,

210
00:26:56,530 --> 00:27:00,130
right, then maybe that's the that's the new for this model.

211
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:06,730
And when they people become no longer sexually active, that can be a way in which they leave the risk group.

212
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:09,860
So there is. And migration again, could be another way.

213
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:22,480
So so these this population dynamic rates could also represent risk entering and leaving risk groups or immigration.

214
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:32,500
The recovery rate is Delta. So that's the rate in which an infectious person is no longer infectious.

215
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:35,980
So that person is no longer a risk to the community.

216
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:44,490
So that recovery rate in a very important parameter to know and understand and parameters.

217
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:51,969
And there's the transmission rate. That's the rate in which people go from susceptible to infectious.

218
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:53,350
And we talked about this before.

219
00:27:53,350 --> 00:28:02,290
The transmission rate has a social component that is the rate in which people contact each other and a biologic component.

220
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:08,440
That's infectivity, how infectious that pathogen is, how susceptible the individual is.

221
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:24,549
So these are the equations which you don't need to know for this class is what we do in the class.

222
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:28,870
I teach next semester. We actually work through these equations,

223
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:42,309
but suffice it to say that the left side of the equation is just telling you it represents the changes in numbers of susceptibles in fact,

224
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:46,630
just removed over time. Are they increasing or decreasing?

225
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:51,700
So these derivatives, DST, DADT, DADT is just talking about the change.

226
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:59,920
The right side of the equation talks about what are the forces that caused the change?

227
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:11,329
So for instance, you'll get more susceptibles if there is a higher birth rate or over time as as there are birth in the population,

228
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:17,420
you get more susceptibles you lose susceptibles if when there's transmission

229
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:22,270
events that occur because those susceptibles move into the infectious state.

230
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:33,800
So this transmission event that was seed times, as in the previous models here, is that sometimes I this transmission rate represents.

231
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:47,600
Susceptibles becoming. Infectious and then infectious people leave when they recover and they enter into the recovery stage.

232
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:55,910
So the right side is just kind of bookkeeping over time how people are entering and leaving these different states.

233
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:57,800
And so these are force of trends.

234
00:29:58,010 --> 00:30:05,810
You can think about transmission as a force that changes the state values, the variables in the state, the state variable values.

235
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:11,750
Birth and death rates are forces that change these values, and recovery rate is a force.

236
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:19,480
So this basically just summarizes. And it keeps what's happening over time.

237
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:28,960
And if you you know, you simulate this in R or MATLAB, you can simulate epidemic curves and endemic steady state values.

238
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:38,380
And you can look at interventions by changing these different parameter values and see what happens over time.

239
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:42,480
That's a decision today.

240
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:59,360
So we had these different forces, basically four forces that are depicted here, birth and death rates, recovery rates and transmission rates.

241
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:09,230
And those are the four forces that are that are governing how this enemy logic states that these populations are changing.

242
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:23,520
So these same models can mimic and model endemic conditions and they can model epidemic conditions.

243
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:29,270
So if we look at an epidemic situation for these models,

244
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:39,080
one way to look at this is that so that if if we have a short term dynamic that is an epidemic is happening in a very short time frame.

245
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:46,500
We don't need to consider the birth and death rates. And if we think about an epidemic as possible, if the.

246
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:53,110
In fact, as people are increasing the end of it. In fact, this group is increasing.

247
00:31:53,650 --> 00:32:01,860
Cases are increasing. Therefore, this equation on the right side has to be greater than zero.

248
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:06,930
And you wind up with this equation, which is basically saying.

249
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:18,380
If your threshold number is set, doubles is greater than your recovery rate of your transmission rate, then an epidemic is possible.

250
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:24,149
So basically it's saying that you need enough is enough.

251
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:32,040
Susceptibles. In the population governed by Delta over Beda in order to have an outbreak occur.

252
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:41,600
And so this is how we can look at this threshold of fact that McKendrick came up with.

253
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:51,090
When you analyze this. Yes, they are a model. And we can use this for thinking about how do we minimize the potential for an

254
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:56,370
epidemic to occur by decreasing the number of susceptibles in the population.

255
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:06,090
And so there's different features like the size of the map, the size of the epidemic,

256
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:16,020
the timing of the number of susceptibles after the epidemic that you can surmise from the equation.

257
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:22,230
So here's the peak number of cases, the time to peak, which actually characterizes how.

258
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:35,260
How explosive an epidemic is. And so the Obama dynamics of an epidemic in a function of the parameter values,

259
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:43,180
in this case it's the recovery rate and the transmission rate as well as how many susceptibles there are in the population.

260
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:54,730
For an endemic feature of an essay or model.

261
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:59,380
We actually want to understand, well, what happens when?

262
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:05,020
These changes to Susceptibles, in fact, that are recovered are not changing.

263
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:13,450
There there zero that basically DST and DTT equals zero.

264
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:18,730
You do some algebra which we don't need to focus on here.

265
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:27,460
But the fact that that again, when these derivatives are zero, that means that the number of susceptibles never infected or not changing.

266
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:33,129
And when both S and I are not changing.

267
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:43,990
Our transmission system is at steady state and this is how we can derive what are not is for our reproductive number is for the population.

268
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:50,049
And that's again the reproductive number is the number of cases caused by one

269
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:55,900
infectious person that enters into a population of completely susceptible people.

270
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:58,990
And how many cases is that person?

271
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:09,870
So in COVID, people are seeing how they are not increased from two to 3 to 6, seven, eight, even for the armed crime.

272
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:19,780
So that should that's basically saying how infectious how what's the epidemic potential of the pathogen is defined by this number.

273
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:33,680
And so. What goes into the reproductive number is the transmission rate data, the rate of production producing new cases.

274
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:42,920
And then the rate of leaving the infectious state. And you can either leave it because you recover or you die, or you leave the risk group.

275
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:48,160
And that's the view that the rate of leaving this infectious state is Delta Plus MU

276
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:53,460
and one over Delta Plus MU is actually the average time an individual is infectious.

277
00:35:53,470 --> 00:36:00,790
So the average duration that someone's infectious in this same model is one over Delta plus MU.

278
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:08,130
And so then it's just the product of these two factors that give us our reproductive number.

279
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:14,630
So it's the product. It's the number of new cases, the rate of new cases that's being generated.

280
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:18,590
Times how long someone can generate new cases.

281
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:23,440
Gives you the reproductive number.

282
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:29,590
So if you can generate two cases per day and you're infectious for two days.

283
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,120
You on average will generate four cases. And that.

284
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:42,100
So you're not just for that one individual on average can infect grade or in fact for other people.

285
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:56,950
And so if this product is greater than one, you're going to sustain transmission and you'll have an endemic situation.

286
00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:04,780
And your goal is for that product to be less than one, and therefore, you eliminate the disease.

287
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:09,280
So the the goal is trying to decrease.

288
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:18,860
The transmission rate. So how that is and mostly that's contact masking, social distancing.

289
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:19,490
We'll do that.

290
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:28,780
Or you can decrease the duration in which someone is infectious through screening programs because a lot of people are infectious asymptomatically.

291
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:35,239
So again, for a lot of studies, there's screening programs to try and find asymptomatically,

292
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:40,850
infectious people and treat them and you decrease the duration of infection.

293
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:50,780
So those are ways in which you can try and decrease the reproductive number and get it closer and closer to one towards elimination.

294
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:57,630
And we can talk about when we talk about it. As dies in a few weeks.

295
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:04,230
You know, we talk about the challenge of decreasing this number for less than one because you can you know,

296
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:11,130
for many of these diseases like gonorrhea and syphilis, they're very treatable with antibiotics.

297
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:15,540
But the question is, how do you find everybody that's infectious,

298
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:22,170
that's infected because of the stigma of STIs and the fact that they're people are asymptomatic?

299
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:29,729
So the challenge. Of getting this down to one is is is great.

300
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:36,540
And if there is enough resources, we've shown that we can eliminate something like syphilis and gonorrhea.

301
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:40,230
When we take those resources away, we see how it just comes right back.

302
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:48,680
And so these are these are important this are not is an important concept to be thinking about this.

303
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:59,870
You know, I'm showing you how it's how we codify with respect to parameter values for this simple model which is applicable.

304
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:05,870
Even if we make our model more complex, this concept stays the same, basically.

305
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:19,090
So. This basically just summarizes that, you know, we have easy our models can produce endemic and epidemic behavior.

306
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:27,700
When we think about epidemics, we think about this threshold of susceptibles needed to cause to result in an epidemic.

307
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:37,810
And we target and think about endemic dynamics. We think about this are not in a reproduction number and driving are not less than one.

308
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:51,620
So we're going to run through different ways in which we can extend the model.

309
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:59,070
And again, the details here, I'm not expecting you to know with respect to all these different equations that pop up,

310
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:09,090
but just to understand what the added process is here so we can extend the, say, our model to account for environmental transmission.

311
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:16,210
By the simplest way, is to include an environment, state e equity, water.

312
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:22,570
It could be fomites, it could be air. And so infectious individuals.

313
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:30,240
Deposit. At a rate of alpha pathogens into the environment.

314
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:36,290
And the idea that can be coughing into the air.

315
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:44,900
It could be. Or you think an oral pathogen that could be shedding into water.

316
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:50,810
It could be, you know, contaminated hands, contaminating fomites.

317
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:56,270
So there's various ways in which infectious people can deposit pathogens in the environment.

318
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:59,210
And there's different ways in which to settle. People come to pick it up.

319
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:10,220
Ingesting ingesting water, inhaling contamination in the air, touching fomites and then touching your eyes or nose.

320
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:14,770
And so. And then in. So this. New.

321
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:22,500
This extension to the ACA model allows us to think about interventions that are more environmental.

322
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:33,679
We talked about screening, vaccination, distancing, as you know, interventions with respect to an essay, our model.

323
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:44,900
But with this environmental process, we can think about cleaning the environment, we can think about water treatment, we can think about ventilation.

324
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:58,310
So it allows us to think about a lot of the environmental interventions and more directly when we add this and when we add this state.

325
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:06,720
So this just shows you that. Are not gets a little bit more complicated.

326
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:20,640
Pie is our is basically our infectivity parameter and then alpha over gamma becomes really our.

327
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:30,970
Total pathogens deposited into the environment during their contagious period so that that instead of that recovery rate,

328
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:41,950
now we have pathogens being deposited into the environment and then this pick up, this becomes our contact rate, basically.

329
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:49,490
So again, I don't expect you to memorize this equation but just to see that are not gets more

330
00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:57,920
complicated but it's informative because now it all of a sudden has factors that are.

331
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:04,150
Characterize the pathogen in the environment, such as how long does it pan out?

332
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:10,430
How persistent is the pathogen environment? And if we treat the water, can we change that view?

333
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:16,880
Shedding into the environment, using masks that are different ways in which we can minimize shedding.

334
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:25,820
So we now explicitly in our are not calculation, have environmental factors that we can intervene on.

335
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:39,870
This is just showing again, when we talk when we talk about fecal oral pathogens, we'll talk about the diagram.

336
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:46,800
This is. This is a classic diagram used in water and sanitation work,

337
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:54,629
where we look at ways in which feces from a contaminated person enters into the environment.

338
00:43:54,630 --> 00:44:01,200
Fluids, fingers, food, fomites it's got represents this diagram and ways in which.

339
00:44:02,970 --> 00:44:06,540
Susceptible. People can become exposed through contact in this environment.

340
00:44:06,990 --> 00:44:12,180
And this is just to show that this is work that our research group is working on,

341
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:20,309
where we can extend this as our model to look at lots of different environmental pathways water,

342
00:44:20,310 --> 00:44:29,130
food and hands, and look at different interventions, mimicking the modeling, this F diagram.

343
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:36,090
And there's a lot of different questions we can we can address, such as completeness, you know,

344
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:46,050
what are how do we block all the sufficient pathways, those pathways that are sufficient to transmit in order to decrease the disease burden?

345
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:58,610
So a vector borne disease is is another way to expand the model.

346
00:44:59,270 --> 00:45:02,810
So we now have a transmission model. Again, this is more the.

347
00:45:03,970 --> 00:45:11,650
Ross model where we have susceptibles and in fact we don't have the removed, but we have that transmission model for humans.

348
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:19,410
We also have it for. Mosquitoes. And so that's the main extension of this transmission model.

349
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:26,700
What we're doing when we're looking at vector borne diseases is that we now need to consider the mosquito.

350
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:35,370
And this is an old diagram depicting ah not again just like in the are not for

351
00:45:35,370 --> 00:45:41,730
environmental mediated pathogens like waterborne diseases in food or pathogens.

352
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:50,460
This Arnott now incorporates a lot into the logical parameters, the fighting rate of the mosquito.

353
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:57,120
How long the mosquito lives in those are become the important factors in this new,

354
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:05,159
more complicated Arnott that can be used to think about ways in which we can reduce

355
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:12,629
our not towards one end and decrease the less than one in order to eliminate.

356
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:16,580
So controlling mosquito control is a huge piece of.

357
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:28,079
And the last piece is is extension that I want to present.

358
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:34,350
Here is how we incorporate social structure. We'll talk about a little bit more about this in the lecture.

359
00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:41,360
Social structures become critical with respect to lots of transmission.

360
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:47,329
SDI is just one example, but understanding kinship, sexual partners, socioeconomic statics,

361
00:46:47,330 --> 00:46:52,030
demographics tell us because we don't have a homogeneous population like this.

362
00:46:52,190 --> 00:46:59,630
Our model is assuming people congregate in different social strata and social groups and.

363
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:09,390
Our goal in incorporating social structures is to figure out who is spreading the disease, what groups are spreading?

364
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:12,990
Who are the superspreaders? The high risk people.

365
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:21,450
In order to better target interventions. And this idea of core and non-core social structures is something that was developed in the

366
00:47:21,450 --> 00:47:28,080
eighties by I'm actually a mathematician but has been taken on conceptually as an important.

367
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:42,160
Concept in SDI. Control where we're looking down core populations that are small, that are high, high risk groups.

368
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:51,670
And then there's the bulk of the noncore population that's large, and it's the core population that can sustain transmission in the non core group.

369
00:47:54,520 --> 00:48:03,980
And so. You already mentioned this so that this is just depicts this idea that you've got into.

370
00:48:06,810 --> 00:48:10,940
A non-core group that may that's a large part of the population.

371
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:19,080
There's a core group that's a small part. They mix in some way and and people spend a lot of time thinking about way.

372
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:25,680
We had a model of this mixing and this is just showing how we have, again, two groups.

373
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:34,439
What we want, we we can use two different transmission models to represent a core group and

374
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:39,090
a non-core group and we need to model how they interact and that these data.

375
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:48,460
One one and made it one. Twos are the ways in which people contact each other with in-group and the

376
00:48:48,470 --> 00:48:53,800
beta one to invade it to one is the ways in which they contact between groups.

377
00:48:57,430 --> 00:49:08,650
And so this became an important again concept in this literature and the way in which public health people think about controlling,

378
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:16,180
looking for these poor high risk groups that are driving transmission in the population.

379
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:27,239
This again. We'll talk about more. Also, this idea that sexual behavior is not static.

380
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:32,140
So it's not like people are in this core group all their life now that people are in this nightclub.

381
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:39,720
This kind of depicts with respect to anal sex.

382
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:50,480
That people move. And this is actual real data that people are moving from state to state in different periods of their lives.

383
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:58,360
And so all risk groups have individuals changing their behavior between each collection cycle.

384
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:08,570
So for example, here it's saying for any given time step in this model, 73% of the people stay in this low risk category.

385
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:17,260
But it also says that any at any given time, a lot of people are entering in from higher risk categories,

386
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:22,180
groups into this low risk group and they're also leading.

387
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:29,330
And so groups. This is this is just illustrating.

388
00:50:31,110 --> 00:50:34,470
That risk factor behavior is dynamic and not static.

389
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:44,790
And the fact that even if most people are in this low risk state at any given time so that's if you did a cross-sectional survey,

390
00:50:44,790 --> 00:50:52,919
you would see most people are in this low risk state. At some point in this person's life, they're going to be in these higher risk states.

391
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:58,229
And so you miss that when you only look at it as a static variable in a cross-sectional

392
00:50:58,230 --> 00:51:04,650
survey and only through longitudinal surveys can you actually get at how this dynamic works.

393
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:18,500
So it didn't animate quite right. This is the last one last behavioral extension that I was going to introduce.

394
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:22,670
And this is a model that we did for COVID 19 and quarantine.

395
00:51:22,670 --> 00:51:28,700
And this idea that when we think about how long we want to recommend a quarantine time,

396
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:36,919
we need to think about behavior and the probability that someone will be able to quarantine for 14 days.

397
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:45,280
The 14 days was the original time that was recommended for quarantine because 14 days of the maximum time in which somebody could be infectious,

398
00:51:45,290 --> 00:51:53,870
like it ranged from two days to 14 days, but people wanted to air on the side of caution, so they went to 14 days.

399
00:51:54,260 --> 00:52:00,830
The problem with that kind of recommendation is that you wind up with people that

400
00:52:01,070 --> 00:52:06,980
aren't able to either don't want to comply or not able to comply for economic reasons.

401
00:52:07,550 --> 00:52:13,760
And so this is again, this is this is a very complicated CRM model.

402
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:18,739
So it has susceptibles the is represented by latent.

403
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:23,780
Now AI is the AI and then R is here.

404
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:29,209
So I can be divided into symptomatic and asymptomatic people.

405
00:52:29,210 --> 00:52:35,810
And that's why we have a lot of states. But the main part of this model of interest is that there are people that are

406
00:52:36,110 --> 00:52:40,999
being quarantined here and there are people that are leaving the quarantine.

407
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,500
So once you leave the quarantine, you're transmitting, once you're in,

408
00:52:44,510 --> 00:52:48,680
as long as you're in quarantine, you're you're not transmitting when you're infectious.

409
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:57,230
And so this is the basic model structure. And these are the basic the idea here that.

410
00:52:58,430 --> 00:53:02,719
Guidance of COVID 19 quarantine duration, often based on the maximum reserves.

411
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:11,720
That's what I mentioned, that we often base it on the 14 days, but these longer quarantine times maybe subject to diminishing returns.

412
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:16,490
And so the conclusions here is when you run this model.

413
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:22,370
Is that the first few days in the quarantine is the most critical to control spread.

414
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:24,410
And even when compliance is high,

415
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:33,630
a ten day quarantine would be as effective as in lowering transmission as a 14 day and uncertain noncompliance scenario.

416
00:53:33,650 --> 00:53:37,940
So the key thing is how do you model compliance?

417
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:42,020
Five day quarantine may be as protective as 14 day. That is.

418
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:48,050
We did this model early on in the pandemic when 14 day was recommended.

419
00:53:48,050 --> 00:53:49,700
Right now, five days is recommended.

420
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:59,960
I think the value of this model, though, I think we went to five days for a lot of reasons, but not necessarily for a deep understanding of.

421
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:08,400
The dynamics of compliance and transmission. And so the value of this model is that it makes again explicit this.

422
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:20,980
The dynamics of how you know, how people. Quarantine and and the dynamics of decision making on how they decide or not

423
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:25,180
decide to actually quarantine depending on the length of the quarantine period.

424
00:54:27,850 --> 00:54:34,809
So this is a whirlwind tour of transmission modeling showing you like the basic S.R. model,

425
00:54:34,810 --> 00:54:38,770
which is the classic model that we're using different ways you can extend it.

426
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:44,230
If you have vector borne diseases or if you want to add social structure and behavior.

427
00:54:47,690 --> 00:54:59,770
And yeah, we'll revisit some of these concepts and weave in later lectures when we talk about fecal oral pathogens, respiratory diseases, nasty eyes.

428
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:07,700
So. That.

429
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:20,350
Any questions we would like? So I developed these questions for this topic.

430
00:55:23,330 --> 00:55:27,910
So the first is a transmission model to provide a causal representation of transmission.

431
00:55:28,030 --> 00:55:37,360
So it's mechanistic. As we saw, it actually models the way we think the prior disease process occurs.

432
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:41,230
And they they can be used to predict what's happening in the future,

433
00:55:41,410 --> 00:55:50,530
much like we do for whether we have mechanistic models to predict if it's going to rain or not in the next week.

434
00:55:51,130 --> 00:55:57,960
And we've used this prediction in COVID 19 quite a bit, using models to predict when the peak will occur.

435
00:55:57,970 --> 00:56:05,470
But in this case, they can. But they can also provide this mechanistic explanation for why an intervention works or doesn't work.

436
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:10,990
And as I illustrated with this COVID 19 and quarantine example.

437
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:18,070
So the first discussion question is how public health sector may use transmission models to develop policy.

438
00:56:19,430 --> 00:56:26,150
For example, for example, surveillance or control strategies and and provide some specific examples in your discussion.

439
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:32,150
So that's the first question. Second is just how the concept of reproductive number is useful in public health.

440
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:38,870
And I think all of you have been exposed to are not in the COVID 19 pandemic.

441
00:56:40,570 --> 00:56:43,750
Third is a little bit more methodological.

442
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:54,310
Compare and contrast the logistic regression model, something that you often use in bread and butter for epidemiology with the transmission model.

443
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:58,150
When, why, when and why you would use one over the other?

444
00:56:58,510 --> 00:57:05,830
I provide a few hints here about hypothesis testing versus generating and also deduction versus induction.

445
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:14,860
If you talk about a rule earlier and the last was compare and contrast epidemic and endemic features of transmission from a perspective of control.

446
00:57:15,730 --> 00:57:24,430
And you can use measles and norovirus, an example of diseases that appear as outbreaks like you don't see norovirus,

447
00:57:24,430 --> 00:57:28,780
you don't see measles around and all of a sudden you see explosive outbreaks that occur.

448
00:57:30,370 --> 00:57:36,040
In contrast, diseases like gonorrhea or disease that are always around endemically.

449
00:57:36,550 --> 00:57:44,450
And so when we're trying to control, then we're trying to control an endemic disease process as opposed to an esoteric process.

450
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:46,240
So I just wanted you to think about it.

451
00:57:47,170 --> 00:57:54,460
You know, think about it in the context of assessing or model how you compare and contrast this epidemic versus the endemic features of transmission.

452
00:57:58,580 --> 00:58:04,160
Okay. So maybe I was already 1230, maybe 10 minutes there.

453
00:58:04,430 --> 00:58:09,580
So in your groups to discuss these and then we can record.

454
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:25,970
In a business sense, you have to wonder, how are you holding up?

455
00:58:30,970 --> 00:58:46,270
But it should be also. It looks as though you're going to be feeling.

456
00:58:47,270 --> 00:58:58,040
I didn't know you went through what you're hoping to do really well trained for it.

457
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:04,790
Didn't know it because it was stolen from my brothers.

458
00:59:05,730 --> 00:59:11,870
Yeah. Yeah.

459
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:20,320
Like I was like, you know, you're good. I want to do something.

460
00:59:22,460 --> 01:00:03,200
I thought I was going to go to the wedding while I was going through about I think it was like age 45 for tomorrow or as soon as I was saying,

461
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:10,010
yeah, like I'm going to be okay to watch the game, right?

462
01:00:10,270 --> 01:00:33,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

463
01:00:33,830 --> 01:01:02,900
And the administration cares about 68 and 1979 and the Arizona, which I really, really like certainly sources.

464
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:11,770
Yeah. Okay. So, so I was just talking about how something like that really.

465
01:01:18,190 --> 01:01:43,190
U.S. prices are going up on that and it's never going to be like.

466
01:01:46,150 --> 01:01:50,360
Oh, like that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

467
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:58,400
And she's, you know, like, every single day.

468
01:01:59,390 --> 01:02:04,280
So, like, predicting Christmas. Anyway, I love easy money.

469
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:24,340
Like infection severity or like helping you out movements like today you should adhere to.

470
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:36,210
She's like, Oh, yeah, you know, just be amazing.

471
01:02:36,980 --> 01:03:02,430
And I just keep thinking of, you know, higher is usually the question for me about the book.

472
01:03:04,210 --> 01:03:15,480
I go, I got a lot of 37 I need, so I went to go get water and all I had was my water bottle testing.

473
01:03:16,070 --> 01:03:22,070
So I was just, I was only one there and then doctor or which one is reserved rooms and why.

474
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:27,590
So you're saying like it would affect like where you would have that?

475
01:03:27,590 --> 01:03:44,410
I was like, why do they have a security guard in the garden distribution system?

476
01:03:45,350 --> 01:03:56,720
You know, it's a nice building. And it was referencing the restricted existence that was that was the Coast Guard.

477
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:02,510
They loved stickers that they had,

478
01:04:02,660 --> 01:04:12,350
hospitals that make you feel you go anywhere if they feel like it's right in front of the shoes or something like that,

479
01:04:16,610 --> 01:04:22,820
I guess we could actually something like a little more time and again.

480
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:27,500
I mean, it is yes.

481
01:04:27,890 --> 01:04:37,910
It's like the risk is is always the number of incidents or whatever it is usually

482
01:04:39,290 --> 01:04:49,550
that includes like infectious issues and maybe epidemic with ongoing engagements.

483
01:04:49,580 --> 01:04:56,200
But it was like, oh yeah, yeah, different services.

484
01:04:57,470 --> 01:05:08,000
It does not have better job after this conference in other countries.

485
01:05:08,870 --> 01:05:14,910
You know, there's not like assignments.

486
01:05:15,860 --> 01:05:20,959
I think you do see what sounds like to me.

487
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:25,880
Like I'm just sort of like I looked at Katie when I'm like, when I like I'm on the fence about something and then he gives me and I'm like,

488
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:34,370
okay, if Kenny says it's probably legitimate, but I obviously don't care.

489
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:46,490
So yeah, I'm trying to set it up. It's not topics and answer, so it's like, why are you trying to like, I don't do it.

490
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:54,139
Oh yeah. So you're saying that the transmission model is on the phone because I afraid to ask, because I thought it'd be stressful,

491
01:05:54,140 --> 01:06:10,520
but I like I never got multiple calls for this because, you know, she's getting ready for what some people are going to say.

492
01:06:12,290 --> 01:06:13,520
But I also think I think like.

493
01:06:15,300 --> 01:06:31,379
It would make it a little bit easier because I know you're in the Somalia zero a few years, so maybe it wasn't something that you did.

494
01:06:31,380 --> 01:06:36,030
Microbiology and immunology. Yes, sir.

495
01:06:37,540 --> 01:06:49,040
You didn't understand that? I didn't understand why it was like any other.

496
01:06:51,060 --> 01:06:54,360
I thought we had to go along with it.

497
01:06:54,690 --> 01:06:58,530
It's very flexible, right? Yeah.

498
01:06:59,130 --> 01:07:12,070
BE Yeah. They really think that if I was somebody like Springfield and they are also going to be talking to somebody in Pakistan.

499
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:16,870
Oh, my God. Yeah.

500
01:07:17,110 --> 01:07:42,510
Like this current crisis in the U.S., is this subject psychologist or like, I really tried to do my job as a 48 year old, as well as to talk to him.

501
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:52,470
And so he doesn't have to be the one to pick up.

502
01:07:52,940 --> 01:07:59,310
Yeah, I think that's what it was like the five tracks.

503
01:07:59,910 --> 01:08:25,320
Yeah. Like a very general, which actually has something to do with the whole side of the story.

504
01:08:29,970 --> 01:08:50,820
I really think they teach, like, for, like, you know, if you want to help students.

505
01:08:51,350 --> 01:09:03,420
I mean, I heard the whole thing, but it's just you have to try to do the job market position.

506
01:09:07,060 --> 01:09:13,740
So it's managing. Do you want to get up to that one?

507
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:18,810
I mean. Yeah, but I mean, this is not your fault.

508
01:09:19,620 --> 01:09:23,400
Much for any more like rate of execution.

509
01:09:24,210 --> 01:09:38,250
I want to call it a little bit of action surveillance because like obviously you want to look at some of this stuff.

510
01:09:38,250 --> 01:09:49,530
And I think you're right about where first thing in the morning.

511
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:57,770
Okay. You might have to just make it 24 hours or whatever.

512
01:10:02,340 --> 01:10:04,890
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

513
01:10:05,490 --> 01:10:29,430
Because you know about nutrition groups that would give you a call continuously and just being advised that it is it's not about her.

514
01:10:29,430 --> 01:10:33,629
Like you think it's just about this.

515
01:10:33,630 --> 01:10:44,760
I mean, if you'd asked me, it's it's about the sports. So I said about Arizona, what are some of the really good I guess I know.

516
01:10:44,820 --> 01:10:48,090
Yeah. Most women are actually just.

517
01:10:48,300 --> 01:10:52,310
And it's not that I'm worried about that.

518
01:10:52,340 --> 01:10:57,690
Okay, let's spend the last 10 minutes reporting back and all that.

519
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:03,660
It's a group seven. What do you discuss about that?

520
01:11:03,660 --> 01:11:11,610
First question, the how transmission models can be useful in the public health sector.

521
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:21,020
You kind of talked about how. It can guide how long you want someone to quarantine for if they get infected or if and how long you want to

522
01:11:21,180 --> 01:11:26,499
isolate for if they come into contact with the case as well as like if you want to have masking policies,

523
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:31,570
if you want to have distancing policies or vaccination policies and how all those are working.

524
01:11:33,330 --> 01:11:36,720
Right. I think as the last example,

525
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:47,130
why the utility to that is that we can be the public health sector to be much more specific about why cancer and also instead of saying.

526
01:11:48,830 --> 01:11:51,950
They jump from 14 day, ten days into five days.

527
01:11:51,980 --> 01:11:57,080
Sometimes it's more about politics and pressure. No, there's not a well thought out.

528
01:11:58,540 --> 01:12:00,960
Understanding of what are the factors that go into it.

529
01:12:01,690 --> 01:12:08,940
So developing quarantine policy is a good example where these models can help you think through the process.

530
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:19,020
I just thinking how like at the beginning it would be difficult. To do that.

531
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:25,560
I feel like I'm reliving, beginning to like thinking about the first few days.

532
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:31,920
And now that it's five days late, so much goes into these policies.

533
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:37,380
And it's I can see that if someone's not does not have a lot of stake in public health,

534
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:42,990
that they would be frustrated by the change in the different policies and whatnot.

535
01:12:43,410 --> 01:12:46,830
But sometimes the policy changes as we learn more.

536
01:12:46,860 --> 01:12:47,290
Yeah.

537
01:12:47,310 --> 01:12:54,840
And that that should be something that's that frustrating, that it's not like you're just changing and changing because we didn't know something.

538
01:12:55,020 --> 01:13:02,040
Yeah, but we understood that by going to 14 days, we only were protecting.

539
01:13:03,570 --> 01:13:07,470
There's only a few percent of people that would be infectious that long,

540
01:13:07,590 --> 01:13:19,970
that we could have easily argued a ten day period that was, you know, much more manageable and didn't know you.

541
01:13:19,990 --> 01:13:24,060
Changing for days can be a lot more because two weeks are a long time.

542
01:13:24,690 --> 01:13:34,020
So I think we didn't know actually a lot more then because this disease is not is novel in many ways, but it's also very similar in many ways.

543
01:13:34,650 --> 01:13:40,410
So for. Group six.

544
01:13:40,410 --> 01:13:42,270
Have any other thoughts? Number one.

545
01:13:44,700 --> 01:13:51,400
You know, we talked about basically the same examples and then about how the models can help provide justification,

546
01:13:52,660 --> 01:13:58,600
why we should be doing these things. So basically the same stuff we talked about.

547
01:13:59,380 --> 01:14:07,530
I think these models provide just a very structured framework for your hypothesis about why you're acting.

548
01:14:07,570 --> 01:14:14,530
You know, anytime you make a decision, you have a mental model and this just takes that mental model and puts it on paper.

549
01:14:14,620 --> 01:14:22,989
It's great to allow you to explore different options. The Group five.

550
01:14:22,990 --> 01:14:31,030
What about how how can we use how in what ways is the reproductive number useful in public health sector?

551
01:14:34,060 --> 01:14:40,660
So that it's useful because it clarifies potential for epidemic in transmission of a pathogen.

552
01:14:41,650 --> 01:14:46,880
Like an understanding of what you're dealing with. You know.

553
01:14:48,510 --> 01:14:57,600
Right? Right. So it's again, it's just a crude and it is a crude measure, but it does provide you a way of thinking about.

554
01:15:00,470 --> 01:15:06,950
How infectious this pathogen is. That's what a lot of the press on COVID 19 has been about.

555
01:15:06,950 --> 01:15:17,570
But it could also tell you about how how effective different interventions might be in reducing that are not so.

556
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:22,570
And the difference between. Ventilation and masking in such.

557
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:47,530
Anything more from that group for that? And what's also ahead.

558
01:15:48,560 --> 01:16:01,280
Some maybe like a couple in Germany, like epidemic potential of this kind of kind of how like severe epidemic would be based off of the number.

559
01:16:03,810 --> 01:16:14,450
Say one more time how impactful the epidemic may be based off of like not like this very high any of a very little positive population.

560
01:16:14,460 --> 01:16:27,810
And the epidemic may be more impactful to life than low, a low or not, and a much less susceptible population or even a susceptible population.

561
01:16:27,810 --> 01:16:30,100
People are not. Right.

562
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:40,020
I mean, I guess then what you're saying is a good example of that is just the changing strains and variants of COVID 19 and how it you know,

563
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:49,470
it either when, you know, went up and, you know, more and more infectious as these strains that came then mutated and they become much more.

564
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:56,309
Much more competitive and can actually displace a less infectious pathogen.

565
01:16:56,310 --> 01:16:59,820
So being able to talk about that and actually say, okay,

566
01:16:59,820 --> 01:17:07,080
now we need to really be ready for this new variant that's coming along is going to be much more infectious based on this.

567
01:17:07,860 --> 01:17:15,510
These to be. Group three without question, three with group three back.

568
01:17:17,870 --> 01:17:22,690
Thinking about the difference being a logistic regression and transmission model in our team.

569
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:31,640
So we were mostly looking at how we perceive regression models in many statistical models.

570
01:17:32,240 --> 01:17:39,560
Look at data we've collected about past incidents. So that way they're very observational based and they're good at explaining why things happened,

571
01:17:40,370 --> 01:17:45,020
whereas our transmission modeling is going to be a lot better at.

572
01:17:45,860 --> 01:17:51,169
Predictive estimates. So what is going to happen then, a logistical regression?

573
01:17:51,170 --> 01:17:57,319
Because, you know, it's more based on the past data moving forward is not necessarily observational.

574
01:17:57,320 --> 01:17:58,990
And in that way they can kind of work together.

575
01:17:59,030 --> 01:18:07,910
Logistic regression can be a great way to figure out what is actually important in a model and then transmission models can apply that to future.

576
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:16,850
Right. I think that's good point that if you're going to predict, you need a model to predict, you want it to be a mechanistic model like the weather.

577
01:18:16,970 --> 01:18:26,629
Weather models are mechanistic models they and tweaked in different ways to account for a lot of the things that the model doesn't account for.

578
01:18:26,630 --> 01:18:31,250
But basically that's a mechanistic model that predicts that we want a mechanism

579
01:18:31,250 --> 01:18:35,780
model is going to be more reliable when you're going to try to extrapolate.

580
01:18:38,780 --> 01:18:47,090
But also the logistic model you used said the logistic model would be something you would like you'd want to use for explanatory

581
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:57,950
in the sense of like figuring out looking at data that you have like which variables were important in how they contributed.

582
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:07,550
Right, right. But what the thing that the logistic so the logistic regression model or a linear model is really driven by the data.

583
01:19:07,730 --> 01:19:13,490
Like we'll use a logistic model because the data is binary and we'll use a linear model

584
01:19:13,490 --> 01:19:21,020
because it's because it's continuous so that the choice of the model is really data driven.

585
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:29,299
Whereas with a mechanistic model or transmission model, we're using a model that we think describes how the process occurs.

586
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:38,660
And so in that way, we can actually explain things much more easily with a transmission model,

587
01:19:38,660 --> 01:19:42,080
mechanistic model, because it has the parameters have meaning.

588
01:19:42,950 --> 01:19:54,920
They're not just coefficients of this of a variable. So again, we push for that being the transmission model being much more of a explanatory model.

589
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:58,838
So what the logistic model does, you can use that for hypotheses.
