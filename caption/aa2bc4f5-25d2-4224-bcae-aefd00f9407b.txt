1
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:14,030
U.S. But.

2
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:36,100
Oh, it's okay. Remember? If you would just like to.

3
00:00:40,530 --> 00:01:34,270
Okay to. All right.

4
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:43,540
We'll get started if a couple of students who are doing professional development today, so they're not joining us, but you might as well get going.

5
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:47,620
So, hello, how are you doing? Welcome to Fall.

6
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:54,340
Hope you're getting settled in after the first week of classes and things start to get into a routine.

7
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:58,300
It's a little bit easier for you hoping it gets better for you.

8
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:06,850
Okay. So I was going to say, do you have any recommendations or suggestions for the cannabis site?

9
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:11,380
Things you would like me to decide to change, to do differently?

10
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:16,150
Good morning, Holly. Please let me know.

11
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:19,400
Don't hesitate to just. That's suggest things.

12
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:24,180
Right. And how did it go with the perusal activity?

13
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:27,240
How did you find perusal so far?

14
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,840
Okay. Helpful. Interesting. Okay.

15
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,819
Yeah, I was. I really enjoyed seeing everybody's comments.

16
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:42,590
It was great for me to just hear, you know, to see the discussions, to see your questions, just to see the dialog between you all.

17
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:50,239
I think I think you for those people that also put links to existing literature, other papers, and that's really helpful for me, for other students.

18
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,340
So, you know, for me, I really enjoyed it.

19
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:57,290
And I think we'll touch on some of the questions and the issues that you that you raised and throughout the class as well.

20
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:01,230
So I'm glad that worked well. All right.

21
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:07,319
Today is, I think, one of the most important classes, I think, in this course itself,

22
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:11,940
which is the looking at the life course perspective and thinking about aging from a life course perspective.

23
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:19,319
And so what the goals of the course and or this class in particular is to really think about

24
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:24,180
aging from workforce perspective and understand how it could actually impact health as we age.

25
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:27,660
And then within that, the concept of cumulative inequality.

26
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:32,940
And what I really want you to get out of this course is that you or this particular class,

27
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:37,410
when you see someone who's older, you'll think, Gee, I wonder where they've been.

28
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:44,040
How old were they when COVID hit? Where what kind of educational trajectory might they be on?

29
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:48,840
And you kind of think about someone who's aging and think about their histories.

30
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,980
Similarly, if you see somebody who's younger, an adolescent, perhaps,

31
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:58,830
how do you think about how their circumstances might change their aging trajectory and their health as they age?

32
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:05,370
So that's that's what I do when I walk around. I look at people, I think, oh, have they been I see somebody who's older, I'm talking to them.

33
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:10,950
What have you done? Where have you been? What is how has your experiences shaped how you are today and who you are?

34
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:19,350
So that's what we're going to get into. We're going to talk a little bit just about some of the early theories in gerontology,

35
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:23,760
which are highly limiting, but set a context for where the life course perspective is going.

36
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,470
We're going to delve really deeply into all the different axioms of the life course perspective.

37
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:32,490
We'll take a break and then we'll do it for the second half of the class.

38
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:35,530
We'll do some deep dives into some case studies.

39
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:41,820
So we've got three case studies. We're going to break in two groups and really dig into them and think about them from a life course perspective.

40
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:51,669
So gerontology is a field that has really been emerging, I'd say like from the fifties and sixties.

41
00:04:51,670 --> 00:05:00,010
And one of the early theorists in gerontology was Burgess, who basically suggested that what happens as people get older,

42
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:08,710
as they enter this phase of having no roles, so they are no longer working, they no longer perhaps no longer married, have they been widowed?

43
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:18,250
They are their kids are out of the house and they're kind of segmented from the rest of society and having this kind of role as role and coming in,

44
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:23,710
Henry said, You know, this is normal, really, because older people should really disengage from society.

45
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:27,910
It's a normal part of aging. It's just withdrawal.

46
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:31,210
It's inevitable and it's adaptive because it prepares them for death.

47
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:37,960
So this was a pretty I don't know, it was a pretty major theory, but it also generated controversy.

48
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:43,480
And then the rebuttal to this was engagement theory that now people are aging.

49
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,340
They also want to engage in society.

50
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:51,850
Just because you've lost roles that society or Western society might put on you doesn't mean that you still haven't got anything to contribute.

51
00:05:53,230 --> 00:06:00,280
So that kind of tension kind of evolved, and people did realize that there is more engagement for older adults as they in society.

52
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:07,420
And then more recently in this, in the I'd say in the early nineties,

53
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:13,780
there was now an extension of thinking about aging, not just as older people, but as from the life course perspective.

54
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:19,899
So in the two, there are two parallel streams that I that I consider that I'm aware of really,

55
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:24,010
which is the life course epidemiology which is the epidemiology view of life course.

56
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:24,730
Diana,

57
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:35,050
who over at UCL in London really has been the champion for this perspective and bringing it to the minds of people who study epidemiology in parallel.

58
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:45,550
Glen Elder, a sociologist at USC Chapel Hill, was one of what really drove home the importance of the life force perspective in sociology.

59
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:50,470
His seminal work was this book called The Children of the Great Depression,

60
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:59,470
and it was a study that he did following children that had been very young during the Great

61
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:06,090
Depression and looking at their outcomes later in life compared to kids who had been,

62
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:10,150
you know, who didn't experience Great Depression at that young period of adulthood.

63
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:20,739
And due to the poverty, famine, lack of education, there were these marked differences and marked inequalities in later life,

64
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:26,110
health outcomes and accomplishments because of that early exposure to that vulnerable event.

65
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:31,840
And then he built up these different axioms around life course theory that will go into the kind of think about

66
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:40,120
and use that framework to understand that there's an also a rich history of lifespan research in psychology,

67
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:45,640
which is in human development, but it's all basically looking at the same kinds of ideas.

68
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:51,100
Does anybody know any other similar perspectives that are kind of lifespan or life course?

69
00:07:56,950 --> 00:08:01,660
Do they what do they do in medicine just. And do they have a life span perspective to.

70
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:09,040
Medicine. I mean, I don't think in a positive way usually, you know,

71
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:15,040
but a lot of the patients coming in in the I think more than we are with the diagnosis of their sex just because,

72
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:23,910
you know, they're high risk of not making it. But I don't think that on exclusive sort of model for them.

73
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:31,460
Hopefully, you know, you'll bring some of that back with you. You invest in this field.

74
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:38,120
So the axioms of the life force perspective. So basically, I would say the left cause is not a theory.

75
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:44,600
It's doesn't say, you know, this is how everything is going to work out is just say this is a tool that you could use to understand health.

76
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:50,330
And the axioms are basically aging is a lifelong process that starts from birth.

77
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:59,690
The importance of historical time and place. The importance of timing of life transitions, which we'll get into and often time transitions,

78
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:06,850
that there are critical periods in life that we need to pay particular attention to in terms of exposures during that time.

79
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:16,940
And then risk can actually become additive so that you once you have adversity, you might be a greater risk for a subsequent adversity,

80
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:23,330
but they kind of accumulate and that that cumulative process leads to inequality that actually just grows.

81
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:27,710
And at the same time, fundamentally, there is agency.

82
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:33,800
We're not preprogrammed to experience these pathways.

83
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:39,080
People have the ability to navigate, negotiate these life course experiences.

84
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,549
All right. So we're going to go deeply into each one of these things.

85
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:50,180
I'm going to show you some data of stuff that I've done just because that's something that I could, you know, dove into more in more depth.

86
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:58,430
So aging happens from birth to death. So there's different debates about what these life stages are called, and they've evolved over time.

87
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,270
There's childhood, which is the early period of life,

88
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:08,899
and adolescence is considered to be a very important particular point of the life course who isn't here?

89
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:14,610
That's doing interesting work on adolescence. It's somebody said they were interested last week.

90
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:20,700
Oh. Oh, that's right. Okay. Yes. You belong here with us. Okay.

91
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:26,430
And then transition to adulthood. This is also a very important period that we'll get into as well.

92
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:29,880
And then there's the stage of midlife and then later life.

93
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:37,290
People focus on different things and different parts. And I don't necessarily know that we need to think about these as life stages.

94
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:43,710
You know, it is that age is a continuum, but there are these important sections of life that we need to think about.

95
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:50,480
Yes. So for the five stages just realized I do have a certain.

96
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:56,640
Like each couple for them? Or is this just more of like a structural thinking for that?

97
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,600
Because I'm always struggling how to put people at 40, 49.

98
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:04,470
Which group doesn't he or she? That's a great question, Lisa.

99
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:09,490
And I can tell you that that is changed over time. So people kind of and then and it's interesting to think about why.

100
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:19,020
So I think childhood people generally say. You know, and we could debate this like, you know, what do you think childhood is, you know?

101
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:35,100
Page 33. You know, maybe to age five, you know, the first five years of life or so-called kids that are to be the most critical for childhood,

102
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:47,880
maybe even getting into six or seven, then adolescence is this kind of, you know, I'd say maybe like 9 to 17, 17.

103
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:59,880
And then this so-called transition to adulthood is usually kicked around 18 to it has been like 18 to 25 much earlier.

104
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,110
Like many years ago, that was considered to be. That wasn't until now.

105
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:10,020
It's actually extending on into the thirties and that people go through this transition between like 18 to 32.

106
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:16,020
And if you think about it, you know, it used to be that when people finished high school,

107
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:22,410
they went on to university or not, but they would get married very early, they would start a career.

108
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:27,900
They'd have kids, you know, like, boom, they're right into being established adults very early in life.

109
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:36,180
Now there's much more of a churning that goes on that people are, you know, leaving high school,

110
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:42,870
maybe going on to college, maybe not trying different careers, maybe going back to college later.

111
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,820
There's a lot of process that happens. You know, family formation is happening much later in life.

112
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:51,090
People don't embark on careers so much anymore. Right.

113
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:54,840
I mean, people are moving in and out of different kinds of work.

114
00:12:54,840 --> 00:13:00,030
They're exploring things. So then this phase of churning and transition, it's become much longer.

115
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:12,900
So that and then I would say that midlife is really I would say from I don't know what, 40 to 40 5 to 65.

116
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:27,549
You know, as I get older 65 being written that when you transition to later life 65 is kind of the definition of of older because

117
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:33,610
that's what we think about people are eligible for Social Security that that that age has shifted and changed over time.

118
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:41,560
But yeah, there's not really a writer on age span for each of these stages.

119
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:52,960
Feels like like for an escalation. This stages is more defined by people's status, not really age.

120
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:57,070
Yes. What I take. Yeah.

121
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:03,820
I agree with you. Absolutely. Has there been any sort of movement to incorporate, like biologic age into this?

122
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:09,459
Because, you know, we see people that are quite advanced age despite their chronological age,

123
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:13,450
you know, biologically telomere length, that sort of thing. Can you tell me a bit more about that?

124
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:18,579
Sort of? Yeah. So the ends of your chromosomes are flanked by these things like telomeres,

125
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:24,760
and they shorten with age in a fairly linear fashion and population based studies.

126
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:31,990
Now that are measuring telomere length, you can create this new mg of what your expected telomere length would be from 30 to 100, or what a rating.

127
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:40,120
And some people fall outside the MG, and so they're biologically aged, even though their chronological age is much longer than this.

128
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:46,310
Yeah. I haven't seen that, but I think there may be more research on that out there.

129
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:51,229
I can certainly say from the work that we've done with spinal cord injury, so people that are aging,

130
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:57,530
the spinal cord injury age much faster in premature aging, their bodies are old, are aging faster.

131
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:02,690
But I don't think that that we think about them as like socially older.

132
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:10,850
You know, they may be 45 and their bodies may be, in fact, like an 80 year old.

133
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:16,490
But we still say, you know, they're they're just you know, they're in midlife that their body,

134
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:21,020
the experience of aging isn't their social experience and state of mind is different.

135
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:27,830
Yeah. And also like things like when you know you're not eligible for a Social Security for until you're 65, but their bodies may be 80,

136
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:37,910
but they're socially they're not eligible, you know, so that there's that kind of contrast or that tension between social age and any biological age.

137
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:46,020
Yeah. No, that's a good point. Very interesting other questions.

138
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:52,860
Okay. So the importance of time and place, this is the kind of the key thing.

139
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:56,309
So we're all aging, but we age at different times and in different places.

140
00:15:56,310 --> 00:16:04,980
And what I mean by time is the year, the millennium, the the different exposures that we have based on historical time.

141
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:08,670
So there's three different pieces, and I'm sure you're all familiar with this.

142
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:14,850
The age of Facts is just the simple process of development process within a person that's associated with aging.

143
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:23,850
More widespread period effects are those things that are historic, that happen at a given time, that affect everyone, the whole population.

144
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:28,170
So COVID is an example of a period effect, but if it's going to affect everybody.

145
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:33,390
The Great Depression was one. The Great Recession has been argued to be a period of fact.

146
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,110
The World War Two is being discussed a lot. It's a period effect as well.

147
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:44,880
And what that does is when there are period effects that hit aging and do people at different ages, we get cohort effects,

148
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:53,909
which is that people that are experiencing that historic event at different ages because those ages or different stages of the life course,

149
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:57,600
it will manifest differently and have different consequences for health as a result.

150
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:05,850
There's a lot of, you know, complex statistical models that go into try to modeling each period and cohort effects because they are completely linear.

151
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:11,730
You can't separate them out. You can't you know, you can't have all three together because they're each a function of another.

152
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:16,940
Some people argue that it's futile to even try to separate them out.

153
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:22,740
So I generally focus on age and cohort, but you just kind of have to pick two and see,

154
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:28,820
but you have to understand how they're all related to each other. And you've done each period cohort analysis work at all.

155
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:36,170
You know, it's it's kind of a fascinating, very, very interesting statistical way of thinking.

156
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:40,520
Okay. I'm going to show you an example of where we can think about age proven in cohort.

157
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:46,310
So these data come from the monitoring the future study. This is a ongoing study that's been happening since 1976.

158
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:51,020
Anybody aware of the study? I'll tell you a little bit about it.

159
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:59,360
It's actually a study that is taken that takes place every year with the senior high school seniors across the country.

160
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:04,309
So it's a nationally representative sample of high school seniors, and they ask them about drug use.

161
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:06,080
And they've done this since 1976.

162
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:16,940
And it's a very, very detailed, written, handwritten questionnaire they fill out about all sorts of drug use and sexual behaviors,

163
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:23,000
and they get away with this from an IAB perspective because they don't actually ask permission from the parents.

164
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,129
They just they just send a note out to the parents to say, this survey is going to be happening.

165
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:33,290
If you don't want your child to participate, then please, you know, remove them from the class on that day.

166
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:38,810
So it's not like active consent is sort of passive consent. And so they've been gathering these amazing data.

167
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:46,969
And if you're interested at all in life, course, in youth and also, you know, substance use,

168
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:50,420
but they've gotten more into health now so they can pick up some of the things.

169
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:54,470
In 1986, they threw in a question asking about their kids height and weight.

170
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:59,629
Then when they graduate from high school, we've been following these kids over time.

171
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:04,070
And so you had these amazing trajectories and cohorts of people.

172
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:13,100
So this is too small to see. But I'll just give you an overview of the 1976 and it's ongoing and they bring in these class of 76,

173
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:16,830
class of 77, and then they follow them every year all the way out.

174
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:22,420
So they've got into their fifties now, but you've got very different, although people are all the same age, right?

175
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:27,500
They're all high school seniors. They're the high school seniors at different times in historical time.

176
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:34,159
So they started, as I said, asking kids about their BMI in 1986.

177
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:39,709
And then they, of course, been following them. And you can see on the x axis here, we have age.

178
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:47,420
This is just plodding body mass index for these children at age 18 as well as when they age.

179
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,080
And you can see that there's these two different cohorts or actually three.

180
00:19:52,040 --> 00:20:02,570
There is the class of 1976. They only get their BMI starting in when they're 28 because they didn't start asking the BMI question until 1986.

181
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:10,070
The this is the class of 1986 and this is the class of 1996.

182
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:16,660
So what do we see from an age standpoint? BMI increases as you get older, right?

183
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:27,560
We get fat. As we get older, that's what happens. But we also see that that rate of increase has been very different for the different cohorts,

184
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:37,970
so that the more recent cohorts start off at a much higher BMI when they're 18 and their rate of increase in BMI is faster than the previous cohorts.

185
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:43,700
Looking at here, these two cohorts, we can see that they at the age of 32,

186
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:49,910
even though these people are the same age, they're from different high school classes.

187
00:20:50,840 --> 00:21:01,700
That's creating a difference in their BMI. So that historical impact of the obesity epidemic manifests itself right here where you

188
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:08,550
see the people who are the same age but from different times have very different BMI.

189
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:16,700
Anybody study obesity? You're interested in obesity as a health outcome.

190
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:23,870
I used to do a lot of more research in this area, but I really haven't done it. I'm not in touch with the current literature on it.

191
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:31,260
Is there still a sense that there is an obesity epidemic? Yes, there is in California.

192
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:40,490
I did some undergrad was one of the professors that she was doing more like obviously, I believe in like Latino population.

193
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:45,109
So like the Mexican immigrants in these cells in California.

194
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:51,220
And that was a big thing. So there's still focus on it, they say Justin as well, you know.

195
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:57,660
I feel like it's kind of not getting the same attention it did at the time when it was actually called an epidemic.

196
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:02,730
You know, when it was really a focus. But but definitely you can see the cohort effect here.

197
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:08,160
Another study that's also really useful to thinking about it.

198
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:11,930
Cohorts and life stages is this Americans Changing Life study.

199
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:19,910
I think I mentioned it last week. So again, this is a nationally representative sample of over 3000 adults who were first interviewed in 1986.

200
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:24,320
It's different from the monitoring. The Future study is that it doesn't have replenishment cohorts.

201
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,370
It's just one cohort that has followed over time.

202
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:30,440
So it's up to like 35 years now. They'd be following these people.

203
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:39,740
It is the longest ongoing, nationally representative study of capturing a cohort that's aging in the United States.

204
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:49,250
It's it's really, I think, valuable compared to other studies like the Health Retirement Study, which only picks up people at age 50.

205
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:53,150
So it becomes by nature a biased sample, and that is selective survivors.

206
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:57,680
This one actually carries people from age 25. It's not capturing them at birth.

207
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:01,820
So we still don't have that piece, but it's bringing people in and falling over time.

208
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:08,640
You can see that they are quality across time in different ways, mostly by telephone.

209
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:14,360
This is the most recent wave that took place. Maggie Hickam was the pi of this this wave.

210
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:19,190
And she added a lot of she had actually a phlebotomy blood collection.

211
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:25,670
So she's doing a lot of work with epigenetics and understanding of the intersection between the environment and aging.

212
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:36,400
Respect to epigenetics. So this, for example, is the covered structure of this where you have, you know, the this these are different birth cohorts.

213
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:41,460
So these are ten year birth cards which are split up so that people born in 1952 to 61.

214
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,889
These are really are baby boomers. They were the youngest people.

215
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:50,440
They were this is the midpoint of this period, but it's age 25 in 1986.

216
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:57,310
Follow through to age 55 in 2012. I don't have the wave six on here because I'm going to the data is not released quite yet.

217
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:05,800
And then you've got this other cohort. These are people that were born in 42 and 51, again, followed up from age 39 to 65.

218
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:09,340
And you can see we've got these different pieces that are coming together.

219
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:18,070
If we string them all together, we can create what's called a synthetic cohort or an accelerated longitudinal design where we can say,

220
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:23,650
okay, how can we use all these different pieces of people to string them all together and look at trajectories?

221
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:28,450
So I showed you this last week, but this is just looking at depressive symptoms over the life course.

222
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:34,870
It's taking that exact data and looking at their ESD, the Center for Epidemiological Studies,

223
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:39,489
Depression, Scale, and modeling it over time with a growth curve model.

224
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:47,710
So these are predicted trajectories for females and males, and the middle one is the the both sexes together.

225
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:58,720
So we can see a couple of things. Age depressive symptoms are highest in the younger adults, and then they get higher again for older adults.

226
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:06,970
We see that there is gender differences, that women have higher depression persistently across the life course than men.

227
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:14,150
But of course, there's cohort differences that are hidden in there. Right, because we have all these cohorts together.

228
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:20,630
But they are that they're all different. So if we separate out these trajectories for different cohorts, it looks like this.

229
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:29,630
So we don't have a complete curve for every single cohort because we are only looking at we only have them for certain windows of time.

230
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:34,970
But there's these are these ten year cohorts. So we've got six of them.

231
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:44,450
We've got our baby boomers that we're our youngest people. And their that's their trajectory over the the period that we observed them.

232
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:50,030
These are these people that were born very early from 1911 or earlier.

233
00:25:51,350 --> 00:26:00,200
These two groups of people here are born in their in their twenties, sort of 19, 20 to 31.

234
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:05,180
And they're these are the people that are born in the Depression era.

235
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,980
So in the thirties in World War Two, and then are baby boomers.

236
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:16,250
And you can see there's tremendous difference, right, in these trajectories of depressive symptoms depending on these cohorts.

237
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:24,010
So while age may have this, you know, the age trajectory of depression may have this curve, it's not the same for everybody.

238
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:27,190
It's shifts a little bit. And so what do we see?

239
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:34,399
We see that these people who have actually survived, these are selective survivors.

240
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:39,890
Right? These are people that were born in the early 1900s and they've lived out to their late seventies and eighties.

241
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:45,440
Their depressive symptoms are the highest. So they report the most depressive symptoms.

242
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:55,450
These people here they were. We've seen them in our study at exactly the same age, but their depressive symptoms are much lower.

243
00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:03,520
Children of the 1920s. And then again even lower the children of the Depression.

244
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:09,220
Yes, it's true that this is the bottom part of the curve.

245
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:15,250
But even people who are the same age, like around age 65, that were observed,

246
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:19,690
that experience, that age at different point in time had much more depression.

247
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:23,950
So what do you think it is about these people that have more depression?

248
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:30,400
These people that have less. And even the baby boomers, why do they have the lowest levels of depressive symptoms?

249
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:37,230
It wasn't baby boomers like boomer around, like the booming age of America.

250
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:42,600
So everything is basically it's like it's like our generation in China.

251
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:47,920
So everything's getting better. So they, you know, they they're like, oh, us.

252
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:52,280
They like material life. It's way better than the last four generations.

253
00:27:53,570 --> 00:28:02,600
Yeah. Yeah, that's a good point. And also, American people pay more attention to mental health and they are aware of the importance of mental health,

254
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:06,920
not only on their physical health. So maybe that's the reason.

255
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:14,530
Yeah, that's a good point. They are younger and then, you know, write about the meat and potatoes.

256
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:25,450
Right. But there but even though these people are the same ages, these people are far more depressed.

257
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:29,680
So there's even though they're younger, there's still differences by culprits.

258
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:39,600
There's been some thought that people that have been aging through hard times,

259
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:46,350
like World War Two or the Depression are more have a better outlook when they get to be older,

260
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:54,420
they're more they're sort of or more stoic and therefore less likely to report depressive symptoms as they get older.

261
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:57,870
They may still be experiencing depressive symptoms,

262
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:08,640
but might not want to report them because they have experienced hardship earlier and may be less likely to to relatively wait their hardship now.

263
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:14,450
There's those pieces. What about antidepressant medications?

264
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:24,310
When did that start? That's been a big reason why people think this is so low.

265
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:32,840
The introduction of the preventative measure for the children born in the early 20th century.

266
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:42,380
They actually lived through multiple wars and depression. So I wonder whether that's driving that association.

267
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:46,340
Yes, because it almost seems like they don't have a better outlook.

268
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,840
So that was the question. Yes. Yes, exactly.

269
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:52,720
I agree. Yeah, they they've lived through that.

270
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:57,969
So you're saying you're picking up on something which is saying that they although they were burnt one earlier,

271
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:07,270
they might have been at their sort of stages of raising kids careers and trying to sort of eke out their life at a time of incredible disruption.

272
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:10,749
Yeah. So you're picking up on that life course piece of like the critical periods.

273
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:19,060
And so which is different from from these people who were born during the Depression but may have been more fortunate in their subsequent lives,

274
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,900
in subsequent years when society was a little bit more stable.

275
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:29,870
Good point. Okay.

276
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:33,040
I'm going to show you some other work, which is looking specifically at optimism,

277
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:37,060
which gets a little bit at this piece about why we saw differences in depressive symptoms.

278
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:39,820
Right. Who's who was a little bit more optimistic looking at the world.

279
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:46,060
Optimism is important, I think, because we're going to get back to this when we talk about resilience and agency later.

280
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:50,620
But optimism is being repeatedly shown to be important for health.

281
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:55,690
And you might think this is just like a rinky dink kind of thing, like optimism, you know, what is that?

282
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:57,700
Who really cares what's crazy?

283
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:05,230
It actually has a lot of consequences for health, and people think it's because it has consequences for what you do in your day to day life.

284
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:11,560
And optimism is basically a forward thinking kind of expectations for the future.

285
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:15,940
You knew it was thinking about the future, feeling optimistic about what's coming up.

286
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:23,590
If people who are more optimistic about the future, they may be more likely to persist with pursuing education.

287
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:31,120
They may be less likely to smoke because they perceive themselves to have a future and may more likely to engage in physical activity.

288
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:36,130
Optimism is also potentially a coping mechanism, mechanism to cope with adversity.

289
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:43,840
So there's I'm going to just quickly show you this is like higher levels of optimism that being associated with lower blood pressure,

290
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:46,720
cell, cytotoxic toxicity,

291
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:55,600
lower end from late inflammation, less progression of carotid atherosclerosis, and a reduced likelihood of developing coronary heart disease.

292
00:31:56,890 --> 00:32:01,650
This is just a game just quickly showing you like this is the association between optimism and cardiovascular events.

293
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:10,120
This with a systematic review and meta analysis, consistently higher optimism, you get a reduced risk of cardiovascular events.

294
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:16,700
You'll also have a reduced risk of death. It protects you from dying.

295
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:26,780
How crazy is that? But that's crazy. And it maybe it is this idea that if you are expecting a future, you will plan for that accordingly.

296
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:34,919
So I'm going to show you some results from some work that we did looking at optimism in

297
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:38,940
the Americans changing life study and how it changes over the life course and by cohort.

298
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:47,280
I'm a little bit of a methods junkie, so I'm going to talk about this, but if you are not interested in this, even just glaze over for the time being.

299
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:52,469
This is a complex model that we did in the Americans Changing Lives study.

300
00:32:52,470 --> 00:33:02,010
There are only three questions that were asked about optimism and they are from the life orientation test revised there.

301
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:05,790
One of the questions is I am always optimistic about my future.

302
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:12,000
The response options are that we strongly agree, somewhat disagree, somewhat disagree strongly.

303
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:17,610
This is what we asked participants at every wave. The other two questions.

304
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:24,270
The two items that are part of that questionnaire are these questions which are It's really impossible to reach my goals.

305
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:28,830
And the sorry that the question is this one, I hardly ever expect things to go my way.

306
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:38,670
I really count on good things happening to me. So those are part of the optimism measure, but they're capturing pessimism and in fact,

307
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:44,070
they don't actually hang together very well as a single construct if you were to check the author liabilities.

308
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:50,459
So what Bill Magee did who who led this paper was he said, okay,

309
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:56,670
we've got a whole bunch of other stuff and ACR that asks about mastery and self esteem and hopelessness.

310
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:04,830
Let's see what we can do to create these kind of more latent constructs of pessimism based on measures of hopelessness as well.

311
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:16,169
But also, let's get at some of people's tendency to view things optimistically by capturing wording effects from other questions.

312
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:25,649
So wording effects are things like your tendency to respond positively to positively

313
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:31,530
worded items and your tendency to respond negatively to negatively worded items.

314
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:38,579
So what this structural latent model is showing is that you've got your basic

315
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:45,450
optimism and pessimism measures that are directly derived from questions about hope,

316
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:49,170
hopelessness and pessimism, and this one measure of optimism.

317
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:57,720
But we're going to create another latent variable, which is going to suck up all these questions, which are coming from self-esteem and mastery.

318
00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:07,650
And what's left over would be the valence effects like that tendency to respond negatively and respond positively.

319
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:13,290
There's a whole literature in psychology that uses these wording effects.

320
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:19,380
We did it to try to make our measure of optimism more robust than just simply this one question.

321
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,760
And I it's kind of a cool way of thinking about things.

322
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:34,410
So what we have essentially from this model is a latent factor score for optimism, and we are not one for pessimism.

323
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:40,950
We get rid of everything else. We just take that predictive factor score for optimism, pessimism, and we use that in our growth curve models.

324
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:48,930
So if we then plot for a people in ACL, this trajectory of optimism that we're getting from this model over time,

325
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:56,550
this is what we see over age pretty much, you know, a little bit of a bump up.

326
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:03,030
But then people just, you know, get less and less and less optimistic about the future as they get older.

327
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:16,999
Why might that be? Something that idea there's a lot of I think that's a big part of it.

328
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,330
Like, you know, how much do you look? It's like there's no there is.

329
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:23,660
You know, future is is less there's less future. Yeah.

330
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:30,280
And they have already experienced a lot related to the younger generation.

331
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:35,890
So yeah, there there's less things for them to expect in the, in their future.

332
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:42,370
Do you think it's different in different societies, different cultures, different countries?

333
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:50,280
Where do you see the wisdom for society that little color lead people to work under?

334
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:55,040
Like optimism. Optimism towards their lives.

335
00:36:55,230 --> 00:37:01,870
Is it kind of like girls? Like a little bit like Hong Kong, even though I think it's miserable, they're like,

336
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:07,779
I don't know why they they just feel more like optimistic about their future because probably because they have an income,

337
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:17,139
you know, and they kept working. So I just I would imagine people that live in the afterlife would be more optimistic potentially.

338
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:23,770
Yeah. Yeah. I think in Japan we're older adults are much more a central part of society and integrated.

339
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:32,530
You might see something different here, but. But anyway, it's this is this is optimism in America that it's this is more it's for arbitrary.

340
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:37,530
I mean because it doesn't go above zero is everything below means pessimism means everybody's.

341
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:40,180
That's a great point actually. This is this factor score.

342
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:45,549
So it's a factor score, which means it doesn't really have any intrinsic meaning as a number itself.

343
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:51,060
It's just like relative to that. So it's it's you don't have to be above zero to be optimistic.

344
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:57,190
No. Well, again, we can break this out by cohorts.

345
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,620
So what I've done here is actually then broke these into 415 year birth cohorts,

346
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:06,670
sort of compress them a little bit more so we can see them a bit easier.

347
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:10,569
So these are our oldest old people, right?

348
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:17,440
These are the people that are born liberated before 1917.

349
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:22,510
They are the ones that really have this fall in optimism.

350
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:29,320
Again, these children of the twenties that we see, these are people that were born 1917 to 1931.

351
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:35,290
They are the same ages in this graph. But the graph that they're much more optimistic.

352
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:42,390
And then our baby boomers, you know, let they're a little bit lower down, right?

353
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:49,910
They're a little bit less optimistic than their peers who were their same age 15 years earlier.

354
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:19,250
What do you think that might be? Maybe just expectations.

355
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:26,300
Feeling so special about you. So you said it's a relief.

356
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:30,140
By themselves. So you can see the trend. Come here.

357
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:34,010
Look, you come here. I will. Between come first or just.

358
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:47,690
You can compare between each one. Yeah. And I take it a little bit further and we're going to break this down now by gender and race.

359
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:51,260
So this actually then breaks it down. We found that there were.

360
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:56,900
What we found was actually there's no difference statistically between these two cohorts.

361
00:39:57,110 --> 00:40:01,129
And these two are in terms of their slope and their intercept.

362
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:04,910
So we collapse them for the purposes of looking at differences by gender.

363
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:08,959
And so here we have the same thing broken out.

364
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:14,720
We've got our early, early cohort there, born before 1932.

365
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:24,170
The solid line is men. The dashed line is women. And then we have our younger cohort born after 1932, as were baby boomers and the postwar babies.

366
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:27,950
Again, solid line is men and women.

367
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:36,260
We see that men are over across the early period of adulthood, are far more optimistic than women.

368
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:44,659
There's a narrowing that happens, an agreement at midlife around age 60 between men and women about the perceptions,

369
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:52,430
about optimism and then a divergence again, where women again become far less optimistic in later life than men.

370
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:56,090
But again, we see the same trajectory of it declining over time.

371
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:08,450
If we break this out by race, ACL is really a rich sample in terms of having sufficient numbers of blacks and whites to look at these differences.

372
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:14,180
We see something quite interesting here. So in the younger or in the older cohort, let's start with them.

373
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:21,320
Whites are more optimistic than blacks. But in these younger ones, it's reversed.

374
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:29,300
So, in fact, blacks are more optimistic than whites at this stage of the life course for that cohort.

375
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:33,620
So why do you think that is? Why why are we seeing these differences?

376
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:44,650
And thinking during that time might be like the writings of like Martin Luther King Junior and similar.

377
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:51,980
Exactly. Exactly. That's what we think. It's it's this optimism that things are going to get better.

378
00:41:52,000 --> 00:42:00,000
I'm optimistic about my future and the increase. And then if we were to be able to follow these people, would we see, in fact,

379
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:06,690
a crossover that the reality might not be what was anticipated at younger ages?

380
00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:11,940
But if we think about this from a health standpoint and the mortality standpoint, you know what?

381
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:16,440
You know, it's important to think about maybe what are the ways in which optimism might buffer

382
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:21,570
other senses of adversity to actually mitigate health declines later in life.

383
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:28,559
This is just quickly to show you a pessimism by age cohort and race as well,

384
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:35,550
in that although we saw that blacks were more optimistic than whites in younger life, they're also more pessimistic.

385
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:41,280
So blacks are both more optimistic and more pessimistic than whites at that early life stage.

386
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:45,959
So that's a complex it's a recognition that I'm optimistic about my future.

387
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:49,860
But, gee, you know, things really are don't always go my way.

388
00:42:51,350 --> 00:43:00,499
Oh, do you know why? If I'm feeling the depression and then I know that there may even more than the depression,

389
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:04,299
really, even in the optimism, we also know this kind of contradiction.

390
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:07,840
He wasn't expecting that would the same kind of color.

391
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:11,610
But yes, I know I was looking at that, too.

392
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:13,680
That's a great point. I don't know why that is.

393
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:19,110
You know, that they they have the lowest depression, but they have the low they don't have aren't as optimistic.

394
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:23,610
So the question is, how are optimism and depression related?

395
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:32,100
Could the baby boomers be perhaps less optimistic but less depressed because they're taking more anti-depressants?

396
00:43:32,850 --> 00:43:36,419
You know, it could I don't know. It's a really good point.

397
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:42,590
And I was looking at that, too. Okay.

398
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:46,300
The importance of timing. Timing. Timing is everything.

399
00:43:46,450 --> 00:43:51,790
So there's this idea that there are on time and off time transitions.

400
00:43:51,790 --> 00:43:58,839
So our society, American society in particular, I would say North American society is very much structured in terms of timing of events.

401
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:05,980
So these at least what you were saying about the different stages of adulthood, you know, we expect people to, you know, go to school,

402
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:10,870
elementary school or a certain age to go to high school at a certain age, then to go to college,

403
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:16,950
then to get married at certain ages, to have children at certain ages, to retire at a certain age.

404
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:22,390
There's an ordered structure of the life course that is built into our economic policies, our social policies,

405
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:29,080
our neighborhoods, how we interact with people, what we expect, what happens if you don't follow that sequence?

406
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:40,420
So what if you are if you have a child, when you're a teenager, if you have a baby, what does that mean for your life?

407
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:52,009
Drop out of school early, maybe? Yeah. It's much harder to go to school in high school.

408
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:55,520
When you have a baby, you have childcare issues.

409
00:44:56,540 --> 00:45:00,200
You know, there's not a lot of support for childcare.

410
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:07,129
You're trying to navigate and negotiate, you know, high school and finishing your classes with a young child at home.

411
00:45:07,130 --> 00:45:19,030
You may or may not have support. And it's true that the evidence is that the teen parents are much less likely to graduate from high school,

412
00:45:19,070 --> 00:45:23,480
much less likely to go on to college, and also more likely to have more children.

413
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:31,430
What about schooling? What if you, you know, come back to college when you're 50?

414
00:45:32,090 --> 00:45:36,560
I know it seems like that's a lot easier than coming back to high school when you're 50,

415
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:41,479
but still, you know, all time potentially career starting career.

416
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:49,520
We talked a little bit about how, you know, timing for career has changed over time, that we expect people less and less to have a career at age 25.

417
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:54,560
People are evolving and trying different careers and different vocations.

418
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:58,580
You know, people are expected to engage in relationships.

419
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:03,290
That is, I think, is much more fluid now than potentially it used to be in terms of expectations for getting married.

420
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:07,460
And then when I was 25 and I wasn't married, I thought that, you know, that's it.

421
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:13,640
I'm going to be forever single all my life because I've missed the window of opportunity to find myself a partner.

422
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:19,069
And I think there's there's more fluidity that, again, what about having children later in life?

423
00:46:19,070 --> 00:46:27,860
How does that change your aging trajectory? Do you need to be concerned that you might not have you might you might need to be more fit

424
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:33,470
and more healthy to be able to take care of a younger child when you're when you're aging.

425
00:46:33,770 --> 00:46:40,159
And might you be concerned that you might not have enough support from your children to be able to take care of you?

426
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:44,600
They might not be, in fact, you know, established enough economically to be able to take care of you when you're older.

427
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:48,139
Things that just to think about lifetime retirement,

428
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:55,340
what if you retire later than you thought and you or earlier than you thought and you don't have the money?

429
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:58,010
What about experiencing widowhood much earlier in life?

430
00:46:58,010 --> 00:47:05,270
So there's things and sort of off time expectations and on time expectations that can have consequences for health directly.

431
00:47:05,270 --> 00:47:08,060
I think just in terms of the stress process of experiencing that,

432
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:15,500
but also indirectly through just economic implications for not not, you know, sort of that disrupted life course.

433
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:23,220
And we show you quickly some results from a data. This is Leah Abrams wrote this paper.

434
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:27,030
She was a former graduate here. She was a Ph.D. student epidemiology.

435
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:30,659
And this was data that she took from the Health and Retirement Study.

436
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:37,170
And the Health Retirement Study asks participants this question, and they've asked it every single year,

437
00:47:37,170 --> 00:47:42,180
and it says, What are the chances that you think you'll be working at age 62?

438
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:44,520
You know, what's the probability that you'll be working?

439
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:49,560
And so they they've asked them since they were 50, you know, thinking ahead, what do you think are going to be working?

440
00:47:49,890 --> 00:47:55,890
And so you can do some really cool things by looking at actual people's expectations for whether they're going to work at age 62,

441
00:47:55,890 --> 00:47:59,820
whether they actually are working at age 62. And what does it mean if there's a disconnect?

442
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:10,829
So this is just this are showing the graph of people who expected to be retired by age 62, but in fact, weren't able to live up to that expectation.

443
00:48:10,830 --> 00:48:19,559
They had to they actually were working. And the differences that we see is that people with college education, in fact,

444
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:23,730
are more likely to be working at age 62, even though they expected not to be.

445
00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:30,330
Blacks and Hispanics, Hispanics are more likely to be working, even though they expected not to be.

446
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:40,820
Men are slightly more likely to be working as well. The converse are people who are not working, but they expect you to be working.

447
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:44,700
Ask them at age 50 you can be working at 62. Yep, I'm be working and they're not.

448
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:49,290
Why are they not working? Maybe they lost their job. Maybe they were unable to work.

449
00:48:49,290 --> 00:48:53,990
Maybe they're unhealthy and they can't continue to work. What are the differences?

450
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,990
Who are those kind of people? They're more likely to keep people with less than a high school education.

451
00:48:59,610 --> 00:49:04,260
They're slightly more likely to be pre baby boomers, and they're slightly more likely to be women as well.

452
00:49:04,590 --> 00:49:09,630
So what does that mean if you, in fact, expected to be working, but you're not.

453
00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:14,400
Maybe you don't have enough money saved up as well for you to plan for your retirement.

454
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:22,470
So she's done further work looking at the consequences of this mismatch and the consequences for depression and for life satisfaction.

455
00:49:22,830 --> 00:49:29,370
And there are consequences if you're not making the transitions that you expect to make at certain times.

456
00:49:29,370 --> 00:49:37,710
It does impact you in terms of your mental health. Okay.

457
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:40,400
We're going to just how quickly about critical periods of the life course.

458
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:46,079
We talked a little bit about this earlier in terms of thinking about, you know, those really critical times of childhood.

459
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:48,540
It's one when when my kids were young,

460
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:54,030
there was this big push in making sure that everybody made sure that the first five years of your life are the most important.

461
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:59,850
That's when everything is going to be figured out and done. You're going to make them the healthiest that they can be in that five years of life.

462
00:50:01,350 --> 00:50:06,419
And then this transition to adulthood has become also a very important stage of life to be looking at,

463
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:12,630
because it's a process of early careers, asset accumulation,

464
00:50:13,230 --> 00:50:17,850
engaging in and, you know, transitions to to, you know, employment,

465
00:50:17,850 --> 00:50:24,480
but also partnering and building a sense of who you are and what you're going to be doing.

466
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:25,409
And then, of course,

467
00:50:25,410 --> 00:50:34,860
later life when we are transitioning out of those roles and there's been some work showing that when there are disruptions in those critical periods,

468
00:50:35,070 --> 00:50:38,400
they actually have long term consequences for your health when you're older.

469
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:47,490
So this was a study that was done by Glen Elder and his colleagues looking at men who were called up to service.

470
00:50:47,490 --> 00:50:57,090
These are American men entering the World War in World War Two at younger ages, compared to those who aided who were mobilized in their thirties.

471
00:50:57,930 --> 00:51:05,520
And they found that there were actually huge differences in their health in later life for people who actually had to then give up, you know,

472
00:51:05,610 --> 00:51:09,510
stop in the middle of their career development, you know, leave their families,

473
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:15,240
go to war compared to people who were like 18, who hadn't got those things to establish yet.

474
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:21,450
And when they came back, they were able to pick up and get going on their career lives after that.

475
00:51:22,770 --> 00:51:28,139
So thinking about when the disruptions have happened in people's lives in terms of these critical

476
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:32,820
periods is really important to thinking about the magnitude of that event on subsequent health.

477
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:35,280
And this is very relevant for COVID as well.

478
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:41,250
You know, thinking about what are the critical periods in the life course in which people have been experiencing COVID?

479
00:51:41,670 --> 00:51:48,680
Is it the youth? You know, is it you know, should these people, the transitioning to adulthood, is it midlife know?

480
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:53,660
What are the periods of life that have become most sensitive to the disruption that is caused by the COVID?

481
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:03,030
This is another trajectories of depression graph that's coming from a different study.

482
00:52:03,030 --> 00:52:09,090
But this is also, you know, using a synthetic cohort to string people out over the life course.

483
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:17,760
But instead of using the quadratic form of the curve, it's using supplies to actually pick up on distinct stages of the life course.

484
00:52:18,210 --> 00:52:24,810
So we've got this early period up to, you know, age 19 or 18, adolescence, the transition to adulthood,

485
00:52:24,810 --> 00:52:30,540
going to over age 35 and then midlife coming through to age 65 and then later life.

486
00:52:31,050 --> 00:52:35,640
These these are this relates to your question as well. This is empirically derived supply.

487
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:39,690
And so this is telling, you know, using a spine regression and saying, where are the dots?

488
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:43,409
Where does depression trajectories shift notably?

489
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:47,969
So in these data with these people, those were the stages of the life course.

490
00:52:47,970 --> 00:52:51,870
So it's a kind of empirically derived cut points.

491
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:58,890
And then if we kind of think about exposures during those critical times or different stages of the life course,

492
00:52:59,850 --> 00:53:04,200
this is where people have been living, where they were living at these different stages of the life course.

493
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:11,760
And we model this by neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage. So neighborhoods that were more concentrated poverty, unemployment,

494
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:20,459
the living in those neighborhoods has a much more dramatic effect on depressive symptoms at this stage of the life course.

495
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:25,560
Right. It doesn't really make that much of a difference when you're in later life or in adolescence.

496
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:30,000
But it is critical period. If you're living in a more disadvantaged neighborhood,

497
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:36,360
you're more likely to have higher depressive symptoms than if you're living in a less disadvantaged neighborhood.

498
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:45,750
Those are you know, there's a as a neighborhood researcher, we think about what are the opportunities and constraints that are in our neighborhood,

499
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:53,760
environments that can shape opportunities for employment, education, good health behaviors.

500
00:53:54,450 --> 00:54:00,480
So that's the context that I think we can shape very critically, at least your mental health in particular life stages.

501
00:54:05,690 --> 00:54:08,840
Okay. I think we're going to stop and take a little break now.

502
00:54:09,410 --> 00:54:14,060
We'll come back and finish up with some cancer at risk and then we'll we'll do some work on our case studies.

503
00:54:14,510 --> 00:54:19,190
So we'll take about a ten minute break or so and we'll see you back here.

504
00:54:43,090 --> 00:56:10,970
Oh. And they're pronouncing it right.

505
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,120
Yes. Yes. Perfect. So I am not really.

506
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:18,890
American history simply means after the war.

507
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:25,060
Yes. And the governments and the kind of people we have more here.

508
00:56:26,410 --> 00:56:34,810
No, it just happened that way. Oh, because there's this I think there was incredible sense of optimism postwar.

509
00:56:34,870 --> 00:56:38,469
There's a lot of money being directed in towards building America.

510
00:56:38,470 --> 00:56:45,860
And. Okay. So it's like a and then this phenomenon just happened.

511
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:55,940
Yes. Oh, yes, exactly. And it was so I mean, I don't know what you know more about the baby boom.

512
00:56:56,840 --> 00:57:03,290
My parents are part of it, technically, but I think that's true.

513
00:57:04,190 --> 00:57:08,240
1961. Yeah, I don't, I don't know, a ton more.

514
00:57:08,630 --> 00:57:18,800
Um, just the sort of hyper American patriotism that was sort of seen before previously because of the Cold War.

515
00:57:19,730 --> 00:57:24,160
Um, I don't know. Yeah. Maybe I can do some.

516
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:31,920
But it's just that during that time they did close societies having more newborn children.

517
00:57:32,430 --> 00:57:38,190
Yes. And the population is like, yeah, everybody had babies and they had lots of babies.

518
00:57:38,850 --> 00:57:45,450
So there were a lot of children and there was something then it was really just a cohort and then it stopped.

519
00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:58,480
So it was really this sort of function of specific population, just that that sort of the postwar baby just isn't going to help us with as a.

520
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:11,290
So I'm not a baby boomer. I think a bit early on when talking about the baby boomer definition of baby boomers are not familiar with American history.

521
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:12,600
Do you know something about it?

522
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:23,680
I mean, there's obviously people born after World War Two, but the age group right now is, like I said, in the fifties and seventies.

523
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:34,110
Yeah. So you said those people those people were last year the baby boomers, that they were the child that was born during that period?

524
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:39,330
Yeah, because when I first came out from World War Two, they had like a lot more children than previous generations.

525
00:58:39,330 --> 00:58:44,010
And so there was this like massive explosion of children. I really do.

526
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:50,550
I think the end of it is correlated with the introduction of birth control and increasing divorce rates.

527
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:59,610
And how about this mid-sixties? We start seeing a drop in children, an increase in affairs and increase in divorce.

528
00:59:02,010 --> 00:59:07,470
So. Yeah. It's also a very unhealthy generation for the baby.

529
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:15,300
How come? I don't know. Rise of alcoholism and heart disease.

530
00:59:15,390 --> 00:59:18,500
Like. It's by far the least likely generation.

531
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:22,910
Interesting. See? Yeah.

532
00:59:22,910 --> 00:59:27,920
No, at least it was just this like everybody having babies. This is like great sense of optimism.

533
00:59:27,930 --> 00:59:34,250
You know, they just come back in the war. And it was the the the government was putting a lot of money into the economy, to infrastructure.

534
00:59:34,970 --> 00:59:42,440
You know, the building there was the GI Bill where they were giving they were paying for college education, for returning soldiers.

535
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:46,130
So there was this incredible sense of, oh, life is just great.

536
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:49,770
And then I think portrayal your point about sort of what the bust was,

537
00:59:49,770 --> 00:59:53,870
the baby bust, it's called, it's like why that stopped, you know, birth control.

538
00:59:53,870 --> 01:00:02,149
And then this idea also of maybe marriages weren't so great but yeah,

539
01:00:02,150 --> 01:00:09,710
that but for America I think a much more so I would say than than other North American countries this baby boomers,

540
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:18,560
they have shaped they shape America. So when they when they were babies, you know, everything was all about infant formula.

541
01:00:18,950 --> 01:00:24,649
When they were I don't know when they were teenagers, it was all about, you know,

542
01:00:24,650 --> 01:00:31,910
they're focusing on them and they talk about how that's the way the reason why Baskin-Robbins has so many different flavors of ice cream,

543
01:00:31,910 --> 01:00:36,799
because it was created for the baby boomers, because they used to be just chocolate and vanilla and strawberry.

544
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:41,810
And then baby boomers came along and they had to, you know, they to target this particular group economically.

545
01:00:41,810 --> 01:00:50,060
It's a very lucrative market to target. And as they age, it's going to be more focused on incontinence products or other things.

546
01:00:50,060 --> 01:00:54,500
You know, that, okay, this is a huge consumer group.

547
01:00:54,560 --> 01:01:00,560
They're also very dominant like the American sense right now because the age group is like.

548
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:03,830
Really? Yeah. For for now. Yes.

549
01:01:06,150 --> 01:01:11,700
But they are shifting. Right. And it's the aging that they're aging out.

550
01:01:12,690 --> 01:01:20,550
It's it will be interesting to see how they change aging. They may not be people who will be saddled with this role, less role of the aging.

551
01:01:21,030 --> 01:01:25,090
They might say, you know, I want to be I want to be right in there.

552
01:01:25,110 --> 01:01:34,190
I want to keep working or keep something. It's just that there are powerful cohort because of this sheer size of them.

553
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:43,830
The consensus is not to the same extent resistant to that.

554
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:51,050
I think cultural and demographic changes that are going on. I think the baby boomers played a big part of pushing back against changes.

555
01:01:51,060 --> 01:02:01,520
The. Yes. Yes. Do any other countries have a baby boom?

556
01:02:01,850 --> 01:02:05,120
China? Yeah. In the eighties with everybody.

557
01:02:05,530 --> 01:02:09,940
Yeah, it was. I always I always feel like. Like the baby boomers.

558
01:02:09,950 --> 01:02:18,500
Yeah. They're in the eighties, even though more like the people, like for after 65 to like late seventies,

559
01:02:19,010 --> 01:02:24,240
they're actually the one that enjoy all the benefits that the population really would have around.

560
01:02:25,050 --> 01:02:30,290
History of the U.S. population know this Latin American economy.

561
01:02:30,860 --> 01:02:34,860
I mean, all these people. Yes. Yes.

562
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:40,620
Exactly the same things, the same economics kind of driving this sense of optimism and having children.

563
01:02:41,490 --> 01:02:45,780
I was going to say, I know I actually have a of a psychopath like I used to.

564
01:02:45,780 --> 01:02:49,380
I was and he's a baby boomer and like.

565
01:02:49,890 --> 01:02:57,440
Yeah, and he's in his 60. And it's like a mixed feeling when I talk.

566
01:02:57,470 --> 01:03:01,850
You know, we tell a lot about, like, American society, politicians, blah, blah, blah.

567
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:08,720
I always feel like there's a mixed feeling of, like, feeling optimistic at the same time.

568
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:14,870
You can be like this. That's great. Yeah, I don't worry about really interesting.

569
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:19,760
It's really interesting to talk with him even though he's doing. Yeah, he's actually doing very well.

570
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:23,860
He was like a I think he was a CIA agent back in the day.

571
01:03:23,860 --> 01:03:28,040
Yeah, but he feels like it's interesting to talk to him.

572
01:03:28,190 --> 01:03:32,360
So I have like an interesting about, like, baby boomers in general.

573
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:36,060
Yeah, it's. Great.

574
01:03:36,140 --> 01:03:40,310
You know, just engage and talk and find out perspective. I mean, we write together, so.

575
01:03:40,430 --> 01:03:44,300
Yeah. Yeah. That's like, oh, singles. Now I'm like, on the road, you know?

576
01:03:44,570 --> 01:03:52,570
Yeah. Yeah. So it was pretty interesting to know what he thinks of the society because it's totally different viewpoint comparing to it.

577
01:03:52,610 --> 01:03:55,660
The younger generation, you know, like the college kid. Yeah.

578
01:03:55,740 --> 01:03:59,700
They talk the same topic. It's different. Yeah. Yeah.

579
01:03:59,730 --> 01:04:04,010
Very interesting. Okay.

580
01:04:05,540 --> 01:04:10,369
I'll jump in and I'm going to just get through the next sets of slides and we'll get into the case study.

581
01:04:10,370 --> 01:04:14,629
So that's what the concept and the axiom of the life course is this idea of chains of risk,

582
01:04:14,630 --> 01:04:22,010
which is something that happens to you if you get, you know, you have a child when you're 18.

583
01:04:22,460 --> 01:04:27,620
What does that mean in terms of a chain, an event that subsequent to that, you're less likely to graduate from high school?

584
01:04:27,620 --> 01:04:34,790
So a chain of risk in that sense. This is data gained from the monitoring of future study looking at body mass index over adulthood,

585
01:04:34,790 --> 01:04:39,439
but it's using a latent class analysis where you're looking at, in fact, two different trajectories.

586
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:45,559
So what I showed you before was assuming that there was a single population trajectory that's broken down by cohorts,

587
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:50,150
but that, you know, that you're modeling one single trajectory for the whole population.

588
01:04:50,780 --> 01:04:54,559
This is actually saying, okay, there's actually may be late, subtle differences.

589
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:59,540
So some subpopulations within that that are detected by a latent variable.

590
01:04:59,930 --> 01:05:07,490
And so the majority of people are experiencing this kind of normative waking, which actually never gets up a BMI of 25.

591
01:05:07,850 --> 01:05:10,910
There are about 80% of people in this analysis,

592
01:05:11,570 --> 01:05:17,750
but there's this group that are persistently overweight going back until when they were 18, and that's about 20% of the sample.

593
01:05:18,290 --> 01:05:23,960
And then if you follow these people up as they're monitoring the future, doesn't look at how they're faring in midlife.

594
01:05:24,380 --> 01:05:30,530
You see very different impacts. So this is just a logistic regression showing.

595
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:38,870
What are the odds of experiencing any of these outcomes at age 40 and above if you're in

596
01:05:38,870 --> 01:05:43,220
that persistently overweight group compared to the normative normative weight group,

597
01:05:44,180 --> 01:05:50,810
the analysis controls for a number of different covariates, including your average grade in high school and in other conditions.

598
01:05:52,010 --> 01:05:56,360
The this model here shows that people who are specifically persistently overweight

599
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:59,990
are more likely to be experiencing a chronic health problem by age 40.

600
01:06:01,010 --> 01:06:04,040
They're more likely to be receiving welfare, unemployment compensation.

601
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:08,060
They're less likely to have gone on to college,

602
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:17,480
and they are more likely to be without a current partner if we then adjust for some of the other chronic health problems and things as well.

603
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:19,489
We're left with two things that stand out,

604
01:06:19,490 --> 01:06:28,940
which is that people who are persistently overweight earlier in life are going to end up with a chronic health problem and not go on to college.

605
01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:35,690
What do you think these things are, causal or not, is certainly an issue discussed,

606
01:06:36,170 --> 01:06:41,750
but just kind of showing you potentially how chains of risk and things can be related when,

607
01:06:42,050 --> 01:06:45,620
you know, adversity at some point can lead to adversity later in life as well.

608
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:49,820
And that strings, you know,

609
01:06:49,860 --> 01:06:56,790
brings us into cumulative inequality and thinking about how these chains of risk can actually manifest in terms of inequality.

610
01:06:56,790 --> 01:06:59,850
So chains of risk, but also chains as chains of opportunity.

611
01:07:00,450 --> 01:07:04,919
So this is Ken Ferraro and this is the term. Yes, should be. And they can.

612
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:09,900
Ferraro was a gerontologist and a sociologist who does a lot of work in terms of the life course.

613
01:07:11,940 --> 01:07:18,650
When did you find this paper useful? Was it helpful in kind of thinking about cumulative inequality,

614
01:07:19,860 --> 01:07:24,750
bringing in a lot of the biological pieces of it as well, which at its time was quite novel.

615
01:07:28,860 --> 01:07:36,180
Essentially the idea is that inequality accumulates because we're each you know, once you're exposed to risk, you're going to be exposed to more risk.

616
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:39,150
Once you have opportunity, you'll be exposed to more opportunities.

617
01:07:40,590 --> 01:07:46,230
In sociology, there's this term called the Matthew Effect, which is drawing from the New Testament,

618
01:07:46,620 --> 01:07:51,240
which is saying that if you have, you're going to be continued to have.

619
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:58,230
If you do not have, you're continuing to not have. And then this is the idea of really sort of chains of risk.

620
01:08:00,030 --> 01:08:04,049
What's nice about this, I think, and I think you all touched on this in your comments in the paper,

621
01:08:04,050 --> 01:08:08,610
is that it actually considers that inequality within social systems.

622
01:08:08,610 --> 01:08:16,320
And so, you know, that the reason why people are experiencing different kinds of opportunities or risks are really social and structural.

623
01:08:18,810 --> 01:08:25,680
What else I want to say here? Oh, what also is nice about it is that this idea is that people can be resilient in that you're not

624
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:31,890
necessarily predisposed or prescribed to be experiencing chains of disadvantage and chains of risk.

625
01:08:32,250 --> 01:08:39,630
You have the capacity people do have the ability to break out from that risk, albeit it's more challenging.

626
01:08:44,010 --> 01:08:49,649
This was an interesting point that people talked about a lot in the paper as well, which is this idea of selective survival.

627
01:08:49,650 --> 01:08:56,459
So, you know, because of cumulative inequality that there is this nonrandom selection bias that people

628
01:08:56,460 --> 01:09:01,920
who are older tend to be people who have done reasonably well that haven't that have,

629
01:09:01,950 --> 01:09:13,850
you know, just being able to survive to later life. We can talk a little bit more at some point about survivor bias and how to adjust for it.

630
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:19,730
Mike Elliott, who's in the statistics department here, wrote a paper once, which is when you're dead, you're dead.

631
01:09:20,420 --> 01:09:30,110
Which means his argument was you shouldn't be accounting for dead people in analysis and trying to, like, you know, incorporate that into the models.

632
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:38,190
It's it's a debatable it's an interesting idea, you know, because we always try to update people in our analysis who never,

633
01:09:38,330 --> 01:09:44,059
you know, who are less likely to have aged so that we can provide more of a balanced estimate.

634
01:09:44,060 --> 01:09:50,510
But he says when if you if you're dead and if someone dies and you don't try to account for them in your analysis,

635
01:09:50,510 --> 01:09:57,020
then we can talk about that another time. You know, to do analysis is like a chronic disease.

636
01:09:58,130 --> 01:10:07,280
Every sensor you want, somebody reaches their expected life expectancy is like at least in the disease they die study.

637
01:10:07,790 --> 01:10:12,889
And some people will get the disease in 80 and 90, but they've already blown way past their life expectancy,

638
01:10:12,890 --> 01:10:20,510
whereas somebody will get the disease at 65, which obviously is a much more important event on a population basis.

639
01:10:20,540 --> 01:10:25,769
I always wonder whether it's okay to, you know, not look all the way to the point of death, but.

640
01:10:25,770 --> 01:10:33,270
But sensor at the life expectancy. Yeah, I don't know. People censor life expectancy, but they would certainly adjust for age, right?

641
01:10:33,860 --> 01:10:39,920
Yeah. Yeah, for sure. It's just I don't know how you capture like years of life loss.

642
01:10:39,950 --> 01:10:49,670
You know, earlier onset is is more important a population level than getting the disease when you're already near your life expectancy.

643
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:53,630
So I've always wondered how to approach that, you know, from our standpoint.

644
01:10:54,290 --> 01:10:59,910
Yeah. I mean, people and you certainly can model I think people do morally and.

645
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:07,269
Health adjusted life expectancy, you know, that incorporates that of how long someone's expected to live versus,

646
01:11:07,270 --> 01:11:12,070
you know, and then what that impact of that health condition is in that time.

647
01:11:12,730 --> 01:11:18,730
So there's either hollie's health adjusted life expectancy or life years.

648
01:11:20,310 --> 01:11:26,049
Do you know, like health? No.

649
01:11:26,050 --> 01:11:29,930
Anybody else doing that to that? Pleasure.

650
01:11:30,450 --> 01:11:34,260
Let us know what you find out. But it's it's a good point.

651
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:42,059
Okay. I'm going to show you some data which is looking at people who are aging with disabilities.

652
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:45,270
So people who have disabilities and kind of getting at this idea of cumulative

653
01:11:45,270 --> 01:11:49,620
inequality and how that manifests itself over life in terms of the right course,

654
01:11:49,620 --> 01:11:52,860
but also in terms of health. So these data come from the panel study of income dynamics.

655
01:11:53,280 --> 01:12:02,280
Anybody heard of these data or use these data? It's really also another fantastic resource to look at each time because it goes back to 1979.

656
01:12:03,150 --> 01:12:06,660
It's a was a sample of households and they've been following these households

657
01:12:06,660 --> 01:12:10,379
over time and then when they'll be following the kids with these households.

658
01:12:10,380 --> 01:12:14,490
So it's like this kind of, I don't know, household structure that goes on over time.

659
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:23,310
They don't have really great measures of health until recently. So this in order to get at actually disability in this study,

660
01:12:23,310 --> 01:12:27,420
we looked at a measure which is just asking people whether they had a physical or a

661
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:31,260
nervous condition that limits the type of work or the amount of work that you can do.

662
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:36,659
We identified we we created a variable called disability.

663
01:12:36,660 --> 01:12:41,330
If they reported for more reports of this between when they were kind of at their working ages.

664
01:12:41,340 --> 01:12:47,760
So thinking that people are saying that they are limited in the amount of work you can do for a more times over this critical period of,

665
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:51,540
you know, the work life. We would consider them to be disabled.

666
01:12:52,710 --> 01:12:58,260
And so we get about 12% of this sample who meets the criteria and the rest do not.

667
01:12:59,010 --> 01:13:04,110
If we look at those people and see how they have aged over time, we see very different things.

668
01:13:05,190 --> 01:13:10,709
The educational attainment is very different for people who are aging with a disability.

669
01:13:10,710 --> 01:13:15,210
They're much less likely to go on to college than those who age without a disability.

670
01:13:16,860 --> 01:13:23,280
They're much less likely to be employed over adulthood than those who are aging without disability,

671
01:13:25,620 --> 01:13:29,189
perhaps because of they're less likely to be employed.

672
01:13:29,190 --> 01:13:34,800
They have lower household incomes over adulthood consistently, but actually magnify over the life course.

673
01:13:34,890 --> 01:13:37,140
So they increasingly, increasingly have lower incomes.

674
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:46,350
And they're much more likely to report poor health status, presumably because they are having fewer educational opportunities, less income.

675
01:13:48,420 --> 01:13:52,620
They also have poor health behaviors, presumably, potentially,

676
01:13:52,620 --> 01:13:59,460
because people are having challenges in managing their health due to lower incomes, less education,

677
01:13:59,940 --> 01:14:04,470
environmental barriers that are preventing people from actually being physically active,

678
01:14:05,220 --> 01:14:09,960
being able to go to accessible gyms, to be able to navigate in built environments.

679
01:14:10,710 --> 01:14:15,840
People are much more likely to be current smokers, to be sedentary and to be obese.

680
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:21,540
They're also more likely to then get these secondary health problems in midlife by disability status,

681
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:24,750
and more likely to have arthritis, heart disease and high blood pressure.

682
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:32,329
They're also more likely than to develop more difficulty in basic self-care activities like walking,

683
01:14:32,330 --> 01:14:36,100
going out, bathing and dressing, and with instrumental activities.

684
01:14:36,110 --> 01:14:40,760
Simple things like making a meal, doing housework, managing your finances, or going shopping.

685
01:14:42,710 --> 01:14:47,480
That is all to say that there are these chains of risk so that people who particularly who are exposed to

686
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:52,580
vulnerability or have physical health problems that are potentially creating disability early in life,

687
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:59,360
then there's a sort of sequence in this chains of risk that occur that create these inequalities in later life in terms of health,

688
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:02,660
but also in economic resources that are important for health.

689
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:12,110
We talked about this as well, which is that just because you have a disability and you are engaging in life and it's not going your way and

690
01:15:12,110 --> 01:15:15,830
you're having trouble finding a job and you're having trouble getting to your job and you're having trouble,

691
01:15:16,250 --> 01:15:20,030
you know, earning an income, it doesn't necessarily mean that you're going to be in worse health.

692
01:15:20,180 --> 01:15:26,540
People are resilient. And this is the idea of the life story, which is that there is agency, which is a sense of empowerment,

693
01:15:26,540 --> 01:15:31,550
which is we're not just pre, you know, predetermined to accept our fate.

694
01:15:32,510 --> 01:15:39,829
This was a really interesting paper by Edith Chen and Greg Miller that talks a lot about why low socioeconomic status isn't always

695
01:15:39,830 --> 01:15:47,960
bad for your health and how the strategies of what they call shift and persist so that in a debate in experiencing adversity,

696
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:53,060
people, you know, even though they may be in a difficult family environment, a difficult neighborhood environment,

697
01:15:53,570 --> 01:15:58,370
children who experience adversity, if they have a stable and positive role model,

698
01:15:59,210 --> 01:16:08,360
good socialization behaviors, they're able to adapt this kind of shift and process strategies, which means you shift what your goals are.

699
01:16:08,510 --> 01:16:16,520
Okay, maybe I can't be a golfer because I have trouble walking, but I can teach kids how to golf or you can, you know.

700
01:16:16,550 --> 01:16:22,850
Shifting your priorities, shifting what's important for you, and finding a different way to do it at the same time is persisting.

701
01:16:22,850 --> 01:16:27,740
Like not giving up, being, you know, I'm going to persist and try and make this happen.

702
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:37,190
I'm going to be optimistic about trying that I can actually accomplish this goal, even though I've encountered all these challenges and limitations.

703
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:47,390
And I'll just close with just this, which is data from our spinal cord injury study that Nash and I work on together, which was looking at.

704
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:52,400
Adults in Michigan who have been aging with a spinal cord injury.

705
01:16:52,410 --> 01:17:02,850
So, as you know, spinal cord injuries are really dramatic and sudden injury that can result in paralysis from the neck down, from the waist down.

706
01:17:03,420 --> 01:17:11,640
And it can really be abruptly changing people's lives in terms of their trajectories for education and employment and health.

707
01:17:11,970 --> 01:17:18,420
And when we were asking that, we did some we did a quantitative survey, but we also did follow up focus groups and qualitative interviews.

708
01:17:19,020 --> 01:17:22,470
And we asked them about what their how they view aging.

709
01:17:23,310 --> 01:17:26,520
This is a 47 year old woman. She's had her injury for ten years.

710
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:31,110
She separately jokes that she's had no movement from her neck down.

711
01:17:31,620 --> 01:17:39,030
She lives alone. She says, you know, well, I can see where it could be a struggle, but I think it's just, you know,

712
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:45,070
determination to be able to do those things that you want to do, get out, you know, and get around.

713
01:17:45,090 --> 01:17:49,380
So this kind of persist, this ability to say, I'm going to do this.

714
01:17:51,550 --> 01:17:56,050
This is a 58 year old man who's actually had a spinal cord injury since he was 20.

715
01:17:56,050 --> 01:18:02,760
So he's 38 years Asian with a spinal cord injury. And he's he's aware he's I don't know what ability I'm going to lose next.

716
01:18:02,770 --> 01:18:05,890
So there's an awareness that things are starting to fall apart.

717
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:10,120
He's only 58, but he's probably has like an 85 year old body.

718
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:14,049
But I'm going to hold on to what I can. I'm going to hold on tightly.

719
01:18:14,050 --> 01:18:17,980
So this kind of sense, like I am going to I'm going to fight this.

720
01:18:18,940 --> 01:18:24,970
It's important to think about who are the people that have the ability to have these attitudes, because not everybody does.

721
01:18:25,090 --> 01:18:34,690
Right. Some people just can't summon up that motivation to be able to try to persist in the face of adversity.

722
01:18:34,690 --> 01:18:42,100
So that's something else to also think about as well. All right.

723
01:18:42,970 --> 01:18:47,320
Any other comments, questions about any of this before we move on to the case stories?

724
01:18:49,940 --> 01:18:54,970
Okay. So what we're going to do for the remainder of the class, we're going to I'm going to show you three different case studies.

725
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:58,730
We're going to break up into groups of three. So we'll have three different groups of three.

726
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:03,679
And what I would like you to do is kind of think about these case studies and really dove deeply

727
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:07,820
into how the life course and perspective could be useful to understanding the consequences,

728
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:14,509
the situations for aging of these people. So the first case study is aging with spinal cord injury.

729
01:19:14,510 --> 01:19:18,380
So again, spinal cord injury is a life threatening, life altering event.

730
01:19:19,310 --> 01:19:22,910
Most of the injuries in the United States occurred before the age of 40.

731
01:19:23,510 --> 01:19:26,780
It results in various degrees of paralysis and disability.

732
01:19:27,740 --> 01:19:36,560
It creates tremendous dynamics in the ability to engage in social relationships, how hold a job, get to a job.

733
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:41,690
And then we also know that the average age of people living with spinal cord injury is increasing,

734
01:19:41,690 --> 01:19:44,690
in fact, because of advances in medical care and technology.

735
01:19:46,550 --> 01:19:53,150
So this first case study is here, a 58 year old white male, you're injured in a motor vehicle accident when you were 20.

736
01:19:53,990 --> 01:19:59,090
You have quadriplegia, which means you cannot move from the neck down. You never married and you live alone.

737
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:03,170
You did benefit tremendously from Michigan's auto non fault insurance.

738
01:20:03,170 --> 01:20:11,780
So people know what this is. It's extremely important for people who had catastrophic car accidents, injured in car accidents.

739
01:20:12,350 --> 01:20:20,179
It did provide essentially tremendous amount of funding or funding to allow people who are injured severely in car accidents,

740
01:20:20,180 --> 01:20:27,080
to have caregivers at home, to make modifications to their home, to continue to be able to live a productive life.

741
01:20:28,280 --> 01:20:37,760
In July of 2021, that was taken away. There's been a huge uproar and a real fight to for people in the disability community to arguing,

742
01:20:38,030 --> 01:20:41,179
really trying to fight against that with not much success.

743
01:20:41,180 --> 01:20:47,780
But it is actually then taking away the money that had been given to these people and the support that they had expected

744
01:20:47,780 --> 01:20:54,710
and had been receiving completely taken away so that they no longer are able to have caregivers in their home.

745
01:20:55,190 --> 01:20:59,720
This person lost their job, unable to care for themselves and have transitioned to a nursing home.

746
01:20:59,930 --> 01:21:05,240
So this is the source of this particular person's situation.

747
01:21:06,410 --> 01:21:06,770
Okay.

748
01:21:06,770 --> 01:21:14,630
So the question is, considering this case from a life course perspective, what are the consequences for aging in terms of educational attainment,

749
01:21:15,110 --> 01:21:19,340
income accumulation, family, social supports, health conditions, resilience?

750
01:21:19,730 --> 01:21:22,880
How are social systems central to the generation of inequality?

751
01:21:23,270 --> 01:21:24,950
These are just some of things you might want to think about,

752
01:21:24,950 --> 01:21:30,259
but really just thinking from a life course perspective about this person and his aging and his trajectory,

753
01:21:30,260 --> 01:21:39,650
how has how can you think about the different stages of his life and his future life as well in terms of from a life course perspective?

754
01:21:41,740 --> 01:21:45,500
Okay. Second case study in your eight year old girl.

755
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:49,540
Hispanic ethnicity. Your mother is a single mom working in the health care industry.

756
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:56,470
This is all about COVID. When COVID hit, you had to go online for school, but you didn't have reliable Internet, so you started struggling.

757
01:21:56,920 --> 01:22:01,389
Your mom worked at night, so she was only able to come and try and help you during the day.

758
01:22:01,390 --> 01:22:04,360
But she was very, very tired. So you start to fall behind in school.

759
01:22:04,930 --> 01:22:08,800
When you return to fourth grade here, reading and math scores are at their lowest levels.

760
01:22:09,560 --> 01:22:15,640
And the United States is not just now saying, but it could take a generation for scholars to rebound.

761
01:22:15,700 --> 01:22:23,110
For our fourth grade math and reading levels and it could weigh on GDP or so the economic output of this country for years to come.

762
01:22:25,780 --> 01:22:31,110
The gap between the high and low performing students was already really high before COVID hit, and now it's just magnified.

763
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:37,360
So again, the question is, what are the consequences of this for this aging of this girl as she moves forward?

764
01:22:38,740 --> 01:22:43,570
And the last one is a study is a case study of an older African-American woman who lives alone.

765
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:48,100
You have had high blood pressure for many years, and it's not easily controlled.

766
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:53,110
When the pandemic hit, you'd be you became afraid to socialize outside the home.

767
01:22:53,110 --> 01:22:57,070
You were basically afraid to go out. This is something that we're hearing a lot from older adults.

768
01:22:57,760 --> 01:23:03,310
They have basically shut themselves in their homes. They are terrified of getting COVID and they have not gone out.

769
01:23:04,570 --> 01:23:07,970
So you are increasingly feeling isolated and lonely.

770
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:11,200
You're starting to exhibit symptoms of depression and anxiety,

771
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:14,740
and you're actually finding it hard now to remember things, including actually day of the week.

772
01:23:15,220 --> 01:23:21,340
So again, what are the consequences for aging? How might this person's previous background have also shaped this?

773
01:23:22,630 --> 01:23:26,500
So let's break up into groups of three that will work out well.

774
01:23:27,370 --> 01:23:28,944
You guys at the front will be doing case study one this row here,
