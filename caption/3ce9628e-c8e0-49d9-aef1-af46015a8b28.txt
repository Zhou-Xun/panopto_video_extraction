1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:09,660
Today we're going to talk about and this is mostly an introduction of first view or how to write that easy proposal,

2
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:17,069
how to write the specific aims for your DC proposal this winter.

3
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:18,629
Winter 2023.

4
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:29,910
You you need to take outside required class nutrition 7a1 in that class you are going to be working on writing your actual thesis proposal.

5
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:39,540
And what it means is to is I know that doctoral student until you have more more time to do that but you need to take the class.

6
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:44,070
You need to take the class what for you? You will do all the other type of work there.

7
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:52,050
You get this, but you don't have the nutrition before the not nutrition saving of one.

8
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,120
Yes, we don't have it in the plan. But they sent us.

9
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:59,100
I think you're right. You have it the after that, the QE is it.

10
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:03,839
We're not done yet. You need to take it.

11
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,410
Yeah, could be and not necessarily the this this winter.

12
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:13,530
So we can think later. Yes. Do you have it?

13
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:23,669
How do you have it in you to schedule after or the first years that what you look for but a basis to then you need to

14
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:31,140
take this winter is step one like just time to work on your proposal or it's more like this where we do activities too.

15
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:38,009
Okay. I used to teach the class when I was teaching.

16
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:42,590
The class was like unprotected time for you to write the proposal.

17
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:48,350
Of course, sometimes I.

18
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:56,730
I gave like a brief lecture. For example, let's say today I went to work about my fourth day and I talk a little bit how to write them as well.

19
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,750
Then you work together and that there that sounds helpful.

20
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:09,690
However some helpful. Okay, great. Now these this winter, I'm not teaching the class anymore.

21
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:20,759
The class is going to be teaching by Dr. Hobson, but I think she's going to keep that same more or less the same format as you segregate t shirt.

22
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,750
And I know that you are going to be great. I want to be very helpful for you.

23
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:28,260
Okay? Okay. Okay.

24
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:31,530
The plan is to end. You need to take seven more Wang, I think. Okay, you want.

25
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:34,859
You can wait, I think, but I'm checking right now.

26
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:40,560
But I didn't find them. But the course is I should say yeah it is required of class.

27
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:44,160
Yeah. Yeah these are required class four or also for doctoral students.

28
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:48,420
Then today I'm going to talk a little bit about specific aims.

29
00:02:49,230 --> 00:03:00,840
Now the specific aims are income, but you can find in nothing in today's model that is are a PDF file or specific games.

30
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:17,050
What is happening here. Okay.

31
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:25,030
That is. Are these PDF documents just a page is an example of a specification of a previous grant,

32
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:31,960
of making them feel free to use it as a template when you're working in your only specific aims.

33
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:43,810
I don't know what is happening here. Sorry about that, but feel free to to look into this document in just one page.

34
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:48,689
Feel free to use it as a template for refund recession. Okay.

35
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:54,510
And today we are going to talk a little bit more then about Pacific Games now.

36
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:04,320
Okay. Right now, you should be right now looking for mentors, talking with potential mentors about the selection of your topic.

37
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:13,580
Now, after you have selected your topic with your mentor feedback, the first step would be to write,

38
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:20,580
to do a little research, because you will need to complete several objectives during this search.

39
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:25,620
One, you should know what what we know about that topic.

40
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:33,270
For example, if you are going to the exercise that we did last class or the last couple of classes about coffee,

41
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:36,719
for example, remember coffee and diabetes, then to work together.

42
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:46,170
Okay, what we know about coffee drinking and diabetes, then that's the energy active of this shares what we know about that particular topic.

43
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:57,090
But for your research also you should be able to identify areas of disagreement about a particular topic or area of debate.

44
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,840
For example, the case of that coffee, again, coffee and diabetes.

45
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:09,150
Do we know that coffee is protective or not? Depends on the amount of coffee, the beans, whether that coffee, decaf or regular,

46
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:16,349
the type of questions you're going to be of the objective when doing this search and

47
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:23,700
also identified gap in Daniel is why we don't know about that particular topic.

48
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:29,820
Again, I'm talking about the example of coffee and diabetes.

49
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:39,660
That is a minimal amount to get the benefit of coffee related to diabetes or maybe just a day is enough.

50
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:49,830
Or if I drink more than one coffee a day that is going to be harmful, then that type of question you should be able to identify in the search.

51
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:58,880
Now General Buys established a daily trading routine.

52
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:08,240
We are ready to talk about this and we discussed here at home and by some examples, do what works for you.

53
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:19,460
Then as a first step, don't try to write an extensive review because the first step for you will be to give a general overview of that,

54
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:30,410
of what we know, what we don't know. And when you start writing your thesis proposal, I will think of that as an introduction to your thesis project,

55
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:34,430
because at the end of your research, you will be writing of this project,

56
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:41,870
and most likely the proposal that you write right now is going to serve as a draft of your final thesis,

57
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:50,210
but be flexible because most likely you are going to refine your objective and method when working with what do you see?

58
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:53,760
Probably, and this is very common. You'll write them a proposal.

59
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:57,440
You'll say, I want to do this, I want to do that.

60
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:01,640
By one, you start working. Maybe you've got two ideas.

61
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,970
Okay, maybe this better this way. Maybe be better this way.

62
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,680
That way. I didn't think about this particular and will then be flexible.

63
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:19,830
Okay. Part of your research proposal for doctoral students I think is a little bit longer than this.

64
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:32,160
But for doctoral student for motorists to then we ask them paid yes double as base exclusive or references for your proposal.

65
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:38,729
What that is going to include on a specific aims.

66
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:44,940
Usually this is one page background, a rationale that could be a couple of pages or maybe three pages.

67
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:48,930
Methods, maybe a couple of pages.

68
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:55,470
Also, you will need to write about anticipated results with false limitation alternative strategies.

69
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,890
For example, let's say you are recruiting participants for study.

70
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:03,300
What's happening? You don't recruit the participant that you were planning to recruit.

71
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:10,680
Then you need to anticipate that, well, what you are going to do if that happens, you are working in an animal model.

72
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:15,180
What's happening with the animal model? Nothing workable at the end then.

73
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:18,780
Then you need to think about that on the genotypic strategies.

74
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:24,880
That happens. You need a special application for human subject research.

75
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:29,310
For animal research. Also, you will need to write about that in your proposal.

76
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:34,620
You will need to write a timeline of idea in that reference.

77
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:39,960
And then this type, these ten pages are all this part is references.

78
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:44,880
QUESTION So far. Okay.

79
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:48,630
And today, I want to talk a little bit about a specific aim.

80
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:53,940
Again, in 711. You are going to need to work on all the different parts.

81
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,450
Today, I want to talk a little bit about specific themes.

82
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:05,460
Now the specific aim, you can think about that as a11 based summary of your research proposal.

83
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:12,660
Then in that page, you will need to answer these three important questions.

84
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:21,280
First of all, why? Why you are doing that research that the most important question why?

85
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:26,400
Second, what? That what is what we know about it?

86
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,040
What we know about that particular question?

87
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:40,020
What are that gap of knowledge that I want to want to do to help you come to feel what we don't know about that and how in your methods,

88
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:45,330
how I'm going to do to reach these aims.

89
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:50,340
Then you have to be able to write that in one page.

90
00:09:51,930 --> 00:10:01,170
Sometimes when you do, you continue in academia and you are writing brand proposals.

91
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:04,770
Usually many of you read your work.

92
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:12,540
They are going only to the specific page and you are going to judge your proposal based on the specifications page.

93
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:17,130
Then you don't write that good the specification page.

94
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:22,650
You are in big problems. Then think about that.

95
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,920
That is a very important component of your research proposal.

96
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:34,680
Anyone reading you specific names should be able to have a good idea about your proposal, about your research,

97
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:42,060
because again, first, your thesis committee is going to have faculty with different expertise.

98
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:49,320
They know a bit about it, about your topic, but they have complementary expertise.

99
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:56,160
Then they should be able to understand what are you planning to do reading your specific names, even if they are not?

100
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,640
They don't even need that. They have more general knowledge about your topic.

101
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:04,280
Thinking about Grant.

102
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:18,170
And again, when you write Grant Proposal for the NIH, your grant is going to be a review for reviewers that they are not as they have.

103
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,700
They may have some expertise about your topic,

104
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:29,790
but maybe they don't have to complete this particular the particular topic that anyone will be able to understand what you are planning to do.

105
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:42,120
Then thinking about that unit specification will be written for the general scientific audience and also for you is

106
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:48,150
going to be a useful framework for your overall proposal because you can use it as a template for your proposal.

107
00:11:49,500 --> 00:12:02,639
Now do you see how to use the template, how to write you the specific aims that in the first sentence is always good to start that naming that big

108
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:09,720
picture question the white question why this is important is start with a specific page with one sentence.

109
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:14,890
Boring. Your why wait? I want to do this.

110
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:22,020
Then after that, I will suggest and again I to the from this page here.

111
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:28,600
Feel free to go there they are better serve regular basis help to write the down proposal how to write specific games.

112
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:39,220
Then what I'm going to do now is just to explain to you an example of updates with Pacific Games and yet to see how we do that.

113
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:45,120
Okay. Again, this is based on that document that you see on canvas.

114
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:50,979
Feel free to use this as a template because they became the exact grounder.

115
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:56,950
I was proposing to do genetic analysis in Costa Rica to study longevity in Costa Rica.

116
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:11,290
Okay. Then you'll see here in yellow, in this first sentence, I put that big picture question and only Costa Ricans, particularly males,

117
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:18,400
have one of the lowest mortality rates in the world, outperforming even high income countries, including the United States.

118
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:22,060
Then this is a big picture. This is the observation.

119
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:27,110
And this observation will lead to the central question of this graph.

120
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:31,030
These the Costa Rican males have a survival advantage.

121
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:36,550
They live longer compared to other elderly males, even in high income countries.

122
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:41,730
Then that was really why I'm here. You can start to think about diet.

123
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:47,830
These are quite sure you are climbing this report.

124
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:56,590
Flush out the poor getting at the factors then but you start in these you try to catch the attention or that person reading this,

125
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,660
I mean, you read this sentence, do you feel interested to know more?

126
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:08,350
And that idea that you read this sentence then and the person is interested, want to know more.

127
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:13,210
Okay, they're in in the in green here.

128
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:21,160
I elaborate a little bit more about the problem and this is part of our what question what do we know about it?

129
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:31,000
Then here I just plain that the survival advantage is more everything in in this region in Costa Rican Nicoya in the north west.

130
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:36,130
I compare that to other regions in the world, these blue zones.

131
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:41,410
Then this is just an extra information explaining that what we are we know about these.

132
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:50,209
Okay. Again in green. Some more information about that.

133
00:14:50,210 --> 00:15:02,000
What where from what we know but see here that in the green part first I elaborate a little more about the they don't notice.

134
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:07,250
For example, I say that there are areas, so I'm getting at the factor related to that.

135
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:14,390
Also, I present some preliminary results. You have preliminary useful you can present here.

136
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:21,649
In fact, we did our pilot study and we found that Amerindian genetic ancestry,

137
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:28,700
indigenous genetic history was associated with higher odds of being or reaching 100 years.

138
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:35,400
And then I just play a little bit the hypothesis behind this proposal.

139
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:37,999
There may be genetic ancestry,

140
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:46,970
may explain in part this extended longevity that the central hypothesis that the research genetic factor behind these extended longevity.

141
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:54,200
Now you see that I say may this play in part because we don't know whether this is

142
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:59,270
natural history and most likely they are more than just given more than genes.

143
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:07,040
And here in. Great. I f busy fight or should I wipe with you?

144
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:11,420
And you see that central gap of knowledge that I want to complete in this proposal?

145
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:20,870
Because most of the studies are most of these studies are longevity, aging, genetics, longevity being done in European ancestry populations.

146
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:28,100
And this is true for almost any trait that we can consider cardiovascular diseases, mental diseases.

147
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:32,480
Most of the participants, these are from European ancestry populations.

148
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:36,230
Then this is a central gap that I want to complete.

149
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:46,760
They went to really to to to feel, well, what do we know about genetic of Hispanics populations, genetics of ancestry?

150
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:57,770
Then this is that white question. Then here in blue, I especially I talk a little bit about the how question how I'm going to do this.

151
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:02,450
Then you'll see here that i.e. it busy on brief this curriculum my methods

152
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:07,370
including the population I'm going to use these Kriol is a study in Costa Rica.

153
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:10,610
You are working in an animal model here.

154
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:17,390
You will need rest playing a little a little bit about your animal model or you are going to recall.

155
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:23,530
Participant You need to explain here a little bit about how you are planning to recall of these parties been how many do you plan to recruit,

156
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:26,390
how long this is going to take?

157
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:34,420
And also see that I just play a little bit about techniques, whole genome, you know, typing are not what you've been doing.

158
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:41,690
Statistical analysis, you know, wait a minute your you but see that you need to write everything that in a paragraph.

159
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:51,319
Yeah. By reading this paragraph you know that population under the study, you know, sample size, you know something about how many.

160
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:56,360
So I didn't want to use about the techniques and also about statistical techniques.

161
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:03,870
And then there's Pacific Games now for Master Thesis.

162
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:13,919
Usually you will need one or two specific games because remember, you have a shorter time,

163
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:22,440
you have two years to complete your thesis to invite less than that being a move to a specific games.

164
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:34,560
For doctoral student, you will need three or more specific games now or so, but typically it's associated with one publication.

165
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:38,250
Yes, exactly. Each is specific and should be one publication.

166
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:52,020
Now for masters students, usually we we strongly advise at least one publication for your thesis.

167
00:18:53,760 --> 00:19:01,829
You don't need the publication to graduate because you are going to present your thesis to your committee.

168
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:08,670
Your committee is going to approve your final work, but you don't need to have the actual publication in a scientific journal to graduate.

169
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:19,560
However you want to continue in the academia, you want to be in good graces with your mentor because you want to be cool.

170
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:28,810
Then you leave the policy results. Okay, but that would be after you graduate.

171
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:33,180
Usually you take your time. You are added during the.

172
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:41,489
I would say, I must warn you that you will need to get an application ready to be in the already submitted.

173
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:48,840
What? Your. Yep. The specific aim is how you measure the problems.

174
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:53,070
No specific aims are objective of your research.

175
00:19:53,820 --> 00:20:00,600
They are. But again, see that these are specific and they are different.

176
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:04,650
But they are related to the central question of the proposal.

177
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:11,790
Because remember, the central question of this proposal was to know whether genetic ancestry is associated with longevity.

178
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:19,650
That isn't a question now in the first objective and when to do this as a specific statistical technique that is called,

179
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:25,620
you know, I don't need your mapping to look associated with mortality in that that specific thing.

180
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:35,610
I'm going to do that saying it's not a critical technique but to measure are associated with biomarkers of longevity of immune function,

181
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:39,300
underlying asset losses, specific aims.

182
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:49,680
I want to use whether to know whether it is biomarkers mediate the association between genes and mortality with you then remember the specific aim.

183
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:57,300
They are they are different, but they are related because they are related to the central theme of your proposal.

184
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:06,420
Then you'll see that each specific and usually I use these for but we will do Y to get x,

185
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:10,310
we will do what you know and meet your mapping to identify genome.

186
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:20,549
You know, you can all say now again thinking in the future because you are your committee,

187
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:27,360
your committee is going to work with you to provide your specific to get your proposal to your this is done but

188
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:39,770
you are planning to to write grant proposals to write to the reviewer as to you need to think in that review

189
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:47,969
letter because on time I have I have been reviewed many times sometimes I reviewing a been night after preparing

190
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:55,290
classes I need to review these grant them I'm trying to be fair with that with a grant but we are tired.

191
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,680
Then try to write in a way that's easy to do.

192
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:02,490
Right. Okay, so click clear.

193
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:05,820
Clear. Also avoid too many details.

194
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:16,950
Okay. So for the proposal to be we would have like this page with the overview and the aims and part of the proposal document.

195
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Yes. You will have this as a part of the proposal document.

196
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:25,790
Yes. We'll be like on the first page.

197
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:31,310
We'll get a proposal document. Now.

198
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:35,510
Okay. Also, you see that you see specific names.

199
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:44,930
I have a brief description of these aims and also a have on this on a small description of the missiles for each aim,

200
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:52,219
because usually, even whether they are related by specific things can have different missiles.

201
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:56,270
For example, a different statistical technique are different technique.

202
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:00,800
They you will need to explain that all for each specific aims.

203
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:15,490
Now, another thing about your specific claims is that even even if they are related to the overarching worth of your proposal,

204
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:21,280
but they have to be somehow independent from each other.

205
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:27,670
For example, let's say to complete a specific aim to you need to complete a specific one.

206
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:30,460
What's happening in specific game? One doesn't work.

207
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:39,940
Let's say, for example, you requested beginning one is to recruit participants and all you do all that it depends on that recruitment of participants.

208
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:45,700
Then we don't recommend to do that. They have to be related, but they have to be independent.

209
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:52,450
You want specific? It doesn't work. You should be able to follow with the recipe game and somehow try to.

210
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:57,820
And this is the reason why we ask also for alternative strategies.

211
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:03,640
Then what happens if one is specific and doesn't work out your true happiness and alternative strategy?

212
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:10,450
But the other specific games they don't need to be depending on the first one they do.

213
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:17,290
They don't. They have to be related to the same question, but they have to be also independent from each other.

214
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:28,090
Okay. At the end, it's always a good idea to remind you what why this is important.

215
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:32,200
And again, this is the last question. I'm here again.

216
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:41,670
Then you're right there that that resource that we expect to find, they can be they're going to have to solve a particular problem,

217
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:48,250
that problem, or they are going to advance our knowledge, what they are going to are to fill the gap of knowledge.

218
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:56,230
And just to remind our viewers, remind your committee why your thesis is important and why your research is important.

219
00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:07,090
Your Student one We should submit that before the questions we have our research questions on real aims when yes,

220
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:21,070
usually that happens after that the QE because that is your doctor requalification exam because after that you will need to apply for candidacy.

221
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:25,300
And that's the moment when you need to have a proposal complete.

222
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:34,420
But it is good idea to start working early because sometimes sometimes you need to modify your aims some time,

223
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:42,400
maybe two, to remove anything to put on a dream start earlier because they're so good.

224
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:46,150
So we should start the fall semester with this almost ready.

225
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:51,370
So we should start the fall semester having the proposal almost ready.

226
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:56,560
So we should be working during the summit on this idea this summer, huh?

227
00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:11,740
Uh, no, I mean, okay, let let me reiterate the answer you need right now to start thinking about your thesis, what you want to do.

228
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:15,730
And with that, thinking about what you're about to have.

229
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:24,460
Let me let me say you are a timeline when this specific part of your profile your to the QE

230
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:30,850
candidacy proposal and I respect it but it's always good idea to now to start thinking about this.

231
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:36,920
Hmm. Mm hmm. Okay. Thank you all. Oh, yeah.

232
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:43,850
What? I wanted to ask. If we are to change something about our aims, is there a specific process that needs to be followed?

233
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:52,190
Or just a communication with the committee that is communication with your committee now for change,

234
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:55,489
for your committee for this is for the projects to be formatted.

235
00:26:55,490 --> 00:27:05,390
So there is more flexibility. But for for the planet two is why don't you have your committee because you need to submit that form to Rakhine.

236
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:12,979
I need to approve that form. Then with a member of your committee for any reason you need to change.

237
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:17,480
I mean, based on time member, just leave that university or life happens.

238
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:24,139
Then you will need to submit another form to our to change member in your committee for

239
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:28,820
matters tools is more flexibility because everything in my initiating the department.

240
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:40,320
Question so far. And then for doctoral students, I will I will send you a more detailed timeline without the whole process.

241
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:56,170
Okay. Then after you write down the specifications and remember you want to work more detail in this one, yet this is just a first view.

242
00:27:56,830 --> 00:28:01,210
You will write your background, what we call from the introduction section and your proposal.

243
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:08,560
And this is the opportunity for you to put the research, your plan, your research in the context of previous work.

244
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:14,530
Okay. What I'm going to do. But how that relate to what other people have done in the past.

245
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:22,060
Now, again, someone that is not familiar with this particular topic, topic, which will be able,

246
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:29,740
after reading the introduction, to understand in general terms, what did you research about?

247
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:37,390
Now I can remember the member of your committee. They may be no expert in your all the particular research with and they are going to

248
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:42,040
have complementary expertise but they they are not exactly expert in every topic,

249
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:49,150
every particular point. They think about that and also start to think about future publication of your findings.

250
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:55,800
Why did all of you that usually also who regularly recommend it?

251
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:01,420
Students who write this part thinking in a particular journal and write the part

252
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:06,570
in a format for that particular order that will be easier to get it published.

253
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:11,200
When you finish UTC, when you present UTC, you will have most of your work already done.

254
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,659
Now then this is also very important.

255
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:19,030
I would say avoid unnecessary details.

256
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:30,880
I know that some time we we want to to put every final details of every last paper that we found that was published in the last century.

257
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:35,470
I don't do that that I to summarize what is more important.

258
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:44,690
Sometimes I remember my my mentor always told me to try to write the history.

259
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:50,359
You are telling a story about your research. You need to engage the person with like a they say.

260
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:55,280
I can see that within new you drinking coffee then.

261
00:29:55,280 --> 00:30:04,760
Okay. And I'm going to tell you about me when I'm doing that. I will get you in a scientific language, but avoid the necessary details.

262
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:12,860
Now, that method, that mental part, after your background, they should be targeted to your aim.

263
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:24,230
And remember in the aims we wrote and specific sexual intimate aims that I have seen.

264
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:30,260
So this is proposals that are that may feel sexual.

265
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:35,090
They are reading. My aim, for example, is specifically one.

266
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,689
Then we have the whole mental sections. If as if we're going to,

267
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:43,070
then we have the whole middle section that also you're going to have blog posts to them because we

268
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:50,680
want to publish different papers that that will help you also to to to get all these papers ready.

269
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:55,759
Now, in some cases, you may need some black background for your man.

270
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,120
So for example, you are using a new approach I may follow.

271
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:03,260
I know it is not the standard. You will need a little bit of background.

272
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:12,830
Also, you will need a brief description of your model or your population that you are starting when you are doing human studies and also anticipate

273
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:19,790
any concern about just a man's little book with so many more lawyers because your comedian look like they are going is going to ask you,

274
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:26,659
why do you wait and you choose in that population, why are you working with that animal model, what you are proposing,

275
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:31,580
that particular statistical technique, then be ready for that type of question in your oral presentation.

276
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:38,610
Also anticipate results. What do we expect to find?

277
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:45,060
Anticipate problems. For example, what happens if you have low recruitment of participants?

278
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:50,310
What is happening? That data collection is slow. That happens too.

279
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:53,850
What happens is you have some difficulties conducting the lab.

280
00:31:54,570 --> 00:32:01,350
I remember one time that the PCR wasn't working or the amplification wasn't working.

281
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:08,970
Then why did you want to do ADR and always think about the limitation when your research?

282
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:16,260
Are you able to generalize? You refer to other populations or is only applicable to the population that you are working with?

283
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:21,570
You remember we are taking AP right now AP classes.

284
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:27,780
Yes. Okay. Then you you know about confounding bias said that you would need to validate those each of their.

285
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:41,400
You will have other sections RB Animal Protection Data use agreements that are going to include that feedback from your mentor timeline.

286
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:52,890
Be mindful of time constraints. Now we are looking at the now we are going back to the lab where they were to work in person.

287
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:57,479
But as you see that previous two use to them, they needed to be very mindful about that.

288
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:09,780
Because of what limitations the lab was from available, they were not able to work every day in person or they would they needed to work on Zoom then.

289
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:14,160
Now at least we don't have that constraint anymore. And good luck.

290
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:18,570
You are embarking on an exciting journal journey.

291
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:24,570
In an exciting journey. I always tell students that in journal.

292
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:29,040
Yeah. Once we get to an exciting journey, when you think you will write your individual,

293
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:38,070
I always tell a story and once you finish your thesis, why don't you present your this at that very moment of time?

294
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:47,270
You are not were experts in that topic you know even more than your mentor in that what people what you have been working on that for

295
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:59,510
two you five years always is I don't know that so when you say I'll be doing do you need to include the applications in the in the.

296
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:07,200
No, no, you don't need to do that. I mean, you we need to that because when I say I to be,

297
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:13,709
you need to say I'm going to apply for I would be for these but not you're going to have to put that tapping into exactly that process.

298
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:16,920
Exactly. Yeah.

299
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:24,520
This is more for your committee because let's say you are you are proposing to war with the population.

300
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:27,690
They say a very special population.

301
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:31,049
That is that needs special consideration for.

302
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:35,670
I got to be then your committee needs to be sure that you are going to be able to work with that population.

303
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:41,580
You know, they need to to know that you are thinking about that and any questions?

304
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,850
Not again, you are going to work more on these things.

305
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:50,810
They will go one also with your mentor and with their work in your thesis, in your proposal, you are going to work more on these.

306
00:34:51,960 --> 00:35:02,040
And then for next week we have a homework and remember to week from today we had to this presentation.

307
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:10,350
You already have the debate again at most 10 minutes but a student you want to do PowerPoint presentation that is fine.

308
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:22,830
You just want to do to come here on the program talk about or even you would it right now it would be more of a discussion not that for for next week.

309
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:27,030
Please watch this video about imposter syndrome.

310
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:32,010
I know that even as faculty, we are always thinking about this.

311
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:41,010
Am I an imposter? Then please watch the video and be ready to discuss questions.

312
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:49,410
Not. I did check the BHP guy. That's unrelated.

313
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:57,120
Okay. Mm hmm. But it is 701 is required before I think before the exam before the QE II.

314
00:35:57,150 --> 00:36:01,530
Okay. They were saying that usually we get schedules for 2 hours.

315
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:06,140
Usually we get schedules for our semester language courses which triggered interest in for.

316
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:11,190
And we do not have this course. And that is that courses I can show you.

317
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:18,750
Okay, let me let me see. Yeah. Because usually, ah, last year I had first year two students to conducted seven more one.

318
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:27,569
And then even if you are not working UTC proposal at that moment but the student had the opportunity to to to start writing a decent

319
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:36,810
background or you are working in a paper in a of or so I remember one student was working at grant proposal for a fellowship.

320
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:42,300
Then he used that time to work in the fellowship. And then she got my feedback on.

321
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:46,150
Mm hmm. Yeah, I just. I have my commitment is.

322
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:49,590
Of course, but I would take it, you know, this winter.

323
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:56,280
Okay. You need to take it. You need to take it. Doesn't need to be this coming winter.

324
00:36:56,310 --> 00:37:02,550
This is for doctoral students for Methodist. And you need to take it this winter because that is going to help is required for good.

325
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:06,330
I put a proposal for because I will take them weeks later.

326
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:12,360
Mm hmm. I think it's good work before you get to the teacher, but I'll let let me double check,

327
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:18,390
because you need to take it, whether it is winter or that you can wait for the second year.

328
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:22,740
I think there is one class that is required after we passed the degree.

329
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:28,350
I don't remember which one it is. It may be this one, but I haven't noted, so I'll check it.

330
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:34,310
Hmm. Let me double check out. I will get back to you. I will send you that invitation when I get home.

331
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:39,690
Okay. Thank you. Okay, then you don't have any more questions.

332
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:44,640
Then please watch that video and be ready to discuss.

333
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:48,330
Then I will see your next next week. Thank you.

334
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:52,140
You're welcome. Yeah. It will be in the group sensitive person.

335
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,210
You may once again.
