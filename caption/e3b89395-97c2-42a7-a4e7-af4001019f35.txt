1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:08,640
Sparks. I'm here today to play fantasy, a trend of heavier attendance on Thursdays and on Tuesdays.

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,080
But, you know, for Christmas it out if they're not there all the time.

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,320
Not on me, but on your vast knowledge and information.

4
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:22,500
And so any announcements? Yes.

5
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:34,410
So tomorrow we are having a great admissions panel and we're having four of these departments from the state grad program who are on the

6
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:42,360
admissions committee comments to undergrads about what they are looking for in an application and just tips and how to create an application.

7
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:48,480
So any of you are interested in going to grad school here or you're unsure of what you want to do after graduate.

8
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:53,010
Having it and at 1020 in a speech to from 5 to 6.

9
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:57,210
I sent out an email last week with the registration form and then I'll send out

10
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:01,770
another one today where you can submit your own questions to for the panel.

11
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,230
And there will also be grad students to talk as well.

12
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,640
Anyone else. All right.

13
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:16,460
And so you have an assignment due this week. Any questions on the assignment?

14
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:23,930
One issue that did come up, someone had a question about evaluation.

15
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:33,140
So for this project, you don't have to describe or create an evaluation component if you want to put in there.

16
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:38,030
You know, you're got to do pre and post and that's fine, but it's not required because again,

17
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:43,380
we're trying to like incrementally build up to a fuller application.

18
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:46,700
So if you want to mention that, you totally can, there's nothing wrong with that.

19
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:51,560
But you don't have to put a lot of time into developing an evaluation plan

20
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:56,900
because that's like a whole other class to get into a public health evaluation.

21
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,640
Any other question or any question about the assignment?

22
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:07,620
Yeah. So for like office hours, I've been getting a lot of requests for meetings.

23
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:14,540
That's totally fine. But since I've gotten so many hours, I have to limit them to about 15 minutes per person.

24
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:21,770
And so when we meet just with, like very specific questions that you want to talk about so that we can get through them all.

25
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:27,800
I won't have time to like pre read any assignments or like read a full paper and provide feedback.

26
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:31,819
So if you do need help with your assignment again, happy to help submit email.

27
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:38,930
We can set up a time. But I do need to limit the time and just come with specific questions so that I can get through them all.

28
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,090
Okay, great.

29
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:52,850
And for for my hours, I have other hours on my calendar that are for other programs, like I run a co-run, a mentoring program called PSAs.

30
00:02:52,850 --> 00:03:00,380
So if there's if the class hours don't work, you could sign up for one of those hours.

31
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:07,459
And then, you know, if you need something outside of the schedule times,

32
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:10,820
just shoot me an email, but make sure you have public health 360 and something subject.

33
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:16,490
All right. And then the group.

34
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:22,670
So we want you to start developing your groups.

35
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:29,290
Hopefully, folks have been working on that. I also want to remind you about laptops.

36
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:33,230
We don't allow laptops, so I want to reiterate that.

37
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,480
So if you have those up, please close them.

38
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:45,920
I also wanted to talk to the class as a collective because an issue occurred last class that some students talked to me about afterwards.

39
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:51,980
I just want to address it with the whole class. I understand that when you're in a class that sometimes you side talk.

40
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:56,540
You know, I do it too when you have something to say to someone.

41
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,290
But sometimes you make a side comment. That's fine. That's human nature.

42
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:06,470
Last class, there were some students that were talking for a prolonged period of time and then a very loud tone.

43
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:11,290
And a couple of students asked me to address that this class.

44
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,300
So this is a collective learning environment.

45
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:20,090
And so we all need to respect each other and we all need to respect myself and Akeelah.

46
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:26,570
So if you have the need for a prolonged conversation, I just ask that you simply step outside.

47
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:31,110
That's it. I think it's just common respect. I noticed it, Akeelah.

48
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:35,210
I noticed it. It was very distracting to me as the instructor, to be honest.

49
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:41,450
And then when students started contacting me, that's when I felt like I needed to address the group.

50
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:48,730
I'm not going to single out individuals. People know who they are if they've engaged in that behavior.

51
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:52,280
So I don't want to embarrass folks by calling anyone out.

52
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,420
I think that's appropriate.

53
00:04:53,840 --> 00:05:03,830
But just so the whole class knows that we're all responsible for respect to each other, and if there's some way that I'm not showing respect.

54
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:11,930
Please give me feedback on that or talk to Akeelah. But I tried to show you respect, and I would ask that we receive that same respect.

55
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,430
Okay. So it hasn't been a big issue before.

56
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,419
Again. I understand that people chat and things come up.

57
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:27,110
Things that people may say may be interesting, humorous something, and you may say a side comment.

58
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:34,490
Again, that's totally fine. That's human nature. But it's the prolonged discussion that it was at a volume where other students were being disturbed.

59
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:38,180
And that's when I need to draw a line and bring it up to the whole class.

60
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:43,370
Okay. Any questions about that? Okay, great.

61
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:49,360
So we ended the last class. Does anyone know anything that we talked about last?

62
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:53,870
You come on.

63
00:05:53,870 --> 00:06:00,020
That video had that look like nobody's going to ask this and it's like hanging right there.

64
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,150
You remember this year? You're getting older.

65
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:12,670
No. No. Oh, my God.

66
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:19,400
You're just walking over there. I know. Talked about how to make it here, but in spite of if you want to come.

67
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:26,170
Right. Exactly. Right. Because, you know, if an intervention is really boring, then no one's going to come.

68
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:35,410
What else? What about a process at the very end of class to a framework for developing interventions?

69
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:39,520
You want to remember what it's called or anything about it? Yes. Right.

70
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:44,500
Intervention, mapping framework. You remember anything about it? That.

71
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:48,820
Right. Okay. Oh, it was just six steps.

72
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:54,020
I mean, that's totally fine. No. So there's six steps.

73
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:57,350
It provides a really good framework for. Think about the process. Yeah.

74
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:03,530
Sometimes the six steps of the success or you have a six, then just give me one of them.

75
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:10,960
One that you thought was impactful or interesting or important. I guess program outcomes and objectives like the logic problem change.

76
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:17,590
I think like it's. Obviously the intent of an intervention is to accomplish an objective,

77
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:22,430
but actually goals can really easily get lost sometimes along the like planning phase.

78
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:26,500
So it's important to go back to those. Right. Excellent. Excellent point.

79
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:32,260
And especially because, you know, in public health, we really should be doing these things in a participatory manner.

80
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:38,319
Right. So if you have a collective group of people working on things over time,

81
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:42,730
you might start to have what in the kind of nonprofit world we talk about is mission drift,

82
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:46,870
where you start to drift away from your original intent or mission or goals.

83
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:52,089
So that's a good way. Yeah. Yeah. I was actually talking about that with my supervisor.

84
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:55,630
I work at a nonprofit and we talk about mission creep. Yeah, exactly.

85
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:58,720
Like if you just do it right just a little bit.

86
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:03,110
Right. Okay. Yeah. And what did you all talk about with that, if you don't mind?

87
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:07,510
Yeah. Sets out how it's like sort of as an organization expands.

88
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,620
It's really you try to do too much at once.

89
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:16,030
Mm hmm. Stay true to what the organization was created for, right?

90
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:20,230
You get, like, a SWOT analysis. Mm hmm. Oh, perfect. That's.

91
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:25,600
And that's the same exact thing you should do with the intervention, because as the intervention goes, it can get bigger.

92
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:29,049
And, you know, you may start out just doing things at one level.

93
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,570
And then why don't we at this level? At that level.

94
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:37,630
And in the end, you may end up with an event that doesn't look anything like what you agreed upon at the very beginning.

95
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:45,740
Excellent. Anyone else remember anything else about intervention mapping? Okay.

96
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:55,100
So again, it's just, you know, and I think I can and I both brought this up that in your if you go on to an MPH and MPH train,

97
00:08:55,100 --> 00:09:00,440
you typically learn a lot of these different models and frameworks. So this is just one of many that are out there.

98
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:09,590
It's one that I found personally. I'm working with communities that it is very community centered and community grounded because you are

99
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:15,500
in the beginning creating a group of community members and they're working with you the whole time.

100
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:25,070
Right. And then in your you remember creating interventions in your groups and a long time ago, um, but yeah,

101
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:33,710
but I think you all did a really good job too of thinking about how challenging intervention development is that sometimes it seems really easy.

102
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:40,580
It's like, Oh yeah, you just do this. But when you're using a critical lens to it, it becomes a much more difficult and much more challenging.

103
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:47,240
All right. So we're going to be talking about health related inequities, inequalities and disparities.

104
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:51,620
We talked about some of these things already. So I'm going to breezed through some parts.

105
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:54,859
But this is just a quote from Kimberlé Crenshaw,

106
00:09:54,860 --> 00:10:00,409
who we've talked about before in terms of both critical race theory and intersectionality, treating different things.

107
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:05,840
The same can generate as much inequality as treating the same thing differently.

108
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:18,030
What do you think that means? You don't think you're going to have to think deeply to engage?

109
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:24,690
It reminds you of the difference between equality and equity and that not all groups need the exact same accommodations.

110
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:30,300
Some groups need more to counter disadvantages that they're unfairly exposed to.

111
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:43,850
Hmm. What else? This is very timely, given the Supreme Court hearings yesterday about affirmative action in college admissions.

112
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,390
I don't know enough about the Supreme Court.

113
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,890
You don't have to talk about the Supreme Court to respond to the.

114
00:10:52,350 --> 00:11:03,569
I think it's like kind of emphasizing the importance of like recognizing difference in like see like not only seeing a difference,

115
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:13,860
but like recognizing that you need to adhere to differences kind of and adhere to different circumstances and different backgrounds,

116
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:20,960
different identities based on how one prefers to live their life, how they have lived their life and things like that.

117
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:26,340
And I think the thing that I kind of think about is like when people say they don't see color and how that can be

118
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:33,600
like damaging because it's important to recognize and cherish color opposed to just seeing everyone is the same.

119
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:37,060
Right. So that's kind of what I thought about this is wrong.

120
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:40,920
I mean, it's like it's so stupid. I mean, I was talking about it this morning.

121
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:56,280
I was listening to a piece on NPR about the small number of black owners and head coaches in the NFL and that there's been like regulations in

122
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:06,240
the NFL about having to hire so many folks within their leadership that are black because the vast majority of players in the NFL are black.

123
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:14,130
So you want to have a workforce that doesn't actually, I don't think it is.

124
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:19,560
All of that mass of knowledge that we got that you all have been sharing.

125
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:25,440
I just think it does. But I was at about the NPR because I heard the director again,

126
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:34,549
but one of the people that I called in was saying that, you know, he thinks that most coaches are colorblind.

127
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:40,080
And then when you're watching the game, you're colorblind is like, that is such [INAUDIBLE], you know?

128
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:48,270
And the guy that was speaking was like an executive vice president within the NFL organization, and he's like, I don't want you to be colorblind.

129
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:51,569
I want you to see me as a black man, because that's how I move through the world.

130
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:56,310
That's who I am. And I was just thinking about that, too, like applying it to other identity groups.

131
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:02,280
Like if someone said, Oh, well, we should be sexual orientation blind.

132
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:06,900
You know, as a gay man, I'd be like, No, I want you to know that my life is different.

133
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:14,110
I want you to know that I have certain barriers, you know? Or if you're saying we need to be ability blind, how stupid is that?

134
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:17,440
I mean, if we said that, that would get rid of the ADA, right?

135
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:21,000
And we wouldn't have ramps and buildings and things like that.

136
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:25,860
So I think that word is really dangerous and the way that it's been used.

137
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:31,379
Josh I wasn't going to say anything about football, but now that he's sort of inspiring because also,

138
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:36,360
I mean, I don't think there is a single black owner of an NFL team among the 30 teams.

139
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:42,750
And so all the hiring processes and panels are mostly white people hiring the coaches.

140
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:49,240
So like saying that they're colorblind is like sort of dumb because that's like not even true.

141
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:53,250
But what I was going to say is about the Supreme Court case.

142
00:13:53,260 --> 00:14:01,379
Yeah, I think, like I listened to Justice Jackson's argument, it was like it was pretty powerful.

143
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:07,170
What she basically said was like, if there's two people, because I think the court cases from UNC Chapel Hill.

144
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:11,430
Yeah. She said the different ones but she she can only speak in the USA one.

145
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:19,460
But she was on the board of Harvard. Right. So she said like if there were two applicants to USC Chapel Hill, one one is way and one is black.

146
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:22,110
They both like lived in North Carolina for five generations.

147
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:29,310
The white student or prospective student had five generations go to USC Chapel Hill, and he uses that in his application.

148
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:33,720
That would be seen as like totally fair and totally normal and like a positive.

149
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:42,770
He wants to like, cherish his family values and like continue his heritage of going to USC Chapel Hill over the black student.

150
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:50,400
Also five generations in North Carolina, but none of his family want to go and see Chapel Hill because five generations ago his family was enslaved.

151
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:55,679
And she said it's not fair that you couldn't use that same justification in honoring

152
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,520
his family heritage of being the North Carolinians just because he's black.

153
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:02,850
Yeah, yeah. That's an excellent point. Yeah.

154
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:07,560
Some of the stuff that yeah.

155
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:14,370
Some of the other more conservative justices are saying, is this this guy?

156
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:19,610
Clarence Thomas. I mean, like, we got to get rid of him somehow.

157
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:30,930
Seriously? You know, he made a statement that, you know, I heard the word diversity for many years, and I still don't know what it is like.

158
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:38,540
I really I mean, because if you want to get to like the role that suppose we use the term diversity and things other than humans, right?

159
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:42,409
We talk about biodiversity and diversity of disciplines.

160
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:45,500
So if you can't define diversity,

161
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:51,910
you're I should not be on the Supreme Court because that means you don't know basic from grammar, but basic word, definition.

162
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:59,029
Take your word. I don't know what the [INAUDIBLE] it is, but.

163
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:02,410
Yeah, come on, dude. You should really. Yeah.

164
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:07,310
You should recuse yourself from everything you think you see yourself.

165
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:11,150
Yeah, I just. I don't get him. But anyway.

166
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,820
So anyway, I won't get too political.

167
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:19,759
So wait, before I go to this, because you all are really good at, like, arbitrary things without looking at the board.

168
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:23,120
So, ah, you know, you already have a lot of this up here.

169
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:28,130
So when we talk about inequities, inequalities and disparities,

170
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:35,630
you can tell me what the difference between these three concepts is and ah, what the differences are, what a difference is.

171
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:39,530
Can plural you can point to and compare?

172
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:43,900
You can pick all three and do like a three way diagram.

173
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:54,740
He said, Thank you for saving me a difference that I just like I noticed change or like pattern between certain groups or something.

174
00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:04,610
And then for like inequality versus inequality, like inequality is like an unequal out.

175
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:07,730
So it's like they're like very much done this time, right?

176
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:16,340
Yeah. Like, like you have two people and then like someone has three apples and so there's two like that's an equal like plus term.

177
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:23,060
And then like addressing equity is like, like one person is like starving and the other just had a full meal.

178
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,969
And so to address it you get like the starving person,

179
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:33,920
three apples and then the other person one and then they're at the same like I don't know if that was a good I like the nice concrete like no,

180
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:40,580
no, I'm not joking. I mean, that's, it's good because we in academia, we get too up in here and all these like big ass words.

181
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:47,329
And yeah, I was on a call yesterday, just a sidebar with a bunch of academics and we were talking about like doing

182
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:52,250
like qualitative research in global communities and community voices listening.

183
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:57,799
So there's wah wah. I couldn't have said anything. She wasn't even like 10,000 words.

184
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,920
I'm like, How do you work with communities in global settings?

185
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:05,020
When I had to look up like every third word that came out of your mouth.

186
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:08,710
But anyway, that's academia. Excellent.

187
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,810
Anyone have any that work? Well, do people agree with what he said?

188
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:16,180
Are she totally wrong or needs to be kicked out of the class? Hi.

189
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:19,970
That's good. You resolutions. And it's just that you're not the weakest link.

190
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:27,050
We have a goal, and we want to add anything to this before we start digging into them a little bit more.

191
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:38,050
Now I feel like kind of going off issue and what they're thinking about disparities.

192
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:50,150
I feel like I usually think about like our power disparities putting us in kind of something like disparities are

193
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:59,180
worse than inequities and very intentionally created and maintained by different systems of oppression society.

194
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:06,770
But inequity is kind of just like like it's not just the difference because like, explain what a difference is.

195
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:08,880
But, um,

196
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:17,659
I feel like as public health professionals that like we should be trying to focus on like remedying health disparities rather than just saying like,

197
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:25,340
oh, we need to fix the inequities that exist. Because I feel like disparities is more like a root cause or like, what do people think of that?

198
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:35,040
Yeah, I definitely agree with that. And I think you can look at health outcomes and see like there's differences between populations.

199
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:41,360
But like when you're talking about disparities, you can just think more of it, like in terms of like opportunities of health, I guess,

200
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:50,780
and like the differences and like or like the systemic injustice that causes like those unequal opportunities for health,

201
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:54,150
which then cause the differences in health outcomes at the end.

202
00:19:54,170 --> 00:20:01,190
But I feel like, like kind of yeah, like it's the root cause they trace it back to the disparities.

203
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:03,469
Okay. I mean, yeah, yeah.

204
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:09,680
I was going to say I feel like usually contextually I hear inequities more kind of among like smaller groups, like maybe like neighborhoods,

205
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:13,700
but you're disparities more in larger groups like racial or ethnic groups or gender

206
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:18,530
groups like I think oftentimes they're kind of used in like to kind of show the scale,

207
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:24,169
kind of like what I was saying, just like to kind of show the scale and like size of the problems that people think.

208
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:31,879
And I was taught in one class and this might be wrong, but health inequalities are like predictable differences in health.

209
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:38,530
So like an older person or older population on average may have higher rates of arthritis than younger population,

210
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:48,059
and that's expected or may make sense, but that health inequities are unexpected, preventable and not normal differences in health outcomes.

211
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:53,540
So like going back to like what are those structural systems creating differences

212
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:58,250
in outcomes as opposed to just like inequalities being possibly more normal or.

213
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:02,240
Right. Okay. Yeah. I'm gonna wrap it all together after everyone.

214
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,530
Yeah. You're going to offer.

215
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:12,439
I was gonna say I remember saying something different that like disparities are more objective and like more synonymous with difference,

216
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:16,519
but you're not observing a disparity. Then that could mean a lot of things,

217
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:22,330
but you have to look underneath that sort of like the disparity is in the outcome and you to look underneath that to the root cause.

218
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,320
Right. Okay, good. Yeah. So.

219
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:31,340
So the reason I wanted to just throw that out is I want to see kind of like, you know, where people are in terms or understanding things like that.

220
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:37,370
And, you know, the tricky thing is that public health, we use these words sometimes some people use them interchangeably, you know,

221
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:48,620
and some of the words are rooted in and are embedded in the way we think about public health in this country,

222
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:54,559
like a lot of government offices and different things are called health disparities.

223
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:59,960
So, you know, there's even a National Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities.

224
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:10,819
So that's like built into the language. You know, I think that I mean, I, I agree with a lot of what folks said.

225
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:14,900
I think, you know, the thing with disparities, I mean, it's interesting.

226
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:20,960
I was saying, as you were talking to me, that there are different ways you can view disparities.

227
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:29,570
So because because, you know, like when we are talking about disparities all times, people do talk about those as more like statistical differences.

228
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:35,719
Right. So it's like when we look at this group in that group, what are the disparities?

229
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:41,710
So they're disparate meaning they're different right now with health inequities.

230
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,810
It is getting at why are they different? Right.

231
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:52,610
And so those are things that are the things that that when you look at it,

232
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:58,400
you're also thinking about some of the root causes, some of the other factors that create that inequity.

233
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:03,230
But the challenge is that when you're acting, you're despair.

234
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:09,830
When you see a change in disparities that can be the result of taking an equity lens.

235
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:18,770
So when you look at like measurable differences, it's harder to look at differences in equity than it is to look at disparities.

236
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:26,210
So sometimes the markers that we use are looking at how do those disparities exist.

237
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:34,220
Now, one thing that makes it even more complicated is that it also depends on how we measure whatever health outcome we're talking about.

238
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:44,540
So if the measures that we're using are really rooted in a white, Eurocentric, heteronormative, cisgender framework,

239
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:54,530
people that are outside of that may have higher or lower levels of something, but that may be more normative and even desirable in that group.

240
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:57,680
And classic example is weight, right?

241
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:08,870
So BMI is just not good and different ethnic cultural groups may have different weight differences and it's seen as culturally acceptable.

242
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:16,159
It's healthy, all these other things. Food intake is another one of those things, even things like substance use.

243
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:21,320
I mean, there may be different levels of substance use that in a particular cultural are seen as normative.

244
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:26,570
So even though if you just look at, you know, a raw measure of how much alcohol.

245
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:34,490
Was consumed. It may look like there's a difference, but that difference may be more cultural or normative within there.

246
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:40,190
So you have it gets really complicated because you have to look at who is who's creating the measure,

247
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:44,120
you know, who is deciding what is normal and not normal.

248
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:48,170
You know, what are you doing with those measurements?

249
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:57,649
So the whole issue, you know, all these issues become really, really complex and hopefully in the next couple of slides will dig a little bit deeper.

250
00:24:57,650 --> 00:25:00,710
So this is from the reading by Braverman.

251
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:07,190
And with this, health equity really brings in the Africa social justice.

252
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:17,120
So if we have social justice and public health, people are not denied the ability to be healthy.

253
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:27,470
So it's going beyond just a health behavior or a simple environment, but it's really taking this larger social justice approach.

254
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:34,760
And again, the second point, health disparities are the metric we use to measure progress toward achieving health equity.

255
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:41,719
So again, that's what we can measure, is we can look at disparities and see if there is change.

256
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:46,010
But then I would put an asterisk at the end of that of who's determining the metric.

257
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:52,340
Who created the metric? Almost exactly. So how do you, I guess, rolling off the clock,

258
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:58,729
which just mean how do you standardize like an intervention if you have a study or an

259
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:04,460
intervention group where you're taking in people from multiple background cultures like alcohol.

260
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:09,499
Yeah, you can standardize that. Yeah, that that's an excellent question.

261
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:19,490
And it's very tricky because I think if you're if you're bringing in people that have different kind of normative behaviors,

262
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:27,069
it's hard to compare across those groups. So what you'd have to do is look at within group clusters.

263
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:32,149
So you'd have to do what's called like a cluster analysis where you're looking at, let's say,

264
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:38,479
Group A has a particular social identity and then you'd have to look at their

265
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:44,060
pre and post test scores within that group and be careful about looking across.

266
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:51,410
So there are different types of analysis that I'll look at, like clustered things where you're putting groups of people together.

267
00:26:51,680 --> 00:27:00,110
Yeah, because if you put them all together, it could be that the reason there was a change was because most of your group was from

268
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:06,200
a particular background where that's an easy behavior to change or where it doesn't.

269
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,350
It's not really tied to cultural understanding, value, things like that.

270
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,210
Yeah, that's a really, really good question.

271
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:18,799
So the third, no reduction in health disparities is evidence that you're moving toward greater health equity.

272
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:26,870
So again, that that relationship between the two is really important and the last are moving toward greater health

273
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:31,010
equity is achieved by selectively improving the health of those who are economically socially disadvantaged,

274
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:35,810
not by worsening of the health of those in advantaged groups.

275
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:39,979
And that's what I remember the very first year I taught this class.

276
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:44,870
We had a really interesting conversation about this because I had a student who was like,

277
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:49,280
Well, people who have advantage also have child health challenges, too.

278
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:55,700
Yeah, because we focus a lot, I think especially and and the School of Public Health on people who are,

279
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:59,450
you know, lower income minoritized groups, things like that.

280
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:05,839
But, but people in others kind of identity categories also have different health issues.

281
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:13,940
And so she was bringing up that, you know, if we if we're really looking toward health equity across different health issues,

282
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:19,729
we do need to make sure that we're not blinded by like always focusing on those that are the

283
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:24,950
most economically and socially disadvantaged because other groups do have health issues.

284
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:29,690
So, for instance, eating disorders cut across all socioeconomic groups.

285
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:37,100
We're seeing them now, although it doesn't cut across economically is as much.

286
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:48,770
But like with with fentanyl, people are dying from all different kind of groups, from ODS, from from Vietnam and other types of drugs.

287
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:55,460
So I just thought that was an interesting point that she raised that that one year.

288
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:05,870
So one of the do you all know you should but do you all know helping people find dirty formulas like guess I know what you're going to ask already.

289
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:14,660
Yes. You are learning this in other classes, which is good. But one of their overarching goals is eliminate health disparities, achieve health equity,

290
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:18,290
and attain health literacy to improve the health and well-being of all.

291
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:22,730
So they were pretty inclusive. So it's like, let's throw in the disparities.

292
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:27,210
Let's throw in. The equity.

293
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:34,170
Now, it's interesting how they talk about eliminate health disparities and achieve health equity.

294
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:40,230
So what does it mean to achieve health equity? So how would the world look different if we achieved health equity?

295
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:52,300
Yeah. I think that like image with, like the fence and like three different people and like,

296
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:55,620
you know, like the shortest person needs like a couple boxes, right?

297
00:29:56,590 --> 00:30:08,200
And so, um, yeah, I think like providing those extra resources or whatever it may be so that people have that are able to see over that fence,

298
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:15,250
are able to access help the same way, or like if they have additional needs, those needs are also met.

299
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:18,870
Right. They can be healthy, I guess. Okay. All right.

300
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:24,940
What's another way that we could eliminate health or achieve health equity?

301
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:32,910
What would that look like if we had? Complete health equity.

302
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,720
It's so far away, you can imagine it. I don't know. But I had a question for you.

303
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:54,230
So when people ask me that. Yeah, but you're saying something about how it's people have more images that could still be told to the crowd.

304
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:59,280
Right. Yeah. And so and then you're talking about like for eating disorders that cuts across.

305
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:05,100
Right. But I guess I'm thinking about like something that goes back to that point in like treatment for that.

306
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:14,220
Yeah, you're right. Like availability to to have like secondary and tertiary prevention, stuff like that.

307
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:17,250
So in that case, it still would be like a disparity,

308
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:22,950
even though like across said it's more people might have like a higher the same like prevalence of.

309
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:24,780
Right it.

310
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:36,390
So maybe it's about back to your current question like it would be equity in terms of like making sure that people have the same access to prevention.

311
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:44,470
But even if there aren't current disparities within different like marginalized populations, on the other hand, that treatment part of it,

312
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:54,920
I'm not sure that people have like the ability to attain different like medication, like, um, hospital beds or even up to the hospital like doctors.

313
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:59,790
And they don't have to go to hospital. We're just kind of having like both sides of the coin.

314
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:06,959
Yeah. And that's actually a really excellent point because you're right, even though if you look at just the presence,

315
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:15,090
like you said, like the prevalence or incidence of certain health conditions, there are some that will across those.

316
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:20,990
But you're right that the treatment and prevention is usually inequitable.

317
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:24,960
So it's going to the people that have higher income. So that's a really excellent, excellent point.

318
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:32,190
And what was the second part? I'm sorry? I was focusing so much on tearing that apart and thinking about it that.

319
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:36,510
Yeah, I don't know. Okay. It's all good.

320
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:39,810
No, no, it's okay. Okay. All right. Is it regression?

321
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:46,810
Okay. Sorry. Um, yeah. So I think with, you know, with achieve, it was about achieving health equity.

322
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:49,920
Definitely. Right.

323
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:56,610
So, you know, when we're talking about achieving health equity, I mean, Abigail,

324
00:32:56,610 --> 00:33:03,269
you were bringing up the point about we need to then be making sure that we're giving people those extra resources that they need.

325
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:08,850
Right. So a lot of people have seen that image of people looking over the fence and one to have different size of boxes.

326
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:13,970
You know, another way we can achieve health equity is just eliminate the need for any boxes.

327
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:22,380
Right? So to to work toward eliminating some of those larger level structural issues that we know that,

328
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:27,780
you know, that you could probably say is not going to happen in my lifetime.

329
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:34,919
It might in years. But but those larger level issues are would help.

330
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,230
But we know that they're going to be really, really challenging.

331
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:42,629
And if we think about like the health problem analysis as you go out further, that's where you get a lot of those things.

332
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:44,730
And those are the things at the bottom of the pyramid.

333
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:58,360
When we think about intervention and racism, sexism, heterosexism, other factors, it's really hard to attack those at the bottom is in.

334
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:02,970
I think the rest is all makes sense.

335
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:09,420
Yeah, I think, you know, really, just so you know, everyone's on the same page that when we're working toward health equity,

336
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:14,610
we have to do more than just provide people with prevention and treatment.

337
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,829
We have to look at the root cause.

338
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:26,400
We have to look at contributing factors, direct and indirect, and we have to really see what we can do to change those those structures.

339
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:30,600
Now, is that what are some of the challenges with doing that, though?

340
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:34,140
I mean, you all had a a kind of taste of trying to develop interventions.

341
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:38,640
What what's hard about trying to address health equity?

342
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:46,460
Because it very easy. If it were that easy, then we probably would have done it.

343
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:55,190
But what's hard? Yeah, I guess a little bit specific to my intervention, but not doing any sort of prevention.

344
00:34:55,430 --> 00:35:01,410
Mm hmm. And I noticed that a lot of the research that I was looking at is specific to adolescent white girls.

345
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:09,200
Yeah. So it's, like, hard to form an intervention that's, like, as inclusive as possible when, like a lot of the research.

346
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:18,930
Like a huge majority of the research is focused on like one specific group, even though like it affects older people, men and we literally everyone.

347
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:24,859
So, so, so one thing I hear from what you're saying is that one of the challenges may

348
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:28,730
be that we don't we may not have a basic understanding of these phenomena,

349
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:33,610
you know, across different groups. Right. Some of the research is really just focusing on a particular group.

350
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:41,450
And then we're trying to think about, well, how do we, you know, eradicate something or decrease something at a more community level?

351
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:45,350
You know, it's hard to do that if the research isn't out there. What else?

352
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:50,330
What else makes it hard to do? Health equity. To eliminate health equity.

353
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:55,070
Yeah, I my my my other thing is Rose's paradox.

354
00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:01,820
I mean, I don't know, like, what it was like where if you make an intervention that is aimed at the entire population,

355
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:11,330
it ends up having much smaller, like increases in health or like better health outcomes for each individual than if you make a more targeted one.

356
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:16,790
Right. But then the targeted one, just the gray is sort of like this cycle.

357
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:25,639
Yeah. Yeah. And what you can do, I mean, even with the more targeted approach is it also depends on how you approach the targeted approach.

358
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:32,870
Right. So you can try and ameliorate or try and attack some of those root causes.

359
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:37,759
But that takes having the research and the resources that all those other kind of things.

360
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:43,489
And you're absolutely right, when you try and do interventions that are too broad and there are a lot of times it ends up

361
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:51,020
having no effect because if it's so general that everyone should be able to respond to it,

362
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:54,870
most people are gonna be like, I don't see myself in that situation.

363
00:36:55,580 --> 00:37:05,690
Yeah. So yeah, I like I feel like also those in, in positions of power are often hesitant to kind of.

364
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:15,549
Take initiative to combat these inequities, either because you don't really fully understand them or aren't feeling the effects of them,

365
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:20,230
or also like the way in which it could affect them financially.

366
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:25,770
Like I think my big role in it all. So I'm trying, but I definitely think so.

367
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:30,220
Yeah, I mean, so there are a lot of incentives not to change health inequities.

368
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:39,219
I mean, you know, people are making a lot of money at the CDC and, you know, NIH and other governmental agencies,

369
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:47,410
people in academic institutions are making a [INAUDIBLE] ton of money off of meaningless research that goes into a journal somewhere,

370
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:50,230
but not here at the University of Michigan.

371
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:58,270
And, you know, people who need the services on the ground aren't getting them because it is going into these,

372
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:01,870
you know, kind of people in more elite positions doing that.

373
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:05,560
So there really isn't for some, there isn't really a strong incentive.

374
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:17,140
And if you think about again the way, ah, the US academic system is set up, which is where a lot of public health work originates at some level.

375
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:21,490
You know, people are trained in academic institutions to go into public health.

376
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:28,509
Is that when we look at the types of research that's done and the people who are

377
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:31,630
able to do different types of research are the people who are able to get money,

378
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:36,520
which are people from historically overrepresented groups.

379
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:41,440
You know, so this all kind of comes back to to the Supreme Court decision as well.

380
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:50,470
Now, there's been a lot of discussion and hopefully more about, you know, what should our academic institutions look like?

381
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:59,800
I think this is a really great example of how in public health, when our academic training programs don't look like the population,

382
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:07,990
you're saying that there may not be an awareness that you need to address these issues and there may not be an incentive to address those issues.

383
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:18,130
What else is tough about health? Equity interventions are trying to combat and I think like specifically what I was trying to work on,

384
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:24,770
but there's a lot of misinformation regarding it.

385
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:35,250
I think a lot of people expect that inequality in change, like how they can.

386
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:51,360
So because of that, there's like just it's like you can't do you monitor what your health issues.

387
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:54,770
Yeah I was like really inspired by this. I kind of switch.

388
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:59,530
It was like a giant crowd crush. Oh, yeah, yeah.

389
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:05,710
It's horrible. Like, it was such a big, huge difference, I think.

390
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:10,239
Oh, yes. Like that entire thing.

391
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:14,200
A lot of people are just like the media specifically. Yeah.

392
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:21,940
Time. Mm hmm. A lot of people because.

393
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:28,179
And so like these types of situations, I mean even like last year when.

394
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:39,640
Ashton Yeah, a lot of people and I think it's just such like situations I, it's so a lot of people talking.

395
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:47,950
It's like you can people in such situations can control the.

396
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:57,240
Really interesting. I've never seen an intervention from time and weight to your work, but yeah, that is true.

397
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:03,149
I mean, you think about I mean, there's been a lot of different instances where I know you guys in Chicago,

398
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:09,990
there's an instance where like a stage collapse at a music festival and hundreds of people died and, you know, just mass hysteria.

399
00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:12,269
And too, I mean,

400
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:20,550
I remember one year we had the pride parade in Chicago and it was so smashed into one street that at one point I was literally moving without walking.

401
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:30,540
And it was really a terrifying experience. So that's a really, really excellent point because so many people were injured and died from that event.

402
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:35,260
And it's really I can't wait to read your intervention out of the car.

403
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:40,680
So you're buying. So I'm still thinking about what would I do for an investor?

404
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:47,220
Isn't there maybe health issues that people aren't aware of or don't have good knowledge about good information?

405
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:54,510
You know, so if we're trying to address health inequities and especially we live in the age of disinformation right now,

406
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:58,230
people are putting out disinformation about things like,

407
00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:03,060
for instance, vaccinations and autism, zero linkage, no data,

408
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:11,100
but there's still tons of people who feel that there's a linkage between childhood vaccinations and autism.

409
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:13,350
And so that's a really great point,

410
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:23,580
is if we can't address health inequities that people don't believe us or we don't have any understanding about what's really cool,

411
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:35,510
what else makes it hard to do? Health equity. I have a small comment based on what you just read.

412
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:47,260
One class. We actually just had a talk about women and had it going to the point of people having like people putting out intentional misinformation.

413
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:54,110
Yeah, some people who would try to counter that or just giving an example of how each of our government is correcting,

414
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:59,510
is going to look like a parent of a child who like each each day.

415
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:02,990
The parents had the opportunity to read a book for their kids class.

416
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,140
Guess like this, like. Yeah.

417
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:13,160
And so one of them was something along the lines of like a boy liking another boy and then like a mom of three that said the kid's class.

418
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:17,600
But either she ended up reasons or not, and maybe somebody else in the class,

419
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:23,710
but just like kind of that fear of repercussions that might happen if she tries like reason.

420
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:28,610
So I think that can be like a like it sounds like health equity people were

421
00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:33,469
trying to pursue like equity research or and kind of for some background to the

422
00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:37,670
teacher told us that we had to put all our devices away and stuff because the

423
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:42,139
speaker who was like this information had got like just read and stuff like that.

424
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:48,140
So I just like the kind of like peer and like like intentional misinformation that

425
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:52,670
other people are putting out can prevent some people from trying to do that, to speak about it.

426
00:43:52,850 --> 00:43:59,840
And so I kind of like for like further blocks us getting for something that a lot of people are trying to do.

427
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:06,230
Mm hmm. Now, at some point, I think that, you know, sometimes we think that public health is a relatively safe field.

428
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:13,040
And it can be, but it can be dangerous, you know, when you're trying to challenge notions or, you know,

429
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:17,720
kind of going back to what you were saying earlier about how people are profiting off of these things,

430
00:44:18,110 --> 00:44:23,210
when you start to push that, you could be in real danger.

431
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:29,900
You know, and I think just look at, you know, COVID, how much misinformation, disinformation was out there.

432
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:37,810
I know around issues of like conversion therapy, which, you know, I've done a lot of work both politically and research wise.

433
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:44,570
I have a colleague who was receiving and receiving death threats because he published a paper

434
00:44:44,570 --> 00:44:52,760
showing extremely high rates of suicide attempts among kids who had gone through conversion therapy.

435
00:44:53,690 --> 00:45:00,770
And he was being threatened so much that we couldn't communicate over email anymore because we were working on a paper together.

436
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:14,100
And so we had to text everything or talk on the phone because his emails were being looked at, sent me the word anyway, he didn't have any privacy.

437
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:17,830
So yeah. So I think that is a good point when, when we move toward,

438
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:22,220
when we're trying to move toward health equity, there's a lot of people who aren't happy about that.

439
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:29,930
And we're unfortunately, we're you know, we're living in this era now where violence is acceptable in some groups,

440
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:33,410
you know, as a way to kind of protect your own. So, yeah, that's a really good point.

441
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:40,260
Any other challenges to pursuing health equity? Everything that lasts forever.

442
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:43,340
It is like striving for the highest possible standard of health.

443
00:45:43,730 --> 00:45:47,900
So I know we've also talked about in the past that like everyone's standard of health looks different.

444
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:51,350
Like how do you achieve health equity when.

445
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:56,930
The whatever goal you're trying to reach might be at different levels.

446
00:45:56,940 --> 00:46:00,960
Or like how do you get measure, I guess?

447
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:08,310
Yeah, no, I think that's an excellent question. And I think that, you know, that's something that I think a lot about is, you know,

448
00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:12,419
sometimes I feel like we're never going to be able to truly have health equity

449
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:18,420
because we're never going to have a standard for health that cuts across all groups.

450
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:20,160
And I think that's okay.

451
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:28,290
You know, I think we have may may have health equity with it in a particular group, but even then, I'm not getting my end now.

452
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:31,790
But even then, you still have to compare that group to another grade.

453
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:39,989
So yeah, I think that is a huge challenge because when you really take a critical lens to the way that we

454
00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:46,950
measure things in public health has such a huge impact on how we look at issues of disparity,

455
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:53,520
equity and inequality. And we have to really dig deep and look at where is this measure coming from?

456
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:55,680
Why are we using that measure?

457
00:46:55,980 --> 00:47:04,680
You know, even if we look at things that are coming from US governmental agencies about this is how much exercise you should have,

458
00:47:04,890 --> 00:47:06,209
well, what is that based on?

459
00:47:06,210 --> 00:47:14,250
Or This is what healthy fruits and vegetables look like or what nutritional things you should have, you know, does that fit all bodies?

460
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:18,620
Because not all bodies eat the same food and processed food in the same way.

461
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:23,010
So yeah, I'm really glad you brought that up because too,

462
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:33,299
to achieve total health equity means that we would have to have some kind of gold standard for what is was healthy and unfortunate.

463
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:37,980
A lot of times that's not something that all groups will fit into.

464
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:45,420
Excellent questions, excellent points. So again, we've already talked about these a lot because they're all so smart health inequality.

465
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:48,480
You know, this is really just differences in the health of individuals.

466
00:47:48,630 --> 00:48:01,710
And, you know, the difference when you talk about like health inequality and health disparities, if it's disparate, it's not equal.

467
00:48:01,950 --> 00:48:06,450
So that's kind of, you know, an easy one to say because if.

468
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:16,510
Akeem and I have different levels of depressive symptoms,

469
00:48:16,870 --> 00:48:23,330
then we're not equal because we have different levels and we're disparate because we're very different.

470
00:48:23,350 --> 00:48:28,880
So and I liked who said that about that inequality, right?

471
00:48:29,230 --> 00:48:36,860
About how inequality is expected. Right. So you would expect certain inequalities to exist based on certain social demographics.

472
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,040
I think that's a really great point.

473
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:52,450
And again, when we're talking about health inequities and we're looking at this in a broader way and looking at systematic differences.

474
00:48:52,780 --> 00:49:03,300
And the other thing, too, with the inequities is that those could be avoided if we were to do certain things like and eradicate sexism,

475
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:12,240
racism and all the isms. Now, the fact that we probably won't see that in our lifetime doesn't mean we shouldn't try, right?

476
00:49:12,490 --> 00:49:17,050
Because any incremental differences that we make are a difference.

477
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:23,200
And I mean, I could just say, again, it's my personal experience.

478
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:34,630
I really never thought that in my lifetime I would see some of the freedoms of expression that the LGBT community has.

479
00:49:35,110 --> 00:49:41,290
You know, growing up the way I did, where I did, how I did, like I used to talk about last year,

480
00:49:41,290 --> 00:49:46,930
I talked about just how much respect I have for Lil Nas X.

481
00:49:47,440 --> 00:50:00,220
Now some aspects, not so much. But to be an openly black gay man and have his identities just out there and celebrating those identities is powerful.

482
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:02,230
You know, that's so powerful.

483
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:13,450
And I know so many young men that I work with in Chicago that, you know, that's life changing, you know, to see someone like you.

484
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:26,650
And I think that, you know, I am sometimes shocked at the fact that, you know, we are seeing people,

485
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:36,370
trans people in positions of power and privilege that we're seeing in general, lesbian women in different powers of position from things like that.

486
00:50:36,670 --> 00:50:41,840
So just to say that that's something that when I was younger, I'm like, now that should never happen.

487
00:50:42,190 --> 00:50:49,899
And it did. So there may be some things you're thinking about now in your twenties that I think most of your twenties or 19,

488
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:54,250
20 plus, you know, you may be thinking,

489
00:50:54,250 --> 00:51:02,320
oh, that's never going to happen, but don't give up hope because you never, never know what's going to happen in the next 20 or 40 years.

490
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:14,900
This is from the Lisa Boling article, which, if you did not read yet, I'd strongly, strongly encourage you to read it.

491
00:51:17,390 --> 00:51:23,990
I really see Lisa as like a major and thought leader in the areas of health equity.

492
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:30,530
She's a she's a professor now at George Washington University, used to be at Drexel.

493
00:51:31,850 --> 00:51:35,120
A black woman who is very powerful and very smart.

494
00:51:35,570 --> 00:51:44,450
And those are shared. She's writing a lot about issues of health equity.

495
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:51,230
And I think one thing that makes her work so powerful is that she also will personalize some

496
00:51:51,230 --> 00:51:56,850
of the work that she writes and talk about her experience as a black woman in this field.

497
00:51:58,430 --> 00:52:05,629
And she talks about how this is first one, that the language of health disparities in U.S. public health describe how health

498
00:52:05,630 --> 00:52:12,290
outcomes that are clearly avoidable by reasonable means and thus inequitable.

499
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:16,540
And she calls this a presumed epistemology of ignorance.

500
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:24,200
And this is a term that really comes out of philosophy more that sort of thing I love about Lisa's work

501
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:31,040
as that she really cuts across other areas and kind of polls phenomena from different areas as well.

502
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:38,090
And she talks about this as it's a type of active avoidance of or refusal to attend to

503
00:52:38,330 --> 00:52:42,620
certain understandings of and knowledge about social relations of power and oppression.

504
00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:52,820
So it kind of goes back to when we were talking earlier about how some people just don't want to recognize that these inequities exist.

505
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:58,720
You know, they're happy with disparities because you can get money for grants, right?

506
00:52:58,730 --> 00:53:06,320
So if you show there's a disparity and this group has higher rates of some kind of,

507
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:14,870
you know, potentially limiting mobility phenomena, then you can get a grant.

508
00:53:14,990 --> 00:53:18,680
But if you don't, then, you know, you're not able to get money.

509
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:23,870
So there is and again, I think this is also related to privilege.

510
00:53:23,870 --> 00:53:28,519
Right. So if you're in a position of power and privilege, you don't have to think about oppression.

511
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:32,600
You don't have to think about health inequities in the same way.

512
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:38,540
Or it can be that you think about them in an academic way, but not in a practical way.

513
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:47,690
I know, unfortunately, too many people in the public health field that write beautifully about health inequities.

514
00:53:47,690 --> 00:53:52,340
But then I look at their behavior and their actions and it just doesn't connect.

515
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:59,239
And I really feel like that if you're going to put yourself out there and kind of espouse

516
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:03,469
some of these principles and challenge some of these things from an academic perspective,

517
00:54:03,470 --> 00:54:12,290
you need to live that, too. Because to me, it just feels really shallow to kind of say that and to, you know,

518
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:17,509
there's been a long history of predominantly white researchers making money off

519
00:54:17,510 --> 00:54:22,910
the backs of people of color by showing all the differences for people of color,

520
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:25,010
but not doing [INAUDIBLE] to address it.

521
00:54:25,610 --> 00:54:33,080
So it's one thing if you keep reporting over and over and over again that black men have higher rates of this than white men,

522
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:38,570
but you're not really doing anything about it. To me, that's not really.

523
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:42,320
I mean, in a way, you're almost more the problem than the solution,

524
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:49,670
because it's kind of like going back to prayer about recognizing that there's a difference, recognize oppression.

525
00:54:49,670 --> 00:54:55,100
But if you don't go to a space of action, then you can actually make things worse.

526
00:54:55,430 --> 00:54:59,360
So that's just my opinion. And other people may not agree with that.

527
00:55:01,970 --> 00:55:05,690
And she talks about how this like willful ignorance is functional.

528
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:13,819
And I'm going to read this quote because I don't want to steal her words, but neglecting the historical legacy of how race,

529
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:16,940
as well as other marginalized social positions that intersect with race,

530
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:25,130
have structured social inequality for people of color in the US serves to center the health experiences of white people as normative,

531
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:31,999
colorblind white privilege to highlight positive health outcomes among white people as a product of their

532
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:39,230
individual actions and revise negative stereotypes about the irresponsible health behaviors of people of color.

533
00:55:39,890 --> 00:55:45,710
There's a lot in that statement who wants to unpack some of what she said.

534
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:08,340
Pretty deep. I'm doing the last part about like positive health outcomes among white people as the

535
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:11,850
product of individual actions and negative stereotypes about their responsible health.

536
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:21,120
That last chunk that makes me think a lot about how people in smaller bodies are always like praised for being healthy, eating.

537
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:25,590
They're not. And people, larger bodies are always being told that they're doing that.

538
00:56:25,890 --> 00:56:29,080
It's based on personal responsibility, and that's why they're fat.

539
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:32,280
Like, it's that the logic. And I think that's kind of a symbol,

540
00:56:32,290 --> 00:56:41,010
like a very similar structure to what she's saying here about how like making white people and their health as the norm,

541
00:56:41,070 --> 00:56:44,040
like completely ignores the structures that are in place,

542
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:51,669
that makes people of color unable to make the same healthy decisions that white people might be making if that's even a fact.

543
00:56:51,670 --> 00:56:57,239
Yeah. And even how we define what a healthy decision is, that's usually based on a white standard.

544
00:56:57,240 --> 00:57:01,290
So, you know, it's about really, can you mimic a white person?

545
00:57:02,070 --> 00:57:06,240
If you can mimic a white person that you're healthy? If you can't mimic a white person, then you're not healthy.

546
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:11,880
I know it sounds silly, but it's actually how a lot of it kind of falls out or comes out.

547
00:57:12,110 --> 00:57:15,300
But yeah, no, I think that's a really great example outside of race,

548
00:57:15,350 --> 00:57:24,240
another place where if you are dealing with a particular if you have a certain presentation

549
00:57:24,690 --> 00:57:29,459
that people are going to attach laziness because that larger body is laziness,

550
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:33,780
it's all your fault. You did this wrong. And with smaller bodies it's like, Oh, that's so great.

551
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:41,580
You must be doing that superwoman thing of like doing a lot of and going to the gym and walking your dog seven times a day.

552
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:48,180
So, yeah, there is a huge difference there. Other reflections in that concept, what you guys were talking about, really,

553
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:52,110
I know we talked about so long ago about how people who have privilege and are in

554
00:57:52,110 --> 00:57:57,149
the majority think that privilege is earned and that they are in positive health.

555
00:57:57,150 --> 00:58:01,530
They have that status because they worked really hard or they earned it and they don't consider that other

556
00:58:01,530 --> 00:58:06,150
people might just be working as hard but don't that don't have the same outcomes because of who they are.

557
00:58:07,590 --> 00:58:11,190
Yeah. And that is, you know, and that's something I think that, you know,

558
00:58:11,190 --> 00:58:15,179
when we talk about things especially around like white privilege and male privilege and

559
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:21,660
some of the and the big ones is that it can be hard to get folks to come around to that.

560
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:30,160
You know, I think especially even if they feel like they've had other disadvantages, you know,

561
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:37,590
because I've heard some of like white students from low income backgrounds and have other disadvantages that will say,

562
00:58:37,590 --> 00:58:43,440
oh, once it's you know, my experience is the same as a black person that had all those experiences.

563
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:47,370
And, you know, I always kind of challenge, well, we need to look at this intersectionality.

564
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:53,160
You know, there are probably some shared elements, but there are also not some shared elements.

565
00:58:53,580 --> 00:58:58,350
And it's hard for some people in those positions that have that privilege to even see that.

566
00:59:00,410 --> 00:59:01,549
And I think that's fine, too.

567
00:59:01,550 --> 00:59:08,120
With all the current discussion around critical race theory and people talking about how we're making white kids feel bad,

568
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:18,410
you know, realizing that you have privilege doesn't have to make you feel bad and it makes you informed and educated and you know.

569
00:59:19,610 --> 00:59:25,350
Again. You know, you could feel bad for a moment or you could experience racism your entire life.

570
00:59:25,430 --> 00:59:29,930
You know, so I think that that's always a kind of a crazy arc.

571
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:33,650
Other reflections on this last statement. Any part of it?

572
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:40,030
Yeah. And of course, the overall. Just like good luck.

573
00:59:40,030 --> 01:00:10,750
A good summary, essentially, of. And like specifically like I watched like the surrounding area and I just thought the issues within health care.

574
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:18,420
Color and display. You.

575
01:00:27,410 --> 01:00:38,300
It's like such a. Yeah, that's a good point.

576
01:00:38,310 --> 01:00:39,629
Yeah. And I think, you know,

577
01:00:39,630 --> 01:00:50,220
COVID did so much to really shake us up in different ways and to bring certain inequities to light in ways that they haven't been before.

578
01:00:51,570 --> 01:00:59,970
And it would be really interesting to see for a lot of kind of white folks of privilege what, if anything, they learned from Kobe,

579
01:01:00,450 --> 01:01:05,740
you know, about things like access to health care and, you know, all these other kind of grievances, obviously.

580
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:10,290
Um. Yeah. I was just going to say, I actually just literally before this class,

581
01:01:10,290 --> 01:01:14,759
I'm in a paper where I was talking about this earlier because we had to critique

582
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:19,050
an article that was talking about preterm births in black and white women.

583
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:23,969
And the article was basically arguing that there was some sort of genetic

584
01:01:23,970 --> 01:01:31,709
predisposition for black women to have more preterm births without any evidence of a,

585
01:01:31,710 --> 01:01:34,170
by the way, like their measures didn't have anything to do with genetics.

586
01:01:34,170 --> 01:01:39,569
But and so it's interesting how like, you know, this happens in public health, too.

587
01:01:39,570 --> 01:01:43,920
So I think it's important for us all, like what we're reading and like we're taking into like,

588
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:46,280
you know, these different articles that we're, you know,

589
01:01:46,290 --> 01:01:54,869
analyzing to keep this critical lens because that paper didn't take into account any of the historical trauma at all for black women,

590
01:01:54,870 --> 01:02:01,199
that could be the cause of of higher rates of preterm birth, like there was no mention of of any of that.

591
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:05,910
And so I think it's interesting and something that we do have to keep in mind also,

592
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:09,200
I think that this quote is the perfect example and something that like,

593
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:13,080
you know, just just keep that in mind as you're reading different articles in different classes,

594
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:17,610
because you'll find that especially if you keep a like a critical lens on it,

595
01:02:17,610 --> 01:02:23,159
you'll find that this is like interjected in different articles within our field, which is not great.

596
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:27,729
So we want to make sure we're not doing that and perpetuating that. Yeah, it's really at excellent point.

597
01:02:27,730 --> 01:02:35,040
And you know, and then yeah, I mean, again, I love Lisa's work and she's actually a friend of mine, so full disclosure.

598
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:42,470
But, um, so I'm a little biased, but she's just an amazing human and, you know,

599
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:46,499
and I wish like last year I was able to bring her in because we had on Zoom.

600
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:59,399
So I had to come in and talk to the class. So. But anyway, I think that this does permeate everything we do in public health, and it really does.

601
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:05,130
And that's why I just I love this sentence because she pulls together so much here for you to think about,

602
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:09,209
you know, and I would really encourage you to to think about some of these things.

603
01:03:09,210 --> 01:03:14,400
I mean, these are there's elements in that, you know, things we've talked about in the class and different parts.

604
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:22,050
And I think that, you know, it kind of goes back to critical race theory, too, and that race is always there.

605
01:03:22,620 --> 01:03:26,400
All right. No matter how much we want to think it's not, it is.

606
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:30,239
It's always there. We cannot have anything colorblind.

607
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:36,840
We cannot have anything that ignores race. Even if it's a study of all white people, race is still there.

608
01:03:37,140 --> 01:03:41,730
And and I think that this is just something for us to think about as we move forward.

609
01:03:43,380 --> 01:03:49,890
She also talks about the political implications, though, about how it stifles moral and ethical urgency for research interventions,

610
01:03:49,890 --> 01:03:53,280
policies and laws to address and eliminate social structural inequalities.

611
01:03:53,640 --> 01:04:02,280
So if we don't think that there is a need to address the that we do have this epistemological ignorance where it's like,

612
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:05,519
oh, no, we don't need to, you know, we see these disparities.

613
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:06,989
We're doing this, we're doing that.

614
01:04:06,990 --> 01:04:17,819
But you're not really doing that deep dive since we know that in order for public health to work, we need money and power and we need politics.

615
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:26,430
So we need people in positions of power within the government that are going to fund the work that we're going to do unless you have a rich,

616
01:04:27,570 --> 01:04:37,140
you know, sugar mama, sugar daddy, sugar, you know, nonbinary individual who's going to just like fund all of your work,

617
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:41,880
you're gonna need to find money and it's got to come from somewhere.

618
01:04:42,180 --> 01:04:49,880
And that's why I like I'm really scared about the election that's happening in the wee hours.

619
01:04:50,340 --> 01:04:59,910
This past weekend, I was I was working at Emory all weekend on a new project and it sits at our offices at right at the edge of the CDC.

620
01:05:00,060 --> 01:05:04,380
So I was like looking into the CDC and being like, Oh, please don't know.

621
01:05:04,590 --> 01:05:07,710
I hope the political forces don't corrupt you.

622
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:12,479
But what was scarier is Herschel Walker, you know,

623
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:26,220
running for a Senate seat there and just looking at how a couple of people in key political positions can totally change how public health is viewed.

624
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:30,360
And that's really, really scary if you think about it. You know, when you look at.

625
01:05:30,980 --> 01:05:37,080
Even here. Although I'm not going to give my opinions on who you should vote for.

626
01:05:37,090 --> 01:05:50,710
But, you know, the governor of Michigan, if certain people were in power who want to eliminate abortion rights or, you know,

627
01:05:50,770 --> 01:05:58,390
even people wanting to eliminate access to birth control, you know, that has an impact on what we do in public health.

628
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:06,180
Right. And just the women's rights to their own body, because that it may be one issue.

629
01:06:06,190 --> 01:06:08,110
So abortion may be an issue,

630
01:06:08,590 --> 01:06:21,130
but it also is part of a larger framework of thinking about how we police women's bodies or how we police people's bodies who can carry children.

631
01:06:21,820 --> 01:06:23,680
So, yeah,

632
01:06:24,310 --> 01:06:33,220
the act the aspect about the political implications that Lisa talked about in this article are just they're very real and especially right now,

633
01:06:33,790 --> 01:06:37,990
given the upcoming elections very, very important.

634
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:47,379
By the way, I did change the modules and on the canvas so that we don't have class Election Day.

635
01:06:47,380 --> 01:06:50,080
So everyone should go next Tuesday. There's no class.

636
01:06:51,550 --> 01:06:57,040
So she talks about what we need is a critical health equity stance where we're looking at research interventions,

637
01:06:57,040 --> 01:07:05,080
policies that really dismantle inequalities, that create health inequities.

638
01:07:06,250 --> 01:07:15,850
Now, that's easy to say and right, but very hard to do that sort of building up like the point that you just finished, which isn't also part of like.

639
01:07:17,620 --> 01:07:24,249
Like politics plays a big role into the role of public health but doesn't like messaging also play an almost equally important

640
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:32,680
role because I feel like a lot of like the CBC's mistakes in the early part of COVID were centered around messaging.

641
01:07:32,770 --> 01:07:38,920
Yeah, it's like really I feel like deluded confidence in them when they were like trying to do the right thing,

642
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:42,690
but like they just didn't message it very well. Yeah.

643
01:07:42,940 --> 01:07:48,320
And like that combined with like the administration being like anti-science, right?

644
01:07:48,820 --> 01:07:53,500
Sort of like led to a disaster. But yeah, I have a lot of thoughts about that.

645
01:07:54,490 --> 01:08:05,680
Yeah, I think that the I mean, how government agencies, like you said, message about different health issues is very, very critical.

646
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:12,370
And I think with, you know, with COVID, a lot of those of us who are in the social behavioral science realm and in health education,

647
01:08:12,850 --> 01:08:15,100
we're fighting to change the messaging.

648
01:08:15,250 --> 01:08:22,360
You know, I think I'm my teacher, but I was part of a group of social behavioral scientists that were writing to the CDC.

649
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:31,750
We wrote to Biden when he got into office about the need to have health, education and behavioral social science experts assisting with the messaging.

650
01:08:32,110 --> 01:08:35,200
You know, because we have people like Brian Zygmunt Fisher, who's back there,

651
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:41,260
he's like world renowned for risk communication, you know, and how to message things.

652
01:08:41,260 --> 01:08:47,620
And you're obviously right, it was horrible messaging, I mean, an event and there was that interaction effect.

653
01:08:47,620 --> 01:08:50,620
So I think you're right, that part of it is politics.

654
01:08:51,430 --> 01:08:57,489
But then we also have to make sure that our governmental structures that are created to promote our

655
01:08:57,490 --> 01:09:04,270
health are actually interfacing with the government in such a way that it is actually promoting health.

656
01:09:05,110 --> 01:09:11,580
Because yeah, I mean, the messaging, I mean, even today I think that, you know, they still are not doing enough.

657
01:09:11,590 --> 01:09:17,860
I mean, we have, you know, high, high rates of RSV right now among children and older adults.

658
01:09:17,860 --> 01:09:25,020
And, you know, COVID is still it's not killing as many people, but it's still decreasing quality of life.

659
01:09:25,030 --> 01:09:33,970
So yeah, I think that that what our government agencies do with that knowledge is very critical,

660
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:40,900
you know, because even if we get money to NIH or CDC to address issues around women's health,

661
01:09:41,140 --> 01:09:49,030
that the messaging that comes out of these agencies is such that it's not in a health promoting in affirming way,

662
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:57,720
then we're not going to really see that movement for point, and that is good on that.

663
01:09:57,730 --> 01:10:08,500
So hopefully what you take away from this is that we do need to move toward more of a health equity approach.

664
01:10:09,130 --> 01:10:17,370
It's hard to do. It's challenging to do. But again, that doesn't mean we should just give up, you know, and we have to challenge the status quo.

665
01:10:17,410 --> 01:10:24,459
I've been saying that probably for all semester because I Freyre talks about that and other critical you know involves a lot of you know

01:10:48,140 --> 01:10:52,730
different areas that are more focused on human behaviors and communities and

671
01:10:52,730 --> 01:10:57,380
societies instead of just a minor view of your health stats or your health outcome.
