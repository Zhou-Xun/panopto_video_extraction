1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:08,330
So there's only that one. Gene Wilder. Is that right, Betty? Yeah, I didn't work on screencaps.

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:14,280
You're right. And I might have got this one right.

3
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:20,340
Okay. And. Okay, quiet down right away.

4
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:25,770
You've got these guys. I know, right, everybody?

5
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:32,700
And you know what I need to do? And we should hear this. You probably want to take off American soccer.

6
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:37,980
Yeah, I will. I just. Yeah, I just heard.

7
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:43,150
So we're very fortunate to have this kind of.

8
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,250
How do you say this? Chintzy, right? Yeah, that's the way it's Italian.

9
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:50,600
I said in Italian. Uh huh. Exactly right.

10
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:55,490
Soundbite of preparedness. And maybe you can tell a little bit about yourself.

11
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,679
Sure. I ended up in there. Absolutely. Yeah.

12
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,159
So I'm a my day job is do clinic.

13
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:10,799
I'm a clinician infectious diseases. Very similar doctor that Dr. Stillman where we round over at the university I was just on

14
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15,180
and we were talking about and we can talk a little bit about this this ad no virus outbreak

15
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:21,230
that's gonna I know if you get you guys discussed it here we haven't yeah but yeah so he so

16
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:25,080
might be in this context it might be interesting to kind of talk about that a little bit.

17
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,060
I do mostly, like I said, clinical stuff around in the hospital.

18
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:35,430
I see patients who are infected with whatever bone infections.

19
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:39,629
I saw a bunch of patients in clinic today and then I also do what's called bio preparedness,

20
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:44,400
which we'll talk about here in a moment, which I got interested in when I was a fellow.

21
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:50,250
A lot of it stemmed from reading some of the books that Richard Preston, he wouldn't know who Richard Preston is.

22
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:59,370
He's a science writer and he wrote the Cobra event. And it was another one he wrote about the the Marburg outbreak.

23
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:07,950
Yeah, but he wrote one that President Clinton wrote read back in the nineties and got very concerned about bioterrorism and started to fund it.

24
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:11,850
And so. Well, we will talk a little bit about that,

25
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:19,530
but I was interested in that as a young faculty member and started to move this stuff into bio preparedness.

26
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:24,659
So let's just start let's start there. I enjoy what I like.

27
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:27,930
Is this part of it coming to school, public health, working with public health folks,

28
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:33,120
working with emergency management, not sitting in a hospital somewhere, just seeing patients.

29
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:39,630
I mean, I love seeing patients. I really do. But this this part of it I enjoy also and it sometimes gets scary.

30
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,739
So what is bio preparedness? I don't know. I mean, I guess you could look that up.

31
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:47,910
There's probably there's probably definitions of it out there. But what is it?

32
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:56,970
We're going to do. This will be interactive, by the way. I'm not lecturing. If I lecture, it will probably go way too long.

33
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:03,500
So let's. So what is bio preparedness? Yeah.

34
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:09,500
Think of things like anthrax, like. Yeah. So bioterrorism is is we prepare for that.

35
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:14,870
Right. What else? Yeah. Getting the resources and prepared for outbreaks.

36
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:19,010
Yeah. Outbreaks? Yeah. And we're getting very used to those aren't we.

37
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:23,960
I mean we're seeing when I used to I've given this lecture here probably, I don't know, 15 years or so.

38
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:29,870
And it went from not very much to everybody, almost knowing everything I was talking about.

39
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:34,160
And I think a lot of you guys will have input into what we're going to discuss today.

40
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:35,360
Yeah,

41
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:48,290
it's looking at how do you prepare for these events that could go anywhere from very mild like a flu outbreak or a pandemic or a flu epidemic to very,

42
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:53,270
very difficult like Ebola or Corona virus.

43
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:59,270
All of those have their challenges at each level. And you guys in this class,

44
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:07,820
I think part of what we're going to do is say you're going to we're going to assume you are the infection control people within the hospital.

45
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,010
I think that's what will put you or within the public health system. We can expand to that, too.

46
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:17,119
Let me start with. So what are we we're preparing what are we preparing for?

47
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,939
We're preparing for outbreaks, bioterrorism. I have to say, it was exciting to read about it.

48
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:26,780
And when I was when I was looking into bioterrorism, there was no literature on it at all.

49
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:31,160
There was one textbook, and I had to get it from the military.

50
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:35,450
I had to order it from the Defense Department here to our library.

51
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:39,920
The Taliban used to be a library with books in it, and so I had to order that book.

52
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:45,260
Now, there's a reams of of books on bioterrorism.

53
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:50,300
Having said that, what's the biggest event of bioterrorism that's occurred in this country?

54
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,060
Yeah, anthrax. And what kind of event was that?

55
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:58,790
How bad? How bad was it? Anybody?

56
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You guys were tiny kids probably when that happened. Anybody?

57
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:06,710
Anybody ever hear about that or talk about that? Yeah. So what happened?

58
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:13,710
Anybody know what happened? Just a couple envelopes with some bad bacteria.

59
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:17,600
Yeah. More. I don't think. Nothing, really.

60
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:22,220
Did any people die? Yeah. Yeah, a few people died. There were.

61
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:27,020
There were, I think, 11 people who died. And it was sent in the mail.

62
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:34,380
It was anthrax, sent in the mail, in envelopes. And that was a terrorist brother sent bombs.

63
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,230
That's not true. So at the time, I was doing a lot of scenarios.

64
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:44,960
I would go to DC and we would go through these scenarios and within public health within.

65
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,860
But to try and figure out what was the way that people would disseminate this.

66
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:55,190
And in none of those scenarios was that done in the mail because it was felt that it wasn't efficient enough.

67
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:59,210
What would be the best way to release a bioterrorism agent? Drinking water.

68
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:06,620
So that's a good one. I thought about the releases of of certain organisms in the water.

69
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:12,260
But the problem is you really have to put a lot in the water system to infect anybody.

70
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:17,510
So you have to basically pull up a truck full of whatever you're going to dump into the system.

71
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:23,660
Right. Clostridium or whatever is going to be put in toxins.

72
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:28,790
So it turns out to be not that easy to do that. The food system, right?

73
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:33,020
Milk was one place where it was. But what was another way that you might release that?

74
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,950
Yeah. So you would aerosolize it.

75
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:43,430
So the scenarios that were brought up and I used to do these with the medical students would be plain would fly over crop duster.

76
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:53,630
And so some of the terrorists in the 911 outbreak that crashed into the in the buildings had actually been looking at plans for how to fly planes,

77
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:59,620
crop dusters and how to use those. So the concern was at the time that there was going to be a bioterrorism outbreak.

78
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:04,700
So that outbreak of anthrax came on a few months after 911.

79
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:09,360
So that happened in about November. So it was very scary.

80
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:12,910
Only 11 people died. And you say, well, that was a that was not efficient.

81
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:19,640
Right. But it scared it. But how many people were given prophylaxis for CYP for Cipro prophylaxis?

82
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:27,139
10,000, 20,000 people was because it went through the machines, the rehearsals.

83
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:31,570
There were some people who were actually exposed who got sick. Yeah, the machines.

84
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:37,790
You guys don't get envelopes anymore. All right. There is no such thing as real mail anymore.

85
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:40,940
But the envelopes used to lick them. And you always wonder, why does it?

86
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:44,870
Only the sticky stuff only go a certain point doesn't go way out to the edges.

87
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:49,880
And that's because in these sorting machines, if you did that, all the letters would blow up because the air,

88
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:53,420
they would fly through the sorting machines and would explode.

89
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:54,700
So what happened?

90
00:07:54,710 --> 00:08:02,750
But it's a very efficient way to to release something, because if you put anthrax in there, these corners are still open and it aerosolize.

91
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,770
So the people that were infected were in these mail sorting departments in

92
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:10,459
D.C. and there was there were a few patients further out that were infected.

93
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:13,940
We still don't know how they were infected. Probably got a letter that was tainted.

94
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:17,839
An old woman in Connecticut died 90 years old. Who released it?

95
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,330
Who did this? I would.

96
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,510
It's not clear. It's not clear. Right.

97
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:29,610
It wasn't it wasn't it was considered a bioterrorism event, but it wasn't the groups we would normally think of.

98
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:36,209
And this the the the U.S. had been working on bioterrorism agents, on bioterrorism defense,

99
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:43,530
so that there we had like bioterrorism quality anthrax in some labs at the Defense Department.

100
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:49,470
And it was thought that one that Bruce Ivins, one of the researchers, was the one who did this to get funding,

101
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:55,710
but he ended up killing himself as a result of the as a result of the investigation.

102
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:59,160
And then the FBI said, well, he did it, and so they pinned it on him.

103
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:03,120
But if you read I've read that if you read, there's got to be a movie coming out about this,

104
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,670
because if you read what happened, it was very circumstantial evidence.

105
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:14,670
But he was sort of pilloried in the press. Yes, he was terribly bullied.

106
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:17,730
And so I think that's that's why.

107
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:22,100
Right. Probably. But and he was a little bit of a strange guy.

108
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:29,100
He had he he was he had a he had a obsession with a sorority and the mail.

109
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:32,129
One of those envelopes was sent from in front of one of these sorority.

110
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:36,690
So they said, oh, he had an obsession when he was younger with a woman who was in one of these sororities.

111
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:40,319
And the mail was and it was sent from that mailbox. So it must be.

112
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,070
So that's all the kind of evidence they have. We won't go into that.

113
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:48,270
But it's a fascinating story. But to this point, we don't really know who did it.

114
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:51,900
And as a matter of fact, they pin it on somebody else, a guy named Steven Hatfill,

115
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:58,890
who didn't kill himself, but for a long time was the key person that the FBI was going after.

116
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:03,240
And they end up having to pay him several million dollars because they ruined his career.

117
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:07,830
He was in the bioterrorism defense part of bioterrorism.

118
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:14,300
Anyways, a primer on bioterrorism. It's fascinating, but it's really not what we want to put money into.

119
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:20,310
Right? We want to put money into bio preparedness overall and mostly in terms of pandemic preparedness.

120
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:24,630
Who should be involved in bio preparedness? Who do you guys think should be involved?

121
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:31,790
Give me one person. It should be about one one job. I was going to say everyone.

122
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:35,280
Yeah, I like that. Let's narrow down.

123
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,590
Yes. So. Yes. Now, let me ask you this.

124
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:45,710
So how if you say everyone, how does somebody living in who's, you know, in a nursing facility in.

125
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:49,560
How should they be involved in the Ann Arbor nursing facility?

126
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:56,400
Oh, I think being aware of like what potential targets, certain things that can affect them.

127
00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:00,620
Absolutely. What to do if something happens.

128
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:05,010
I think in general, education, you look at career, you look at SA's coronavirus rate.

129
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:08,840
COVID 19 will definitely those institutions.

130
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:11,970
That's where a lot of the cases were that were the most severe.

131
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:18,960
It caused the most morbidity and mortality. Who else has to be involved? Yeah, the very public health department.

132
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:24,959
Absolutely. And poor public health, right. When things go wrong, everybody blames you.

133
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,710
And when you do things right, what do they do? Nothing.

134
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,030
You get no pat on the back. They cut your budget. They cut your budget.

135
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:36,390
That's right. Yeah, right. Because you've done things so well.

136
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,809
So that's what you're going to be faced with going into public health.

137
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:43,350
Not. But it's a gray field and they have to be involved. Who else has to be involved?

138
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:50,070
Who else would be reasonable agencies?

139
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:53,900
Firable, fire, police, EMS. And you know that to me.

140
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:59,940
And if you're somebody who likes to work with a lot of different disciplines, that works really well.

141
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:04,709
And plans are nothing but planning is everything really.

142
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:08,940
I mean, you can have a plan this big and that could be used as a doorstop and nothing else.

143
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:11,580
But the work that went into that is what's going to help you.

144
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:18,869
And we did that a lot before bioterrorism, before pandemic, and it helped us at the university setting.

145
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:22,230
It helped us in our county because we were all involved there.

146
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:27,640
There was a there was a SaaS before COVID 19. Anybody know which one that was called me?

147
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:31,400
One, yeah. What happened there? Anybody know China.

148
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:36,480
It started in China. Oh, yeah, it started. Yes, it was.

149
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:40,950
And it was spread it through a hotel, Metropol Hotel in Hong Kong.

150
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:51,990
And it went all around the world from that hotel, probably about, I don't know, 8000 deaths, maybe 80,000 cases.

151
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:55,589
But it wasn't what it was nothing like COVID 19. When was that?

152
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:59,790
What year was it? 30? Yeah, it was 2003.

153
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:05,730
Where is SA's coronavirus one? Where is it?

154
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:10,950
Who? It's in a lab somewhere for sure. It's gone.

155
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:14,070
It went away. By 2004, it was gone. We didn't see it again.

156
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:20,730
Obviously, that's not going to happen with this coronavirus. But so we were preparing at that time.

157
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:23,819
We got a group together. Emily, I don't know if you were here then,

158
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:31,170
but we got we had a group together that was looking at where would we put SA's one patient because these patients were really sick.

159
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,270
Most of them needed to be hospitalized.

160
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:40,860
Health care workers were really getting in, were really at the forefront of both treatment, but yet also getting infected.

161
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:47,220
So in Canada, where it hit, Canada was right before this ended.

162
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:55,680
In Canada. They were they were going to pay doctors $20,000 to come for two weeks to work in Canada.

163
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:59,459
That's how desperate they were getting now. Luckily, it fizzled at that point.

164
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:03,050
It started to fizzle. It didn't end up being a pandemic.

165
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:06,900
And why is that? Why did it wasn't considered a pandemic.

166
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:16,310
Those are public health systems. Just so great. You know that.

167
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:25,970
Well, so one for one, you know, the CDC, the World Health Organization, it was just starting to develop the categories for pandemic.

168
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:34,630
But pandemic really mean it had to be spreading within the community in two different regions.

169
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:39,020
And there wasn't community spread, although when you hear about it, it sounds like it.

170
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:43,190
It was all spread within hospitals, within health care settings, within families.

171
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:49,729
But there wasn't efficient community spread. So you have to have efficient community spread that potential for a pandemic.

172
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:51,620
Remember that? That's a very important point.

173
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:59,330
So we were trying to we had prepared and we were wondering where are we going to put patients if this did become a pandemic?

174
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:08,840
We actually identified Celine Hospital, which no longer exists would be our pandemic preparedness hospital as a result of Sars-cov-1.

175
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:18,620
The University of Michigan, when they built the pediatric hospital, developed a floor that was called the Respiratory Care Unit, the Recue.

176
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:24,170
That's where we put patients who were most recently infected with COVID 19, the sickest patients.

177
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:32,090
We had a whole floor that can be made in negative pressure, and that was a result of the preparedness efforts that occurred way before that.

178
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,250
And it was you know, it was people working together.

179
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:41,180
It was Skip Campbell, who was the chief of staff at that time, who said, we need a unit because we we didn't have a unit like that in the hospital.

180
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,689
And we were going to have to put people in our in our ICUs and then move all the

181
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:50,420
other people out of the ICU to make those ICUs into negative pressure areas.

182
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:57,229
But now we have that one unit. Now, the one unit may not be enough, but it was something that we have we now have to do.

183
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:00,440
We do have to empty one hospital and then fill it up with patients.

184
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:05,600
So let's talk about this. This is May 23rd, 2014.

185
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:10,200
W.H.O. reported the first case of Ebola in Western Africa.

186
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:14,750
I want to go through let's look at this clip and then talk a little bit about that.

187
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:21,470
We've got to watch we've got to watch advertisements, as you guys know, a grisly story.

188
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:35,740
There we go. That's not a bad advertisement. I'll put on the sound and supersize license and show it, for example.

189
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:39,610
This could be the greatest tribute.

190
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:48,900
It's a beautiful time for basketball. I think we all agree.

191
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:57,210
Okay. And next here tonight, our Richard Besser takes us inside a hot zone, an outbreak of a disease so fierce, so deadly.

192
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:03,239
Even the word strikes terror. Ebola. The mysterious virus is on the move tonight in Africa.

193
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:10,380
And ABC's chief medical editor, a veteran disease detective for the CDC, shows us why there's such an urgent effort to stop it.

194
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,280
In a lifetime investigating outbreaks around the globe. This was as scared as I've ever been.

195
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:24,120
Not one step of my riding, but walking into an emergency Ebola ward in Uganda two years ago,

196
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:28,680
making sure that everything is covered is absolutely essential.

197
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:33,690
One careless mistake can be deadly. Those are the three who have Ebola over there.

198
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:38,880
Over there and over there. Ebola is one of the most feared viruses.

199
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,630
The new outbreak already claiming 61 lives in the African nation of Guinea.

200
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:48,330
So contagious that four of the dead are health care workers trying to help close contact with body fluids.

201
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:53,070
Can stress causing organ failure, internal bleeding and no drugs can treat.

202
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:58,230
That's why anytime someone in this ward touches something, they're quickly sprayed down with disinfectant.

203
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:02,850
The fear is this outbreak may have already crossed into two neighboring countries.

204
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:03,600
Late today,

205
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:10,080
the CDC told me they're already helping the medical teams that are on the ground in deciding whether to send their own team there to assist.

206
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,260
All right, Dr. Richard Besser, thank you for going and good to have you back.

207
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:18,450
And next here today, Richard Besser takes it. So let's stop there.

208
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:23,130
So this is Diane Sawyer. She I don't think she's she's still working and I think she retired.

209
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:31,350
And Richard Besser, we used to be the head of the CDC before he was a correspondent and as you can see, did work overseas also.

210
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:41,700
So this is happening in Guinea right now as it put yourself in the position of a hospital epidemiologist or a somebody,

211
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:48,120
a public health person within working at a public health department, local public health department, even state public health.

212
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:54,270
What what are you doing right now related to this? Think about what you know about about Ebola.

213
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:57,840
Ask questions about Ebola. What would you do?

214
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,840
Let's say you're a hospital epidemiologist.

215
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:15,670
So what are you worried about if you're a hospital epidemiologist and there's an Ebola outbreak thousands of miles away?

216
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:23,170
Yeah. What's your number one concern? You're afraid someone's going to walk into the emergency?

217
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,560
Exactly, yes. It's going to show up on your. And they happen.

218
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:30,970
Yes, it happens. Yes. So it happened and we'll talk about that.

219
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:35,080
So, yeah. Well, that's your main concern. That's what the state health department is worried about.

220
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:45,670
That's what local public health is worried about. You pull the ripcord at this point or press the button and get your whole group

221
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:50,320
together to talk about what you're going to do about Ebola in the hospital.

222
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:55,530
Let's say the hospital. This is mostly about hospital epidemiology stuff.

223
00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:04,060
Should we? Should we? Yeah. Let's focus on that. That. What do you get?

224
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:09,560
It depends where you work in the hospital. Right? Or just like where your hospital.

225
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:13,550
Let's say you're. You're the infection control. Yeah. Okay. Where your hospital is?

226
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:20,680
Yeah. So why does that make a difference? Well, just, you know, if some cities and states watch out because, like, it's.

227
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:23,960
Yeah. From Africa, you know. I don't know. Right.

228
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:30,590
Well, from Tennessee, traveling from Africa. So if you're if you're the U.S., if you're the epidemiologist at a hospital.

229
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:42,010
And this is happening right now. Where is this outbreak right now? It's in Guinea, right in Guinea, which is a small country in Western Africa.

230
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:47,650
So the couple of questions, had Ebola ever been an issue before this outbreak?

231
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:52,600
Was this new, you know, surge coronavirus was probably 19, was new stars.

232
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,649
One was new at the time. Was Ebola new in 2014?

233
00:20:56,650 --> 00:21:08,690
Was that the first time? No. What else have we seen it? I don't know exactly when, but it was mostly in Central.

234
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:14,030
Yeah. Yeah. So you never in that area? Exactly. So one thing that was a concern was it was in a new area.

235
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:18,920
There were many outbreaks in Central Africa. And we knew about this, Dr. Solomon and I.

236
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:23,989
And when we were thinking about, okay, what do we have to worry about, we were thinking, we don't have to worry too much.

237
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:29,720
This is pretty localized and it usually stays localized in those countries in Central Africa,

238
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:35,720
you want to know the one thing you start doing is you start reading up about Ebola for sure,

239
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:40,010
because we don't see enough cases ever to be that up on it.

240
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:43,990
So we read about Ebola and that's what you're going to do as that's you'll get prepared.

241
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:50,059
Now who else might you contact in your when you're the infection control person to find

242
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:57,350
out what is my realistic what is the realistic risk that we have at our hospital?

243
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,890
Let's just say Ann Arbor. Let's pick University of Michigan Hospital.

244
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:05,420
Big hospital near what? Big city? Detroit.

245
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:09,440
Okay. So you were worried about people coming in from what country?

246
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:15,380
So Guinea, not the continent of Africa, remember?

247
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:22,430
So part of your job as a as a public health person is to say, you know, Africa is a huge continent.

248
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:26,089
If we start to look for everybody who comes in from Africa, that's going to be an issue.

249
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:34,490
So right now, let's focus on the country where all this is Guinea, and then how might you figure out how many people are going to be at risk?

250
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,110
He called it the ice. You call the airport, you say.

251
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,800
Do we have flights that come in from Guinea? How often do flights come in from that part?

252
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:48,370
Are there any connecting flights that go through Guinea? Just so you wrap.

253
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:53,320
You start to wrap your head around what that risk might be if this starts to explode in that country.

254
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:57,020
Good, good. What are we.

255
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:00,219
What do you know about Ebola? What else? Let's differentiate.

256
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:04,270
We we're right in the middle of all these other outbreaks that are occurring, influenza.

257
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:11,460
What do you know about Ebola that would make you feel better? Yeah.

258
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:14,810
You know, it's kind of like thunder slides.

259
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:20,400
It's not aerosolized. Right? So it's not one of those that we consider airborne.

260
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:27,990
Good. Yeah. The incubation period is like 21 days, so people are asymptomatic, like the first 21 days.

261
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:31,500
Yes. Transmit and travel. Say that again.

262
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:36,239
They're able to transmit it even though they're asymptomatic. So that's a big that's a concern, right.

263
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,080
That you would have. That's.

264
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:45,030
So they might be I mean, it turns out that the highest that the highest level of transmission occurs when the person is the sickest.

265
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:52,620
And we'll talk about that a little bit. So and there's really very little to no transmission before symptoms occur.

266
00:23:52,950 --> 00:24:00,750
So that's an important thing to know because if there's transmission, what, what and what infections are transmitted before people have symptoms.

267
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:08,780
Now, in some. Colvin Yeah, it's high five typhoid.

268
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:15,509
That's a good one. That's a food borne mostly. It can be transmitted before you have full symptoms.

269
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:18,629
Absolutely. Typhoid Mary was asymptomatic when she was transmitting.

270
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:22,620
That's probably what you're thinking of. What else? Good flu.

271
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:29,100
So those diseases, somebody could be traveling on an airplane and they can actually with COVID,

272
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:35,130
you can be lousy with COVID and not have symptoms and be on an airplane transmitting this.

273
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:40,230
Now, with with Ebola, very unlikely.

274
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:44,400
So you could say so you could really focus on people who are symptomatic.

275
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:51,569
And it turns out you could even focus farther down. But we didn't know we didn't know it at the time, but it's really sick.

276
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:57,870
You have to be pretty sick before you're efficiently transmitting it because it's not transmitted through an aerosolized form.

277
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:01,590
What is bad about Ebola that you're worried about?

278
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:08,010
It's scary. It's scary. There are bad movies about it, right?

279
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:12,510
What was the movie out? Was it called Outbreak with Dustin Hoffman?

280
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:16,470
What was an Ebola like illness? And everybody saw that.

281
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:21,340
And that was before the Ebola outbreak that occurred. Terrifying, right?

282
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:28,470
People bleed through their eyes and and nose and they they die terribly and they die very sick.

283
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:37,320
And what else? What else is bad? It was said on here, there's no treatment, no vaccine.

284
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:46,680
So you are in a situation where as a public health person, all you can tell people is protect yourself.

285
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:54,460
And so the level of that protection kind of increases because you don't have treatments for it.

286
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,660
If we have treatments for something and the treatments are very effective,

287
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:02,700
you don't have to sit in your house and wait until the pandemic epidemic outbreak is over.

288
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:09,150
But in a case like this, in your worst and your worst case scenario, and you have to be a little careful as a public health person,

289
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:13,590
and that's why reading a lot helps because you wrap your head around it.

290
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:18,480
When people are getting really scared, you can say, Wait a minute, okay, it's scary,

291
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:24,660
but let's put parameters around this disease because there are we know about it.

292
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:28,980
It's been around. And so that's where we were at that time.

293
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:34,740
I wasn't so concerned. And we'll see where we wrong.

294
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:38,340
I don't know. Emily, how concerned were you at the time when when it was in Guinea?

295
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:51,750
I wasn't really that concerned, but I think as time went on, got more concerned as it spread to inches countries.

296
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:55,169
Yes. And we'll talk. And this is this is what's going to happen now.

297
00:26:55,170 --> 00:27:00,360
So at this time, you don't want to pull the ripcord, because if you do it, what's going to happen?

298
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:06,600
Okay. What's that? Panic.

299
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:14,350
People will panic. Your leadership will believe you because you are their line into the epidemiology of things

300
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:22,180
and they will either panic or start to lose some confidence in your abilities to to to,

301
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:25,240
you know, supply information to them.

302
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:33,990
So you have to be careful. And then if you start too early, there is all this preparation fatigue that can occur that is out there.

303
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,959
So it's a tough dance because you don't want to you don't want to poo poo it.

304
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:45,010
You don't want to say, oh, it's nothing. I mean, I kind of was in that camp at the time, and I and I regret that I wasn't saying it was nothing.

305
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:51,819
But these are isolated events. They typically don't go outside those countries and there we don't have to worry

306
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:56,190
about it here except to make sure that we know that people are coming in.

307
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:04,660
So the very simple thing to do is anybody who comes into our hospital, who's been to Guinea, Guinea, not Africa.

308
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:08,110
And the problem was some places would say Africa.

309
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:14,150
And Africa is not a country. It's a huge continent with many.

310
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:18,200
I don't know how many countries are in Africa. 80. Yeah.

311
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:22,180
More. More. Right. So you have to be a little bit careful.

312
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:25,700
Let's move forward here. Why were we not so concerned then?

313
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:31,280
We talked about that. And as the infection prevention person in the hospital, what steps would you now take?

314
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:37,460
And you would really you would really look at how do we how do we watch people who are coming in?

315
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:42,110
And you have to be careful because even asking a bunch of questions of somebody who comes into the system,

316
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:47,630
that has to be done thousands of times a day. Right. Because people are coming into our system from all different places.

317
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:52,340
So do you put that do you do this in the emergency department? Do you do it in the outpatient setting?

318
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:57,290
Do you do it in your inpatient setting? It turns out you probably have to do it in all those places.

319
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:04,399
But you want to be careful because if you if you it seems simple, but if you overextend,

320
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:08,170
it'll tire out people and then they won't and then it won't work later on.

321
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:13,700
So you have to be a little bit careful. So Ebola takes a heavy toll on health care workers.

322
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:31,620
And let's look at this clip now. I'm going to leave the sound off because it's not basketball.

323
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:42,040
Britney. ABC's chief health and medical editor Dr. Richard Besser with us here tonight.

324
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:46,360
And Dr. Besser, first of all, these two Americans. What are their chances of survival here?

325
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,000
Well, in this outbreak of Ebola, 60% of people have died.

326
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:53,820
40%, their bodies fight it off and they survive. 60% have died.

327
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:59,730
This is a troubling number. Is there any kind of treatment? Well, there's no medicine that will fight the virus.

328
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:04,900
There's no vaccine to prevent it. But I'll give you fluids if you're dehydrated, medicine for your fever, those things can help.

329
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:10,450
But these two Americans were on the front lines when pictures of you. You've been on the front lines before as well, suiting up there.

330
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:14,170
And you were telling me within 15 minutes of suiting up, you feel that massive heat?

331
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:17,440
Yeah, it's very hard to wear that equipment for long periods of time.

332
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:22,000
Usually you see health care workers get sick early in an outbreak before there's this kind of equipment.

333
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:26,170
You know, I talk to CDC, they're worried that people are getting sick this far into it,

334
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:29,829
that maybe people are making mistakes, perhaps outside the scope of this at this point.

335
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:34,060
A couple of weeks ago, you were sitting here telling me your biggest fear someone would get on a plane undetected.

336
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:38,890
We reported on that this weekend, a man flying to Nigeria and then dying once he arrived.

337
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:42,999
That's very concerning. Reportedly, he had no symptoms when he got on.

338
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,070
He was sick when he got off. Those people who were in direct contact with him are at risk.

339
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:50,620
They're going to need to monitor them to make sure they don't spread it around Nigeria.

340
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:53,740
All right, Dr. Besser with us every step of the way on this story. Thank you.

341
00:30:53,920 --> 00:31:03,350
ABC. Okay. So what do you so what do you do now?

342
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:10,689
So now we have two people who are transferred here because they are one case transferred here because they got sick in that country.

343
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:16,390
They were health care workers being transferred here. And where are we going to transfer those people to the U of M?

344
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:20,860
Get those people. Michigan medicine. Where do we transfer them?

345
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:26,379
Okay, you get a call, you say, oh, we have these two people from Guinea.

346
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:30,520
They're they both have they've been working in the field, health care workers.

347
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:33,970
We need to treat them for Ebola. And what do you say is the infection?

348
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:39,010
But you won't be the you'll be working with your leadership. But what do you what do you tell your leadership?

349
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:47,290
We don't do Ebola. It's like this is where you tell your leadership.

350
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:51,670
And those calls never went out because where do they take these patients?

351
00:31:55,710 --> 00:32:02,370
They take them to a biocontainment unit in unit. Now, that's that's a little bit scary, isn't it?

352
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:10,170
And it's a little bit against what we were talking about before. Right. Why they took them to a biocontainment unit.

353
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,770
What is. We were talking about Ebola just before.

354
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:19,290
To your point over there in the corner about Ebola transmission.

355
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:24,900
How was it transmitted? Through contact.

356
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:30,870
Yeah. Yeah. Contact is spread through secretions, through body fluids.

357
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:35,610
So why the heck are we putting these people in a biocontainment unit?

358
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:41,850
So, I mean, in truth, we should be able to take care of that person at University of Michigan.

359
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,970
We ought to be able to do it right, Emily? In theory.

360
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:49,110
In theory. Right. But no one's going to want to do that.

361
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:54,180
But that's so and so we have and there are four broke and there may be more now.

362
00:32:54,180 --> 00:33:02,670
But there were at the time there were four biocontainment units in the U.S., all run by NIH and CDC, and there was one in Nebraska, too.

363
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:06,960
And these units are lockdown units. You go in with your moon suit.

364
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:11,430
They're well controlled. They're very well controlled in terms of temperature.

365
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:15,900
So that that when you saw Dr. Besser getting dressed up there, that's awful.

366
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:20,040
And it's it's we did this.

367
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:24,180
I'll show you a picture of us in our suits. But that is not easy to do.

368
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:28,080
To be in one of those suits. It's hot. You can't do very much.

369
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:34,079
And you want out and you get claustrophobic. So it's not easy to do in the best situations.

370
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:39,900
But in a situation where the temperatures are up in the nineties with no air conditioning, I don't know how they did it.

371
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:44,879
And these nurses being in there with patients for hours and hours are really remarkable.

372
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:51,360
Now, two people that were I think it was one doc and one nurse that were being transferred here for care.

373
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:57,260
Yeah. And so why the biocontainment unit? We should talk about that a little bit.

374
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:06,629
Scary. Yeah, it's scary, right? I mean, it is, right.

375
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:13,980
You're bringing somebody in. But Ebola is a scary disease, not only because of the television, but because of movies.

376
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:19,110
It's truly scary disease. We don't know much about it in this country.

377
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:25,320
We do have facilities that can take care of patients that are sick with Ebola, but there's no treatment.

378
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:32,850
So you have to be very careful. And so any new disease, it doesn't matter if it's it can be a new disease.

379
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:43,980
It could be a new flu. So the first H1N1, H1N1 infection, when it started to occur, the first patients were putting in airborne precautions.

380
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:54,209
But with these new illnesses, people will be put in biocontainment units in if they end up if there are so many that they end up at our hospital,

381
00:34:54,210 --> 00:35:03,660
they'll be put in airborne negative pressure rooms to protect people and you'll have to suit up to go in and see them.

382
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:08,820
So we're not going to get these patients. These patients.

383
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:12,870
So are you changing anything that you do at this point?

384
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:17,549
There was another thing that occurred here that they talked about.

385
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:24,250
What else occurred? Yeah, there was.

386
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:30,129
So there was a person who came who got sick while they were in flight.

387
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:34,450
So we talked about Ebola not being a big, big issue if you're asymptomatic.

388
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:40,719
But what if you're on a long Continental flight across the ocean and you get sick while you're on the flight,

389
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:47,860
then you're trans, then you could potentially transmit. And so this person flew into Nigeria.

390
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:54,440
And anybody know what happened in Nigeria? What happened in Nigeria.

391
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:58,580
There were 20 cases. That's it.

392
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:05,610
So they got on it and they got rid of it. And what's very important is that was nowhere in the news.

393
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:11,460
You didn't hear about that. All you heard about what was going on in West Africa and the risk to everybody else.

394
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:18,450
And one big problem that I had is I would be in settings like this and I would say, but Nigeria took care of this and they managed it.

395
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:21,750
They found out who was on the plane. They monitored those people.

396
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:26,850
So they really stopped it at the first few people that were infected right there.

397
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:31,800
Now, it's possible that they didn't have a person who was spreading to too many people.

398
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:37,530
But they did something with their infection control practices that stopped the disease at 20.

399
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:43,140
Nobody was saying that to calm down the world at that time.

400
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:49,200
It's kind of happened. Oh, there were cases in Nigeria and then you'd be back to West Africa.

401
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:56,650
So does this change anything you do in your hospital? Any of these events?

402
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:06,640
Further communication. You guys think?

403
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:20,350
Right. I mean, like for hospital workers, like hospital staff with patients like the Red Sox, but that if you just like,

404
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:27,480
it's not your aerosolized, so you just make it better distance and keep stupid hygiene.

405
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:31,230
Absolutely. It's so it's preventable.

406
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:35,040
We still it's not a it's not an effort. It's not a pandemic.

407
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:41,220
It's not an epidemic. You probably don't want to put too much out there.

408
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:49,860
You want to have information, places where people can call, because by this time, patients are calling and saying, do I have Ebola?

409
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:54,210
I walk by a person whose nose was bleeding. Do I have Ebola?

410
00:37:54,810 --> 00:38:03,270
And the answer is no. You don't have Ebola? Of course not. I was in I was in Rwanda for recently.

411
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:07,440
And there were I was around a few sick people. Am I at risk?

412
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:12,830
The answer is no. So you do have to do something because the public is starting to hear about this.

413
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:17,190
It's on the news a lot daily, if not multiple times a day.

414
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:22,320
And so within our system, we start to get our our nurse.

415
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:26,280
You start to get a system where people can call in and get questions answered.

416
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:29,580
You have to talk to your leadership as an infection prevention person.

417
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:33,300
You have to make sure your leadership is up to date.

418
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:35,400
They don't want to be surprised by anything.

419
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:42,850
At the same time, you don't want to over stimuli in terms of what they don't want to say, oh, my gosh, it's coming.

420
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:46,380
We don't know at this point. We don't know. We're not sure.

421
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:52,290
We know about Ebola. I can tell them about Ebola. Emily can talk to them about Ebola.

422
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:55,920
They would get a group together, have a discussion, okay. Everything's okay.

423
00:38:55,950 --> 00:39:05,160
We're doing these things. What are you doing? We're doing information campaigns to people, have questions we're asking when they come into our system.

424
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:11,850
Have they been to Guinea and the other countries that it started to show up in, which will look at here in a moment?

425
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:16,310
And you do that. You have to do it in a stepped up fashion.

426
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,799
Remember, you're not. You're the one you're in my mind.

427
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:23,370
I always want to be the one that quells pain. That may be a false.

428
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:31,559
I might sometimes do that to a fault. But there's there is a way always to make sure that people understand the reality of something.

429
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:38,250
And the reality is usually a lot less scary than what people have in their minds in any of these situations.

430
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:43,600
And so be that person within public health. And that will serve you well.

431
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:47,580
I think I think that is is where public health is excellent.

432
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:51,030
Getting the information putting the information out there.

433
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:59,730
CDC has gotten a bit of heat for that. And Dr. Walensky has acknowledged that to say we are not putting out the information the way we should be.

434
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:05,800
Some of that is a function of the way information is coming out now. So you guys are going to be part of that, too.

435
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:12,060
It's there's so much out there. And how do you communicate within the gray?

436
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:17,590
So you don't want to be, oh, this is nothing or oh, my God, this is the end of the world.

437
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:25,620
You want to be in between. And what we were the understanding is that the news cycle, the way it is, it's on those extremes.

438
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:30,330
Like either I don't want to hear about it or this is the worst thing that could be going on.

439
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:39,130
That's why it's on the news. So your job is to live within that gray area and talk to your leadership about that.

440
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:45,480
Talk to the docs about that. And we get questions all the time still.

441
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:49,770
I mean, we get questions if there is an outbreak of flu. I'll get questions from my colleagues.

442
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:54,480
I get questions from my colleagues. Emily, you do, too. Probably all the time about.

443
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,320
Can I go out to this restaurant, not wear my mask? That kind of question.

444
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,910
And you want to be you don't want to be cavalier in either direction.

445
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:13,320
So then what happens? Well, so this was starting to expand in in West Africa.

446
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:16,950
So there was cases in Guinea, in Sierra Leone and Liberia.

447
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:23,370
This was, I think, in August because I was up on Beaver Island far, far away.

448
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:33,120
And we got this message that there was a woman in Ypsilanti who had just returned from Sierra Leone two days prior with her family,

449
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:38,820
called the Pediatrics Clinic to say that her who 19 month old was sick with a fever and diarrhea.

450
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:47,010
So realize now that all those three countries Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea,

451
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:52,770
were all kind of on the list of countries who were asking about when patients would come in.

452
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:54,810
So this woman called in.

453
00:41:55,290 --> 00:42:03,420
There was a nurse who took the call and appropriately was concerned enough to say, wait a minute, don't just go to the hospital right now.

454
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,690
We were called Emily. You were part of this, too, I think, at the time.

455
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:15,340
I'm I we it was the question to us was where do we put this person?

456
00:42:15,350 --> 00:42:20,420
What do we do? So what's what are you what are you thinking about right now?

457
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:27,790
These are tense situations, right? You get a call. It's usually from somebody higher up who's saying, we got this problem.

458
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:31,720
What do we do? So what do you do here?

459
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:48,610
You make the call? Yeah. What is it? What do you do?

460
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:56,910
This kid's sick. So the kid needs to come to see somebody. You tell them just to make it into the clinic and the waiting room.

461
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:00,130
No. Yes or no? Yeah. So. Okay.

462
00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:03,580
Won't be an alternative to that. Yeah. I have to bring him to mind.

463
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:09,309
So you're going to have to figure out a place. Right. So you're starting to think about, okay, do we have a place?

464
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:16,240
And now we have this recue upstairs. But turns out when we're not using the recue, it's an actual normal hospital with kids there.

465
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:19,350
So it's not a unit right now that we can just put somebody in.

466
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:23,860
You have to empty that unit because it's being used. Where would you put where might you put?

467
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:30,190
So that part, this person. She?

468
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:37,579
Yes. Yeah. So you want to put it in? You want to put it in a probably a negative pressure room.

469
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:43,460
And it is both have those now. How much fanfare do you want on all this?

470
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:47,420
As little as possible, really. I mean, you you don't want to you don't want to.

471
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:50,720
Again, you're pulling the ripcord only when you have to.

472
00:43:51,530 --> 00:43:55,970
And so there were people there were a bunch of people involved on phone calls to try and figure this out.

473
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:06,390
What else do you want to do to wrap your head around the issue? The problem is we have a sick person from Sierra Leone,

474
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:17,580
a place where there's an Ebola outbreak going on who has a 19 month old, has fever and diarrhea.

475
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:25,230
How common is fever and diarrhea in Sierra Leone? Ferguson, 19 or just 19 months old.

476
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:28,420
Yeah, have. Right. I'm sorry. Yeah. In a 19 month old. Right.

477
00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:36,280
Extremely common. So in your mind, you have to think, what are the chances that this is Ebola?

478
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:42,000
What do you think she is like?

479
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:48,749
Is that woman saying, you know, the mother, the mother's not sick, just the kid?

480
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:55,500
Then that would kind of I don't know, because I saw it and I'm like, well, if it's involved, yeah.

481
00:44:55,550 --> 00:45:00,540
Seems less likely, right? Yeah. The whole family is the incubation period, right.

482
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:06,690
Two days, two days from returning. The answer is yes.

483
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:11,670
That that you can't you know, you didn't return two months ago. If that was two months ago, you would say, oh.

484
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:17,350
Incubation period. Time pass. Not a problem, but they just return.

485
00:45:17,370 --> 00:45:20,480
So, yes, it's within that time period. Yeah.

486
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:29,880
You want to see? Is anybody else sick? Turns out they're they're the son who was older, also had fevers and was feeling ill.

487
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:37,290
Not as sick, though, because she this woman was wondering she wanted to bring her baby in because the did the baby need fluids.

488
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:43,140
So it wasn't even necessarily that the mother was worried about Ebola.

489
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:46,590
She was more worried that the baby needed to be treated.

490
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:54,599
And so so you could see these these different she wants just to get in, get evaluated, get some fluids and take care of her baby.

491
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:57,540
And we're saying, oh, wait a minute, you're coming from Sierra Leone.

492
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:10,230
And put put the risk, put it into high, medium, low, very low risk that this is Ebola.

493
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:21,500
Chance, not risk chance. You load a load a very long until rule.

494
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:27,290
So what else do you want to know about what was going on in Sierra Leone at that time?

495
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:34,180
How many cases? Yeah, right. So. So let's look at.

496
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:39,500
So what do you tell her? How do you advise the hospital leadership? So this is what was going on at that time.

497
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:41,870
So if you look if you look here,

498
00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:51,650
what you can see is here's Sierra Leone and there are about how many cases does it say so maybe a hundred, maybe maybe more than a few.

499
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:56,120
A little bit more than 100 cases. You know, in these other countries.

500
00:46:56,120 --> 00:47:02,000
There were also cases in Guinea and Liberia, but 150 cases.

501
00:47:05,870 --> 00:47:09,830
How big is you got to do things like Google?

502
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:15,340
How big is Sierra Leone? That's the population of Sierra Leone.

503
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:19,470
6 million people.

504
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:34,170
So there's a hundred a little more than 100 people ill in a country of six, 6,318,000 where we're most of these cases mostly localized in the city.

505
00:47:35,490 --> 00:47:38,520
Now, it turns out that this family had been in the city.

506
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:48,580
So you you think about it, you have to think about things in those terms because then you can tell your leadership, listen, this is a low risk.

507
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:52,090
There aren't that many people sick with Ebola there.

508
00:47:52,090 --> 00:47:59,559
Note there. Remember, Ebola is Ebola does not get transmitted if you're if you're asymptomatic.

509
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:04,690
So you can very quickly ascertain the risks by asking the family a few questions.

510
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:10,110
What would you ask them? We are in contact with anybody set.

511
00:48:12,410 --> 00:48:17,490
Are you? Yes, the mother. Are you sick or what's her?

512
00:48:17,510 --> 00:48:21,680
What the. What job categories are you looking at? Are you a health care worker?

513
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:26,630
Are you a nurse? Have you taken care of sick people with fevers recently?

514
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:29,720
Answer to all those were No, she wasn't a health care worker.

515
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:34,720
They mostly been to on their own and with family. There were no sick contacts.

516
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:46,430
Right. So you use that to say, gosh, we need to be really careful because where are we more likely to make a mistake at this point?

517
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:51,290
How are we most likely to to air causing panic?

518
00:48:51,440 --> 00:49:04,290
Causing panic by far. The problem is, nobody nobody wants to be the hospital that missed Ebola and then somebody else in the hospital gets sick.

519
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:09,600
Did that happen? It did happen.

520
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:13,680
It did happen. And let's let's move forward on that. What time is it?

521
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:17,610
1115. And we go till noon. Okay.

522
00:49:18,090 --> 00:49:26,219
Oh, we'll be done before that. So at this point, when there were three countries that were involved in West Africa,

523
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:32,129
they were they the W.H.O. declared a public health emergency of international concern.

524
00:49:32,130 --> 00:49:35,300
Is that pandemic? No.

525
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:39,950
And thinking about Ebola.

526
00:49:39,950 --> 00:49:43,610
What's the chance of a pandemic with Ebola?

527
00:49:44,510 --> 00:49:47,600
Low, medium, high. Very low.

528
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:52,610
Very low. You have to know that right up front, it's not a respiratory disease.

529
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:58,010
People have to be pretty darn sick when before they're efficiently transmitting it to others.

530
00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:01,280
There's no such thing as a super spreader. I might have used that term earlier,

531
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:09,320
but there's really not a super spreader for Ebola unless a lot of people have contact with somebody who's very sick.

532
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:16,640
I mean, that did happen. Anybody know when that happened? It did happen with Ebola where about 20 people got it from one person.

533
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:25,980
That person was an imam in Mali and the imam died and he died of.

534
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:29,610
They didn't know it at the time that he had died of Ebola, but he died of Ebola.

535
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:35,460
And burial procedures are that they that you wash somebody.

536
00:50:36,210 --> 00:50:41,490
It's a religious procedure that they were trying to tamp down in those countries.

537
00:50:41,970 --> 00:50:45,960
Now, remember, your your your family member is going somewhere for eternity.

538
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:55,170
So how how important is it to make sure that they go through the all the procedures that allow that to happen efficiently and and the right way?

539
00:50:55,560 --> 00:51:02,100
Very important. So people were stealing their their dying family members out of the hospital to be able to do this,

540
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:06,419
because if they didn't, those people were taken and put into refrigeration units.

541
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:12,720
It wasn't happening for those people who had Ebola. So this imam was washed.

542
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:18,540
And because he's an imam, people drink the water from the.

543
00:51:19,290 --> 00:51:23,250
From when he got washed or they put it on themselves.

544
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:31,560
So of that of those people who were at his funeral or at that washing, 20 people were infected.

545
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:44,180
So. It can transmit at those levels when people are either dead because there are such high levels and when the person is the billions of particles,

546
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:54,070
when I when I see an HIV patient, if they have 100,000 copies per ml of a viral load that's extremely high.

547
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:58,940
And with Ebola, it's billions, billions copies per teaspoon of blood.

548
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:04,730
Yes. So how is Ebola like on surfaces and in water and so forth?

549
00:52:05,450 --> 00:52:09,320
Yeah, not because that's absolutely something you guys would want to check.

550
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:17,180
Not very stable. Not stable. Like some other infections like hepatitis that we know where HIV is.

551
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:22,970
Not very stable, you know? Yeah. And so so these it's not a stable virus, right?

552
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:25,790
So it's not going to stick around for a long time.

553
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:33,170
It's really about your contact with a sick person at the time when they're almost not able to move anymore.

554
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:38,810
I mean that. But yeah, I would just ask because you said copies are there at the.

555
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:39,850
Oh, that was a piece.

556
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:51,100
I mean that by PCR testing it's like a diagnostic test for Ebola there there we not there wasn't one I don't know that they had a PCR test right away.

557
00:52:51,110 --> 00:52:54,110
They did have one very quickly through this epidemic.

558
00:52:54,110 --> 00:52:58,130
So we were able to get that kind of data. Yeah.

559
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:01,970
And that's another great thing about preparedness.

560
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:09,230
We're able to develop these tests that are outstanding for almost any viral infection, bacterial infection.

561
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:16,910
Yeah. So they declared it's not a pandemic. It's very unlikely to become a pandemic.

562
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:20,610
And we need to let our leadership know that this is not flu.

563
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:24,420
This is not sorry. This was we hadn't had COVID yet, but this is not SA's one.

564
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:33,450
We're not worried about a pandemic. We're worried that we might have somebody come in that might put some people in our hospital at risk.

565
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:39,520
And I'm not saying that zero risk is is is tough.

566
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:43,120
And we'll talk a little bit about that toward the end here.

567
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:48,550
So let's look at this now. This was August of 2014.

568
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:56,720
Disney. Disney. Got to listen to music more.

569
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:01,510
A place to uncover secrets to live there. Explore the galaxy.

570
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:08,020
And finding life changing. Nature's glorious high does.

571
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:17,200
This world is full of surprises. And, you know, there's one place that always feels like home.

572
00:54:17,950 --> 00:54:24,040
Disney plus. There we go. News breaking overnight on the Ebola outbreak.

573
00:54:24,250 --> 00:54:28,630
The World Health Organization is now calling it an international health emergency.

574
00:54:28,930 --> 00:54:33,430
And this morning, the husband of Nancy Writebol is speaking out about her battle with the deadly virus.

575
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:37,890
ABC Studios, in fact me is tracking it all from Atlanta where she is being treated.

576
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:41,350
Steve, good morning. Good morning, Amy.

577
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:44,890
Her husband remains in Liberia where he continues their missionary work.

578
00:54:45,190 --> 00:54:50,890
He says that he and his wife are choosing to put themselves at great risk because of the incredible need.

579
00:54:52,570 --> 00:54:58,780
Overnight, the World Health Organization declaring the spread of Ebola in West Africa an international health emergency.

580
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:05,770
And this morning, the husband of one of the missionaries in isolation here at this Atlanta hospital is speaking out for the first time.

581
00:55:06,070 --> 00:55:09,790
Please, please tell us where we are.

582
00:55:10,510 --> 00:55:14,890
David Writebol calling home from the deadly Ebola hot zone in Liberia,

583
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:19,780
thanking God and the doctors for bringing his wife, Nancy, back from the brink of death.

584
00:55:20,170 --> 00:55:30,280
I'm very happy that she had a brief surgery here possible to come to her every opportunity to get better.

585
00:55:31,270 --> 00:55:37,150
There she is, helping disinfect doctors in the Ebola ward of her African missionary hospital before getting sick,

586
00:55:37,270 --> 00:55:40,600
meaning this emergency flight to Atlanta Tuesday for treatment.

587
00:55:40,830 --> 00:55:49,870
I really want to go in front of those people right now for their contribution.

588
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:51,129
In an exclusive interview,

589
00:55:51,130 --> 00:55:59,230
ABC News reached the six Tuskegee University students on a study abroad trip now stranded in Liberia after flights from the region were suspended,

590
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:07,000
freaking out. They're working with British Airways to fly home through Ghana before school starts August 20th.

591
00:56:07,150 --> 00:56:11,770
I personally would like everyone to know that we are safe.

592
00:56:12,310 --> 00:56:19,900
We are safe. We are happy. The only thing we're concerned about is keeping a soon as possible.

593
00:56:21,970 --> 00:56:29,500
Here in the US, the CDC telling Congress that they're sending more teams to Africa to stop the disease at its source.

594
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:34,320
It is breaking. Smart young woman letting her people know which comes out.

595
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:38,770
I'm okay. That's why we should watch that one for her.

596
00:56:39,070 --> 00:56:47,620
I wonder what happened to her. Yeah, right. So and and think about it from the husband's standpoint, what is the mortality rate of this disease?

597
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:50,650
Up to this point, 66. 60%.

598
00:56:51,070 --> 00:56:54,520
Right. 60%. That's pretty bad, right?

599
00:56:54,520 --> 00:57:02,440
For a disease you can't treat. Not as bad as rabies, which is 100%, but 60% is really, really concerning.

600
00:57:02,590 --> 00:57:08,410
What was it, by the way, if we look at what's the mortality rate of COVID 19,

601
00:57:09,610 --> 00:57:14,950
you know, at the worst, let's say at the worst, what is the mortality rate?

602
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:23,050
Right? It's not no. It's actually a lot lower than that is probably overall about 1%.

603
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:31,900
If you look at at the at the case fatality rate, if you look at the overall fatality rate, it's probably less than a half a percent.

604
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:37,690
The really low and look what we've done to to protect against that what was

605
00:57:37,930 --> 00:57:42,520
in there was a 1918 flu which killed a lot of people in the world probably.

606
00:57:43,090 --> 00:57:47,440
It could have been as many as 50 million back in 1918.

607
00:57:47,710 --> 00:57:52,150
What was the mortality rate at that time? That's what it was.

608
00:57:52,270 --> 00:57:56,380
It was 2 to 3%, maybe up to four.

609
00:57:56,860 --> 00:58:05,110
But you can see that anything I mean, when you're talking about 10%, SA's Corona one was ten, 10 to 11% mortality rate.

610
00:58:06,790 --> 00:58:11,020
Horrible. If you're if you're thinking about how do you manage something like this.

611
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:19,270
So you can see that that's another negative that's another reason why we are saying as we're managing this, gosh,

612
00:58:19,270 --> 00:58:26,450
we don't want to be the reason that one of our workers at the hospital, if we're if we're not watching this, could somebody get sick?

613
00:58:26,470 --> 00:58:27,670
Could somebody get this?

614
00:58:27,970 --> 00:58:36,370
And then their mortality rate turns out to be, you know, 60, 70% with Ebola before that, I mean, 60% was actually pretty good.

615
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:40,780
It used to be thought that it was 80 to 90% mortality rate.

616
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:51,310
So this is expanding and people are getting more nervous because what we used to see with Ebola outbreaks is it would go up,

617
00:58:51,910 --> 00:58:56,049
several hundred people would die and then it would start to decrease.

618
00:58:56,050 --> 00:58:59,950
And what's happening is we're now seeing it's keeps going up.

619
00:58:59,950 --> 00:59:07,000
It's going into other countries. There are people infected in all parts of the world at this point.

620
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:13,930
Let's see. So why the sudden interest?

621
00:59:14,950 --> 00:59:19,600
This is the biocontainment unit in Nebraska. I'll just. We don't have to go through this.

622
00:59:19,930 --> 00:59:24,819
Let me I guess we can take a quick peek at it. Have you guys seen a biocontainment?

623
00:59:24,820 --> 00:59:28,870
You. I'll. We'll just go through this quickly.

624
00:59:31,510 --> 00:59:32,650
It's not quick with ads.

625
00:59:33,730 --> 00:59:40,960
One day I'll figure out how to torrent these and just rip them out and put them on a slide set where I don't have to show ads.

626
00:59:41,350 --> 00:59:46,370
You guys probably know how to do that. Yeah.

627
00:59:51,930 --> 00:59:56,880
So this was one of the biocontainment units, Nebraska. The Atlanta one was the CDC?

628
00:59:58,850 --> 01:00:02,290
No, not yet. Not yet. That was a see feel that air near the air.

629
01:00:02,310 --> 01:00:10,920
So in a normal hospital isolation room, we might have 10 to 12 hurricanes for our area, twice that 20 or 25.

630
01:00:11,430 --> 01:00:12,780
And if you can take a piece of paper,

631
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:23,340
it'll stack against there that you can have a patient and you can start an I.V. or examine them by using these gloves that are completely sealed.

632
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,660
There was a place in there and there is no escape of air.

633
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:36,900
The air that the patient exhales goes through a high efficiency filter and well, so it's kind of like a mini version of the whole isolation area.

634
01:00:36,990 --> 01:00:40,740
And we have a lot of intensification and we have special equipment to see the mask.

635
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:43,830
It's got a fan blowing air into it.

636
01:00:44,490 --> 01:00:48,569
We've got two special suits. So you might think, well, what's all this?

637
01:00:48,570 --> 01:00:53,520
What could possibly go wrong? Well, you still dealing with a very dangerous disease and accidents happen.

638
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:58,020
Patients might unexpectedly bleed. That might be a break in technique.

639
01:00:58,260 --> 01:01:04,140
There might be something wrong with your equipment. So anybody that comes in here knows that they're taking a little bit of a risk,

640
01:01:04,710 --> 01:01:09,690
which I think is one reason why we're so proud of our staff and the fact that

641
01:01:09,690 --> 01:01:13,160
they have volunteered to work up in this environment in a regular situation.

642
01:01:13,650 --> 01:01:17,040
This is a basic uniform. We have an emergency situation.

643
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:22,920
We would be wearing three pairs of gloves and we would take we would take down there.

644
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:29,970
We would take around between the the uniform and the gloves just to form an extra barrier.

645
01:01:30,510 --> 01:01:36,159
And this would be tucked in underneath the yellow suit for that.

646
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:37,620
That's quite another effort for.

647
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:46,499
So you might imagine getting dressed like this with multiple layers of tape and duct tape on your feet under has taken a long time.

648
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:51,660
The pressure alarm here essentially to keep the door open for more than a minute.

649
01:01:52,860 --> 01:01:58,860
The sense is that there's a leak, a break in, the pressure roll and also marble to go from Earth.

650
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:06,630
A good movie feature that had the alarm go off. So these are the containment units.

651
01:02:07,980 --> 01:02:11,700
And I would ask again, always, why are we using this level of containment?

652
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:20,350
Because you guys probably think that you would be very careful.

653
01:02:20,350 --> 01:02:26,350
And if this is a disease that spread by contact with the patient, you say, I'll just I'll wear I'll wear,

654
01:02:26,350 --> 01:02:29,710
you know, I'll wear stuff to protect myself and then I'll wash my hands and I'll be fine.

655
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:40,910
Is that so? Why are we doing that? Because there's no treatment.

656
01:02:41,450 --> 01:02:46,760
There's no treatment. There's no vaccine. We're being extra careful.

657
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:51,430
But I would continue to ask myself that question all the time.

658
01:02:51,450 --> 01:02:56,729
Are we doing this because we did this at the University of Michigan?

659
01:02:56,730 --> 01:03:04,310
Eventually we set up a unit up on the 12th floor where we would be able to take an Ebola patient.

660
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:13,380
And we had we trained over 100 people to be able to suit up like that and take care of the patients.

661
01:03:14,370 --> 01:03:24,980
And you know what the cost of that was? Probably a million for, you know how many patients we know with Ebola?

662
01:03:26,180 --> 01:03:31,310
Zero. You know what capacity was one, maybe two.

663
01:03:32,390 --> 01:03:40,640
So you have to keep asking yourself this question as the infection control person and say and be the one who says, is this really what we want to do?

664
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:45,229
Unfortunately, when the steamship starts to roll forward, it's hard to stop it.

665
01:03:45,230 --> 01:03:48,440
And when the leadership puts their mind to it, saying, this is what we have to do.

666
01:03:49,190 --> 01:03:50,660
They that's what happened.

667
01:03:50,780 --> 01:03:57,230
Now, what happened later was that there were a few hospitals in Michigan which were identified as hospitals that would take Ebola patients.

668
01:03:58,010 --> 01:04:01,219
You then turned out not to be one of those hospitals which.

669
01:04:01,220 --> 01:04:04,970
Yeah, which we were we thought we should because we had the expertise.

670
01:04:05,780 --> 01:04:09,350
But other hospitals, St Johns said they would do it. So that's the plan now?

671
01:04:09,410 --> 01:04:16,000
Yeah, we had an Ebola patient. Yeah, they do have a unit there and we don't have ours anymore.

672
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:20,270
Right. We have the risk, you know, but we don't have the capability to do it.

673
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:27,080
Yeah, we don't keep people trained. They try to do that. They would have us come back and it's a nobody would do it after.

674
01:04:27,090 --> 01:04:28,770
It was just a leadership decision.

675
01:04:28,770 --> 01:04:37,489
And even when they were building the new inpatient tower, their decision was made not to include a biocontainment unit or anything like that.

676
01:04:37,490 --> 01:04:40,650
So if it changes. Yeah, yeah.

677
01:04:41,180 --> 01:04:47,480
You have to. You have to constantly train people. Yeah. Because you can't expect someone's going to remember how to do that.

678
01:04:47,570 --> 01:04:53,870
Absolutely. When they need it. So you have to just have retraining because they do quarterly or something.

679
01:04:54,260 --> 01:04:59,710
So it's really a huge, huge investment that there was federal funding to maintain some of these.

680
01:04:59,740 --> 01:05:02,990
Yeah, but a lot of hospitals were doing this at the time.

681
01:05:03,230 --> 01:05:09,320
This is what we have to do. This is they're seeing these videos and saying, well, we're not going to have this bed where you put your gloves in there,

682
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:12,260
but we are going to have a room that's negative pressure, even a floor,

683
01:05:12,750 --> 01:05:15,170
and we're going to have the capability and we're going to make sure there are people

684
01:05:15,170 --> 01:05:18,260
are trained because we want to protect them because if you don't protect them.

685
01:05:20,570 --> 01:05:24,290
Oh, so I went I was going through how new is Ebola? Well, it's not new at all.

686
01:05:24,290 --> 01:05:29,000
By the time this event occurred, there had been all these outbreaks starting in 1976.

687
01:05:29,420 --> 01:05:32,989
So we were very familiar with this disease in different forms.

688
01:05:32,990 --> 01:05:37,010
There's Marburg, there's different forms of Ebola. But it boils down to one thing.

689
01:05:37,010 --> 01:05:40,040
It's a hemorrhagic fever and the spread is all the same.

690
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:48,970
How big of a problem could this be? So this is the extent of the disease here.

691
01:05:48,980 --> 01:05:52,940
This is West Africa, the the Western most.

692
01:05:52,940 --> 01:05:59,690
And you can see Sierra Leone, Guinea, Liberia, here's Mali, had a few cases and then Nigeria had the 20 cases.

693
01:06:01,070 --> 01:06:04,730
But remember, this is where you this is where you focus your attention.

694
01:06:04,940 --> 01:06:15,000
You don't see all of Africa, a lot of places. We're saying if somebody comes in from Africa, anywhere, and then this was the finally in bat.

695
01:06:15,260 --> 01:06:19,880
By 2015, all countries became free of Ebola.

696
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:24,530
But that was a long course, a long time that that occurred.

697
01:06:24,530 --> 01:06:28,669
And here's the epidemic curve that occurred.

698
01:06:28,670 --> 01:06:34,540
And here is. Here's Monrovia.

699
01:06:34,990 --> 01:06:36,879
Capital of Liberia. This is the capital.

700
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:43,720
This stuff was happening because typically in west and when this would happen in Central Africa, in the Congo, it would be in the middle of nowhere.

701
01:06:43,930 --> 01:06:48,110
There would be a few hundred people would die and then they just wouldn't travel anywhere.

702
01:06:48,130 --> 01:06:51,400
This travel to the big cities. These are people who are.

703
01:06:51,970 --> 01:06:55,450
Yeah, they can't walk. They're sick. They're on the floor.

704
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:59,230
There's not enough bed space. It's really terrible.

705
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:04,270
And then this issue came up, and I'm going to ask you this question.

706
01:07:05,950 --> 01:07:09,850
The concern was that this would mutate. The viruses mutate.

707
01:07:10,970 --> 01:07:17,960
Yes, we know that coronavirus has mutated many times into forms that are more transmissible.

708
01:07:17,980 --> 01:07:22,750
And so we're seeing that. What about mutating?

709
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:31,280
Can head Ebola mutate into an aerosolized form? Maybe in a couple million years.

710
01:07:31,910 --> 01:07:35,090
There you go. So. So is that right?

711
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:42,710
You know, sharks are a problem in the water, but will they ever come out of the water and walk up to you on the beach and chop?

712
01:07:42,860 --> 01:07:46,130
No, it's never going to happen. It's a very similar situation.

713
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:52,670
They they don't change their spots. The viruses, they're they're a virus the way they are now.

714
01:07:52,670 --> 01:07:56,659
They can be manipulated. Right. This was part of bioterrorism.

715
01:07:56,660 --> 01:08:03,230
The Russians were doing this. They were trying to develop forms of Ebola that could be mixed with smallpox.

716
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:07,490
So you have an Ebola smallpox mix. What do you guys know about smallpox?

717
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:14,850
Highly transmissible, aerosolized when it's disseminated.

718
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:22,890
And so the idea was to get something that was hemorrhagic and then could be transmitted through respiratory secretions.

719
01:08:22,890 --> 01:08:28,650
I mean, it's horrible. Why would anybody do that? But that's so that's the level at which things can change.

720
01:08:30,060 --> 01:08:33,180
Nature will not do this quickly.

721
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:42,120
But let me I want you guys to see. So the inability to contain Ebola sparks fear of virus going airborne.

722
01:08:42,540 --> 01:08:47,730
Let me show you this clip here. And I want you to pick out all the inconsistencies here.

723
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:52,110
I don't know why I pick Fox News, really.

724
01:08:58,050 --> 01:09:03,790
So. Let's turn this up. All right.

725
01:09:03,790 --> 01:09:07,480
It's good to get out of here on the Ebola virus. I do want to remind about that.

726
01:09:07,550 --> 01:09:13,120
Still an issue as rapidly as you can, because it's spread throughout West Africa and it's not airborne.

727
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:20,380
Yeah. But having said in time, what's going on with this?

728
01:09:22,180 --> 01:09:29,049
It is mutating. What does that mean? Well, the virus is following the normal pattern and progression that most viruses do.

729
01:09:29,050 --> 01:09:31,600
Viruses are designed by nature to mutate.

730
01:09:32,320 --> 01:09:41,200
The important thing is that the researchers and the folks that are following this can stay on top of the mutations and stay one step ahead,

731
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:48,640
or at least on par with the virus. Well, you need to be able to figure out which types of vaccines and what medications they can develop.

732
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:52,820
But those vaccines lose their well being.

733
01:09:52,930 --> 01:09:58,210
So they do. But sometimes they can alter the vaccine and or the way it attacks the virus.

734
01:09:58,510 --> 01:10:01,989
Based on the way this mutates. So it's exciting science.

735
01:10:01,990 --> 01:10:05,200
And the good thing is in today's world, this is happening in real time.

736
01:10:05,470 --> 01:10:10,900
Whereas even a few years ago, this could take a year or two years to figure out the chance of doing it much quicker today.

737
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:13,860
Well, we already know that the vaccine is in full force.

738
01:10:13,890 --> 01:10:22,060
In other words, a couple of people have done that, taking it for the reasons and not only for that, but it does give you pause.

739
01:10:22,390 --> 01:10:29,830
And of course, it gives us pause. I mean, when we look at regular viruses that we deal with, such as the common cold or even influenza,

740
01:10:29,830 --> 01:10:34,150
when the epidemic occurs every year you look at those things and they mutate as well.

741
01:10:34,780 --> 01:10:40,600
And they're a great cause for concern. Something like this, which is much more virulent or more deadly, if you must.

742
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:48,530
We need to really keep an eye on it and say, okay, right now you're limited.

743
01:10:51,420 --> 01:11:00,210
Nothing could change. It's the way that the virus spreads, maybe as it develops an airborne transmission type of spread and it gets.

744
01:11:00,350 --> 01:11:05,450
What would make you do that? The way it mutates, you know. Right.

745
01:11:06,650 --> 01:11:15,080
Yes. Yes. The like. But it's the virus which you can become easier to transmit airborne.

746
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:19,330
Then that might allow it to spread. That's much more rapidly, more dangerous.

747
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:28,290
And possibly we're not taking, you know, but more than once in the Western world as a sort of a common reaction is it's a mess.

748
01:11:30,110 --> 01:11:36,990
It's not a mess here. What do you tell people with this sort say, no, no, no.

749
01:11:37,010 --> 01:11:41,060
I'll tell them that what I tell them is common sense as the rain, as always.

750
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:45,769
We need to stay on top of this because any type of outbreak or epidemic like this that you

751
01:11:45,770 --> 01:11:51,020
just turn your back on for even a few moments can then multiply it spread even faster.

752
01:11:51,110 --> 01:11:54,470
But in other words, it's considered a sort of letting down their guard.

753
01:11:54,980 --> 01:11:59,900
They're reopening things open that they've gone from being totally shut down,

754
01:12:00,410 --> 01:12:05,299
opening more ports and buy more routes, because that's always a possibility.

755
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:12,050
But we can't we can't stop culture from traveling, you know, going to visit and carrying on their daily business,

756
01:12:12,050 --> 01:12:15,170
or at least, you know, in a civilized world, we can't do that.

757
01:12:15,710 --> 01:12:19,310
Vigilance is important for folks who are looking.

758
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:25,370
I'll stop there. Let's just so this is what you have to contend with as a public health person.

759
01:12:25,380 --> 01:12:29,210
What were the inconsistencies? He's a doc. What kind of doc is he? Anybody pick that up?

760
01:12:31,790 --> 01:12:36,710
It was on the ticker. They didn't introduce him that way. He's an emergency medicine doctor.

761
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:41,330
And they told you he's not what? He's not a microbiologist yet.

762
01:12:41,330 --> 01:12:45,050
He's making claims. And I think he's trying to be reasonable here.

763
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:54,740
But being but saying things. A doctor saying this could change into an aerosolized form or actually or being led to

764
01:12:54,740 --> 01:13:01,160
say that is dangerous and you have so you have to walk this back in your space and say,

765
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:08,120
that's not true. This isn't changing. It's not aerosolized. You get very high levels when you're sick and we have to protect against that.

766
01:13:08,420 --> 01:13:13,700
But it's not going to change in that way. They're talking what else was inconsistent here?

767
01:13:17,370 --> 01:13:19,260
What the heck is the treatment they were talking about?

768
01:13:20,220 --> 01:13:24,210
Actually, they were talking about the vaccine as a treatment and they were talking about vaccine.

769
01:13:24,420 --> 01:13:28,980
I don't know if they didn't mention Ivermectin, but I was waiting for that for treatment.

770
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:35,250
So there's things here that just don't make any sense and they have to be careful.

771
01:13:35,250 --> 01:13:38,070
And that's the problem with this cycle, the news cycle.

772
01:13:38,670 --> 01:13:44,820
You guys in public health are going to be asked these questions with people who are certain that that's the case.

773
01:13:45,150 --> 01:13:48,720
And then you have to tell them, well, where did you read that? Where did you see it?

774
01:13:49,020 --> 01:13:52,080
They might not remember. I saw it on the news. I read it in the paper.

775
01:13:53,610 --> 01:14:01,259
But the virus doesn't change. Very important to distinguish because we have all these outbreaks going on right now.

776
01:14:01,260 --> 01:14:09,750
We have where there's Ebola and there have been a few other Ebola outbreaks in Africa that haven't gotten to this level.

777
01:14:10,050 --> 01:14:16,080
There's flu out there. There's adenovirus out there. There's coronavirus still out there.

778
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:20,850
And which ones are the ones? They're all a little bit different.

779
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:27,000
Which ones are the ones that are most concerning? Are we going to have a pandemic with adeno virus?

780
01:14:28,140 --> 01:14:31,290
Probably not. Probably not.

781
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:34,350
But Emily, you want to tell me about the cases that came in?

782
01:14:34,380 --> 01:14:37,870
Is they I think they've been reported already. So we can tell people.

783
01:14:37,890 --> 01:14:47,280
Yeah. I mean, I think it's sort of public knowledge you but I'm sure most of you are aware and if you read your email there's or the Michigan

784
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:58,880
Daily that there has been an adeno virus outbreak on the campus over the last few weeks and there are 60 some confirmed cases,

785
01:14:58,890 --> 01:15:02,880
but probably that's the very tip of the iceberg of thousands of cases.

786
01:15:03,630 --> 01:15:09,950
But what kind of illness is adenovirus caused? Doesn't even know who it causes the common cold.

787
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:16,740
Right. And so the vast majority of people who actually may have and no virus right now that I got from one of my children,

788
01:15:18,060 --> 01:15:24,030
but the vast majority of people who get infected just having a mild cold and never go see their doctor and get tested.

789
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:30,240
But there have been a few people who've been sick or there have been a lot of students going to us who got tested.

790
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:35,819
And then just over the past few days, there have actually been a couple students who were hospitalized.

791
01:15:35,820 --> 01:15:45,750
And there was one of the cases was reported in Michigan daily because the the student's mom had posted on Facebook.

792
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:53,100
So it kind of became public knowledge at that point. Fortunately, both of those students are improving, doing better now.

793
01:15:54,330 --> 01:16:01,350
But that sort of raised the alarm bells that like, hey, what if what if this particular strain of adeno virus,

794
01:16:02,730 --> 01:16:06,900
you know, is capable of causing more severe disease to make you be worried about this.

795
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:09,960
So in adults. In immuno competent adults.

796
01:16:09,990 --> 01:16:15,570
Yeah. Yeah. These were like, you know, these were healthy college students who wound up in the hospital.

797
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:25,530
So there's been a lot of discussion. We've been meeting for both a group of us from the health system and campus have

798
01:16:25,530 --> 01:16:31,319
been meeting with the CDC actually on regular basis to talk about the outbreak.

799
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:39,000
They have identified as a Type four virus, which was one of the more common causes of this type of outbreak.

800
01:16:40,650 --> 01:16:46,020
And there's no vaccine. Well, there is a vaccine, but it's only available on the military.

801
01:16:46,020 --> 01:16:51,450
Right. There's really no treatment except for an antiviral that we use only in the hospital for critically ill.

802
01:16:51,750 --> 01:17:01,229
And it's in the stockpile, too. There's a yeah, it's so so in any case, in the conclusion really is that, you know,

803
01:17:01,230 --> 01:17:07,379
if you have thousands of cases in a community, you're probably going to see one or two that are more severe.

804
01:17:07,380 --> 01:17:14,120
Right. Just kind of statistically speaking. So we don't really think that this is like a more severe strain of adenoviruses.

805
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:17,999
It's just more that if you see a lot of cases, you know, there are going to be one or two.

806
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:23,540
They get really sick. And this is and that's a very important point because the news is getting to none of that.

807
01:17:23,550 --> 01:17:31,080
Right. All you're going to see on the news is there are two people with nerve with neurologic disease, with adeno virus.

808
01:17:31,350 --> 01:17:35,220
And people may have heard of adenovirus. You may have heard about it, but never heard.

809
01:17:35,550 --> 01:17:38,580
It goes to the CNS. My goodness, I never heard about that.

810
01:17:38,850 --> 01:17:40,980
And is this going to happen? Is this a new strain?

811
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:47,160
And exactly what Dr. Stillman is saying here is, is it probably just the level of infection out there?

812
01:17:47,370 --> 01:17:54,030
Same with COVID. We're seeing weird things with COVID. Now, is that because COVID as a virus causes weird things?

813
01:17:54,270 --> 01:18:00,900
Probably not. Especially because we have so many cases of COVID that we're seeing strange outcomes in some of those cases.

814
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:09,180
Very important points. I think that that and you have to be the voice of reason because how contagious is Ebola?

815
01:18:09,390 --> 01:18:13,920
We had to keep saying it spreads a certain way. We know this now.

816
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:17,770
You do have to be careful when you're taking care of patients if you have a sick patient. The ICU.

817
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:21,340
Well, and let's look at this.

818
01:18:21,550 --> 01:18:31,629
There was a case in I didn't bring this up, but there was a case in Texas of Ebola when during this outbreak where this gentleman came from,

819
01:18:31,630 --> 01:18:44,170
Liberia, Mr. Duncan here, he before he came here, he had helped somebody who was in a taxi in in Liberia, had helped her.

820
01:18:44,180 --> 01:18:47,620
She was had COVID. He helped bring her into the hospital.

821
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:55,610
The Good Samaritan, he helped carry her. And she was sick, put her in the hospital before he went.

822
01:18:55,630 --> 01:18:59,440
He came to the U.S. He got sick when he got here.

823
01:19:01,430 --> 01:19:04,920
Went. And these are the important points.

824
01:19:04,940 --> 01:19:14,270
This is the stuff that for me was the most compelling, came to the United States, stayed with his girlfriend in the same room, in the same bed.

825
01:19:15,230 --> 01:19:20,600
Very close contact. While he was sick. She didn't get sick.

826
01:19:21,260 --> 01:19:22,850
Went to the E.R. the first time.

827
01:19:24,380 --> 01:19:31,550
Was seen in the E.R. doing the nobody got the history of the Liberia of a him being in Liberia and him taking care of it.

828
01:19:31,550 --> 01:19:35,120
They have just asked, did you have were you around anybody sick?

829
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:41,480
He probably would have remembered. Nobody asked him that question. He was treated in the E.R. as a viral illness.

830
01:19:42,350 --> 01:19:50,510
Let go in. The are not in isolation, not in a negative pressure room by seen by many people waiting in the waiting room.

831
01:19:50,750 --> 01:19:58,940
Nobody got sick. Finally he gets really sick, comes back in the hospital, ends up in the ICU.

832
01:20:00,810 --> 01:20:03,930
Two nurses get it from him in the ICU.

833
01:20:04,830 --> 01:20:09,670
So the only thing that comes out in the news is that this guy from Liberia comes into the hospital.

834
01:20:09,690 --> 01:20:16,270
They didn't adequately vet him. Two nurses got sick because infection control practices weren't well taken care of.

835
01:20:16,860 --> 01:20:21,509
Scare everybody. And in fact, it is scary that tunas got sick.

836
01:20:21,510 --> 01:20:29,240
And why did that happen? Well, we know now is that if you don't do the things perfectly, we we would have when we were donning and doffing.

837
01:20:29,250 --> 01:20:34,160
Let me show you just the last picture here. There.

838
01:20:34,590 --> 01:20:37,260
This is. This is what we had to do. We had to put these on.

839
01:20:37,470 --> 01:20:42,360
And not only did I have to put that, I had to have somebody watch me put it on and watch me take it off.

840
01:20:43,590 --> 01:20:49,800
Because one drop of blood. If you have a billion particles in a teaspoon of blood, a drop of blood is enough.

841
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:54,570
And we touch our face hundreds of times a day to cause infection.

842
01:20:54,810 --> 01:21:00,720
Right. So, yes, you have to be careful.

843
01:21:00,730 --> 01:21:03,810
But yet but all those other times, nobody got sick from this guy.

844
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:09,810
So it's not as if it was spreading like wildfire. And this guy did not leave a trail of destruction behind him when he got sick.

845
01:21:10,020 --> 01:21:13,919
It was in his last point of the disease where he was most sick.

846
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:20,249
So you really have to watch these patients in the hospital just to show you, you know, what are the risk?

847
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:23,729
What is the risk, your risk of getting Ebola. So this came out.

848
01:21:23,730 --> 01:21:30,000
Right. So people were very scared for very for not very good reasons at that point.

849
01:21:30,270 --> 01:21:37,020
You know, what's your risk here? I talked about shark attacks getting Ebola, contracting Ebola in America, one in 13 million.

850
01:21:37,020 --> 01:21:40,090
I mean, that's a that's those are the odds of the lottery here. Right.

851
01:21:41,450 --> 01:21:44,970
And, you know, I don't buy lottery tickets. I know you guys might.

852
01:21:46,740 --> 01:21:53,190
Yeah. And so the we were talking about shutting borders and we don't have to go through all that because those discussions have occurred again.

853
01:21:54,450 --> 01:22:02,010
Let me see if there's anything else here. Yeah, I think I think one thing to say is the reason why I asked you about the contamination products,

854
01:22:02,430 --> 01:22:06,780
because I know in Texas they didn't want them to dump anything into the sewers.

855
01:22:07,050 --> 01:22:15,600
Yes. And then they and then anything that touched the patients they had, they didn't even want to process it in their own facility.

856
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:20,550
They threw it away or they. Yeah. They had some sort of like no one wanted to touch it.

857
01:22:20,850 --> 01:22:28,739
And I showed photographs and they had a whole the amount of waste you can imagine from a patient who's bleeding and all that.

858
01:22:28,740 --> 01:22:35,970
And even it was just like they had a whole hallway filled with double bag things that no one would take care of.

859
01:22:36,180 --> 01:22:39,239
They didn't want incinerated. They didn't want to do anything about it.

860
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:45,590
They just left it there. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I imagine that it was just not understanding the transmissibility.

861
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:53,999
So the thing about like how stable of viruses on a material and can you really get sick and this is, you know, even like smallpox,

862
01:22:54,000 --> 01:23:00,719
you probably heard that there were about four events in the US where they would, you know,

863
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:10,410
become colonial times and after where people had smallpox with some clothes and even that was really very low.

864
01:23:10,980 --> 01:23:15,299
You know, so putting these all into context, I mean,

865
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:21,360
that's going to be your job as public health people putting this stuff into context among all the other things you're going to be doing.

866
01:23:21,660 --> 01:23:25,260
This stuff is going to happen when you're already very busy.

867
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:28,499
And I think the other thing to think about is, remember,

868
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:35,130
that was an emergency day and they had a lot more gravitas, you know, hospital than someone living in here.

869
01:23:35,820 --> 01:23:43,229
Yeah. Yeah. So even though, you know, the literature you had treating the most of you in the molecular biology and microbiology,

870
01:23:43,230 --> 01:23:46,620
so you actually know this stuff, it it doesn't have to be out, right?

871
01:23:47,130 --> 01:23:50,430
You have to figure out how to build trust in your communication.

872
01:23:50,430 --> 01:23:53,520
So they say, okay, they actually have some sense.

873
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:57,420
Yeah, right. Very important point. You're that's the person they go to.

874
01:23:57,420 --> 01:24:07,350
And, you know, I kudos to Emily and Lorraine Washer and a bunch of people in our in our infection control folks are very

875
01:24:07,350 --> 01:24:12,479
trusted within the hospital and the leadership goes right to that group with any of those questions.

876
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:14,190
They don't that, you know, an ID,

877
01:24:15,090 --> 01:24:23,640
an emergency medicine doctor speaking up like that would would not get the credibility if somebody in within our within our infection control said,

878
01:24:23,940 --> 01:24:28,530
well, that's not really the way it happens. They'd be listened to.

879
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:32,190
And so you want to be in that position? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

880
01:24:33,060 --> 01:24:36,600
I was just having. Why wouldn't you want to incinerate the waste?

881
01:24:36,930 --> 01:24:40,320
You could. Yeah, you could was fear. It was total fear.

882
01:24:40,350 --> 01:24:48,290
Oh they were. Yeah it was no charge, you know, just misunderstanding about how transmissible or how stable the virus.

883
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:52,379
Oh, yeah. Because we actually when we set up our Ebola unit,

884
01:24:52,380 --> 01:24:59,640
we had people from the CDC come and look at how we dispose of our waste and we beat everything that's incinerated for the most part.

885
01:24:59,640 --> 01:25:00,750
And they were like, Oh, yeah, that's fine.

886
01:25:01,140 --> 01:25:11,030
So are there any cases like not just like including Ebola where you wouldn't want to incinerate something and it was is pretty good at killing.

887
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:17,550
Yeah. Yeah. But I would imagine I was like, why? Why would in the hospital even even prion disease.

888
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:24,630
Well, not the incinerators, probably. There are certain ways. Yeah, the autoclave thing doesn't even work with, so that's tricky.

889
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:32,670
But all right, so this I just wanted to show this last picture, which is what they the the medicines are from.

890
01:25:32,770 --> 01:25:38,760
Here are the Doctors Without Borders. This is the this is the setup they had and they had been taking care.

891
01:25:38,860 --> 01:25:45,099
So they did have a few infections, which was concerning because they had taken care of Ebola cases for many,

892
01:25:45,100 --> 01:25:50,290
many decades without one case of Ebola occurring among their health care workers.

893
01:25:50,500 --> 01:25:54,250
And they did have a few cases which raised consternation around the world.

894
01:25:54,250 --> 01:26:02,889
They say, oh, we we got something new. And it wasn't it was just the sheer amount of people that they were seeing was the reason that this happened,

895
01:26:02,890 --> 01:26:07,930
because typically they were well contained in areas where they used to they used to do their work.

896
01:26:07,930 --> 01:26:11,110
But here it was three different countries. They were pretty thin.

897
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:15,280
So I think that was the reason that those happened. And they weren't very many infections either.

898
01:26:16,570 --> 01:26:22,930
Yeah, one of my medical school when I went to med school with Ian Crosier actually was working.

899
01:26:23,110 --> 01:26:26,200
Oh, and he got Ebola really.

900
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:30,159
And he came he actually came to Ivy Week one year and talked about his experience

901
01:26:30,160 --> 01:26:35,080
because he was in the Emory Biocontainment unit and he was really sick,

902
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:38,139
like on the brink of death. And he recovered.

903
01:26:38,140 --> 01:26:44,290
And then it came back. And as I said, yes, the virus persists in certain it can, you know,

904
01:26:44,770 --> 01:26:50,530
all of a sudden you woke up one day and one of his eyes like changed to a different color and they found Ebola in his eye.

905
01:26:50,530 --> 01:26:56,830
And so it's there were definitely cases in healthcare workers and now he has superpowers.

906
01:26:57,010 --> 01:27:00,690
Yeah that was that was a differently so that's that's good.

907
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:11,290
Wow yeah that is and yeah those are those are really tough cases when when that happens to a doc.

908
01:27:11,530 --> 01:27:15,410
But it doesn't mean that there's anything different about the way that the virus is.

909
01:27:16,300 --> 01:27:19,030
Well, I will stop there. I really appreciate your time.

910
01:27:19,030 --> 01:27:24,520
If you have let's if you have guys who have questions or comments, please put those forward now.

911
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:28,080
So let's go.

912
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:36,290
Any questions or. All right.

913
01:27:36,830 --> 01:27:44,540
Well, good luck to you guys. Yes. And have a wonderful Thanksgiving holiday if you're going to do your thing.

914
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:51,109
Sure. I know that this is going to be hard.

915
01:27:51,110 --> 01:27:55,130
This is going to be during a similar kind of outbreak exercise.

916
01:27:55,180 --> 01:27:58,590
It's probably not great, but I will be at the top your skill level.

917
01:27:58,710 --> 01:28:05,080
I hear references to that and then I will be the final person here for my people.

918
01:28:05,540 --> 01:28:11,780
Yeah, right. I feel like all the world is very much like Thailand.
