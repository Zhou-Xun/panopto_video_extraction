1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:11,270
]Good afternoon, everyone.

2
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:17,150
Just think this is the last time you'll have to wear a mask well, one more time to wear a mask in this classroom.

3
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:24,260
So yeah, we have a mixed amount of material today.

4
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:30,650
I had I added the material for MRSA because I wanted to go through that and then I'm going to add some more to the end of that.

5
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:36,290
So what's on the end you don't necessarily won't necessarily be graded on,

6
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:40,070
However, I wanted you to have that information.

7
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:50,120
OK, so let's talk about active surveillance for MRSA, and I have your tests here for a handout at the end of the class also.

8
00:00:50,120 --> 00:01:02,260
So. OK, so first of all, when we talk about matters and we have to talk about drug resistance.

9
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:29,550
Yes. Yeah. Fearful that it will turn on.

10
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:35,510
Sorry about that. Thanks for telling me.

11
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:43,610
OK, so talking about MRSA, obviously methicillin resistant staph aureus.

12
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:51,980
We have to talk about the evolution of drug resistance and so staph aureus.

13
00:01:51,980 --> 00:02:03,660
In the 1950s was susceptible to penicillin. Then it acquired some genes and became penicillin resistant.

14
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:12,090
Still, we called it staph aureus because it was just penicillin resistant, not methicillin or Oxes Caelynn.

15
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:16,650
But then in the 1970s, there was another quick little change.

16
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:24,240
Methicillin started being used widely and of course, it acquired the genes for methicillin resistance.

17
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:30,810
And now we have not so resistant staph aureus or MRSA, and it is very, very common.

18
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:39,570
And for all of you who are going into hospital with your infection prevention, you will hear about MRSA probably every day.

19
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:43,620
It is very important that it spreads like wildfire. OK.

20
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:49,320
Then in the 1990s, along came very close.

21
00:02:49,320 --> 00:03:00,270
And you can guess what happened. It became resistant and picked up gene for vancomycin resistant resistance from enterococci.

22
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:09,590
Now, who can tell me which Enterococcus is more resistant? Fichier Murphy us?

23
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:13,750
I'll give you a hint, as it is, Bishop is more resistant, however,

24
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:25,500
it picked up the gene for vancomycin resistance from three kilos, which we were all shocked by, but that's what got it.

25
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:30,630
And then in 1997, we found vancomycin resistant staph aureus,

26
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:38,940
I published the first paper on that just had to say that the most resistant and it was here in Michigan.

27
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:47,130
And then along came vancomycin resistant, not intermediate but resistant staph aureus.

28
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:50,770
And that first case was here in Michigan also.

29
00:03:50,770 --> 00:04:02,280
So here in the state of Michigan, we have had quite a history of increasing resistance to Staphylococcus aureus.

30
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,120
So I tried to find a newer try to this, I couldn't come up with one at the last minute,

31
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:19,320
but just shows you how methicillin or accessible resistant staph aureus has increased among patients in the ICUs.

32
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:28,500
So how bad is the problem? How bad is the problem of Mercer methicillin resistant staph worse?

33
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:38,340
Every year annually, the United States averages about 200 93000 hospitalizations for staph aureus infections,

34
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:43,680
and that comprises about eight tenths of one percent of all hospital discharges.

35
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:55,260
Merson is involved in 60 percent. Are these staff worries episodes, and that's over 100 hundred and almost 120000 annual hospitalizations,

36
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:59,280
with MRSA greater than thirty thousand in some studies,

37
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,650
greater than 30000 of the patients have sepsis greater than twenty six thousand have pneumonia due

38
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:11,910
to MRSA and then greater than sixty three thousand have other sites of infection due to MRSA.

39
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:22,860
The death rate due to MRSA is over two and a half times greater than that of infections with methicillin susceptible staph aureus.

40
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:36,860
So once again, versus a hot topic in hospital epidemiology. And if you look at the cost of health care acquired infections, the cost of mercy,

41
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:48,650
health care and health care fight infection with MRSA is almost three times the size of that for a health care acquired infection without first.

42
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:57,260
So we don't generally see the spread of MRSA, commonly in communities and patients who are not hospitalized.

43
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:03,950
However, if they're all playing on the same team or something like that, there is spread in that way.

44
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:13,760
And so all of this has been there over 55 studies now on MRSA, as reported in the AP Guidelines for MRSA Prevention,

45
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:18,830
which APIC associate practitioners of infection control, which you all probably know.

46
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:24,050
So what's the hidden threat here? We don't know when people are colonized with mercy.

47
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:28,610
If they're not sick, we don't know. If I looked around this room, I'm maybe half the people had.

48
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:38,910
We can isolate Mirza from your noses. Maybe reservoirs are generally skin in their eyes, so it spreads from a colonized patient.

49
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:44,010
To another generally via health care workers hands.

50
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:52,830
And this was one of the first reasons why hand-washing became so incredibly important in the last 20 years or so,

51
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:56,010
maybe 30 years or so, and it goes unnoticed.

52
00:06:56,010 --> 00:07:06,010
It spreads easily until it gets into a site in the patient, and the patient has other issues going on and starts causing an infection.

53
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:12,460
So we see this mountain here and the colonizer asymptomatic patients are the major proponents part of it,

54
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:21,240
but the part of the Green Line or those who have the worst problem with mercy, they have the clinical infections.

55
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:31,950
So what are the risk factors for colonization and infection, increased age, which I don't like to admit, but increased age, previous colonization?

56
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:39,480
Because if you've previously been colonized, there's no way to ensure that you still don't have a small colony of staph aureus in your body.

57
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:43,530
But it's not causing you any problems. Prolonged hospitalization, of course.

58
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:48,690
More chances to encounter staph aureus. Recent antimicrobial therapy.

59
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:55,680
Because what's happening with that and I probably the therapy, it's not working out not only the pathogen, but the normal flora.

60
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:03,240
So something like staph aureus, which could be very resistant, is allowed to grow uninterrupted by any other bacteria.

61
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,650
So severe underlying disease. Previous admission to a nursing home.

62
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:14,550
Open wounds, yes. Transfer from another ward or another hospital.

63
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:22,230
Certainly hospitalization within the past six months. Probably patient. Probably acquired most likely acquired staph aureus at that time.

64
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:34,110
I.V. drug use is a huge, huge cause of colonization and infection with with MRSA burning unit patients.

65
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:42,600
Your skin has been traumatized, even though the health care providers are trying to be as careful as possible.

66
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:48,900
But that patient with traumatized skin damaged skin, it can get colonized very, very easily,

67
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:54,270
then going on pressure of ulcers, any invasive device, you know, it's all roadway into the body.

68
00:08:54,270 --> 00:09:01,740
Transplant patients and dialysis patients. Next slide.

69
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:13,020
So what's the epidemiology of colonization? There was a survey done in 2001 2002 of non institutionalized individuals.

70
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:21,150
Thirty one point six percent of them were colonized with staph aureus, and finally, less than one percent were colonized with MRSA.

71
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:25,620
Now you say, that's not very big, that less than one percent.

72
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:29,460
But yes, it is. Once they get into that situation where they're being given, giving other,

73
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:38,860
being given other antibiotics or their immune system is becoming compromised. So who's more likely to acquire staph aureus?

74
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:49,720
Actually, people less than 65 years of age, yeah, we think of it in the elderly, but people less than 65 men, people with less education.

75
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:54,400
People with asthma who has lower risks for.

76
00:09:54,400 --> 00:10:02,680
Persons of the black race or a Mexican birth. Maybe because they are colonized with a preventive stay.

77
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:09,580
And who knows what that reason is. Who's out to have more nursing colonization?

78
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:14,830
People greater than 65 years of age, which unfortunately includes me, women,

79
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:22,930
diabetics and those in long term care facilities and nurses a huge problem in long term care facilities.

80
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:25,630
And interestingly, Hispanics have.

81
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:37,590
In a paper published in the Annals of Internal Medicine several years ago, Hispanics have less risk of acquiring MRSA than the white persons.

82
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:47,880
Next slide. So there was a study by Davis and colleagues who studied the impact of asymptomatic nasal colonization

83
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:54,810
on MRSA infection and how frequently when people who are colonized develop MRSA infection.

84
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:57,660
They had seven hundred and fifty eight patients in the study.

85
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:05,820
They had nearest cultures done on admission when transferred to another unit in the hospital weekly or on discharge.

86
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:10,620
So there were multiple nasal swabs collected from each patient.

87
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:14,280
But these three point four percent had MRSA upon admission.

88
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:23,160
19 percent of them developed infection, three percent acquired MRSA after admission and twenty five percent developed infection.

89
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:30,600
So you can see that it's not when it's not been a long standing member of the microbial flora of a patient.

90
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:37,170
It can cause more problems, potentially. Twenty one percent had a susceptible staph aureus,

91
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:44,730
1.5 percent develop infection and seventy five point four percent of the people had no colonization but a small percentage.

92
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:55,720
Two percent of the people developed infection in the hospital. So what about mortality rates?

93
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:02,620
There was a study done in 9th through 1982 through to the year 2000, so a 20 year study,

94
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:07,210
they looked at that analysis on those studies published during that 20 year timeframe.

95
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:10,810
There were two hundred and twenty one articles reviewed.

96
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:17,200
Data from thirty one of those articles met the inclusion in the study that included three thousand nine hundred sixty three

97
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:27,460
patients results significant increase in mortality associated with MRSA bacteremia versus MSSA or susceptible staph aureus.

98
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:32,680
There was an increase in mortality remained even after adjusting for confounding variables.

99
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:41,170
What the patients might also have had going on and this was a paper published by Sara Cosgrove.

100
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:48,850
So what's the impact of Mercer besides greatly increased hospitalization costs, prolonged hospitalization stays,

101
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:57,970
prolonged ICU stays and longer antibiotics necessary associated with those length of stays great much greater costs.

102
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:06,790
Also, the excess attributable cost was just twenty seven thousand eighty three dollars from Mercer bacteremia,

103
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:11,680
versus slightly about nine thousand six hundred for Messa bacteremia.

104
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,860
So that difference is due to the antimicrobial resistance.

105
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:21,100
Another author showed a one point nine increase in hospital charges among patients with Mercer surgical infections.

106
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:27,340
As you can imagine, a person who has surgery then develops a mercy. Infection is going to require a lot more care.

107
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:38,140
And all of this leads to higher rates of vancomycin usage selecting for vancomycin resistant pathogens.

108
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:42,490
So here we have some common things I've talked about in the first few minutes of class.

109
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:45,250
The rate of MRSA is increasing.

110
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:54,790
MRSA infections are significant because higher mortality, longer hospitalizations and increased costs and colonization.

111
00:13:54,790 --> 00:14:05,480
And of course, that increases the risk for infection. OK, so who should be monitored?

112
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:13,790
So on the upper left hand side, we see high risk patients in the ICU, surgical units, burn unit, nick you and so on.

113
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:15,110
That's the highest risk.

114
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:26,000
The next highest risk is, as you can see, is not in the center circle is the one out patients who have frequent hospital visits, such as for dialysis,

115
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:33,680
if they're getting therapy or they're infected with HIV and they are in the hospital multiple times or patients in long term care.

116
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:42,440
The next highest risk is due to high risk admissions from the E.R. admissions from the E.R. are more patients are

117
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:49,070
more likely to have MRSA than if they're admitted by their own doctor and not not going that emergency route.

118
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:52,670
Patients admitted from another hospital or from a nursing home,

119
00:14:52,670 --> 00:15:02,860
and then it just all other hospital admissions had the least risky and least need for monitoring patients.

120
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:12,820
So what we need to do is search and destroy. So there have been longstanding, intensive, coordinated campaigns in Denmark,

121
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:19,090
the Netherlands and some other European countries, and that relies on targeted screening of high risk patients.

122
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:31,030
And when multiple cases of MRSA are noted, entire units in the hospital can be closed for comprehensive screening and and and cleaning.

123
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:40,390
Health care workers are screened for carriage and of course, is not allowed to work in till they are successfully decolonize.

124
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:48,390
And all of this information on search and destroy is in the papers shown here.

125
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:56,460
So in the hospital, there will be active surveillance cultures and isolation of infected patients.

126
00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:07,440
And these are used these procedures surveillance cultures in isolation for six has shown success when used to control outbreaks.

127
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:13,050
Yeah, there is active surveillance outside of the outbreak situation and that active surveillance

128
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:17,940
would take place in high risk groups that I've already mentioned and patients in the ICU.

129
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:24,930
Once again, those patients who are immunocompromised, long term care facilities, we always think about nurse and long term care facilities.

130
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:29,460
The patients who are on hemodialysis, they're they're not.

131
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:36,000
Currently, most hospitals are not currently screening regularly once a week.

132
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:45,970
All hospitalized patients, something pops up that may be the next step for some institutions.

133
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:54,400
So Society for Health Care, she has guidelines for Mirza and very in control.

134
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:59,830
It's the guideline was drafted, so it took eight years to draft the guideline.

135
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:04,900
It's been revised a couple of times, but it focuses on importance of the spread of Vihari and MRSA,

136
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:11,770
two major nosocomial pathogens in institutions and not just hospitals, but long term care also.

137
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:15,400
And it identifies the optimal means for preventing spread.

138
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:27,750
And so down below, I have a one reference by Carlene Muto, but I think they are getting ready to rewrite this guideline.

139
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:34,890
So you need to do active surveillance cultures to identify the reservoir of the spread, get that patient into isolation,

140
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:40,620
get that patient on appropriate therapy and try and stop the spread as it spreads out from that patient.

141
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:45,390
So if there's a problem, patients are high risk patients,

142
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:49,920
such as coming from a long term care facility are screened on admission and periodically

143
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:55,950
there will be weekly thereafter to see if they develop and become colonized.

144
00:17:55,950 --> 00:18:01,290
There can be facility wide surveillance for institutions with very high rates of colonization.

145
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:09,090
You can imagine what this does for the microbiology lab because all of a sudden you could take here who are getting an extra 500 to

146
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:17,220
a thousand cultures a week with no more help in the microbiology lab and just having the correct media to do all those cultures.

147
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:23,650
It's a big deal for the microbiology lab needs to be brought in on these discussions.

148
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:32,770
So there has to be facility wide surveillance for high res colonies, patience and hygiene, as you all know, is absolutely critical.

149
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:40,780
You can't wash your hands enough. I don't believe and use alcohol based hand scrub and run them until they are dry.

150
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:44,650
Barrier precautions work such as gloves, gowns and so on.

151
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:52,060
Antibiotic stewardship Make sure that patients are only getting the antibiotics that they need and the appropriate antibiotics,

152
00:18:52,060 --> 00:19:00,270
and then decolonization or suppression of of other colonized patients.

153
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:09,840
So the back, which is health care, infection control practices advisory committee that published the paper many years ago,

154
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:18,480
management of multidrug resistant organisms in health care settings and I, it says a lot of what we've already talked about.

155
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:26,370
But the committee did include not just health care, infection prevention, US and allied physicians,

156
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:31,020
but then brought in a lot of other experts in the field, brought in CDC,

157
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:37,350
brought in micro lab directors, brought in environmental people the whole bit to talk about acute care,

158
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:42,610
long term and home care experiences, and the CDC staff was there for all those meetings.

159
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:45,370
The final, they put out a proposed guideline.

160
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:50,970
They took a lot of comments from everybody in every sector of the science and sciences that were involved.

161
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:53,670
And then they incorporated those into the final version.

162
00:19:53,670 --> 00:20:04,500
And so this was concentrated on multidrug resistant organisms, including most of these subversive theory and multi-resistant our gram negative rods.

163
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:10,780
And it's a great article. It covers administration, education, antimicrobial use surveillance.

164
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:17,620
You can see everything that was covered. It's not a short article, though it's fairly.

165
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:25,540
So let's talk about their recommendations, Tier one surveillance and infection control, so under surveillance,

166
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:31,630
enhanced routine methods for identification and reporting of multidrug resistant organisms,

167
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:36,590
develop unit specific antivirals, rooms and monitor trends over time.

168
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:44,200
So if we develop a new unit specific antiviral and in one unit, they have a very high risk rate.

169
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,440
And in another unit, they have a much lower murder rate.

170
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:54,520
What's going on? What's the difference? How can we educate the people in the unit working in the unit with very high risk rates?

171
00:20:54,520 --> 00:21:00,880
And it's not just the people working there, it might be that they're getting a higher proportion of patients who are colonized coming in.

172
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:07,000
So there are a lot of things to think about, including infection control and emphasizing standard precautions,

173
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:13,130
which unfortunately sometimes they get a little sloppy with standard precautions.

174
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:23,740
And more specific contact precautions for patients with known multidrug resistant organisms.

175
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:32,740
They don't have Tier two recommendations, which should be implemented when rates do not decrease despite routine control measures,

176
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:38,230
or there's an outbreak of a multi-drug resistant organism. So Institution thinks they're doing everything.

177
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:46,660
If I can guarantee that the numbers don't go down for the multi-drug resistant organisms seem to be spiking in a particular unit.

178
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:54,250
So in that case, continue to monitor the incidents, implement additional interventions if rates do not decrease,

179
00:21:54,250 --> 00:22:02,390
and that might even be testing health care workers on a weekly basis.

180
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:11,360
So you have to increase surveillance, which means active surveillance for all at risk patients, so multiple cultures.

181
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:20,510
Who's visiting the patients? What are they touching and so on? Infection control has to monitor and go to a higher level of contact precautions for

182
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:29,030
colonized or infected patients don gowns and masks and gloves before entry into rooms.

183
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:35,930
And we have ever really resolved should that be used across the entire institution?

184
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:40,820
And then you can cohort people who have the same colonization.

185
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:49,160
If their medical needs can be in the same room, they can be cohorted.

186
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,520
So the bottom line is there is no bottom line,

187
00:22:52,520 --> 00:23:01,100
she and her pack differ in their recommendations on the scope of active surveillance cultures and basically the decision on whether to do

188
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:09,590
surveillance cultures needs to be made on an institutional basis by a committee of infectious diseases physicians infection prevention.

189
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:19,980
What can the microbiology lab handle and so on? So how do we detect person in the lab?

190
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:29,730
Well, we have distribution between the distribution is according to our test, we can use the FOXTON, or maybe we should use oxygen cylinders.

191
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:36,390
We can do Missie tests micro broth solution either manual or automated.

192
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:45,720
And we can use a test. And if you remember that each test is a test strip is specific to each drug and it has all the dilutions on it.

193
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:55,500
So I'm like on a little graph and you take your organism, make a suspension straight your plate and you can put down,

194
00:23:55,500 --> 00:24:02,280
say, the oxygen cylinder and where the growth stops across that that strip.

195
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:06,000
That's the I see. OK. That's Anita.

196
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,000
You can do access film screenplays, but most places don't do that. Go for penicillin binding protein 2a.

197
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:19,380
If you have that molecular test, you can use MRSA specific Chromogenic auto, which is very easy to use.

198
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:26,250
And there can also be direct detection of Mech. Aging, which is causing that resistance and variety of different molecular methods.

199
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:40,080
Most places don't do homebrew anymore. So here is a culture plate, so she brought our SBA, she would order they play to the nerves that samples on it,

200
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:48,030
and we're looking either for better hemolysis coagulation and coagulation testing morphology to identify stuff worse.

201
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:52,770
And I don't know if you can see this, but there is some slight bit of hemolysis.

202
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:58,200
But the colonies are too close together, so they didn't isolate the colonies very well.

203
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:09,990
See that you've got to do a susceptibility. So you can all see his ox is still on longer because Mirza likes accesso and salt.

204
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:17,800
And so you can see in this photograph we have the control here and we have another control was cut off.

205
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:21,340
Here's a negative patient, no growth and the positive patient.

206
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:25,980
It's growing really well on oxygen. A longer axis on Mercer.

207
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:31,360
Same type of drug.

208
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:38,320
Then we have I mentioned a penicillin binding protein aid that's a rapid latex coordination kit, you can do it on isolated colonies.

209
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:46,540
In the microbiology lab, you extract the penicillin binding protein to aid and reacts with your latex antibody and you look for clumping.

210
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:54,210
So here? This is it here.

211
00:25:54,210 --> 00:26:00,120
This is clumping, you can see the clumping along the edges, and this if there's no clumping, it's homogenous.

212
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:12,300
And that's the control. So we can also detect MRSA directly in nasal swabs by a variety of different assays.

213
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:20,010
Most of these are molecular assays, except for throwing them on from Auger, whereby it will grow for 24 hours and you look for a color change.

214
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:24,480
But the BD Max is separate and homebrewers are all molecular assays.

215
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:29,340
And then blood cultures positive for gram positive in clusters.

216
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:37,530
That is a warning sign that something's going on, and it's a direct call to the physician or the nurse in charge of the patient.

217
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:43,920
We would do regular testing directly, and then that's one way of fitting its phenotypic way.

218
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:50,310
We can do prolonger, get the results the next day as well, as did a couple of molecular assays.

219
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:55,560
But time we would see, particularly in blood cultures, gram positive approximating clusters.

220
00:26:55,560 --> 00:27:05,380
It's an immediate call to the health care provider, the nurse taking care of the patient, possibly also infection prevention.

221
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:17,230
So here is a mercy plate, and it has some accident in it, and we incubated for 48 hours and you can see this growth of colonies.

222
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:24,060
And if this growth of colonies are unsafe accident, it's going to be a MRSA.

223
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:32,220
This is another this is the baby bill prolonger just looking different, different set up, but it works very well.

224
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,360
And here's the ramble specter.

225
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:39,810
I think it's easier to read because the color code of the day that they have in the media is really easy to see the colleagues.

226
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:48,240
But all three of these plays take 24 hours of information. It's not a I'll get you your results in two hours or anything like that.

227
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:55,850
And a buyer at another one. So what about detection by molecular means by PCR?

228
00:27:55,850 --> 00:28:00,890
We have the BD Max assay has many different names, but now it's known as Betamax.

229
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:05,900
It's a qualitative test designed for mercy detection from nasal swab specimens.

230
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:13,550
So it uses a real time PCR piece of equipment. There's an internal control, which is wonderful right there in the system.

231
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:24,190
Turnaround time is 75 minutes, as opposed to waiting 24 hours to get that culture result, and it is FDA cleared.

232
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:29,830
So,Cepheid, another company has a MRSA molecular assay.

233
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:33,220
This is a qualitative test for herself from a nasal swab,

234
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:40,360
uses the GeneXpert system and has three different genetic markers to determine the presence of Myrcella MSA.

235
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:45,050
And I'll tell you, as future infection prevention is.

236
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:53,550
The test that's used in the laboratory, at the hospital of what you're working, as long as you can get good, valid results for detection,

237
00:28:53,550 --> 00:29:08,160
MRSA, whether it's BD or Cepheid, whatever, as long as their quality results, it doesn't make any difference which test you OK?

238
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:13,860
So here's the Betamax we had six of these machines are all in the micro lab there.

239
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:17,520
This one was less than one minute of hands on time to set it up.

240
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:24,270
You get the results in about two hours compared to to four hour, 24, four days for culture.

241
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:34,110
And you can do Stathis our testing in the same run as nurses in different other assets, so you don't have to set one whole run up for versa.

242
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:41,460
So time to detection an immersive by the various methods. Obviously, culture is going to take the longest time.

243
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:46,470
So, um, so you can see on versus select other she bled from Chroma.

244
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:52,830
Jenna Cartagena expert As you go down, the list is less time, so the bottom two on molecular methods.

245
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:58,020
Jennifer Auger. If you incubated over 24 hours and it's a certain color, it's MRSA.

246
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:10,240
So most labs are going. Most hospital based labs are going to more rapid detection of MRSA, and that can be automated.

247
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,710
So but we can have false positives on the PCR type assays also.

248
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:21,190
We might get nonspecific amplification. There may be had the Mekas that may have a deletion of the MEK,

249
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:29,020
a gene which is no fault of anyone in the laboratory or anyone collecting the specimen itself isn't an issue with the isolate.

250
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:37,210
The patient may have had a prior history of MRSA and still is positive, but the positive MRSA result is not causing the patient a problem.

251
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:48,810
It's something else, but there could be inappropriate culture methods. So what about false negative molecular results?

252
00:30:48,810 --> 00:31:04,160
And there was a study on AB, a better Dickinson product that in the year 2007, there was 0.2 percent false negative rate,

253
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:09,380
which would not have been detected if only nasal samples had been tested with they used rectal swab.

254
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:15,710
You can do rectal swabs on this molecular assay as well as nasal swabs, and that does help the positivity rate.

255
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:23,600
There was a 2.5 percent false positive rate in the literature, says two point ninety five point one false positive rate.

256
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:30,080
And so no test is perfect. No person doing the testing is perfect.

257
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:34,640
I know that the staff in the micro labs are stressed out and they all try and do their very best.

258
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,080
But sometimes things happen.

259
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:45,530
If you get a result that does not go along with what you think should be happening with the patient or the results the patient should have.

260
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:50,900
Please call the laboratory and ask to speak with a supervisor or someone.

261
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:57,740
No, not in the choosing tone, but trying to figure out, do we need to send another stuff?

262
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:02,360
Was there anything wrong in the same thing happen in the processing of this specimen?

263
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:10,910
I just have a conversation and that will be very much we'll get to in good with the lab.

264
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:15,350
So what's allowed to do PCR versus counter culture is slower.

265
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:21,320
PCR is much faster and very expensive. So culture does not cost that much.

266
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:28,250
No special training just to do cultures other than routine training. We have to isolate them for epidemiologic studies.

267
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:38,900
We can do high throughput. It's not very fast, though, page, if you have either pre surgical screening or preemptive isolation, it's not going to be.

268
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:43,670
The fastest method of PCR, though, is it's very expensive.

269
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:52,280
It requires special training and special equipment. And if the isolate is needed for additional work, you need a culture anyway.

270
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:55,790
Some platforms have limited throughput, so if you're getting,

271
00:32:55,790 --> 00:33:01,550
you can only do a hundred every twenty four hours and you get an outbreak, you've got a problem.

272
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:11,110
However, it may be very useful for pretty surgical screening and preemptive isolation.

273
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:14,080
So what happened here at University of Michigan?

274
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:21,520
They do active surveillance since November 2006, they've done active surveillance in the surgical ICU.

275
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:29,260
There have been over 300 nurses screening cultures per month and over 200 screening cultures per month.

276
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:36,550
They call screen cultures, are done admission weekly and upon discharge to make sure nobody is leaving or going to another institution,

277
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:46,390
such as a nursing home with about being positive. Initially, they feel she brought order and they did their PCR and quite positive.

278
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:52,090
I still feel quite positive as staff worries that they will look for Medicaid next.

279
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:59,740
They did have some susceptibility, they used some oxygen and they did coagulation of yellow colonies.

280
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:04,900
Now they're using cryogenic media. So which one are using this versus select?

281
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:11,600
And they haven't. When this slide was made, they had a 10 percent positive patient positive rate and a one percent patient acquisition rate.

282
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:18,010
So sometimes it's better new cultures. Sometimes it's better to do molecular.

283
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:28,180
They're both very, very good tests from Nersa. So this screening was extended to other high risk units in 2008.

284
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:37,870
There are over a thousand person screening cultures per month and approximately nine hundred and varied screening cultures per month,

285
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:41,770
and they're set up three times a day and red three times a day.

286
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:48,940
So you can see that's a significant proportion of the staff in the microbiology lab just doing the screening for MRSA.

287
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:57,530
And very. OK, so what if a patient is going into surgery?

288
00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:05,630
There are numerous studies that have documented the value of identifying staph aureus carriers prior to a high risk procedure,

289
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:11,430
such as surgery by carriers are still staph aureus are much more likely to develop Staphylococcus

290
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:17,840
surgical site infections and especially after major procedures and major cardiovascular surgery,

291
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:24,740
total joint replacement spinal surgery and so on. Devastating if these infections occur.

292
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:31,760
Surgical site infections in this patient population are associated with very high morbidity.

293
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:43,260
Loss of mobility and attributed mortality, which affects the hospital and excess cost of care.

294
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:47,760
So what can we do to intervene so that this doesn't happen,

295
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:56,370
so patients are told to use an intranasal you Pearson ointment twice daily for three days before surgery,

296
00:35:56,370 --> 00:36:03,900
on the day of surgery and one day after surgery, and that will get rid of the staph aureus carriage and the nasal passages.

297
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:13,020
There is chlorhexidine showering using chlorhexidine as a soap the night before surgery, and you need to do it for one or three days before surgery.

298
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:22,950
And there is antibiotic prophylaxis with vancomycin for no more securities instead of conventional prophylaxis with safe izola,

299
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:31,770
and that has significantly reduced the rate of MRSA. But there are still some unresolved issues.

300
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:38,130
Active surveillance takes time, and it takes people. So do you report the culture?

301
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:45,390
Wait for the culture to report the molecular how you handle this, and this is an issue that every lab is trying to manage.

302
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:52,170
Do you do universal screening of everyone or targeted screening tests of people coming in for surgery?

303
00:36:52,170 --> 00:37:01,310
Who pays for this? It's not the patient's fault that they might be colonized with something that the hospital doesn't want him around.

304
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:10,210
So who pays for this? It might be standard of care for a patient might be the microbiology lab, which has no extra money anyway.

305
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:15,320
Maybe the infection control department or hospital administration.

306
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:24,090
So there have been many, many, many legislative mandates about this subject, and it is these labs hospitals controlled.

307
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:36,650
Medicare is not reimbursed, reimbursable or hospital acquired infections, which means the hospital pays for the the patient pays for it.

308
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:46,660
So Mercer is not a friend of ours, but it continues to plague us in the lab, in the community and in the hospital.

309
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:53,350
And data suggests that active surveillance cameras may prevent infections, reduce hospital costs,

310
00:37:53,350 --> 00:38:01,750
reduce transmission and give a better quality of care, but you need the people and you need the funding to do that.

311
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:04,930
And all hospitals are struggling with this. It's not u of M. It's not.

312
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:09,790
Almost everybody struggles with how to do all of this where we don't have any more room in the laboratories.

313
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:13,750
We don't have any more qualified people to do the testing and so on.

314
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:24,070
So probably active surveillance at some level is inevitable for all of our hospitals and labs, but we still don't know the optimal method.

315
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:27,640
If we could get cultures, set up a culture and say, grow faster,

316
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:35,700
please and get your culture is out three or four hours a degree, but it doesn't happen that way.

317
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:42,210
OK. That's nursing. OK. I wanted to give you a talk on the great outdoors.

318
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:47,820
This is something that I developed first and then Chris Carpenter, who was the head of it at Beaumont,

319
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:54,940
he's now chief of medicine at Beaumont, took it, revised it for one of his talks and then he gave it back to me.

320
00:38:54,940 --> 00:39:02,550
So this will not be on the test. OK, so you can relax a little bit and just listen.

321
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:09,600
But it's interesting because we have a beautiful state. We really have a beautiful state here and I love to be outside.

322
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:13,140
I love to be on a boat. I love to be walking through the woods. But I'm sorry.

323
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:18,120
There are things that can affect me. So let's let's talk a little bit about this.

324
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:26,760
So what? What risks do we have in Michigan? This is a huge list.

325
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:33,960
On the right hand side of the blast and ICE's list, a plasma swimmer's itch, malaria, rocky mount spotted fever, tularemia.

326
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:40,830
Rabies, bovine TB community acquired C. difficile and possibly Zika virus.

327
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:47,700
And then the others on the left hand list are all here. We know about it.

328
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:56,090
So world's deadliest animals, you're looking at it.

329
00:39:56,090 --> 00:40:00,920
OK, a number of people killed per year by sharks of 10.

330
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:10,790
Wolf, 10 lions, 100 elephants, 100 hippopotamus, 500 crocodiles, 4000, 2000 are killed by tapeworm.

331
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:18,470
Twenty five hundred are killed by askaris, which is a roundworm, and then we go to the larger numbers.

332
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:26,540
There are ten thousand cases ten thousand freshwater snails in a study that were infected by two.

333
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:33,140
Ten thousand cases of Chagas disease. People bitten by a thousand bugs.

334
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:38,720
Sleeping sickness occurs. Rabies occurs in dogs, which is entirely preventable.

335
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:48,450
And then, of course, we have snakes in Michigan, but our number one pathogen is that the mosquito over there?

336
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:58,560
So we have four hundred and seventy five thousand humans and seven hundred and twenty five thousand of.

337
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:05,280
That's a lot of mosquitoes. Per human.

338
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:12,570
So seven hundred twenty five thousand people are killed annually by mosquitoes worldwide.

339
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:24,570
And this is from Bill Gates. So as he said, this is a movie I'd like to see Skeeter Naito, the tiniest bite is the deadliest by bill.

340
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:30,450
Bill Gates has done a lot to improve health care and health in other developed countries,

341
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:38,230
countries that cannot afford to have what we have here in the United States and other other countries.

342
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:46,090
So mosquito borne illnesses, there are viral illnesses, popularity and utility of everyday familiarity.

343
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:51,820
There protozoa illnesses caused by plasma Plasmodium, our carrier of malaria.

344
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:56,440
We have Hellmouth that spread across the eye and the entire species.

345
00:41:56,440 --> 00:42:04,240
More parasites. Yeah, malaria is the number one killer.

346
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:08,290
It's a complex disease. There are four species of Plasmodium.

347
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:16,520
The life cycle varies among the species, and it's carried by the Anopheles mosquito.

348
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,650
Treatment is complicated by drug resistance,

349
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:24,140
we don't have as much drug resistance in this country as other countries, but there is more drug resistance.

350
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:29,870
The further south you go in this country because there's more malaria.

351
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:36,980
Half the world's population is at risk for malaria. That is a huge, huge number.

352
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:40,700
So there's over 200 million cases of malaria a year.

353
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:45,020
So those of you who want to work in other countries, be aware of this.

354
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:52,700
Take your prophylaxis up to one million deaths annually in recent years. Now, the number of deaths are down below 500000 a year.

355
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:59,720
The rates are dropping due to prevention and control measures for early diagnosis and proper treatment for malaria.

356
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:09,650
However, two thirds of the deaths occur in children less than five years of age.

357
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:15,080
And about 7500 cases of malaria are diagnosed in the United States each year.

358
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:23,120
That's something that we think about commonly here in Michigan. But we do see occasional cases of malaria here in Michigan.

359
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:28,160
Generally, they're imported, but we do have a list of rare local outbreaks.

360
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:39,830
There can be malaria spread at airports. Congenital malaria and transfusion transmitted malaria.

361
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:43,220
So here we have some CDC information,

362
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:47,840
we have the life cycle that I'm not going to go through because you can go through it and you've probably already looked at it.

363
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:52,660
We have a diagnosis. What we what do we look for in a blood smear for plus Plasmodium falciparum?

364
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:56,150
We look for the career sites. We don't see those very often.

365
00:43:56,150 --> 00:44:04,550
They're pretty rare, but we do see the signet rings and that is diagnostic for falciparum down below.

366
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:10,850
We see Plasmodium malaria and we will see multiple sites in the red blood cell.

367
00:44:10,850 --> 00:44:16,190
And then in vivax, we will see this glandular structure in infected red blood cells.

368
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:25,190
Generally, the infected red blossom red blood cells that are larger than the other red blood cells.

369
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:38,160
Now, filariasis. Infected mosquitoes pass the larvae, a watery brand across the arogya species to humans.

370
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:48,970
The lava mature, they pass into the lymphatic and the lymph nodes, and they continue to mature over several months until they are adult worms.

371
00:44:48,970 --> 00:44:55,630
And what does this lead to the adult worms block the channels, they block the lymphatic.

372
00:44:55,630 --> 00:45:04,420
And then there's inflammation and that leads to elephantiasis of any of you ever seen a patient with elephantiasis due to blocked lymph node channels?

373
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:11,550
It is unbelievable. You can't believe that someone's walking around or trying to walk around like that.

374
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:20,640
So there's no satisfactory treatment for filariasis, but ivermectin, which is a antiparasitic and DFL carbamazepine, have an anthill mythic effect.

375
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:35,130
It's not 100 percent, but it does help. But as you kill the worms, it can make the situation worse because it will induce an inflammatory process.

376
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:42,120
So and co-infection of the helmet's with Wolbachia seems to lead to an increased inflammation,

377
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:48,810
likely due to the lipopolysaccharide presence of the bacteria when the parasite dies.

378
00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:56,430
It leads to release of the bacteria and increased inflammation. Not a good situation to be in.

379
00:45:56,430 --> 00:46:00,840
So here's information on who Terri Bancroft died.

380
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:11,710
Let's take the right hand side first, so here's our blood. And here is the worm, and if you've never seen a picture of elephantiasis.

381
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:18,640
You can see the swollen hands, this person's leg because of blocked lymph nodes.

382
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:25,480
Now granted, this didn't happen overnight. This happens. It takes time, but it can get very, very bad.

383
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:29,950
And then here it's it's just starting. On the other hand, the other picture here.

384
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:34,390
So there's a life cycle here. You can look at it on your own.

385
00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:38,560
It takes a blood meal of a larva deposited on the skin into the bite wound.

386
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:43,300
They enter the lymphatic and mature in the lymphatic.

387
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:52,840
And this is where the swelling starts. Okay. And then the microphone area under the bloodstream and we can get a blood sample to see them.

388
00:46:52,840 --> 00:47:03,850
And then the mosquito will take another bite from this infected patient and spread it on to somebody else.

389
00:47:03,850 --> 00:47:09,970
OK. What do you all know about arthropod borne viral diseases, horrible viruses?

390
00:47:09,970 --> 00:47:16,360
He had any lectures on them? Well, there are a number of different viruses there.

391
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:18,310
Fall into the group.

392
00:47:18,310 --> 00:47:26,770
There are California encephalitis, including recross virus, Rift Valley fever, and we have the flaviviruses which are more common there.

393
00:47:26,770 --> 00:47:34,180
More types of flu, the viruses, St. Louis encephalitis. I'm sure everyone in here has heard about West Nile dengue, yellow fever,

394
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:41,850
Japanese encephalitis, imposing virus, which is tick borne, not mosquito borne.

395
00:47:41,850 --> 00:47:46,330
And then we have the alpha viruses, chicken Ghana, Eastern Equine Encephalitis,

396
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:54,320
which we see here occasionally Western equine encephalitis, Venezuelan equine encephalitis and looking for us and Barmah for us.

397
00:47:54,320 --> 00:48:00,170
So this bottom three we don't see here in Michigan, I've never heard of a case of a.

398
00:48:00,170 --> 00:48:02,930
So here's the worldwide distribution.

399
00:48:02,930 --> 00:48:10,700
And this has not changed over the years in the US, we have Louis and Satellite Tripoli, Western equine lacrosse and poison.

400
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:19,010
And you can see what other types have been supplied as they have in other places in the world.

401
00:48:19,010 --> 00:48:26,420
So in 2019, which is the newest information I could pull up, this is the Michigan arbovirus surveillance.

402
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:32,870
There were 10 cases, 10 human cases of Eastern equine encephalitis.

403
00:48:32,870 --> 00:48:41,180
There were 49 cases of Tripoli in animals. The number of positive West Nile virus mosquito pools.

404
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:47,930
So they go out. People go out and they're collecting mosquitoes from different pools to see what they're infected with.

405
00:48:47,930 --> 00:48:53,030
There were 57 different West Nile virus positive mosquito pools.

406
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:58,640
The total number of mosquitoes tested is one thousand five hundred and forty, and the mosquitoes are not tested at the health department.

407
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:04,550
They've tested pretty much at Michigan State by Ned Walker's lab.

408
00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:11,330
The total number mosquitoes tested almost thirty two thousand mosquitoes were tested, which is a heck of a lot of mosquitoes.

409
00:49:11,330 --> 00:49:18,560
There were 12 West Nile cases. There were two cases of human California group virus.

410
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:23,630
There were five West Nile asymptomatic cases and they were, but they were very mixed blood donors.

411
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:29,420
They didn't know they were infected. They donated blood. And fortunately, it was found that they had West Nile virus.

412
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:35,240
Now there were 19 cases of avian West Nile virus. We certainly have West Nile virus in Michigan.

413
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:43,070
Some years we have more than other years because of how much rain we get.

414
00:49:43,070 --> 00:49:48,050
So this kind of chart is published by the state, it's a weekly summary.

415
00:49:48,050 --> 00:49:53,510
And so this was 19 counties with three with Tripoli activity.

416
00:49:53,510 --> 00:50:02,120
Forty nine animals tested as positive, 24 human cases of of Tripoli, and this is the end of the year in 2019.

417
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:08,450
And so you can see total number of mosquito four thousand one thousand five hundred forty total number of mosquitoes tested.

418
00:50:08,450 --> 00:50:12,600
Thirty one thousand nine hundred ninety five mosquitoes were tested.

419
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:18,630
So it also shows you where we see the human cases and the animal cases, so where do we see human cases?

420
00:50:18,630 --> 00:50:24,030
Generally, we see them where there are more people. However, they get it up in the up also.

421
00:50:24,030 --> 00:50:28,800
But we have more people in southeastern Michigan and more people in southwestern Michigan.

422
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:34,530
And so on. What are the signs and symptoms of coronavirus?

423
00:50:34,530 --> 00:50:40,970
The majority of people either are asymptomatic or they have a flu like illness. But how common is it another flu like illness in the summer?

424
00:50:40,970 --> 00:50:48,890
Not very common. The onset may be sudden or may be very subtle.

425
00:50:48,890 --> 00:50:55,360
All of a sudden you don't feel good the next day you feeling worse than you get a temperature making and so on.

426
00:50:55,360 --> 00:51:03,890
There can be fever headaches. My allergies are aching muscles, malaise and exhaustion.

427
00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:11,720
Rarely, infected people will develop encephalitis, and when that happens, it is become much, much worse.

428
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:17,150
It will be either fatal or there won't be permanent neurological complications.

429
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:31,480
As I said, much, much worse. How do we diagnose in the lab we can do serology on the patients so we can do a molecular test on serum or spinal fluid?

430
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:43,930
So West Nile transmission, you have these nice reservoir or whole reservoir host birds and the mosquito bites the bird.

431
00:51:43,930 --> 00:51:47,890
Birds fly around one come another. More mosquitoes, mosquitoes.

432
00:51:47,890 --> 00:51:51,550
But when they get infected, so it just keeps going round and round and round.

433
00:51:51,550 --> 00:51:58,990
But the mosquitoes aren't just happy biting the birds. They like to get a good meal or horses or other animals.

434
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:11,740
They bite them, and that's how it's transmitted. So if there are a lot of sick or dying dead birds.

435
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:17,680
Especially Crows and Blue Jays, that could be an indicator the West Nile virus is active in the community.

436
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:26,920
If you see that, please, please, please whenever you see that if you ever see that reported to the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, OK.

437
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:40,290
Sick acting or dead wildlife to India MDR. So in 2019, this was some of the counties that had local West Nile virus,

438
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:46,390
West Nile virus transmission in Marquette County, one case Bay County, one case Kent County one.

439
00:52:46,390 --> 00:52:52,940
McComb had to also have one and Wayne had four. OK, that was.

440
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:57,170
The case is that the state could actually confirm had West Nile,

441
00:52:57,170 --> 00:53:05,470
there were five probably more patients in the hospital that we're told that West Nile, but they didn't have any testing done.

442
00:53:05,470 --> 00:53:13,330
So here's the numbers over several years from the beginning of having West Nile, you can see nothing in 99, 2000, 2001,

443
00:53:13,330 --> 00:53:16,540
and then in 2002 we started to see some green,

444
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:25,870
many West Nile activity and the red dots are greater than 100 and the yellow dots are 10 to ninety nine point nine.

445
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:35,340
This is incidents per million, and the blue dots are much lower numbers and you can see it just spread across the United States.

446
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:42,110
So how can you prevent West Nile virus?

447
00:53:42,110 --> 00:53:47,720
Avoid mosquito bites, if at all possible. How do you avoid mosquito bites?

448
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:55,940
Use insect repellent when you go outdoors. There's a lot of different insect repellents that are good.

449
00:53:55,940 --> 00:54:03,250
Use it, keep using it while you're outside. You can also spray clothes with insect repellent that will help.

450
00:54:03,250 --> 00:54:10,150
Prevent bites. I notice wear long pants and long sleeves, but in the middle of July and August, it's pretty hot to do that.

451
00:54:10,150 --> 00:54:19,690
But if you can do a dusk through dawn, that will help put screens on your windows or repair screens that are broken.

452
00:54:19,690 --> 00:54:26,200
Use your air conditioner if you have it and reduce the number of mosquitoes around your house.

453
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:30,760
Empty standing water If you have flower pots outside, make sure that they drain.

454
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:41,160
The water doesn't just sit on the top of it. Do whatever you can to reduce standing water around your house.

455
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:48,180
OK, that's West Nile. Now, Zika, dengue and chikungunya are much more serious, but much more serious,

456
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:52,650
they're transmitted once again through the bite of an infected 80s mosquito.

457
00:54:52,650 --> 00:54:58,770
They lay eggs in them and their standing water and things like buckets, bowls, animal dishes and so on.

458
00:54:58,770 --> 00:55:04,080
And they are aggressive daytime bias. We usually think of mosquitoes by biting at dusk.

459
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:09,540
These bite during the day.

460
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:17,070
And so they become infected when they feed on a person who's already infected or they bite another animal that's already infected.

461
00:55:17,070 --> 00:55:25,140
Then that virus will grow in there in the in the mosquito and can be spread through additional bites.

462
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:34,220
And then the illness can be mild, it can be asymptomatic or it can be life threatening.

463
00:55:34,220 --> 00:55:35,270
So here's something.

464
00:55:35,270 --> 00:55:47,480
Just this is just online about person talking, refusing to let a virus affect a preschool vacation, and then he went on down, that person got sick.

465
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:57,470
OK, so where are the AIDS mosquitoes in Michigan? So we have AIDS albopictus in 80s of Egypt, aegypti in Michigan over on the left hand side,

466
00:55:57,470 --> 00:56:04,130
you see how it is in jeopardy that it's mostly in the southern states, a little bit in Texas, southeastern Texas, a little bit New Mexico,

467
00:56:04,130 --> 00:56:12,170
a little bit in Arizona and Southern California, but 80s albopictus is basically in the southeastern part of the United States,

468
00:56:12,170 --> 00:56:20,790
and they have even been found in Michigan, which is not something that I like to hear in.

469
00:56:20,790 --> 00:56:26,880
So going from my friends, the mosquitoes to ticks, I'm going to talk a little bit about tick borne diseases,

470
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:33,870
they can transmit bacteria, they can transmit viruses and they can transmit protozoa.

471
00:56:33,870 --> 00:56:43,200
They're becoming the greatest transmitter of diseases just about. So the second most common infection vector is the tick in North America.

472
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:49,590
But then in the world, but the most common insect vector in North America.

473
00:56:49,590 --> 00:56:55,140
And so I may have any of you ever again been voted on to take you out camping.

474
00:56:55,140 --> 00:57:00,930
Oh, you were OK afterwards? Oh good. Good luck, sex outside my yesterday.

475
00:57:00,930 --> 00:57:04,370
Oh dear, oh dear. So.

476
00:57:04,370 --> 00:57:15,290
In addition to infections, the by the tick can cause local inflammation, granuloma formation and some very severe conditions, such as tick paralysis.

477
00:57:15,290 --> 00:57:25,050
And then if you have a patient has paralysis, they can have a neurotoxin in them from that tick, causing the paralysis.

478
00:57:25,050 --> 00:57:30,150
So how small is the tick? So here we see someone's fingernail, not mine.

479
00:57:30,150 --> 00:57:37,650
And there is a tip on it, and then we see part of a metric ruler.

480
00:57:37,650 --> 00:57:40,350
And you can see the sizes of the different ticks.

481
00:57:40,350 --> 00:57:49,380
And as they get larger, as they get older, they get larger and as they get engorged with patient people's blood, they get much larger.

482
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:56,520
So many people don't see the larva or nymph stages of the black legged ticks.

483
00:57:56,520 --> 00:58:04,680
The cousin was not OK. And so those are the ones that by people, and they decided they have never saw a tick on me.

484
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:11,420
Well, they're not the adult females or the adult males, for the most part, and they're very small.

485
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:23,510
So in the US, takes care, carry all these diseases, anaplasmosis that Lazio says Colorado tick fever or lookI, a Lyme disease, porcine encephalitis,

486
00:58:23,510 --> 00:58:30,770
rickettsia pakora, Rickettsia ulcers are a massive sudden tick resources rash on this tick-borne relapsing fever,

487
00:58:30,770 --> 00:58:40,100
tularemia and then a number of rickets causes.

488
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:52,430
So what is tularemia? It is can have various different forms of illness, can cause ulcer or glandular disease, very large swollen glands.

489
00:58:52,430 --> 00:58:53,850
They may ulcer.

490
00:58:53,850 --> 00:59:04,880
Well, you can get ocular glandular disease in your eyes oropharyngeal intestinal pneumonic and typhoid foible, which would be ongoing diarrhea.

491
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:18,480
And the bugs love to live on bunnies associated with wild rabbits and bloodsucking arthropod vectors, ticks and their flies.

492
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:23,970
And this occurs frequently in the Southwest, when I lived in Oklahoma for my doctorate.

493
00:59:23,970 --> 00:59:32,110
We had a lot of information, a lot of cases of tularemia down there.

494
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:40,150
So is this organism is one of the most infectious organisms that we can work with in the laboratory it requires.

495
00:59:40,150 --> 00:59:45,670
Not this nice. It requires containment in a BSL three level laboratory.

496
00:59:45,670 --> 00:59:50,560
Many labs do not have BSL three containment.

497
00:59:50,560 --> 01:00:04,420
You cannot work with it. Even cultured do anything from a patient you suspect has a tularemia if you don't have that kind of containment in your lab.

498
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:09,700
Then we have Lyme disease, and this is the 2019 map.

499
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:17,370
Try to download the 2021 map and get it to download. So here we have an uninfected tick.

500
01:00:17,370 --> 01:00:22,890
Here and then, of course, an engorged check, then we've got the sizes of the ticks also.

501
01:00:22,890 --> 01:00:30,990
So when Lyme disease first started in Michigan, this came up the west side of the state along Lake Michigan,

502
01:00:30,990 --> 01:00:35,550
and we saw it in varying county and a few Van Buren.

503
01:00:35,550 --> 01:00:41,790
And then it started spreading up the lake. The side of the state, on the west side and then across the state.

504
01:00:41,790 --> 01:00:47,310
And then it was in the Upper Peninsula. So the red counties are the kinds of known Lyme disease.

505
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:53,460
The spotted counties are counties with potential risk for Lyme disease or adjacent to a county that has Lyme disease.

506
01:00:53,460 --> 01:01:00,970
And it's so far the state has not been able to get it to stop. I don't think anyone can get it to show up.

507
01:01:00,970 --> 01:01:08,320
So here we have Lyme disease stats, and you can see it's mostly in the upper part of the United States.

508
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:14,650
Most of the cases in the upper part of the United States in the northeast, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan,

509
01:01:14,650 --> 01:01:24,450
Ohio and so on, but there are scattered cases across the United States, even in my home state of Nebraska.

510
01:01:24,450 --> 01:01:31,140
I don't think they might have had one case in Hawaii, and they do have cases in Alaska,

511
01:01:31,140 --> 01:01:38,910
so Lyme disease bacteria are in the mid gut lining of the tick when the tick starts feeding on a human or another animal.

512
01:01:38,910 --> 01:01:48,390
Bacteria must migrate to sell their lands. They're injected into the host with the cell very fluid while they enter the host with the cell and cell.

513
01:01:48,390 --> 01:01:55,680
Very few levels are injected. The tip really has to be on for more than 24 hours.

514
01:01:55,680 --> 01:02:01,870
That's the guideline. Twenty four hours before people can be in fact infected.

515
01:02:01,870 --> 01:02:08,520
I don't know if this is always 100 percent true, but this is why people in public health say has how long does that take on it?

516
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:22,580
Well, about two hours. I don't worry about that. Sometimes it takes 48 hours and you can see the lesions that are caused by one in Lyme disease.

517
01:02:22,580 --> 01:02:29,060
So how do we diagnose it culture, which most labs are not doing and doing molecular test?

518
01:02:29,060 --> 01:02:39,590
You can also do serology that works very well, but if you're looking for antibodies to the the the virus and you have to wait for antibodies to

519
01:02:39,590 --> 01:02:43,040
the better and you have to wait until these antibodies are formed usually takes a couple of weeks,

520
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:49,080
at least. PCR does not work well with human specimens.

521
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:57,070
And it should be noted that approximately 30 percent of the people with Lyme disease don't have the rash either, so you don't know what's going on.

522
01:02:57,070 --> 01:03:02,890
Here's the transmission cycle the tick becomes infected as a larva,

523
01:03:02,890 --> 01:03:12,520
been infected by a larva and feeds on an infected reservoir host who remains infected for the rest of life unless it finds me and I kill it.

524
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:17,050
But you can see how it circles around and continues circling around in and they lay eggs.

525
01:03:17,050 --> 01:03:25,510
And the risk of human infection is greatest in the late spring and summer when we all are trying to get outside.

526
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:34,270
So it will also seek a second host, not just humans, but Dear Fox, etc. anything warm blooded.

527
01:03:34,270 --> 01:03:43,580
And the nymph stage is the stage of greatest importance as the best bet vector stage is the nymph stage.

528
01:03:43,580 --> 01:03:50,090
And there can be covered with text, but they don't support the bacteria.

529
01:03:50,090 --> 01:03:55,960
I don't know what special factor the deer have, but I wish somebody would work it out.

530
01:03:55,960 --> 01:04:01,480
So now they're easier than easier since diseases caused by that easier microbe.

531
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:06,820
It's is the most common strain in the United States. The vector is the city's tick.

532
01:04:06,820 --> 01:04:18,670
We've been hearing about these texts today. The first well-documented cases in 1957 in a patient who had lost his spleen was a Yugoslavian farmer.

533
01:04:18,670 --> 01:04:25,320
Causative agents was about easy a divergence. In 1969,

534
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:38,250
the first case of WC losses in a non atomized patients facility still had their spleen was reported in a syndrome that bombing headache and fever.

535
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:39,870
In a about in the United States,

536
01:04:39,870 --> 01:04:48,000
about 15 percent of patients don't have respect for each clinic at present in a fallen form, an incredibly ill manner.

537
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:55,120
Mortality in the US is about six and a half percent for medical assistance.

538
01:04:55,120 --> 01:05:02,860
Outside the US, with the big divergence, 84 percent of the patients who get infected are Hispanic.

539
01:05:02,860 --> 01:05:08,980
And the mortality, even with treatment, is about 40 percent. But when you look at cases outside, you don't see it.

540
01:05:08,980 --> 01:05:17,300
You don't know how well a good medical care is in this country versus the medical care.

541
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:23,660
So here are the manifestations gradual onset of malaise, fatigue and anorexia.

542
01:05:23,660 --> 01:05:30,200
Shaking chills. Less commonly muscle aches, arthralgia, nausea, vomiting, cough and so on.

543
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:34,190
There can be hemolytic anemia if there's hemolytic anemia.

544
01:05:34,190 --> 01:05:38,920
It's very, very serious. There can be thrombocytopenia.

545
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:48,010
La compania elevated liver enzymes commonly occur and acute renal sufficiency.

546
01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:53,170
So how do we diagnosis generally the same way we diagnose malaria?

547
01:05:53,170 --> 01:06:03,070
You look for that. You look at the red blood cells. You look for these ring forms and these reforms don't look like malaria.

548
01:06:03,070 --> 01:06:07,660
They look like something else. People in the lab are doing hairstyles.

549
01:06:07,660 --> 01:06:13,160
You know, look for a better, easier.

550
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:21,590
There is an antibody testing through CDC, there is indirect, it is an indirect immunofluorescence method, but then again, you have to wait.

551
01:06:21,590 --> 01:06:33,260
So the specimens going to CDC, would it be if somebody the CDC is doing a study or if you can't tell if these are his ring reforms are due to that,

552
01:06:33,260 --> 01:06:38,390
those PCR, but it's not standardized yet. OK?

553
01:06:38,390 --> 01:06:44,250
Rocky Mountain spotted fever How many people have vacationed in Colorado, where New Mexico isn't that wonderful?

554
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:50,720
It's absolutely wonderful, but it doesn't. Rocky Mountain spotted fever is not confined to the Rocky Mountains.

555
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:59,270
As you can see, it's in almost every state, except for South Dakota, Kansas, Nevada, and I'm not sure where this one is right.

556
01:06:59,270 --> 01:07:07,580
You was maybe West Virginia. So. The number of cases go up every year.

557
01:07:07,580 --> 01:07:12,440
People don't use bug spray like they should be.

558
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:19,790
It can be carried by Rocky Mountain Wood Tick or the American dog, depending on where you are in the United States.

559
01:07:19,790 --> 01:07:23,780
So there's a rash always associated with Rocky Mountain spotted fever.

560
01:07:23,780 --> 01:07:28,400
You can see the early macular rash, maybe on this insole or the instep of the foot.

561
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:38,190
And then on the right hand side, we see the late particules or bloody type of rash on the pole and for.

562
01:07:38,190 --> 01:07:43,710
It's caused by a Rickettsia, Rickettsia Rickettsia II. That's an easy one to remember.

563
01:07:43,710 --> 01:07:48,990
They all start with our Rocky Mountain high fever Rickettsia Rickettsia.

564
01:07:48,990 --> 01:07:58,590
It infects the endothelial cells lining the blood vessels that increases vascular permeability, and it causes can cause focal hemorrhages.

565
01:07:58,590 --> 01:08:02,790
And so you saw the bleeding in the previous patient.

566
01:08:02,790 --> 01:08:11,130
The incubation takes about seven days. Rash occurs three to five days later, so seven days you don't know that you're sick.

567
01:08:11,130 --> 01:08:21,320
And then in the next. And about 10 or 15 days later, something's going on, you've got a rash, you're aching all over, you got a temperature.

568
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:33,640
What is it? Oh, no, we can't see our obligate intracellular bacteria, so we cannot grow them on culture media unless we grow them in viral culture.

569
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:43,930
Now most labs are not doing viral culture anymore, so it's either a molecular test or we look for antibodies so that,

570
01:08:43,930 --> 01:08:53,400
as I said, they're not are not trying to isolate the bacterium. But throughout straw allegedly has worked very well because of her.

571
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:55,830
I have a little explanation.

572
01:08:55,830 --> 01:09:03,180
And then by enzyme immunoassay, western blot is a number of different ways to look for the organism there kissing the cause.

573
01:09:03,180 --> 01:09:07,320
Rocky Mountain spotted fever. What about religion?

574
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:13,410
Anaplasmosis because a disease called human brain acidic anaplasmosis?

575
01:09:13,410 --> 01:09:19,920
It's much easier to put HGH. It formerly was known as human granulomas or religiosity.

576
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:29,190
It's carried by the deer tick, and the causative agent is anaplasmosis felicite of the Vegas metaphor for Tennessee Tapia.

577
01:09:29,190 --> 01:09:40,560
That's how you pronounce it only took me three tries. Then there's also human monocyte, like you also say to me, it's carried by the Lone Star tick,

578
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:46,890
the two potential agents are looking at your finances or looking at or we die.

579
01:09:46,890 --> 01:09:57,150
There's a third species that's been described here, Mickey Amyris, but I'm not sure that it's here in Michigan.

580
01:09:57,150 --> 01:10:01,960
So these charts are from a couple of years ago.

581
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:11,130
Well, the upper one is from 2008, so I can't tell you any current knowledge on where the additional player is,

582
01:10:11,130 --> 01:10:14,280
where it's been found, but as of several years ago, it was not Michigan.

583
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:21,420
Well, but for H.J., the incidence is rising as it is with all of these diseases that occurs primarily in April through September.

584
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:26,280
So we're entering the season. We have higher reported cases in older adults.

585
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:34,640
Why they like to sit outside the sun, work in their gardens, play a little golf with the grandkids in the grass, you name it that.

586
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:44,790
That's how they get it. There are less fatalities than with human civic bhajji and similar distribution to H.G.

587
01:10:44,790 --> 01:10:49,320
And here again, the tip must be attached for at least 24 hours before anything is transmitted,

588
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:55,710
so try to get off as soon as possible, mainly transmitted by the new form of the tick.

589
01:10:55,710 --> 01:11:01,920
The adult can also do, but not as commonly as as the name for.

590
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:10,470
And then HIV, the incidence is also rising in that primarily occurs April through September,

591
01:11:10,470 --> 01:11:15,630
and once again, older adults have more cases like can lead to fatalities.

592
01:11:15,630 --> 01:11:20,920
This can be a fatal disease that's found throughout the United States, even here in Michigan.

593
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:30,810
And here, once again, the tick must be attached for 24 hours, yet another reason to get that tick off you as soon as possible in both the NIP.

594
01:11:30,810 --> 01:11:40,140
And then finally, the tick can transmit, but it's much more commonly transmitted by the adult form of the tick.

595
01:11:40,140 --> 01:11:45,960
So what can you get when you travel outside the United States? I am not going to read this chart for you, but you can take a look at it.

596
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:52,010
Just about everything can be transmitted someplace else.

597
01:11:52,010 --> 01:12:00,140
You know, if you go to Australia and Thailand, you might find Flinders Island spotted fever and Typekit typhus.

598
01:12:00,140 --> 01:12:12,290
Japan has Japanese spotted fever, Rocky Mountain spotted fever is found in North, Central and South America, so take a look at this chart.

599
01:12:12,290 --> 01:12:21,920
I hate this cannot stand at any time that a bad is found in a house.

600
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:31,610
There has to be an investigation. If a person has been bitten and if they can't tell the person needs therapy because if they do,

601
01:12:31,610 --> 01:12:37,400
not previously every single day, that's that's the long and the short of it.

602
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:44,310
So we've had an increase in bats in Michigan that have tested positive for rabies.

603
01:12:44,310 --> 01:12:53,470
So protect your families, protect your pets, pets, get vaccinated, humans don't generally get vaccinated, so I'm not gonna read this.

604
01:12:53,470 --> 01:13:04,870
You can read this on your own. So this is the numbers from 1978 through 2013, rabies positive animals in Michigan.

605
01:13:04,870 --> 01:13:05,500
And of course,

606
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:11,440
they're concentrated in southeastern Michigan because that's where more people are and people are closer together than in other parts of the state,

607
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:19,300
but it is across the state. Everything from bad skunks represents cows, you know, down to woodchucks with rabies virus.

608
01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:26,790
And then. This is the map from 2018 on rabies positive animals in Michigan.

609
01:13:26,790 --> 01:13:33,800
There were 77 bats. And two skulls, and so there were 79 cases.

610
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:40,980
2018 was a big year. I looked at last year's data and there were only forty five of forty nine cases,

611
01:13:40,980 --> 01:13:49,420
so two thousand eighteen was a big year and once again concentrated down towards Southeastern Mission, although there were a lot of cases.

612
01:13:49,420 --> 01:13:56,560
Eight bats and two skunks found in in in a county.

613
01:13:56,560 --> 01:14:06,490
And here are the testing for rabies testing the animals for the department of you, the department does it in their laboratory.

614
01:14:06,490 --> 01:14:13,160
If it's testing for humans, the public health department doesn't get a lab in Lansing.

615
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:18,470
So this I'm not going to read this to either, this is how to assess when a person's been exposed for rabies.

616
01:14:18,470 --> 01:14:28,460
This has not changed over the years. And I would expect that you would want to take a look at this and follow the guidelines.

617
01:14:28,460 --> 01:14:36,210
Now we have feral swine. What do they care, feral swine, so these are wild pigs, wild horses.

618
01:14:36,210 --> 01:14:40,050
OK. They carry anthrax, brucella.

619
01:14:40,050 --> 01:14:55,590
There are simple tricks Helicobacter influenza lettuce for bovine TB, salmonella and your severe and they cough and they spread viruses and bacteria.

620
01:14:55,590 --> 01:15:03,570
This is Bob on TV. I don't know if anybody's ever seen a man infected by tuberculosis, but this is what it looks like.

621
01:15:03,570 --> 01:15:09,600
We have a huge problem in Michigan with bovine TB. And where do they want to come from?

622
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:21,410
It comes from the infected deer, primarily up more to the point that petting deer and putting out grain piles for deer to eat off of it is illegal.

623
01:15:21,410 --> 01:15:26,150
And one of the last cases I heard of a bovine TB and a human.

624
01:15:26,150 --> 01:15:37,290
So this is Mycobacterium bovis, which we don't see very often in a human, was a young lady who was seen here by me and she said, Well, they were so.

625
01:15:37,290 --> 01:15:42,760
Did you wash your hands, your mask on bovine TB?

626
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:50,560
OK, so this is what the lungs look like and the infected ribs look like.

627
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:55,690
So it's still ongoing, it's India.

628
01:15:55,690 --> 01:16:01,090
There have been over two hundred and nineteen thousand deer tested as of a couple of years a few years ago.

629
01:16:01,090 --> 01:16:07,090
There have been well tested as positive. We don't have any moves that have been positive, but they've been tested.

630
01:16:07,090 --> 01:16:13,780
The coronavirus has been positive in them. You can see the rest of the animals that have been tested down here on the bottom.

631
01:16:13,780 --> 01:16:20,380
So it's endemic in Americans white tailed deer population that has been since 1994.

632
01:16:20,380 --> 01:16:27,430
The strain is, as you may see, typically consistent and has been detected in many, many humans.

633
01:16:27,430 --> 01:16:34,570
Investigation of these cases confirmed that recreational exposure to deer is a risk for infection in humans.

634
01:16:34,570 --> 01:16:48,010
Don't feed deer by hand. OK. So here is the 2019 Michigan Bovine TB surveillance plan, and you can see the north in the Lower Peninsula,

635
01:16:48,010 --> 01:16:53,260
but the north east portion is where they are primarily located.

636
01:16:53,260 --> 01:16:57,640
There are other places you can see where there are blue circles or white yellow circles or orange circles,

637
01:16:57,640 --> 01:17:05,530
but they are primarily located in those four counties not Morenci, Alpena, Oscoda and Altoona.

638
01:17:05,530 --> 01:17:12,950
But you could run into it anywhere in the state of Michigan.

639
01:17:12,950 --> 01:17:20,900
So we're getting down through this international travelers 2016 through 2009, 1996 and 2017.

640
01:17:20,900 --> 01:17:29,550
How many people travel? Overseas during that time.

641
01:17:29,550 --> 01:17:34,740
So we can see how many went to Mexico. Mexico and Canada.

642
01:17:34,740 --> 01:17:39,780
You can see the numbers right there. They've increased every year through 2017.

643
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:45,750
I'm sorry these teachers were overlapping. And you can see Canada travel is the red.

644
01:17:45,750 --> 01:17:51,180
Mexico travel is the blue. And then going on, we can see overseas.

645
01:17:51,180 --> 01:17:58,790
Air travel has, of course, increased every year. And mostly to Europe, as you can see the blue color there.

646
01:17:58,790 --> 01:18:10,810
But here in the pink color is Caribbean islands. And the green color is travel to Asia from Asia, and the purple color is South America.

647
01:18:10,810 --> 01:18:16,030
So we have a lot of overseas travel in the United States to and from many, many other countries.

648
01:18:16,030 --> 01:18:32,910
And out of the blue is Central America. Excuse me? Okay, so I think this is the last one we started.

649
01:18:32,910 --> 01:18:37,230
It is just showing the grand total of travelers all the time.

650
01:18:37,230 --> 01:18:43,050
And so we have total overseas is the blue line total in North America is the darker red line and the

651
01:18:43,050 --> 01:18:51,030
grand total is the higher flying and it is the grand total of all the travelers during that time period.

652
01:18:51,030 --> 01:18:57,180
Lots of people traveling. So where are they going?

653
01:18:57,180 --> 01:19:03,210
Most of them from the United States are going to Canada and Mexico, but they're also traveling to Europe,

654
01:19:03,210 --> 01:19:10,080
traveling to Southeast Asia to try traveling to Australia, someplace I'd really like to go and South America.

655
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:16,200
And when you go to another country, if particularly if you're not a mate of that country, you don't know what diseases can be transmitted.

656
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:24,870
And so it's always wise to check with public health. Check online, check the CDC website CDC websites excellent for travel information.

657
01:19:24,870 --> 01:19:36,500
So what are the top 10 syndromic and you do a lot of ideological diagnoses in returning travelers.

658
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:41,840
Chronic diarrhea, people say, think they weren't used to diarrhea, acute diarrhea,

659
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:50,300
most infectious irritable bowel arthropod by now is getting more serious rash skin and soft tissue jihadists,

660
01:19:50,300 --> 01:19:56,900
malaria, latent tuberculosis and strong alloys.

661
01:19:56,900 --> 01:20:04,220
Other diagnoses that people came back with abdominal pain, viral syndrome, no rash, upper respiratory tract infection,

662
01:20:04,220 --> 01:20:07,760
a febrile illness of less than three weeks duration dengue fever,

663
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:15,130
very serious chronic hepatitis B die intermedia ices, blastocysts and cutaneous leishmaniasis.

664
01:20:15,130 --> 01:20:21,310
So those left one two three four five are very serious illnesses.

665
01:20:21,310 --> 01:20:25,480
Other common travel related illnesses, traveler's diarrhea.

666
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:32,230
So the kind of thing is, boil it, cook it, peel it or forget it.

667
01:20:32,230 --> 01:20:38,920
And that makes a lot of sense for anybody who's traveling, whether it's inside the United States or outside the United States.

668
01:20:38,920 --> 01:20:44,650
There can be some treatment for diarrheal illnesses with antibacterial agents,

669
01:20:44,650 --> 01:20:52,100
but if it's significant and it's going on for several days, you need you or your patient needs medical help.

670
01:20:52,100 --> 01:20:59,990
And an altitude is illness, if people go higher than 2500 meters of mountains, they can get acute mountain sickness,

671
01:20:59,990 --> 01:21:06,470
and that can be very serious, particularly if anybody has a cardiac condition.

672
01:21:06,470 --> 01:21:15,460
And then respiratory illnesses are common when you travel influenza, upper respiratory tract infections and lower respiratory tract infections.

673
01:21:15,460 --> 01:21:24,820
Then, of course, you could also get skin infections, and this could be a parasitic skin infection such as cutaneous larva migrans,

674
01:21:24,820 --> 01:21:35,430
insect bites are common abscesses, super infected bites, rashes, animal bites, fungal infections and so on.

675
01:21:35,430 --> 01:21:40,960
And then travelers who have special conditions, so they might have diabetes.

676
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:50,310
Women might be pregnant and so on need to speak with their health care provider before they do any traveling.

677
01:21:50,310 --> 01:21:52,380
So the travel risks, I'm not going to read this off.

678
01:21:52,380 --> 01:22:00,410
You all can read, but there are numerous travel risks all the way from typhoid to road and personal safety.

679
01:22:00,410 --> 01:22:06,680
And here we have the leading causes of injury or death for U.S. citizens in foreign countries for about four two years.

680
01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:18,030
And you can see the highest was road traffic accidents and the lowest was terrorist acts and fortunately, drug related or air accident.

681
01:22:18,030 --> 01:22:24,120
So what to do before you do any international travel, I know a lot of people like to work in other countries,

682
01:22:24,120 --> 01:22:30,030
see concentrated consultation with the travel medicine expert from at least one month before travel.

683
01:22:30,030 --> 01:22:36,780
Make sure you get the prophylaxis you need, the shots you need and so on.

684
01:22:36,780 --> 01:22:43,960
Ask about special taxes that might be recommended for specific destinations.

685
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:50,050
You carry it for state medical care, and many people don't think about that, but Band-Aids, antibiotic ointment,

686
01:22:50,050 --> 01:22:58,000
Tylenol and so on and especially special medication drop all need to be brought with you on your person.

687
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:04,550
And then, of course, travel insurance helps if you get sick in another country. So take home messages from Michigan is one.

688
01:23:04,550 --> 01:23:08,590
I'm not testing you on this either. I'm just giving this.

689
01:23:08,590 --> 01:23:14,230
Michigan is a beautiful state, but never, ever, ever drink the ground.

690
01:23:14,230 --> 01:23:19,720
One never, ever do that. Be careful what you touch.

691
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:22,510
Check yourself and your kids for ticks after a walk in the woods.

692
01:23:22,510 --> 01:23:29,350
I love going on walks outside, but I was there for two weeks afterwards and my dog also use insect repellent.

693
01:23:29,350 --> 01:23:35,180
Wash your hands. Remember the supposed to wash your hands for the length of the Happy Birthday song twice?

694
01:23:35,180 --> 01:23:40,390
Remember that and enjoy the outdoors. And with that, this is done.

695
01:23:40,390 --> 01:23:48,480
You're not being tested over this last portion. OK. Any questions?

696
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:53,760
Were you all out, OK? No class on Wednesday.

697
01:23:53,760 --> 01:24:05,010
I have test to hand back and we have a final exam on Friday from one 30 to 50, I believe, and I'm reviewing that test right now.

698
01:24:05,010 --> 01:24:09,180
Make sure that everything you know, everything's hunky dory. OK, OK.

699
01:24:09,180 --> 01:24:16,070
It is not over the entire process over the last quarter. OK, so it's not cumulative.

700
01:24:16,070 --> 01:24:24,840
OK. I'm sorry it's in this room, but as far as I know, nobody's told me it's another.

701
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:36,990
OK, Hayley. Sarah?

702
01:24:36,990 --> 01:24:49,730
You can get. I would feel bad for her to leave.

703
01:24:49,730 --> 01:25:13,470
OK, Lena. Later, OK to.

704
01:25:13,470 --> 01:25:33,630
Maybe you. Very.

705
01:25:33,630 --> 01:25:55,906
Yeah.
