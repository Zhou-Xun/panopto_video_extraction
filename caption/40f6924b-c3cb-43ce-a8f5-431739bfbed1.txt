1
00:00:02,861 --> 00:00:06,890
So where do we stand now?

2
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:10,630
Infectious diseases are no longer
the leading causes of death in the US.

3
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:14,770
So you can see from this
table that while in 1900,

4
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:19,440
infectious diseases made up the top three
leading causes of death, At this point,

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,380
they're not even in the top five.

6
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:23,830
And so for the most part,

7
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:29,000
the major causes of death have
shifted indeed to chronic disease.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,230
But infectious diseases do remain a major
leading cause of death worldwide.

9
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:38,445
And so you can see here the breakdown,
and if you look globally,

10
00:00:38,445 --> 00:00:42,045
in terms of infectious disease
deaths versus other kinds.

11
00:00:42,045 --> 00:00:46,525
And if we look more closely, we can see
that the infectious disease burden falls

12
00:00:46,525 --> 00:00:49,580
more strongly on lower and
middle-income countries.

13
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:53,810
So starting up here at the top left,
for low income countries,

14
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:56,460
the most common causes of
death remain infectious.

15
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,660
As we get to low to
middle income countries,

16
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:02,353
they remain in the top three and make
up a large part of the leading causes.

17
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:06,371
But by the time we reach the upper
middle-income countries, infectious

18
00:01:06,371 --> 00:01:10,940
diseases are among the top five but make
up a smaller portion of overall mortality.

19
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:14,332
And by the time we reach upper income
countries they are among the leading

20
00:01:14,332 --> 00:01:19,031
causes but are not in the top five.

21
00:01:19,031 --> 00:01:22,937
So while the overall trajectory for
infectious diseases is that they

22
00:01:22,937 --> 00:01:25,968
have declined,
several factors have given cause for

23
00:01:25,968 --> 00:01:30,800
concern for potential emergence or
re-emergence of infectious diseases.

24
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,870
So urbanization, crowding, and

25
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:37,810
mobility brings us in greater contact with
one another and over greater distances.

26
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:40,540
And we are also having increasing
contact between humans and

27
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:44,560
the environment, increasing
the potential for emerging infections.

28
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,690
Pollutants can also affect
infectious disease risk and

29
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,690
there is potential for bioterror.

30
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:52,390
Finally, ongoing climate
change has already begun to

31
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:55,940
shift the ranges of disease vector
such as mosquitos and ticks.

32
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,661
And whether in climate can greatly
alter the risks for vector warning and

33
00:01:58,661 --> 00:02:06,102
environmentally driven diseases, Disease
such as Cholera, Dengue, Zika and others.

34
00:02:06,102 --> 00:02:10,087
There is some evidence that infectious
disease outbreak seem to be increasing in

35
00:02:10,087 --> 00:02:10,800
frequency.

36
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,245
But it's difficult to say whether they are
since disease surveillance, communication,

37
00:02:15,245 --> 00:02:18,225
and our population size
have all increased as well.

38
00:02:18,225 --> 00:02:22,095
So the authors of one study proposed
some ways to control for these different

39
00:02:22,095 --> 00:02:26,845
factors and still did, indeed, find
an increasing overall number of outbreaks.

40
00:02:26,845 --> 00:02:30,840
But this remains an active
area of research.

41
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,230
And as we mentioned before, human-animal
interaction is one of the risk factors for

42
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:36,930
emerging infectious disease.

43
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:40,604
We've seen this in many different
examples, including HIV,

44
00:02:40,604 --> 00:02:47,267
as well as different types of influenza,
and Ebola.
