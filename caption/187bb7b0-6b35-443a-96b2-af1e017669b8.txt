00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:16,590
In life, there's always certain things that get a bad rap when talking about epidemiologic study designs.

2
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,940
The one that really gets a bad rap is the ecologic study.

3
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,980
In this lecture, we're going to talk about the ecologic sampling strategy.

4
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:31,560
I'll talk about how it differs fundamentally from all of the other designs we've looked at so far,

5
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:38,100
discuss the measures of associations that can be generated and talk through ways in which the ecologic

6
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:44,610
design shines and reasons for why it's considered to be our weakest choice for studying associations.

7
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:46,950
In this last section,

8
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:55,230
I'll describe the EcoLogic Fallacy and show you some data that can help you to better understand what's happening in that particular scenario.

9
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,990
Like all other designs that we've discussed up until now,

10
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:06,050
the ecologic design is still looking at whether or not there's a relationship between exposure and an outcome.

11
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:13,010
The fundamental difference in this design, however, is that rather than using data collected on individuals,

12
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:18,080
it's studying information between entire populations.

13
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:28,490
Population. Measures that can be estimated in ecologic designs often vary by the investigators interests and their imaginations.

14
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:36,200
For example, sometimes investigators will use proportions or rates that reflect summary measures of the population,

15
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:42,680
like mortality rates for a certain country or prevalence of certain illnesses like diabetes.

16
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:47,930
Or maybe they're even interested in risk factors like the percent of people in poverty.

17
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:54,260
It might also be that they use mean levels of something across a full population,

18
00:01:54,710 --> 00:02:00,740
like the average life expectancy, gross domestic product or meat consumption of locations.

19
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:07,760
Finally, there's often interest in exposures that are shared across entire regions,

20
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:17,840
like drinking ages or policies regarding firearms or even common exposures like weather or air pollution that impact regions all the same.

21
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:28,100
Now, typically when conducting ecologic design, studies will report either correlations or they'll run linear regression models to report

22
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:33,500
the relationships between some continuous exposure and outcome between different groups.

23
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:42,579
For example, there have been some really beautiful public health analysis and visualizations that have been done by the Swedish researcher,

24
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:50,379
Hans Rosling. In fact, I really recommend that you look at one of his most famous visualizations on the ecologic

25
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:55,810
relationships between a country's gross domestic product per capita and life expectancy.

26
00:02:56,350 --> 00:03:02,350
This video is really beautiful and exciting as he walks you through this analysis and concludes

27
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:07,390
that people living in countries with stronger economies had longer life expectancies.

28
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:15,760
But he importantly brings your attention to the fact that there's large differences in life expectancy within countries of the same income level.

29
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:23,749
Now, another nice example of an ecologic relationship is this one which is showing you that there's a pretty strong

30
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:30,590
correlation between colon cancer incidence and meat consumption when you're comparing data across countries.

31
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:37,460
What I wanted to highlight here is that even though the data is probably all from the same year,

32
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:44,300
what's been shown is still incidence because it's using summary statistics for each population.

33
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:49,480
Now these plots all seem very interesting, at least to me.

34
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:56,410
Yet the ecologic design is known to have an Achilles heel, which is called the EcoLogic Fallacy.

35
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:02,530
Now, this ecologic fallacy occurs when the data on the population level does not

36
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:06,670
reflect what you would observe if you had information on the individual level.

37
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:16,330
So here I'm showing you an example of the scenario of income versus life expectancy for three different nations Afghanistan,

38
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:22,479
South Africa and Luxembourg. What you can see in this graphic is that there's actually a strong,

39
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:28,690
positive relationship with more income being correlated with longer life expectancy.

40
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:35,350
But the question that we must ask ourselves is whether or not income is actually the causal

41
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:41,440
reason that people are living longer in Luxembourg than South Africa and Afghanistan.

42
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:51,260
Now, if you're like me, you're likely worried that the life expectancy between these nations is probably due to some other factor.

43
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:59,300
For example, civil unrest. Effectively, the problem comes about when our groups are not exchangeable,

44
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:06,890
such as are some large difference in risk by place due to a factor other than our exposure of interest.

45
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:14,000
When that's true, it is possible that if you are able to get data on the individual level,

46
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:24,290
then you might see no relationship between income and life expectancy within a country such as what's shown here with the scatter and the flat line.

47
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:36,710
This is called the ecologic fallacy. Now, interestingly, not all ecologic designs are likely to suffer from the ecologic fallacy.

48
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:47,750
The Time series study is actually a design that's commonly used in the environmental epidemiology field that's much more robust to this type of error.

49
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:57,950
So why is that? Well, in this ecological study design, an investigator compares the day to day fluctuations in mortality rates in the city,

50
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:04,100
for example, as a function of the day to day fluctuations in something like weather or air pollution.

51
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:10,160
Now, while there might be some long term time trends that the investigator worries about and adjust for,

52
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:18,560
it's really hard to imagine that an entire city differs dramatically in their characteristics from one day to the next.

53
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:29,210
In this way, the ecologic design can be quite powerful for looking at population average exposures on short term triggers of health.

54
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:35,549
Now, another way in which the ecologic design really shines is when we want to look

55
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:39,960
at the impacts of health interventions or policies on population health.

56
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:48,030
Clearly, in these cases, population level information is actually the one that's of interest.

57
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:53,790
So let's take, for example, a very nice study that was conducted in Toronto, Canada.

58
00:06:54,540 --> 00:07:01,709
These investigators looked at hospitalizations for cardiovascular events as a function

59
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:07,170
of the smoking ban that was implemented in all workplaces and public spaces.

60
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:13,650
Now, this occurred in a three phase approach where basically more and more places were restricted over time.

61
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:23,910
Interestingly, what they see here is that there was a reduction in the admissions for cardiovascular events after the smoking ban,

62
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:30,720
but that same ban did not seem to impact a control condition in the same way.

63
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:38,160
The control condition that they looked at was bowel obstructions that were not anticipated to be influenced by smoking.

64
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:47,100
By looking at a control population, they were able to minimize the risk for ecologic fallacy by trying to account for

65
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:51,540
known and unknown differences in their populations being compared over time.

66
00:07:53,270 --> 00:08:02,540
So in summary, the core concept of the ecologic design is that we're collecting information on exposure and outcome on the group level.

67
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:08,270
The strengths of this particular design are that it takes limited effort and cost to conduct.

68
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:17,360
It can be useful for relatively rare diseases and exposures because you're able to get so many counts when you're looking at entire groups of people.

69
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:24,740
It can evaluate incidence and prevalence and is highly appropriate for policy evaluations.

70
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:32,660
Now, of course, it has its limitations and it's often unknown whether or not exposure or disease has happened first.

71
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:41,180
There also may not be enough information on the population level to adjust for characteristics that can threaten exchange ability.

72
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:52,130
And as a result, this design is subject to the ecologic fallacy where group level associations may differ from the individual level associations.
