00:00:05,969 --> 00:00:08,779
Hello, today's lecture is the first of

2
00:00:08,779 --> 00:00:13,440
two lectures covering summary
statistics in biostatistics.

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,400
Todays lectures will discuss summary
statistics used to measure location or

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,680
the middle of your data.

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,580
As we have conveyed hopefully by now
raw data is very rarely informative for

6
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:25,270
human brains.

7
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:27,380
We cannot look at a set of a data and

8
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:30,530
immediately make conclusions
from those data.

9
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,550
We often need to collapse those
data into a single number or

10
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:38,020
a set of numbers that are often
easier to understand and explain.

11
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:42,450
Any number that is computed from a set
of data is known as a statistic.

12
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,280
They are used for
determining the signal and

13
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,570
the noise that we described
in our earlier lectures.

14
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:50,230
Statistics are also useful for
making inference or

15
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:54,860
conclusions about the population
that your data belong to.

16
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,120
Again, the number from
the data is interesting, but

17
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,970
we want to use that number to make
a conclusion about the population of all

18
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:04,340
the other subjects that
were not in our study.

19
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:08,050
Many statistics are also used to
estimate the characteristic that is in

20
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:09,600
the population.

21
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,850
As a measure of location, the most common
measure is the sample mean, a majority

22
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:20,250
of the statistical methods that we cover
in this course will focus on the average.

23
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,040
Again, the sample mean or
commonly is called the average.

24
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:29,220
Mathematically the sample mean is simply
the sum of all the numbers in your data,

25
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:34,350
divided by how many numbers
of data points you have.

26
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:39,063
In mathematical terms if we have
a little n observations and

27
00:01:39,063 --> 00:01:44,072
we label each of the observations as x1,
x2 all the way to xn.

28
00:01:44,072 --> 00:01:49,440
Then the sample mean as I said is the sum
of all those n numbers divided by n.

29
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:54,450
Mathematically we use shorthand with the
Greek letter sigma which represents sum.

30
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:58,840
So again that second line states
that if we take a sum from

31
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:03,730
i equals 1 in the first observation, up to
i equals n in the last observation, and

32
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:06,470
we divide that sum by the sample size.

33
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:11,337
We denote this number as x bar,
so here's an example.

34
00:02:11,337 --> 00:02:15,040
I've asked seven people to count
how many texts they sent yesterday.

35
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,502
And they give me the following responses,

36
00:02:18,502 --> 00:02:22,837
32, 29, 26, 40, 19, 21, and 27.

37
00:02:22,837 --> 00:02:26,231
The mean of this sample of seven
observations is simply adding

38
00:02:26,231 --> 00:02:31,090
up those seven numbers and dividing by
seven, which gives me a mean of 28 texts.

39
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:36,220
So, I would say on average,
these people sent out 28 texts, yesterday.

40
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:41,290
If I went to seven more people and asked
them the same questions, suppose they gave

41
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:46,390
me the responses of 50,
3, 14, 62, 10, 40 and 17.

42
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:50,565
Again, the sum of these seven
numbers divided by 7 is 28, so

43
00:02:50,565 --> 00:02:55,905
these two sets of seven observations
both have the same mean of 28.

44
00:02:55,905 --> 00:02:59,125
However, they then ask is
the mean a better summary for

45
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:01,855
one of the sets of data than the other?

46
00:03:01,855 --> 00:03:03,185
And hopefully, intuitively,

47
00:03:03,185 --> 00:03:08,762
you think that perhaps the mean is a poor
representation for the second data set.

48
00:03:08,762 --> 00:03:12,355
And that's because the second data
set has what we call outliers.

49
00:03:12,355 --> 00:03:17,335
Someone only sent 3 texts and someone
sent 62 texts which are values that

50
00:03:17,335 --> 00:03:23,980
are much lower and much higher than most
of the other responders in my survey.

51
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:28,942
Therefore, when we have data in which
there are outlying observations,

52
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:32,473
a better summary of the middle
is the sample median.

53
00:03:32,473 --> 00:03:36,595
The sample median is the value that is
exactly in the middle of the observations

54
00:03:36,595 --> 00:03:40,890
when we order them from the smallest
value to the largest value.

55
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:45,627
We also call the median the 50th
percentile, because 50% of the data will

56
00:03:45,627 --> 00:03:51,440
be below that number, and
50% of the data will be above that number.

57
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:57,232
From my previous two sets of data, I have
that the first set has a median of 27,

58
00:03:57,232 --> 00:04:00,265
while the second set has a median of 17.

59
00:04:00,265 --> 00:04:02,977
So although these two sets
of data have the same mean,

60
00:04:02,977 --> 00:04:06,670
they have distinctly different medians.

61
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:10,550
That is because, by definition, the median
will always have to be in the middle and

62
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:13,770
the mean will not have
to be in the middle.

63
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:17,840
The difference between these two
numbers is related to the skewness

64
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,160
of the distribution of data.

65
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,710
Here I have plots of two distributions,
one that is left skew and

66
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:26,250
one that is right skew.

67
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,890
So again, the x-axis would
be the range of values and

68
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:33,460
the y-axis would be the percentage
of the data that are at that value.

69
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,140
When we have left skewed data,

70
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:39,630
we have a preponderance of the data at
larger values represented by the peak and

71
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:43,990
we have a small number of observations
that have very small values.

72
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:47,860
This creates a tail on
the left side of the data.

73
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:53,030
The tail draws the mean toward it,
the small observations pull the mean

74
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:57,470
toward a smaller number while
the median stays at the middle.

75
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:59,780
Conversely, with right skew data,

76
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:03,970
a preponderance of the data are on
smaller values represented by the peak.

77
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:09,340
And we have a small number of observations
that are much larger than everyone else.

78
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:13,950
These unusually large observations
will pull the mean toward the right

79
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:16,490
while the median stays where it is at.

80
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:19,450
So with left skewed data,
the mean is to the left of the median,

81
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:24,590
where with right skewed data,
the mean is to the right of the median.

82
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:29,220
So here is an actual example of some
right skew data collected from a study

83
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,780
published in the American Journal
of Public Health.

84
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:34,960
This is a histogram of lead
blood levels measured in Detroit

85
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,670
children under the age of six.

86
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,900
From this histogram we can see
that preponderance of children

87
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:46,030
had lead levels in their blood of ten
micrograms per deciliter or less.

88
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:49,900
Although we had a small handful
of children who had lead levels

89
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:55,650
that were at 20, 30, 40, and
almost up to 50 micrograms per deciliter.

90
00:05:55,650 --> 00:06:00,270
Again, these very high blood levels
in small minority of children

91
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:03,190
tend to pull the mean toward the right.

92
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:06,300
So if I told you that the mean
representing this histogram

93
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:10,160
was 7.12 micrograms per decilitre,

94
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,410
what would you conclude the median
of these values might be?

95
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:17,480
And certainly the conclusion we
would make is that the median

96
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,880
would be less than the mean.

97
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,781
So the median would be
perhaps 5 rather than 7.12,

98
00:06:22,781 --> 00:06:26,184
because these large observations,
the 40 and

99
00:06:26,184 --> 00:06:31,250
50 micrograms per deciliter would
have less influence on the median.

100
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,717
And the median were to
represent more of the data,

101
00:06:33,717 --> 00:06:37,030
the values that are to
the left in the histogram.

102
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:40,140
Now, the two samples of
testing that I gave earlier

103
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:43,330
had an odd number of observations
that were seven in each.

104
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:46,870
So the median will always be the single
observation that is in the middle

105
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:49,450
when they order from lowest to highest.

106
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:52,370
If the data had had an even
number of observations,

107
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:56,930
there are now two observations that are in
the middle rather than a single number.

108
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:01,060
The solution of that is we simply take the
average of the two numbers in the middle.

109
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:04,270
So for example, if we I removed one
of observation from the example and

110
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:08,100
now I had text that range from 19 to 34.

111
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:13,084
The two observations in the middle
are 26 and 27, the median for

112
00:07:13,084 --> 00:07:18,171
these data would be 26.5,
which is the average of 26 and 27.

113
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:22,533
Now, using the sample mean and
median are useful for continuous measures,

114
00:07:22,533 --> 00:07:24,650
like blood lead levels.

115
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:28,320
With qualitative data,
we could use a sample mean or

116
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:32,270
median if each category
is given a numeric value.

117
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:36,608
So for example, recall the data I
presented in an earlier lecture,

118
00:07:36,608 --> 00:07:40,121
looking at the periodontal
health in 100 smokers.

119
00:07:40,121 --> 00:07:44,893
Again, this table shows 100 smokers and
there were 10 of them that had healthy

120
00:07:44,893 --> 00:07:48,302
periodontal status,
there are 23 that had gingivitis,

121
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:53,620
30 with mild periodontitis and
37 with moderate or severe periodontitis.

122
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:56,200
I could assign values to
each of these categories,

123
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,870
with a one representing healthy,
two representing gingivitis, three for

124
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:04,060
mild periodontitis and four for
moderate or severe periodontitis.

125
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:09,677
So I could compute a mean for
these 100 subjects by taking 10 times 1,

126
00:08:09,677 --> 00:08:13,332
23 times 2, 30 times 3 and 37 times 4 and

127
00:08:13,332 --> 00:08:17,626
dividing by 100,
that would give me a mean of 2.9.

128
00:08:17,626 --> 00:08:23,330
I could also take the median of these
100 values and that would result in 2.5.

129
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:27,118
However, the difficulty with these
two numbers although they can be

130
00:08:27,118 --> 00:08:30,710
computed is that they really lack
any biologic interpretation,

131
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:34,449
because the values given to each
of these categories or arbitrary.

132
00:08:34,449 --> 00:08:37,543
I could have just as easily assigned
the values two, four, six and

133
00:08:37,543 --> 00:08:41,820
eight to the four categories giving me
different means and different medians.

134
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:46,870
So in general, when we have qualitative
data, even if they are ordinal,

135
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:51,230
the mean and median are not appropriate
measures of summaries in location.

136
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,249
It is better to present the count and

137
00:08:53,249 --> 00:08:57,237
the percentage of observations
in each category.
