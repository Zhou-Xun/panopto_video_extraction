1
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:41,150
All right. Hey, good morning, everyone. Welcome back. At least I haven't seen you.

2
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:47,490
You probably have been back for more than just today. I hope you had a, I don't know, rest.

3
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:57,450
Well, maybe some time to catch up, maybe a little bit of enjoyable fall break, a few logistics before we get into the course material today.

4
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:02,460
I have hard copy exams. I'm going to go ahead and pass them back.

5
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:09,600
You you can hang on to him during the whole class period. I will recollect them as we as we dismissed.

6
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:20,520
And with a little bit of embarrassment, I'm going to ask you to help me with means.

7
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:35,020
Rebecca. Here we have a small crowd of.

8
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:51,130
Not a. So think.

9
00:01:51,130 --> 00:02:22,720
Ed. Andrea.

10
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:56,640
I don't know. Well, I'll totally go over the whole thing, sorry.

11
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,970
Just give me a minute to Fastback back as much as I can. Go ahead and look through things.

12
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:08,670
And, yeah, we'll take we'll take as much time as we need to kind of review.

13
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:20,900
I'm trying to remember you, you know, you have your results, yet you have your results handed.

14
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:45,100
Now, give let's give a couple more minutes if we have additional evidence to show up before we start walking through a little bit of the exam.

15
00:03:45,100 --> 00:04:02,970
I think campus, the protesters are still. Interesting, yeah, so for all of them or just for some of them to show off that, no, I totally believe you.

16
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:08,970
I'll see if I can figure that out.

17
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:18,240
Huh? And at least the way it was set up in Kansas, it's not set up to be like auto graded,

18
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:25,170
so there are answers in there for like the multiple choice for the open ended, like Sean answer.

19
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:32,760
There's not answers listed, but it's marked which ones you got, correct or not.

20
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:36,600
Yes. Oh, it doesn't even show you that. Oh, that's terrible. All right.

21
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:42,280
Well, let me try to thank you for that feedback. Let me see if I can figure that out, because it's not just impacting you.

22
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:53,660
That's impacting several people. All right,

23
00:04:53,660 --> 00:05:08,360
so so some general feedback and then I want to hit on a couple of questions that people had trouble with and then also just have some discussion,

24
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:16,220
our questions that you might have about really anything. Oh, so first off, I'm not sure if folks.

25
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:24,470
Did anybody watch the zoom recording from last Wednesday? There are a few people on, so I apologize of this will be redundant.

26
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:31,670
The mean score on the exam. I know people like to know this kind of stuff was 87 out of 100, whatever.

27
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:36,770
Just so you have a rough idea of where you fit within that.

28
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:43,760
The message I gave to folks last week was if you didn't do as well as you were hoping, don't worry about it.

29
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,720
The exam is only worth 30 percent of the entire semester grade.

30
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:56,840
So there's still a lot of points to get to be had in the end, if you did do as well as you were hoping.

31
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:01,820
Good job, but keep working hard, right?

32
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:08,360
It was only working 30 percent. You've got you've got a lot more to do. So keep up the good work.

33
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:16,430
A couple of ones that I want to hit on here. Number five, several folks had trouble with this one.

34
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:27,260
The National Ambient Air Quality Standards for twenty point five are most often in and in parentheses non-routine in which of the following areas.

35
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:35,270
So non attainment means not meeting the standards, meaning the levels are above the air quality standards.

36
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:46,830
So the areas that would most likely have this problem are urban areas, right where we have a lot of the emissions in close proximity.

37
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:59,460
Number seven tripped up a couple of people, what agent was linked to neurologic disorders among workers in the industry in the 19th century?

38
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:03,930
This was on one of our earlier class slides early in the semester.

39
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:29,180
The answer is, B, Mercury. That's actually where the sort of fictional character the Mad Hatter comes from moving through here.

40
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:39,320
Number 21, which was there, were to fill in the blanks, most people got the first one, correct stochastic.

41
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:55,520
The second one is probability. Know.

42
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:06,350
For a number 24, almost everyone got at least some partial credit, but it was only a couple of people that were able to list all six correctly.

43
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:11,720
So this is regarding the national ambient air quality standards for the next.

44
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:35,300
So those six criteria pollutants are carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, lead particulate matter both as PM 2.5 and p.m. 10 and ozone.

45
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:45,350
And then actually, most people did pretty well in the open ended answers, so those were the those were the things that I wanted to hit on,

46
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:56,070
specifically the other questions that folks have about any of the others.

47
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:13,380
Did we do we go north of 13 miles an hour because they to for their dose differs from exposure,

48
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:25,350
because it also has which factors, you know, that going on follow that they prefer to go slower than they were right before.

49
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:34,470
So it refers to dose. OK, yeah. And then actually all of the answers are correct.

50
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:38,190
Yeah. A is a true statement. B is a true statement. C the true statement.

51
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:51,510
But the correct answer is all of the above. All right, so Docx takes into account the mass of the person,

52
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:57,080
the amount of agent that accumulates in the body as well as right of protective equipment

53
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:07,520
is being used as impacting how much of that agent is able to get into the body?

54
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:15,220
Any other any other questions?

55
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:24,820
All right, so again, it's kind of back to general feedback, I was happy, you know, as a class how folks perform a good job, keep up the good work.

56
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:28,480
Like I said, I'd like to hang on to the exam during the class period.

57
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:34,390
I'll ask you to pass it forward as the break. But if you if you have additional questions, if you'd like to meet, you know,

58
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:38,830
one on one to talk about anything about the exam, you absolutely have to do so.

59
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:42,190
So just just reach out and let me know. All right.

60
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:48,510
So that was logistic. No one was touching on the exam.

61
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:56,830
And number two is moving to the proposal.

62
00:10:56,830 --> 00:11:06,490
And so and actually, I wanted to to clarify, I had a question earlier this week about accessing material.

63
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:11,170
So I'm on the Kansas home page.

64
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:18,520
And basically, other than recordings, all of them, of course, materials are hyperlinked here.

65
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:27,530
And so, you know, for each class period, this is where you'll find the PowerPoint slides from each lecture you can download.

66
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:34,150
I'm here with the arrow. Each of the associated readings are listed, you know, with the same lecture periods of the day.

67
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:45,040
Today, we had a couple of Chapter three and four in support of today's lecture I posted early last week, the proposal assignment.

68
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:50,590
I'm actually going to do a little demo here, download it and then open it.

69
00:11:50,590 --> 00:12:04,500
And we can look at it together briefly and see if folks have any questions.

70
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:10,140
So this assignment is involves you preparing a proposal.

71
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:18,420
It's in response to a mock call for proposals from the state of Michigan to conduct an applied exposure assessment.

72
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:22,530
So you all are kind of like these budding exposure scientists, right?

73
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:30,540
You're like halfway through the semester. The state recognizes this and they want to tap into your expertize.

74
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:36,270
It's a little bit of a professional development exercise in terms of the time frame.

75
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:42,190
This is typical. And in the real world, hey, some funding is available.

76
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:51,540
It needs to be turned around and allocated really quickly. And you've got three weeks to respond to this mock call.

77
00:12:51,540 --> 00:13:03,720
So it's do eight, 30 a.m. November 4th and the specifics of it and actually a little bit more context.

78
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:10,800
So since you only have a little over three weeks to work on this or since the time I was assigned, it was a little over three weeks.

79
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:19,800
I'm not looking for like this polished, you know, term paper type assignment that you've been working on, you know, for for over three months.

80
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:25,770
Nuts and bolts here, just, you know, text. And what's there is what I'm looking for.

81
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:31,630
It doesn't need to have glossiness. It doesn't need to have pretty tight all cover pages.

82
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:35,070
Like, don't worry about that.

83
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:42,870
It does spell out further down because folks are usually interested to know we're looking for an eight to 10 page proposal,

84
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:46,620
twelve point five, one point five lines facing.

85
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:55,830
Somebody asked me about margins. I'm going to say one inch, please cite your your work.

86
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:58,740
So include references,

87
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:07,350
but the references as well as any like tables are figures that help support your proposal aren't included in that in that page limit.

88
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:12,690
So just kind of tack on at the end and then a little bit of a rubric here.

89
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:18,240
And this might help guide how you lay out the proposal. I'm not looking for a specific format.

90
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,320
Pick whatever you're most comfortable with, but if you're looking for some guidance,

91
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,090
you could just kind of follow these these first four components here.

92
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:28,800
Start perhaps with an introduction.

93
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:39,720
I'm looking for you to be able to put forth your understanding of the history of pithos, contamination in communities.

94
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:44,730
The meat of the proposal is really here, number two. And you can kind of see that with the point allocation.

95
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:50,970
It's worth 50 points out of 100 total. Is your proposed exposure assessment methodology,

96
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:57,370
the description of the sampling strategy or exposure measurement methods, any other data collection activities?

97
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:07,470
I do want you to specifically identify and describe uncertainties involved in your measurements and then also

98
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:15,120
a description and application of what relevant standards might be in place for this particular context.

99
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:23,430
And then you actually get points for hitting that appropriate proposal, length of eight to ten pages slowly back up here.

100
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:31,680
So it's focused on pithos. OK, and this is unfortunately something real here in Michigan.

101
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:39,810
So hence the state of Michigan is concerned about it. And the state has, for the context of your assignment here,

102
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:46,710
has identified several mistakes that have occurred in the process of assessing and attributing exposures to pithos.

103
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:51,210
And that's why they're inviting these proposals to help improve exposure, assessment,

104
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:58,590
preparedness and response in the event of a future community pithos exposure incident.

105
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:08,310
So in your proposal, I'm asking you to again briefly introduce and describe an historical problem of pithos as a contaminant in community

106
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:16,440
settings and then describe your proposed exposure assessment methodology in the event of the following near future

107
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:23,100
occurrence so that residents within a specific Michigan community took it upon themselves to go out and have their

108
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:32,670
blood tested and the levels of pithos detected were found to be elevated compared to the U.S. population levels.

109
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:42,630
So you have some freedom here. You can you can choose if you want to choose a specific Michigan community to focus on just to kind of make it real.

110
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:48,270
You can do that. If you want to make up some fictitious Michigan community.

111
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:56,370
You're also welcome to do that. Whatever helps you along in making your way through the assignment.

112
00:16:56,370 --> 00:17:03,860
So in your proposed methodology, I want you to consider and discuss the possible exposure pathways.

113
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:09,860
And the likely routes of exposure to these residents within the community describe

114
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:14,810
potential exposure measurements and other exposure data collection approaches,

115
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:18,140
including the relative pros and cons of each right.

116
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:23,300
So we've kind of gone through a lot of the different exposure assessment approaches in class.

117
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,300
This is your chance to kind of like show what you know. Right.

118
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:34,850
You kind of go ahead and let them out, say, well, we could do this, we could do that and we could do this, the pros of the first one or that.

119
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:39,050
But, you know, here are some challenges of it, the pros of the second one or this.

120
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:49,610
But here are some challenges. And based on that, you know, what I'm proposing as the best solution would be this or the best approach would be this.

121
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:58,400
So once you kind of work your way through that feasible but rigorous and comprehensive exposure assessment estimate,

122
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,680
exposure across all sources and pathways go out and present and describe what the

123
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:10,400
uncertainties might be involved in your proposed approach and then as well as any exposure,

124
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,560
standards or regulations, you know,

125
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:25,350
pertinent to this kind of hypothetical future incident and how those standards might be relevant for how you would interpret your data.

126
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:37,110
Any questions? No format or is it picked pick whatever you like to use and just be consistent.

127
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:46,080
That's fine. Word Doc PDA. I will actually set up an assignment and canvass so that you can submit the assignment through canvass.

128
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:56,080
I haven't done that yet. So if you're already done with the assignment, I'm sorry, but I'll try to get it set up.

129
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:07,550
Any other questions? Yeah, what type of life standards should we use?

130
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:17,360
Think about the fact that I'm very different. Different people say we heard the.

131
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:24,410
So you're answering your own question a little bit, so I want you to be able to to discuss and work through that,

132
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:31,730
whatever the relevance is to your specific situation that you're kind of proposing the community setting.

133
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:40,510
But, yes, that might not be straightforward. Good question.

134
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:50,010
Many others.

135
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:57,720
All right, well, as usual, this isn't your last chance to ask questions about it as you get further into the assignment and questions arise,

136
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:08,220
please don't hesitate to reach out to me. I'll try to remember to kind of prompt folks over the next couple of class periods for questions as well.

137
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:21,800
And then see come back to this page. So our schedule, at least over the next couple of weeks, so we just finished our fall break,

138
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:30,410
we're going to talk about to continue talking about exposure modeling, kind of picking up where Professor O'Neal left off last week.

139
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:39,470
And Professor Meeker will join us again on Tuesday to talk specifically about biomarkers and biological monitoring.

140
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:48,110
And then a week from today, yeah, you know, lecture, we're going to have a couple of in class assignments to work through.

141
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:53,150
One is going to be our exposure. Science in the news, our third installment.

142
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:57,230
I'll post an announcement to canvas. It's going to be similar to the first two.

143
00:20:57,230 --> 00:21:04,640
I'm just going to ask you to continue to dig a little deeper and continue to apply the principles that we've learned in class along the way.

144
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:14,720
That'll be about half of the class, period. The second half of the class period is going to be allocated to debate groups.

145
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,500
We don't need to go through it now. I will go through it next week on Thursday.

146
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:26,750
But I did post for those folks that are interested, the debate instructions and kind of take take a look at those.

147
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:36,230
I haven't assigned the debate groups yet and the topics that I will have that done soon so that when we are meeting next Thursday,

148
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:42,920
it'll be a chance for you all to actually in-person some some allocated class time to break into groups,

149
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:49,520
start to get yourselves organized and kind of develop a plan going forward again, not to cause any panic.

150
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:54,890
Those debates are not until, in a way, at the end of the semester, that first week of December.

151
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:57,650
So that's really, really far off.

152
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:05,870
But I did want to at least get the ball rolling, get you all connected with your groups so that it's not hanging out there.

153
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:12,680
And as we get into that first week of November, we'll talk about exposure and risk assessment.

154
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:19,350
And then the proposal is due on November 4th.

155
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:28,430
Any questions about kind of the class schedule or logistics over the next few weeks?

156
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:39,400
All right, sounds good. So with that, let's go ahead and jump into today's material.

157
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:45,850
Which is back to exposure modeling, so Professor Merial,

158
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:58,150
Professor Maree O'Neill spoke last week prior to the break around different issues for for using spatial interpolation.

159
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:01,690
Right. Some statistical approaches to estimate people's exposure.

160
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:11,350
When you when you can't have an actual true personal monitor that you can estimate a personal exposure based on other data.

161
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:17,260
So we'll continue looking into this. Today, our goals are going to be to understand.

162
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:25,300
And again, these are indirect methods, right? We're not actually hanging a badge on a person or some other type of approach like that.

163
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:33,730
So this might involve environmental modeling and monitoring versus personal monitoring.

164
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:37,880
It might utilize things like questionnaires and diaries.

165
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:46,420
We'll talk about those today. So understanding what types of exposure data are needed for these exposure models,

166
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:54,340
understanding the methods for assessing personal activities in time spent in different micro environments,

167
00:23:54,340 --> 00:24:06,350
and understanding the role of uncertainty in our data and variability and how it impacts modeling.

168
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:11,870
So when we're assessing exposures, we have options, right?

169
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:18,830
One is monitoring so actual data collection with a device, some sort of instrument,

170
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:24,860
one is modeling right where you have often like a computer model, again, professor or statistical model.

171
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:30,110
Professor O'Neill highlighted several of these approaches, but in reality,

172
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:41,270
both is is a pretty common option to the combination of monitoring and modeling to get us to estimates of exposure and modeling.

173
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:49,130
Is it really indispensable? For one, it's the only way to handle prospective evaluation.

174
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:52,970
Right. So if we're looking into the future, it's really hard to make measurements in the future.

175
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:59,300
But we can kind of predict using models what future exposures might look like.

176
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:08,370
And that allows us, you know, having these models allows us to offer or obtain predictions for a wide variety of scenarios.

177
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:14,690
So all we need to do is kind of tweak a variable or tweak an input for what that future occurrence might look like.

178
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:21,800
And it can help us to kind of parametrized or give us a range of what those exposures might look like.

179
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:33,290
Oftentimes there's problems or just it's really resource intensive or expensive to actually get data through monitoring within a site.

180
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:46,040
And some modeling gives us an opportunity. And then, you know, the need to to screen or provide some sort of preliminary evaluation.

181
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:54,410
It might even include a law, a large number of products or processes, options, different scenarios.

182
00:25:54,410 --> 00:26:01,570
So modeling really has a lot of strength for several reasons.

183
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:11,530
We've looked at this layout a few different times, we talked over here on the direct methods side of exposure assessment process, right.

184
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:16,330
We talked about personal monitoring, biological monitoring and so forth.

185
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:21,250
What we're focusing on today is continuing to look at indirect methods.

186
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:29,260
So it might include some environmental monitoring or area monitoring and or modeling and then the use of things like questionnaires,

187
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:42,940
diaries, time activity logs and so forth, that these are all categorized as indirect exposure assessment methods.

188
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:46,660
You've seen this slide before, but just as a reminder, again,

189
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:57,370
this is still what's what's driving our our knowledge need to in order to estimate exposures, there's four key components.

190
00:26:57,370 --> 00:27:03,280
We need to have an estimate of the magnitude. So how much agent is there the frequency?

191
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:07,630
How often does contact with that agent occur?

192
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:12,220
The duration? How long does the contact last?

193
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:17,680
And then again, those key routes of exposure. How does the agent enter our body?

194
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:28,370
And then our ability to estimate exposure is a function of knowing that magnitude, that frequency and that duration.

195
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:36,140
All right, so jumping back to that really popular example that we started with a few class periods ago where we

196
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:45,020
had Person A who works in a lead smelter and Person B who lives in a community around the smelter.

197
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:51,110
We looked earlier at how we could maybe do personal monitoring on each of these individuals.

198
00:27:51,110 --> 00:28:01,640
Right in these two different contexts. Let's go ahead and utilize this same example, but instead asking how could we model their exposures?

199
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:12,740
What would be some opportunities to do so? So one might be area or environmental monitoring in contrast to personal monitoring.

200
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:21,410
Right. So that personal sampling is where we have an actual device attached to the person that travels with them wherever

201
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:28,820
they go and is collecting some sort of information on what their exposure is as they move about a workplace,

202
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:36,800
a community, wherever they're spending their time. Area sampling or environmental monitoring is different.

203
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:44,750
This generally includes stationary devices. So things that are set up and that don't move.

204
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:48,050
I could give an example here in our classroom. All right.

205
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:53,720
This is our microenvironment for about an hour and 20 minutes on Tuesday and Thursday morning,

206
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:58,520
we might set up a stationary monitor right here in the middle of the auditorium and

207
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:04,460
use that as a surrogate of exposure for all of us during during the class period.

208
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:08,720
Right. If it starts sampling the air in the classroom.

209
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:16,970
So this type of approach is convenient for when the monitoring device is quite large or uncomfortable.

210
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:26,270
It's not practical to be to be worn as a personal monitor in these cases, that personal exposure must be extrapolated.

211
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:31,850
Right. So it's in our example, I just gave it sitting here in the middle of the classroom.

212
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:36,170
We need to kind of extrapolate that my exposure up here at the podium.

213
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:44,660
Right. Is is somewhat related to what the device is monitoring in the middle of the classroom.

214
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:53,270
That exposure is underestimated when people are generating exposure by their own activities.

215
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:59,060
So, you know, if there's something up here at the podium and they're messing around all the time and it's kind of kicking up something here,

216
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:05,300
but I'm actually being exposed to it's probably not being captured very well by that monitor in the middle of the auditorium.

217
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:12,680
Right. So in that case, we might be underestimating my own exposure for these area samples.

218
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:20,090
Exposure might be overestimated when the device is placed near point sources.

219
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:25,850
So let's imagine this would be a worst case scenario, be terrible, that that monitor is right underneath.

220
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:29,510
I don't know. Let's say there's something coming out of the projector, hanging from the ceiling there.

221
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:33,500
Right. And it's kind of falling straight down. The monitors collecting it.

222
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:40,460
I'm way up here in the safe confines of the podium. I'm not being exposed to any of that.

223
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:43,970
But the monitor that's sitting in the middle of the auditorium is capturing it.

224
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:53,450
Right. And so it's giving a really high rating. And so in that case, that area sampling might be overestimating my exposure up here at the podium.

225
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:59,210
Right. Because I'm not actually being exposed to what's falling from the projector alone.

226
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:05,420
Why am I giving these, like, anxiety inducing example? I'm really sorry about this.

227
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:13,130
All right. So back to person A and person B with regards to environmental monitoring.

228
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:26,000
So within that led factory, the smelting factory area, samples could be collected in the work area using even a personal sampling.

229
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:36,110
Right. So we had examples earlier on where the worker person occurred, where a pump where that person was going throughout their workday,

230
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:40,010
just taking the pump off and setting it in the middle of the workspace and having it

231
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:46,010
be a stationary device might be one approach to actually collecting an area sample.

232
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:54,440
And again, that exposure would likely be underestimated when the worker is generating exposure via their own activities.

233
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:58,820
Right. That maybe wouldn't be captured by the area monitor.

234
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:12,140
Oftentimes we're looking at an eight hour time weighted average concentration in a workplace, but is Person A in that area for eight hours every day?

235
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:22,640
Right. So how relevant is that area monitor to their true personal exposure per person be in a community setting?

236
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:27,080
We could use area air samples collected at.

237
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:31,880
The smelter fenceline, right? So kind of right at the edge of the smelter property,

238
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:40,170
the buffer between the smelter property and the community property using some sort of fixed air sampling pump that's kind of set up,

239
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:46,040
turned on and it's running. We might be concerned about other pathways.

240
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:53,630
Is there a source of exposure through soil to that land, perhaps to the water in the community or maybe even food?

241
00:32:53,630 --> 00:33:01,550
So this might trigger as exposure scientists us to actually collect samples in addition to air within this community?

242
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:07,910
Right. Maybe some soil samples and water samples, food samples that are grown locally.

243
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:19,070
That exposure is could be overestimated because we're placing the sample air right against the fence line of the lead smelting plant.

244
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:26,960
Right. So that might be capturing kind of a worst case scenario if person B actually lives a mile away from the smelter,

245
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:32,720
there are two exposure could generally be less right than what's captured right at the fence line.

246
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,860
In this case, the exposure could be overestimated.

247
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:46,340
And then what's typical of community environmental samples for like this air sample for land is that they run for about 24 hours.

248
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:52,410
They integrate over 24 hours of of a time onto a filter.

249
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:58,580
But, you know, his person B, actually at home in the residence for all of those 24 hours.

250
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:11,440
So, again, kind of the relevance of an area sample comes into question how truly reflective it is of Person B's exposure in that case.

251
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:18,340
Continuing along with environmental monitoring or area monitoring within the workplace,

252
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:23,830
like this lead smelter, operation environment or modeling is not really very common.

253
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:36,280
The reason is because it's generally easier to actually get through personal samples, personal monitoring on workers when it is used.

254
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:45,520
We can estimate concentrations within a work area through modeling out here in the community setting where person B is.

255
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:52,510
Environmental models are quite common because it's not as easy to actually get personal samples,

256
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:57,490
personal monitoring, kind of like that exercise you went through a few class periods ago.

257
00:34:57,490 --> 00:35:04,210
And so, again, going referencing some of the statistical approaches that Professor O'Neill introduced.

258
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:16,700
These environmental models are used to estimate the potential concentrations within residential communities, residential homes.

259
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:26,780
Back to the workplace, as I mentioned, we're typically relying on measurements, but there are sometimes there are mathematical models.

260
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:35,090
This might be simple, one box models, multi zone models or even some computational fluid dynamics just because so much might be

261
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:43,050
known about the individual workplace and work processes out here in the community setting.

262
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:49,700
And again, this is highlighting pretty much what everything that Professor O'Neill presented on their proximity based.

263
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:52,730
Right. We know where Person B is.

264
00:35:52,730 --> 00:36:03,980
We have an address, some sort of, I guess, information we can use spatial interpolation based on how far away they live from the lead smelter.

265
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:11,990
We might use some dispersion modeling. Right. If we know some characteristics of what's coming out of the stack at the lead smelter

266
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:20,840
and then also some of those land use regression approaches that she presented on.

267
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:31,370
For this environmental modeling, the EPA actually makes it available, publicly available environmental models,

268
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:39,110
so through their Center for Exposure Assessment Modeling, there are EPA designated groundwater models,

269
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:45,110
surface water models, food chain models and multi-media models.

270
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:51,030
So as we try to actually make estimates, the community settings, there are tools available.

271
00:36:51,030 --> 00:37:09,410
They don't need to be created from scratch to water.

272
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:18,860
With regards to uncertainty, we're actually going to hit specifically on uncertainty a little bit later on in the slide deck,

273
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:26,600
but typically uncertainty around an estimated concentration within the workplace is relatively small.

274
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:30,920
Again, because we usually have a lot of access, we have a lot of information,

275
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:43,000
and so we can get a much more accurate measure with less uncertainty in our assessed exposure in the community setting.

276
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,730
The uncertainty tends to be larger because we have less access.

277
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:49,730
We generally have less known information.

278
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:58,070
So the uncertainty around those estimated concentrations in the community are larger and they vary by media, with topography,

279
00:37:58,070 --> 00:38:08,140
with the availability of GISS data, with things like weather and climate, with specific Egypt, any number of variables.

280
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:18,440
All right, shifting gears, still staying with indirect methods, but moving over to questionnaires and diaries.

281
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:22,640
So back to our lead smelter example,

282
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:31,490
we might use questionnaires and diaries in the workplace and might be a work history questionnaire of an employee,

283
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:42,170
we could collect a time activity diary of what the worker does through each phase of their work during the day.

284
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:52,100
And we can use these to obtain how frequent exposure might occur and the duration of exposure.

285
00:38:52,100 --> 00:39:01,880
We might be able to find out detailed history on each job and related exposure that the worker does per person be over here in the community.

286
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:09,080
We can also apply these questionnaires or diaries. They're going to be a bit more general in nature, right?

287
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,510
Less specific than in the workplace.

288
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:17,870
But we might be able to, through a questionnaire, obtain information on the residential and work history of this individual.

289
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:23,600
Where have they lived over time and where have they worked over time and again,

290
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:33,080
a time activity diary would be useful that would help us when we have an area monitor that's monitoring for 24 hours in their community.

291
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:42,500
If we know that Person B leaves the community for school, for work or some other activity for eight or 10 hours a day.

292
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:52,010
Right. We can then adjust our exposure assessment accordingly with that information.

293
00:39:52,010 --> 00:40:04,880
With regards to these questionnaires and diaries in the workplace, they might be used to to supplement or even validate with employment records.

294
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,810
So other information that we may be able to access through the company,

295
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:17,330
being able to go through these questionnaires with a specific employee could allow us to either get additional information or, if nothing else,

296
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:25,580
give us greater confidence in the information than we already have for person B in the community here,

297
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:34,370
we could use them to evaluate distance from the source, the duration that they've lived in this resident.

298
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:38,600
We might be supplementing or even validating what was otherwise obtained,

299
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:45,530
maybe through property tax records, right in the name of a person that's associated with with residency.

300
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:57,010
And it may also supplement things like this information. So what do some of these look like and what are some more kind of specific applications

301
00:40:57,010 --> 00:41:03,770
so time activity diaries can be really useful tools for assessing temporal variation.

302
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:12,820
Right. So activities that change over time and they help us not just with what the

303
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:18,280
activity is that where people are spending time in different micro environments.

304
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:25,930
So what's a micro environment? I kind of gave this classroom as an example of a micro environment for us, right on each Tuesday and Thursday morning.

305
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:31,600
But it's basically an immediate, small scale environment distinct from a larger environment.

306
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:36,580
Right. So you're spending time on the University of Michigan campus on Tuesday and Thursday mornings.

307
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:41,140
That's a broader scale. The micro environment is, you know, room 1755.

308
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:50,410
That's one different microenvironments may be defined depending on the hazard, the exposure pathways and the roots of exposure.

309
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:57,820
So kind of how we classify them microenvironment might be different based on the chemical or biological agent.

310
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:02,230
We're concerned about what pathways or routes of exposure.

311
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:08,050
We are primarily concerned about a bunch of examples here.

312
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:18,760
I won't go through them all. These are potentially important microenvironments for air pollution exposure assessment.

313
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:27,130
So jumping down here, if we're talking about an indoor non occupational, you know,

314
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:34,330
maybe an apartment that someone lives in the grocery store that they spend time shopping in,

315
00:42:34,330 --> 00:42:40,730
you know, the sports arena that they went to for a basketball game or whatever it might be,

316
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:45,430
we already gave the example here of our classroom for transportation.

317
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:52,360
This is like another kind of a common microenvironment. People tend to commute to and from someplace on most days,

318
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:59,080
whether it's work or school or whatever it is, that mode of transportation, whether it's within a car,

319
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:02,440
on a bus, in a subway,

320
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:15,470
these are all microenvironments that would help us inform how we would collect time activity information with that time activity diary.

321
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:28,520
I gave the examples there for air, but quickly moving through time activity data and how it could apply to specific exposure pathways for water,

322
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:39,290
it might be information collected on the quantity of water consumed either directly or indirectly, information on accidental ingestion.

323
00:43:39,290 --> 00:43:47,330
So if we know that someone swims like in a pool or a lake, we might be interested in dermal contact, right?

324
00:43:47,330 --> 00:43:53,120
How much time someone spends showering or bathing, washing frequency?

325
00:43:53,120 --> 00:44:00,230
Right now we're all washing our hands a lot right in the pandemic for food.

326
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:07,730
These time activity data might help us with the amount and type of food products that are

327
00:44:07,730 --> 00:44:15,320
consumed with the preparation methods are including cleaning and the preparation location.

328
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:20,300
Right. Where's the food coming from? Or maybe storage practices.

329
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:28,280
And then for things like soil, the amount of contact time, the type of soil and someone working in a garden.

330
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:39,460
Are there pesticides being used and information around skin surface contact?

331
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:45,700
So why do we need to assess how much time someone spends in different microenvironments?

332
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:52,810
So here's an example to help at least illustrate why it might be important.

333
00:44:52,810 --> 00:45:05,320
So over here, we've done this great job of assessing concentrations of pollutants in the air in different microenvironments.

334
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:09,760
So we do this like this this survey across the campus, for example,

335
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:17,860
and we determine that 54 percent of the pollutants that we're concerned about in this

336
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:26,800
case is talking about volatile organic compounds that occurs in community settings,

337
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:37,210
whereas 70 percent comes from office settings, 22 percent in home settings and only seven percent in outdoor environments.

338
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:42,970
Well, now let's match this up with exposure profiles.

339
00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:50,710
So this is actually tracking where I spend most of my time right to my own time

340
00:45:50,710 --> 00:45:55,780
activity information center that I spent 71 percent of my time in my home.

341
00:45:55,780 --> 00:46:03,010
I spent five percent outdoors. I spent 18 percent of my time in my office, and I spent eight percent of my time commuting.

342
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:12,220
Well, OK. We learned that the largest opportunity for high exposures to these airplanes comes during commuting,

343
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:15,820
but I only spent eight percent of my time actually commuting.

344
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:25,120
Right. So knowing what these microenvironment area concentrations are combined with my own time

345
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:33,520
activity is really useful information and why we would be interested in assessing these things.

346
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:49,420
Any any questions so far, I think, because. All right, so this time, activity diaries can be short term, very highly time resolve or longer term.

347
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:59,500
So on the shorter scale and like capturing activities and different microenvironments over periods of maybe minutes, two hours.

348
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:05,980
So a 24 hour dietary recall. Right. What did you eat throughout the course of the entire day?

349
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:11,080
It's pretty detailed. A work activity log.

350
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:22,180
What did I do as a worker over the course of my shift for an individual day through each task?

351
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:26,710
And then there's kind of a longer term time activity, diaries and questionnaires.

352
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:36,190
So these might capture activities in micro environments over periods of days to years or even decades.

353
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:46,630
So, again, you know, a food diary, but, you know, this one is is scoped out over the course of an entire week versus a single day and then,

354
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:56,360
you know, using calendar to record instances, whatever it might be.

355
00:47:56,360 --> 00:48:03,530
There's another indirect method of exposure assessment called expert judgment.

356
00:48:03,530 --> 00:48:13,040
It ends up being a bit more useful or common in a workplace environment, but we will talk through both the workplace and a community setting.

357
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:23,150
So within a workplace, we can use expert judgment of an industrial hygienist to estimate what a concentration,

358
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:30,770
frequency of exposure, duration of exposure might be for a person who works in the lead smelter.

359
00:48:30,770 --> 00:48:36,140
So it basically acts as a surrogate measure for environmental monitoring and questionnaires,

360
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:40,760
having someone who has expertize in this area and knows exactly what to look out for.

361
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:47,600
So simply through observation or knowing some basic characteristics about a person A in their work environment and again,

362
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:55,070
like I mentioned here, relies on, you know, a good knowledge of industrial hygiene work practices, what the visibility conditions are,

363
00:48:55,070 --> 00:49:04,760
the different processes and operations and how those change over time in the community environment.

364
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:11,720
We could use expert judgment of environmental researchers to to estimate a concentration,

365
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:25,880
but it tends to be really difficult to estimate the frequency and the duration of exposure for an individual person, in this case, Person B.

366
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:36,800
However, what we can use, we reference this earlier on in the semester is the exposure factors handbook the EPA puts out.

367
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:43,610
So for Person B, we might be able to use this handbook to estimate how much they ingest.

368
00:49:43,610 --> 00:49:53,780
Right, whether it's soil or dust, what typical inhalation rates are to help inform on airborne exposures,

369
00:49:53,780 --> 00:50:02,630
how much water that people typically consume and what the sources of it are, dermal exposures, et cetera.

370
00:50:02,630 --> 00:50:12,020
So we can use this exposure factors handbook to help assess what exposure might be of Person B in their community and in the workplace.

371
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:14,360
It's this approach really isn't used.

372
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:24,720
And again, because there's there's typically other sources of information within that workplace environment that are available.

373
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:32,760
All right, so moving through on the indirect methods side, we're talking about environmental monitoring and modeling,

374
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:40,710
we're talking about questionnaires and diaries and these all in form, again, exposure models.

375
00:50:40,710 --> 00:50:50,600
The exposure models can be informed by direct methods. They can also be informed by indirect methods.

376
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:57,260
The types of exposure models might include statistical models based on

377
00:50:57,260 --> 00:51:04,010
multivariable statistical associations between the input and the output variables,

378
00:51:04,010 --> 00:51:13,490
they might utilize deterministic models that are based on logical constructs of the physical environment and human behavior.

379
00:51:13,490 --> 00:51:24,080
They might be probabilistic models. So based on deterministic model, combined with the probability distribution of the input variables.

380
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:33,800
And again, we're not going to get into too much of this. These are approaches that most of you are learning about, like your bio statistics class,

381
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:42,430
and then you'll get into in some more advanced environmental science courses.

382
00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:49,840
All right, so with these exposure models, again, applying them within that workplace, setting in that community,

383
00:51:49,840 --> 00:52:00,820
setting within the workplace for personne, we might be able to estimate personal exposures using information that we obtain on duration,

384
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:08,860
frequency and magnitude of exposure from doing those area measurements, from doing questionnaires and diaries,

385
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:14,650
applying some mathematical models combined with the expert judgment approach.

386
00:52:14,650 --> 00:52:14,910
Right.

387
00:52:14,910 --> 00:52:25,270
So all of these might feed into an exposure model to actually obtain an estimate of exposure per person in that workplace environment for person B,

388
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:35,530
in that community environment near the lead smelter. We would also have an opportunity to estimate their personal exposure, getting that duration,

389
00:52:35,530 --> 00:52:43,000
frequency and magnitude information from that environmental monitoring or area sampling that we conduct in the community.

390
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,780
We could also get information from questionnaires and diaries.

391
00:52:46,780 --> 00:53:02,180
We also have the tool of the Exposure Factors handbook that can all serve as inputs to that exposure assessment model for community setting.

392
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:05,840
So continuing to talk about exposure models here,

393
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:14,570
statistical models used to estimate exposures are similar for occupational and community assessments.

394
00:53:14,570 --> 00:53:24,650
They're all looking to combine information around magnitude, duration, frequency and other factors to explain unmeasured exposure.

395
00:53:24,650 --> 00:53:28,580
And then ideally, we can use those to create a predictive model.

396
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:34,700
Right. So where we have unmeasured exposures, but if we have information on some of these parameters,

397
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:41,570
we can use that model to predict what an exposure might be and then some common modeling approaches.

398
00:53:41,570 --> 00:53:46,460
And again, you'll be if you're not yet, you'll be learning about these and some other courses,

399
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:54,660
but using linear regression, logistic regression and Bayesian regression.

400
00:53:54,660 --> 00:54:03,570
So, you know, at the end of the day, we want the same thing, both in workplace environments as well as in community environmental settings,

401
00:54:03,570 --> 00:54:08,640
which is a quantitative estimate of exposure of an individual.

402
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:14,100
There's often a lot of barriers in the way of us getting to this point.

403
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:24,300
And a lot of times we need to settle for, you know, less preferred approaches for obtaining measurements.

404
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:30,960
There's categorical exposure classification. It's either high, medium or low.

405
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:39,150
There's questions around whether the person is ever or maybe never been exposed. And one of the three parameters we need, maybe we're missing, right?

406
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:44,130
Maybe we don't have information on the magnitude or the duration of the frequency.

407
00:54:44,130 --> 00:54:48,850
We're going to talk a little bit more on an uncertainty here in a few minutes.

408
00:54:48,850 --> 00:55:01,830
But with the utility and usefulness of these exposure models, it kind of goes back to that any type of model saying that this is garbage in,

409
00:55:01,830 --> 00:55:07,140
garbage out, the quality of the data being input into the model.

410
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:14,820
Right. Or like it's in reverse that the quality of the output of the model and its usefulness and utility is highly,

411
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:22,700
highly dependent on the quality of the input data going into that model.

412
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:27,150
Talking a bit more about the prospective exposure modeling, right,

413
00:55:27,150 --> 00:55:35,120
so it's very specifically designed to assess risk into the future and future scenarios.

414
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:44,650
It's generally based on scenarios describing possible or expected future emission sources or exposure scenarios.

415
00:55:44,650 --> 00:55:52,020
Right. I think early on in the semester, we talked about, you know, a manufacturing plant or some sort of facility,

416
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:55,940
a waste incinerator proposed being built nearby communities.

417
00:55:55,940 --> 00:56:00,170
Right. It's not actually built yet. So we can actually make measurements of its impact.

418
00:56:00,170 --> 00:56:08,510
But using an exposure model, we might be able to predict what exposures might take place if it were to be built,

419
00:56:08,510 --> 00:56:15,050
which could inform the whole project in the first place right now, and whether it should continue to be built or not.

420
00:56:15,050 --> 00:56:21,620
Right. So these types of prospective exposure modeling is actually required and a lot of settings

421
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:27,650
to to obtain like a permit from a state or federal authority to go ahead with the project.

422
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:32,750
And then exposure and risk assessment might also consider aspects of equity.

423
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:48,070
Right. So a lot of environmental justice scenarios come into play in terms of at adversely or in equally impacted communities.

424
00:56:48,070 --> 00:56:52,750
Through this perspective, exposure modeling, there are key steps.

425
00:56:52,750 --> 00:57:00,070
One is a scoping analysis to kind of generally define the boundaries of a problem.

426
00:57:00,070 --> 00:57:11,620
The next step is developing a scenario. So what are the chain of events leading to that exposure and then developing some exposure assumptions?

427
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:17,830
Right. This is a big part of any model is we do need to make assumptions.

428
00:57:17,830 --> 00:57:26,290
So which model would be used to predict concentrations? Which pathways are we assuming we should be most concerned about?

429
00:57:26,290 --> 00:57:31,240
Right. Is it inhalation? Is an ingestion? What's the intake rate?

430
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:38,350
What's the period of exposure? And then we need to finish with an uncertainty analysis.

431
00:57:38,350 --> 00:57:43,690
So uncertainty. So when we talk about uncertainty, what exactly does that mean?

432
00:57:43,690 --> 00:57:48,430
In many ways, it's a defining characteristic of exposure assessment.

433
00:57:48,430 --> 00:57:55,300
It's composed of two different elements. One is variability.

434
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:59,590
So this is something that is real.

435
00:57:59,590 --> 00:58:10,930
Exposure does change over time, changes over space between people, etc. There's also an element from lack of knowledge.

436
00:58:10,930 --> 00:58:27,910
So something that we poorly understand regarding the agent or the measurement conditions, we we don't want to miss real exposures.

437
00:58:27,910 --> 00:58:33,700
Right. This is like a big part of exposure assessment is setting it up so that we're measuring

438
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:38,650
the right things to actually capture where exposures are like most likely taking place.

439
00:58:38,650 --> 00:58:46,270
Right. So it's a big goal and an exposure assessment strategy or methodology to not miss real exposures.

440
00:58:46,270 --> 00:58:52,870
But at the same time, there are a resource effort, cost limitations.

441
00:58:52,870 --> 00:58:58,930
Right. We can't measure everything everywhere all of the time.

442
00:58:58,930 --> 00:59:04,660
So we don't want to waste resources on on phantom exposures.

443
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:15,890
We want to be able to allocate as many of our limited resources as we can on the most likely scenarios where those exposures might be taking place.

444
00:59:15,890 --> 00:59:24,430
This modeling approach, when we talk about these exposure models, they are driven as well as limited by scientific uncertainty.

445
00:59:24,430 --> 00:59:29,260
This is real and it's it's an iterative process.

446
00:59:29,260 --> 00:59:35,650
And it often involves trading off conservatism for data.

447
00:59:35,650 --> 00:59:47,920
And this is a really tough back and forth with exposure modeling and then to differentiate between uncertainty and variability.

448
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:57,580
So uncertainty represents a true lack of knowledge about different factors that could be affecting exposure.

449
00:59:57,580 --> 01:00:06,310
It can lead to either inaccurate or biased estimates, whereas variability is real.

450
01:00:06,310 --> 01:00:16,360
This variability in our data could arise from true heterogeneity across people, across space, across time.

451
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:24,760
It can also affect the precision of our estimates and how generalizable they might be.

452
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:33,430
And then one approach to estimating uncertainty is through probabilistic analyzes such as Montecarlo analysis.

453
01:00:33,430 --> 01:00:38,080
And these are able to account for uncertainty in different parameters of a

454
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:47,540
model by evaluating a range and probability of different plausible exposures.

455
01:00:47,540 --> 01:00:54,500
Wow, I am done really early. I was trying to lead time to so that we could go through the exam,

456
01:00:54,500 --> 01:01:05,170
go through that proposal and see if folks had any questions, any questions on the material presented.

457
01:01:05,170 --> 01:01:17,020
Nine. All right, well, hey, since we're done, it's only 931, I will hang out here for a few minutes if you want to look through your exam.

458
01:01:17,020 --> 01:01:20,780
Additionally, go ahead and do so. If you have any questions, now's a great time.

459
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:27,860
You want to ask me about them? If not, you're free to go. Go ahead and pass back your exam and have a great day.

460
01:01:27,860 --> 01:01:30,370
Oh, great question. Yeah, liability is I mean,

461
01:01:30,370 --> 01:01:38,830
it's like quantifiable versus like uncertainty where really it's a little bit more hypothetical like it could be, but we're not sure.

462
01:01:38,830 --> 01:01:48,520
Ideally they're both quantifiable, but they're different sources of noise in our data.

463
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:57,590
Right. So if if we want to.

464
01:01:57,590 --> 01:02:03,380
If we want to estimate exposure and.

465
01:02:03,380 --> 01:02:10,280
We're measuring particle exposure on the University of Michigan campus.

466
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:16,970
We only have a staff person and a sample are available on Tuesdays,

467
01:02:16,970 --> 01:02:24,440
so we go out on campus and make a measurement on Tuesday, each Tuesday for a month.

468
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:34,460
If the true concentration of particles changes dramatically over the course of the week, if all we have is information on Tuesday, right.

469
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:41,480
That's adding in a huge amount of true variability in our data and is going

470
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:49,280
to affect how precise that exposure estimate is and how generalizable it is.

471
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:59,510
Uncertainty represents things that we we might know less about.

472
01:02:59,510 --> 01:03:11,690
And this could lead to like a bias. So I guess using that same example, if we only measure on Tuesday and it turns out that I don't know.

473
01:03:11,690 --> 01:03:16,820
Don't quote me on this. They don't do this. But I'm going to come up with another anxiety inducing example.

474
01:03:16,820 --> 01:03:27,690
Every Tuesday, the power plant on campus does this like uncontrolled, you know, cleaning of the stack and like shoot out all kinds of nastiness?

475
01:03:27,690 --> 01:03:34,550
How can they only do it on Tuesdays? We happen to be sampling on Tuesday only we didn't know anything about this.

476
01:03:34,550 --> 01:03:43,730
But now we've introduced this huge amount of bias in our estimate by doing it that way.

477
01:03:43,730 --> 01:03:53,520
Any other questions? When I saw Rebecca, first thing that we can going for you interests, I was in a sort of a general question,

478
01:03:53,520 --> 01:04:03,990
but I'm wondering if you see like I mean, I've heard a lot about, like citizen science efforts for like airline money or air and things like that.

479
01:04:03,990 --> 01:04:10,730
Do you see that as like reducing any of the uncertainty in community exposures that we have?

480
01:04:10,730 --> 01:04:16,530
I think so, yeah. That's a that's a great question. Repeat repeated for the recordings.

481
01:04:16,530 --> 01:04:20,640
So Rebecca is asking about different approaches,

482
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:31,920
utilizing citizen science and the example she gave us air quality and does that help us to reduce uncertainty and exposure?

483
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:38,790
So it's a great question. It is has really grown over the last maybe decade or so.

484
01:04:38,790 --> 01:04:46,770
And so the, you know, kind of the true characterization is that a decade or more ago,

485
01:04:46,770 --> 01:04:52,500
what we had information on with regards to air quality exposures in outdoor communities was

486
01:04:52,500 --> 01:05:00,210
relegated to like not very many air quality monitors scattered throughout urban areas.

487
01:05:00,210 --> 01:05:02,190
So on the city of Detroit, for example,

488
01:05:02,190 --> 01:05:12,120
there's probably a half a dozen their standard reference methods that are used to these instruments, they're generally pretty expensive.

489
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:18,660
They're fully vetted and approved by EPA for official air quality monitoring.

490
01:05:18,660 --> 01:05:27,810
It's really, really good measures, very accurate, very precise at that stationary site.

491
01:05:27,810 --> 01:05:35,770
But then how generalizable is it to the few kilometer radius and of the community around it?

492
01:05:35,770 --> 01:05:46,500
Right. So you have a highly accurate, precise measure in a single spot versus with some of the citizen science approaches,

493
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:51,210
there might be some really inexpensive device.

494
01:05:51,210 --> 01:05:53,040
Maybe it's through your phone.

495
01:05:53,040 --> 01:06:01,440
Maybe it's some really inexpensive monitor that someone is distributing that people wear, but they're not very accurate.

496
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:08,520
Right. So an individual monitor might be, you know, might have an uncertainty of like plus or minus 50 percent like.

497
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:13,470
That's how inaccurate or imprecise the monitor is.

498
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:20,940
But if you have a half a million people in the city of Detroit all wearing these or,

499
01:06:20,940 --> 01:06:26,250
you know, doubt having this information contributed to some cloud based data source,

500
01:06:26,250 --> 01:06:36,030
well, wow, you can really outfit that a couple of mile radius of people with living and within a community, ideally, you have both, right?

501
01:06:36,030 --> 01:06:42,210
You be kind of put those both into a model. Here's your official monitoring data.

502
01:06:42,210 --> 01:06:51,000
Here's your citizen science data. And the combination of the two allows you to kind of regress or interpolate and improve.

503
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:59,670
So it's it's a little bit of both. The citizen science approach tend to be highly inaccurate.

504
01:06:59,670 --> 01:07:08,430
And if the precision is so, so broad or so poor, they maybe aren't useful.

505
01:07:08,430 --> 01:07:12,810
So it kind of depends, I guess is the answer. But yes, they are.

506
01:07:12,810 --> 01:07:21,780
Those are it's a great example of how uncertainty comes into play and why it's important to characterize it.

507
01:07:21,780 --> 01:07:25,860
Does that answer your question? OK, OK.

508
01:07:25,860 --> 01:07:28,110
Andrew, you had the question also. Yes.

509
01:07:28,110 --> 01:07:43,710
I was just wondering what your modeling is like saying that trash burning facility was in place would not be a common.

510
01:07:43,710 --> 01:07:52,230
It is it's it's super common, actually, within kind of the world of regulation and permitting.

511
01:07:52,230 --> 01:07:58,650
So, you know, every operation that not only wants to we talked about building a waste incinerator right.

512
01:07:58,650 --> 01:08:05,130
In the steps that would have to go through in order to build one, just making changes to a facility,

513
01:08:05,130 --> 01:08:10,830
growing the capacity, using a different type of control technology.

514
01:08:10,830 --> 01:08:17,490
The the approval of permits that those facilities need to apply for needs to be backed by all of

515
01:08:17,490 --> 01:08:26,190
this prospective exposure assessment to those in the surrounding community that might be impacted.

516
01:08:26,190 --> 01:08:35,840
Yeah, absolutely. These are great questions, by the way.

517
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:49,951
Many others. All right, well, I'll go ahead and end the recording, but like I said, I'll hang around here, folks have any questions?
