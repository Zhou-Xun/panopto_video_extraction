2
00:00:05,986 --> 00:00:09,550
When you think back to what you've
learned, a little bit of biostatistics can

3
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:12,820
be helpful in critically
evaluating public health studies.

4
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:15,890
Now you can question,
what's the population, and

5
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,250
what was the sample to
infer to that population?

6
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:19,810
Was it representative?

7
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:23,620
Was the sample of adequate size
to provide robust results?

8
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:27,390
Is there practical and
statistical significance?

9
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,470
Was there anything that differed
systematically that may induce bias in

10
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:31,980
the study?

11
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,030
And was there association or causation?

12
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:41,959
Some biostatistical knowledge can help you
better understand public health studies.
