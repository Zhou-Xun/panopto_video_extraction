Hi, I'm Ken Warner.

3
00:00:17,137 --> 00:00:21,860
I'm a professor emeritus and former
dean of the School of Public Health.

4
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:25,230
I wanna talk with you about
what public health means.

5
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,530
What is public health?

6
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:32,190
And let's start by asking what the public
thinks that public health means.

7
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:35,520
When you ask the public,
you get all kinds of different answers.

8
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,474
Some of them will say it's disaster
response, the way the public

9
00:00:40,474 --> 00:00:45,354
sector responded to the tragedy
of the Twin Towers in 9/11.

10
00:00:45,354 --> 00:00:49,010
Some think it's just healthcare for
the poor.

11
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:53,450
Others think that public health is
a bunch of behavior nannies, for example,

12
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:57,210
New York city's limiting
the size of soft drinks.

13
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:02,194
Some people know public health by
a few of its specific functions,

14
00:01:02,194 --> 00:01:08,590
restaurant inspections for
cockroaches, septic tank inspections.

15
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:12,790
And a large proportion of the population
if you ask them what public health is,

16
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:17,015
their answer is, I have no idea.

17
00:01:17,015 --> 00:01:21,966
Up on the screen here you'll see here
a great definition of public health by

18
00:01:21,966 --> 00:01:26,614
a very prominent public health
physician CEA Winslow from 1920.

19
00:01:26,614 --> 00:01:30,625
I'm not going to read it to you,
but I do encourage you to read it

20
00:01:30,625 --> 00:01:34,800
because it defines the field
in all of its dimensions.

21
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,070
What I'll do is give you
a more concise definition.

22
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:43,240
Public health is the set of activities
a society undertakes to monitor and

23
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:47,440
improve the health of its
collective membership.

24
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,580
There are three distinguishing
features of public health.

25
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:54,802
First is a focus on preventing disease and
injury.

26
00:01:54,802 --> 00:02:01,910
Second, the patient is actually the entire
community, it's not an individual.

27
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:09,980
And third, the provider is society,
again, not individual professionals.

28
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:13,120
So how does public health differ
from other health professions?

29
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,690
Well, if you think about all other health
professions, medicine, nursing, dentistry,

30
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:21,770
pharmacy, social work, and so
on, they all typically involve

31
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:28,090
an individual provider providing
services to an individual patient

32
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:34,190
with an emphasis on treating a problem,
illness or disability.

33
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:38,160
So let me give you an example of
the difference between health care and

34
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:38,970
public health.

35
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:43,470
And I'll take it from
the area of dental health.

36
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:47,717
When you go to a dentist,
you're frequently being treated for

37
00:02:47,717 --> 00:02:50,400
dental caries, a cavity.

38
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,090
And that means that
an individual provider is

39
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:57,440
giving treatment services
to an individual patient.

40
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,580
In public health, the government
fluoridates the water supply,

41
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,360
meaning that every time you
drink water from the tap,

42
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:12,850
you're getting fluoridated water and
that helps to prevent dental caries.

43
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:16,050
So why is public health so important?

44
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:20,280
Well, three major institutions of
public health in the United States,

45
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,440
the National Academy of Medicine,
formerly called the Institute of Medicine,

46
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:28,960
the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, and the Public Health Service

47
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:34,090
have all studied what we would
need to do to improve our health.

48
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:36,650
And specifically,
they've looked at the issue of

49
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:42,077
what would we have to do to
avoid premature mortality.

50
00:03:42,077 --> 00:03:48,068
All three organizations concluded that
half of the possible solutions to dealing

51
00:03:48,068 --> 00:03:55,310
with premature morality involve changing
people's behaviors, their lifestyles.

52
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:59,784
Perhaps 20% involve improvements
in the environment while another

53
00:03:59,784 --> 00:04:05,290
20% involve changes in human biology,
in other words, genetics.

54
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:11,360
Interestingly, adding on to the existing
body of medical care we have at present

55
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:18,410
would contribute no more than about
10% to avoiding premature mortality.

56
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:25,011
A famous study from many years ago looked
at the 30-year gain in life expectancy

57
00:04:25,011 --> 00:04:31,437
in the United States during the 20th
century as actually done by a physician.

58
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:35,827
And the study attributed 5
years of that 30-year gain

59
00:04:35,827 --> 00:04:38,670
to an improved medical care system.

60
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:42,450
And we saw enormous improvements
in our health care system

61
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,470
through the 20th century.

62
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:50,355
But 25 years of those 30 came
from public health improvements

63
00:04:50,355 --> 00:04:55,499
in sanitation, housing,
nutrition, and job safety.

64
00:04:55,499 --> 00:05:01,885
I hope this gives you a sense why
public health is so terribly important.
