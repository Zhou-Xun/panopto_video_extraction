00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:08,820
Hi, I'm Sharon Kardia, I'm the Associate Dean of Education, and for the last seven months I've been working with our Instructional Services team,

2
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:19,740
Faculty Advisory Group, Student Advisory groups and many others to try to understand what we might do in our next iteration of the core curriculum.

3
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:27,600
We've had many different successes in our first roll out of achieving the CEPHs new 22 competencies,

4
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:38,990
but it really did seem like it was a time and a moment for us to go that next level and do something really innovative.

5
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:44,510
One of the key questions that all of us have had when we started was what are our competitors doing?

6
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:49,190
So in this particular video, I'm going to go through four of our main competitors.

7
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:54,720
And what does their core curriculum look like for their Masters of Public Health?

8
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,220
A couple of years ago,

9
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:07,110
CEPH, our accrediting body, polled all of the different programs and schools of public health to see really what they have done in that first,

10
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:12,390
I'm going to say "revision", of the core curriculum since they rolled out the key 22

11
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:17,790
foundational competencies of every MPH. And they binned all the schools and programs.

12
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:22,230
There's about one hundred and eighty some into three camps,

13
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:27,810
those programs and schools that basically stuck with the traditional way of teaching public health.

14
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:35,610
So the courses sort of followed the disciplinary tracks and looked very much like what had been the previous curriculum.

15
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:41,910
But then most of us actually moved to what they categorized as sort of 'something new'.

16
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:49,560
So there was both the disciplinary courses, but then there was also a way in which there was a stretch to develop courses,

17
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:57,930
for instance, on leadership or things that were actually very much tied to the new core competencies.

18
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:02,400
But then there was a set of schools that actually went to a 'mostly new',

19
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:09,900
pretty innovative style of teaching where additional courses, often interdisciplinary, were created.

20
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:22,720
And in many cases, they revolved around some kind of team project or some other way in which to anchor the content and the skills in application.

21
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:29,290
This is actually the breakdown of what they found for those 184 programs and schools.

22
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:34,840
So very few actually stayed with the traditional model that they had where, for instance,

23
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:43,060
there's a Biostats, an Epi, a Health Behavior or Health Education, which is where we were when we started.

24
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:47,050
You can see that the vast majority actually moved to this 'something new'.

25
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:53,260
And in the very middle of this 3x3 table, little asterisks, that's where we are.

26
00:02:53,260 --> 00:03:03,970
So we're a School of Public Health, that's that middle row. And about 55% of the schools of public health are in that 'Some new' category.

27
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:09,280
But then what you can see is that 'Mostly new' category is really done by the schools of public health.

28
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:16,710
Not so much the programs in public health. And that's where some of our competitors have moved to.

29
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:24,720
For this particular video, we're going to focus on four competitors: University of North Carolina, Columbia, Emory and the University of Washington.

30
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,130
Many of us have either worked here or learned here or have collaborators here,

31
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:39,250
so this seemed to be the right set of competitors for us to take a deeper look into and compare ourselves to.

32
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:46,840
This is an overall table that we are trying to give you the big picture of, what does the MPH look like?

33
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,520
So in the first column, total credits in their MPH and, in the parentheses,

34
00:03:51,520 --> 00:04:01,330
how many credits are assigned to the core? And then in the next column is whether or not that core is focused on interdisciplinary courses.

35
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:05,260
And then the last whether or not there are cross-cutting themes.

36
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:12,940
So if we look at UNC, they have 42 credits in their MPH, 15 have been ascribed to the core.

37
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:23,410
They are mostly courses that are interdisciplinary in nature, and they have multiple cross-cutting themes that they've integrated into this MPH core.

38
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:29,650
University of Washington has some similarities in terms of more interdisciplinary courses and cross-cutting themes,

39
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:33,640
but a much greater number of credits, both overall.

40
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:38,290
So their MPH typically is 60 plus, 62 for instance,

41
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:45,490
as the number we've been able to get from looking at their curriculum materials and 23 are associated with the core.

42
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:53,500
This is kind of a little bit of an outlier, but UW is one of our sort of key collaborative universities,

43
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:59,440
and many of our faculty are already sort of know them intimately because they either trained there or worked there.

44
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:11,920
Columbia is another one of our best competitors, and our Dean actually was taken from Columbia to lead us in our new sort of evolution as a school.

45
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:19,330
And they have the reduced number of credits - 42 for their MPH, 15 for their core credits.

46
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,970
They're using interdisciplinary courses,

47
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:30,910
and they're using cross-cutting themes to really bring across the different elements that their school really values.

48
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:36,130
Both Emory and the U of M didn't really go the interdisciplinary course route.

49
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:39,370
They didn't put in cross-cutting themes.

50
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:49,540
We differ from Emory in some of our other competitors in that we've got 60 credits in our overall MPH and 16 in our core.

51
00:05:49,540 --> 00:06:01,080
So you can see that this now gives us a little bit of an understanding as to what our more new, sort of, competitors really look like.

52
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:07,140
For those of you that are thinking what is really the difference between a disciplinary core course and an interdisciplinary core course,

53
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:14,070
we gave you a few examples here. As I had said before, disciplinary core courses are what we've been doing,

54
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:20,460
like Fundamentals of Epidemiology, Introduction to Biostatistics, Behavioral Sciences in Public Health.

55
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:25,590
But the new courses that have been developed at some of our competitors are things

56
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:31,020
that are actually focused much more on what you're trying to achieve in that class.

57
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:37,470
So, for instance, Conceptualizing Public Health Solutions, Research Methods and Applications,

58
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:43,410
or getting people to think more broadly about the Analytical Methods for Public Health.

59
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:49,670
That's basically a merging of epidemiology and biostatistics.

60
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:56,420
I mentioned earlier that one of the key things that had emerged in the 'mostly new'

61
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:03,940
schools of public health curriculum revision was this idea of cross-cutting themes.

62
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:13,390
Here we have a list of some of the cross-cutting themes that are being introduced and worked into the curriculum, worked into team projects,

63
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:23,260
things like Anti-racism and Equity, Global Perspectives, Ethics, emphasizing Evidence-based Approaches or Systems Thinking and Leadership and Teamwork.

64
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:30,100
So these are actually being taught as a part of the courses or as a part of Core.

65
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:34,150
What you can see here is UNC, Columbia and UW.

66
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:41,050
They all have major cross-cutting themes across their courses, whereas Emory and U-M we don't.

67
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:46,990
So this is another area that we have been considering and you've seen in hopefully some of our

68
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:55,660
materials that we would like to actually introduce into the core that we develop our 2.0 version of.

69
00:07:55,660 --> 00:08:06,940
Just to kind of bring it home, I put in this slide around the MPH core curriculum that we currently have. 16 credits taken over two years.

70
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:14,980
There's not a prescribed order. The order is really something that has been developed and sort of depends on

71
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:21,700
departments and how it's been integrated into the department's core curriculum.

72
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:25,810
We have some multiple offerings of Public Health 512, 511

73
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:34,120
and 516 to be able to handle this difference across departmental needs for the core curriculum.

74
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:41,140
But one of the aspects of this is that it means that the student experience of it is kind of choppy,

75
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:48,520
and sometimes they're waiting to the very last semester of their MPH to get some basics and fundamentals.

76
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:54,580
And it's one of the things that I think that we need to change as we go forward in order to create a

77
00:08:54,580 --> 00:09:02,970
unified and really kind of engaged experience for the students around the core principles of public health.

78
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:11,520
All of this work that we've done to look at our core competitors has also been on the backdrop of work we've done in focus groups,

79
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:20,520
with students talking with faculty, alumni, some of our public health professional organizations and agencies.

80
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:27,510
And we are right now at the moment where we are defining and identifying the new directions

81
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:33,390
of the future landscape of teaching and how to reach students using that information.

82
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:41,700
We really think of this core revision as a way to address some of the broader challenges that we're experiencing right now in teaching and learning.

83
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:50,490
This has been a very tough time for us and I would say all higher ed institutions over the last couple of years with the pandemic.

84
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:54,690
And so we are really looking at this core revision as a way to sort of launch us

85
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:59,400
into deeper community and to help us navigate some of the current issues

86
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:08,430
that we're seeing with students not being as engaged as we would like and faculty frankly pouring a lot of energy in and feeling kind of burned out.

87
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:13,980
So stay tuned because a lot of what we are thinking about is how do we support both?

88
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,680
How do we support students in doing their best work?

89
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:26,010
But then also, how do we support faculty in engaging and making this change-making process that we are talking about doing in the core easier?

90
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:35,480
And and I would say actually even fun. To be a little bit more concrete as to where we are actually going are four goals,

91
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:44,060
which I am hoping that you've seen in other places have been to first design student centered and anti-racist, equitable and engaging courses.

92
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:47,480
That's a tall order, but they actually all go together.

93
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:55,400
Second is to decrease the course load so that students actually can focus in on their department's disciplinary courses.

94
00:10:55,400 --> 00:11:00,290
We heard over and over again that the students are coming to be actually with you,

95
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:06,560
taking electives and basically building their dream of a public health career in their discipline.

96
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,080
They're not really invested in the core per se,

97
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:15,560
except as a way to actually create a foundation for the work that they really want to do inside of the department.

98
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:20,930
Third is that we recognize that we have an opportunity here that we've not had before.

99
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:27,290
If we create a transparent curriculum that everybody in the school can see to get better alignment between

100
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:35,400
the core courses that we develop and actually outside disciplinary courses or even courses within the corps.

101
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:42,800
So we are looking at creating this core not by sort of having every individual course stand alone in its excellence,

102
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,190
but actually creating it as a team instructional,

103
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:54,770
I'm going to say, units so that we can get all of the courses moving towards the greater goals for that semester.

104
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:59,870
And I'll tell you more as we go into more the details of what we have been building.

105
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:03,260
And then the fourth thing is that we really feel like it is time.

106
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:14,210
It's time for these core courses to be addressing real world problems and having the students work on public health products in a year long,

107
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:24,110
basically, it's Fall and Winter semester, student-driven project. So that they can actually test their knowledge and see how what we can

108
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:33,440
teach them about the fundamentals actually has great implications and application to the world's greatest problems right now.

109
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:40,310
As we have been moving forward and collecting all of this information and trying to synthesize it,

110
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:47,570
to create a vision and design a curriculum that is going to fit the needs of both students and faculty,

111
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:53,540
I hope that you'll see that we are at a particularly important and I think,

112
00:12:53,540 --> 00:13:01,070
exciting point in our evolution as a School where we can actually take this,

113
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:10,130
I'll call it tragedy of the pandemic, and build something that creates much more community for us as faculty, for the students.

114
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:18,920
And we can get a tremendous lift out of helping the world in addressing its major problems.

115
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,532
Thank you.
