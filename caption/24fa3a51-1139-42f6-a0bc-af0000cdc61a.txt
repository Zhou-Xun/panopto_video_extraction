1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:04,390
Yeah, I know.

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:14,520
I was like, I was in this thing or something, and, like, we started this stuff on the list.

3
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:27,000
Yeah. And then they were like, we couldn't get upstairs because it's like with the railing, I'll be able to go to work.

4
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:36,420
So I think it really helped, like a lot of study to currently.

5
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,950
It was such a dream next week when I get to see my dad.

6
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:51,900
Yeah, that's true. And. And the guy was like, I agreed to continue our discussion of, you know,

7
00:00:52,050 --> 00:01:00,870
so last week recharacterize the utility maximization problem that consumer faced which essentially was they have a set of preferences that

8
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:10,050
describes what they like and then a budget constraint describes what they can afford and what the trade offs are store with a relative price.

9
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:14,430
And today, we're going to take that one more step and say, well,

10
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:23,430
what happens to utility maximizing bundle if one of those economic factors changes, let's suppose your income changes, those prices change.

11
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:27,839
So we're going to start by talking about income changes and then kind of move over to price changes,

12
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,780
which end up being a little bit more complicated than income changes because we're going to see with price changes,

13
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:42,840
there's sort of two distinct factors that might go into your decision making income for this one and see how that relates to the budget constraint.

14
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:50,820
So we're basically asked sort of how the changes in income and prices change choices, in other words, change utility maximizing models.

15
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,700
And then we're in sort of and by looking at the demand curve, you say, well,

16
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,460
how does the demand curve actually relate to those utility maximizing choices that it makes?

17
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:07,800
And what we'll see is that you could actually think of that curve as being directly derived from the utility maximizing choices.

18
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:13,980
And then we're kind of as the tourist goes on, we're going to use the demand curve much more as our analytic tool.

19
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:19,829
And this will sort of tell us, well, how do we interpret that demand curve to rise in the first place?

20
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:25,950
And it goes back to these utility maximizing bundles for drawing graphs, looking for these things.

21
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:31,210
So that's kind of in a sense the importance of this consumer theory part space.

22
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:37,530
The consumer theory part is that it basically tells us when we look at a demand curve through the course,

23
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:40,410
where did that come from in the first place and what does it mean?

24
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:53,219
And so demand function depends on our it shows how the quantity of a good demand depends on those factors that we're talking about.

25
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:58,620
Really three things prices. So in our to good world price, a good Y price of two attracts both.

26
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:02,879
That influences the demand for good X. It's not just the price of good acts that matters.

27
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,390
The price of the other good also matters. My income.

28
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:14,160
And then finally, my preferences. And we're really going to talk to you about what happens if prices or income change.

29
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,870
We're going to hold preferences constant. So we're going to have the person's preferences are stable.

30
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:24,000
And what's changing is sort of their economic incentives. How much money do they have and what are the things cost?

31
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:33,080
So in general, we would expect that if any one of these factors changes, probably the person is going to move to a new utility maximizing bundle.

32
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:38,750
Their choices are going to change. It's kind of one simple exception, though.

33
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:45,980
We expect them only essentially real income and relative prices matter.

34
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,800
See what I mean by that? We'll start out with some generic budget constraints.

35
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:54,980
There's the equation that we saw last week and suppose great news.

36
00:03:55,250 --> 00:04:00,320
This person gets a raise. Their income is doubled. Horrible news.

37
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,880
The price of goods also doubled in the price of a good y is also doubled.

38
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,970
Is there any reason for this person to change their decisions to change the bundle?

39
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:19,140
No, because nothing really has changed in the world for them. They have twice as much money, but everything costs twice as much.

40
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:24,440
So what's going on right there? New budget constraints? Well, the original price of X was X.

41
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:30,660
Now it's two times whatever X was. The original price of Y was why the new price is two times p y.

42
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,170
The original income was $8. Now they have $2.

43
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:42,570
And that's pretty easy to see. I can just cancel all of those twos from that second equation and my budget constraint hasn't changed a bit.

44
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:50,299
So this is kind of the one exception to that general rule of, you know, if prices are any come change,

45
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:53,870
generally, people are going to move to a different utility maximizing bundle.

46
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,770
They have an incentive to choose something different than they chose before.

47
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:05,570
Prices or income changed, or maybe they're forced to with the company goes down, then they're not even going to be able to afford the old bundle.

48
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,990
They wouldn't want to change, but unfortunately they have to.

49
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:15,620
So one simple exception to that is a rule that sort of only real income and relative prices matter.

50
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:19,160
If real income doubles in the price of both goods, doubles,

51
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:25,639
not the relative price of one good compared to another is still the same if it used to be the case.

52
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:32,990
So I'd have to put one can of beans back on to the grocery store shelf in order to take two cans of corn down and put them in the cart.

53
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:42,559
Well, that's still true of the prices of beans and corn. Both double the relative trade off is still unchanged to what happened.

54
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:52,820
If the price of one goes up and the other will be like most of what just might have been even possible.

55
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:58,430
Sure. So we could have we could have all prices going up, but some prices going up faster than others.

56
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:04,760
Think of what happened with, say, gasoline this summer. And so what's what's really gone up for gasoline?

57
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:09,140
It's coming down now, but it went up much more dramatically than other goods.

58
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,100
But that doesn't mean other prices weren't going up too. Food prices were going up.

59
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:21,530
But, you know, whereas the price of gas doubles approximately over a period of six months or so, you know, the price of food did not double.

60
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:25,670
It might have gone up by, say, 10%. So that's not exactly can happen.

61
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:31,790
And you see that all the time, that even though right now prices in general are rising for most goods,

62
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:36,680
the rising much faster for some than others, how satisfied that is.

63
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:48,680
So you would not have a different equation. So let's say there's a price of gas as the quantity of gas.

64
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:56,230
Price of food times. The majority of food equals income.

65
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,680
And let's say my income hasn't gone up at all.

66
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:06,820
So in other words, I'm really being hit hard by this inflation as my income hasn't gone up, I keep up with higher prices at all.

67
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:15,010
So now the price of gas doubled and the price of food went up by 10%.

68
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:25,450
So there's my new budget constraint. Now I'm going to be a lot poorer, so we kind of graph this out.

69
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:34,320
So this is my original budget constraint. You've got food here and gas here.

70
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:43,210
And so how much gas am I going to be able to afford? Only half as much as I could before.

71
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:49,239
So our interpretation of the intercept is how many of you by if I spent all of my money just on that.

72
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:54,460
Good. Well, if its price doubled, whatever this intercept is, the new intercept has got to be half of that.

73
00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:01,150
This one, though, it's only going to gone down a little bit.

74
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:06,460
If I only bought food and no gas, I still can't buy as much food as before, but it's a lot closer.

75
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:15,860
So to see my budget constraint now. It's further in towards the origin as I'm clearly becoming poorer.

76
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:21,229
All prices have gone up not uniformly, but they've all gone up at least somewhat.

77
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:28,340
And my income hasn't changed. So I know that my budget constraint has to be moving towards the origin.

78
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:35,480
I'm getting poorer because of all the bundles between those two budget constraints I used to be able to afford, and now I can't afford it.

79
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:39,880
But it was also happened is that the slope has changed the slope.

80
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,920
The budget constraint reflects the relative prices we solve.

81
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:48,080
For y to put a standard formula line, we saw the slope was like negative over p y.

82
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:58,910
So this is now a steeper curve than it used to be. It's now the relative trade off between gas has become less favorable to gas.

83
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:04,570
You've got to give up more food to get another unit of gas than I used to.

84
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:09,030
We don't have to have a specific number like it was like this.

85
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:15,790
I'm just like people go down like, do you recall we could put specific numbers to it.

86
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,720
So here I just start.

87
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:23,410
It's sort of sort of generic price of gas is whatever the price of gas is, food is whatever food is, an income is whatever income is.

88
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:26,860
And I said I put specific numbers to them. The relative change.

89
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:34,870
Gas doubled. Food only went up by 10% in terms of its price for a year straight.

90
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:43,510
My income stayed the same number of dollars, so I could put real numbers to that if I wanted to give you an exact equation.

91
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:46,760
But, you know, the shape of this is going to be exactly like it is.

92
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:50,719
This kind of budget constraints got moved towards the orange and I'm poorer and

93
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,000
it's going to steepen because the relative trade off has become less favorable.

94
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:59,809
Since I've got to give up more units of food to get another unit of gas at the new

95
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:05,420
prices than I did at the old prices in the income statement skin and just that one.

96
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:09,480
So grab me one when you like.

97
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:22,160
So if only one price increased with the price decrease and that one be income statement, that means that line was on the top of the other one.

98
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:28,670
Since both prices increased, we know that the intercept has to be lower on both axes.

99
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,610
Let's keep it a move that goes up above that.

100
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:36,440
But you're.

101
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:49,110
So if your income or your income would have to rise or the price would have to go down, you know, so if the price fell, then let's just take a.

102
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:58,020
Simple example is that only one price is changing so that the price of gas falls in half.

103
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:07,269
The key. And so income is unchanged.

104
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:12,440
The price of food is unchanged. The same. They were here, but the price of gas fell in half.

105
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:19,190
Well, if I only bought food, that doesn't affect me at all. Right? I intercept.

106
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:29,220
It's still going to be the same. Over now the gas intercept would double.

107
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:36,560
So it's kind of like getting a race. We'll see those case later today in class.

108
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:41,840
I didn't literally get a raise. I got the same number of dollars in my pocket.

109
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:49,010
But because food is no more expensive and gas is cheaper, it's still kind of like getting a raise.

110
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:53,839
I'm going to be able to move to a higher indifference curve. I'm better off.

111
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:57,319
So even without adding more dollars, you become a richer person.

112
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:03,230
Because my purchasing power has gone up. I've got the same literal number of dollars, but they're worth more.

113
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:08,990
I can buy more with them. You get that kind of what you're asking?

114
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:17,990
Yeah. So let's see a change in income.

115
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:27,990
Both my initial level of income. As I won, I get a raise to somewhat higher level, i.e. to what's going to happen to my budget constraint.

116
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:33,180
I'm sure in the next graph is that, well, both intercepts are going to move out.

117
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:38,100
The prices haven't changed. The only thing in the world changes is I have more income.

118
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:44,460
I could afford more good x if all I bought was good x, I could afford more good y if all I bought was good y.

119
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:49,530
But the slope of that budget constraint hasn't changed because we haven't done anything to prices.

120
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:55,140
A slope is relative prices. If the only thing that the changes in the world is I get a raise.

121
00:12:55,710 --> 00:13:03,630
The relative prices are the same. So let's say I started out with this lower income level that resulted in this budget constraint.

122
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:08,710
I won. So I won the dollars. I get my first raise.

123
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:17,500
So you graduate, you get a job, your income goes up, the income goes up to here, and we see the slope of the budget constrains on change.

124
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:22,630
That relative tradeoff in the store between the two goods hasn't changed at all.

125
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:28,870
But clearly you can afford more bottles. So why would you stay at this old utility maximizing bundle?

126
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:36,850
You wouldn't. You'd find a new one. Now, not only did you get that first job, you did really well and you got your first promotion.

127
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:41,860
I still haven't changed, but you get another raise. Now you've got $3.

128
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:45,780
So this is just the budget constraints associated with all three again.

129
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:50,229
Now your decisions are going to change because that's where you were.

130
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:54,280
That was your utility maximizing bundle, that middle level of income.

131
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:58,720
Now you can afford more stuff. You can say, Well, I could choose an even better bundle up here.

132
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:05,710
Now, the way this graph is drawn is this person's income goes up.

133
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:10,810
They're buying more of both goods. X goes up and Y goes up.

134
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:15,130
It doesn't have to be the case. I'll show you a case where it's not true.

135
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:21,370
But if it were the case for this consumer, we would call both X and Y in normal goods.

136
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:25,930
All a normal good means that something that if my income goes up, I want more of it.

137
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:31,210
So what would be a normal good in your life? If you got a raise, what would you buy more of?

138
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:37,240
Close. Concert tickets. Concert tickets?

139
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:48,150
What else? Surely it is something you would buy if you got a raise and some and you phone.

140
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:52,440
The iPhone 14 just came out. Okay.

141
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,250
There you go. Travel. Maybe because you go on vacation.

142
00:14:57,270 --> 00:15:02,610
Okay. Square says square feet of house, bigger house or a bigger apartment.

143
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:11,300
Maybe you'd upgrade your car. Is it your Netflix subscription back after you canceled it?

144
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:16,310
So all those things would be considered normal goods to you.

145
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:21,490
If you got a raise, you would buy more of them. Do you think of anything that if you got a raise, the measure,

146
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:25,040
something that you're buying now or maybe something you bought when you were an undergrad,

147
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:29,780
and as your income goes up, you're actually buying less of it.

148
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,540
Ramen noodles. Perfect example. Okay.

149
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:42,410
Who bought ramen noodles as an undergrad? Okay. Do you buy as much ramen noodles today as you did when you were an undergrad?

150
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:51,620
When you get your first job and you get a real paycheck rather than paying tuition.

151
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:55,519
Is your dream to have more ramen noodles than you have right now?

152
00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:00,440
Is that the dream? Is that believe in the dreams. I want more ramen noodles.

153
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:05,810
How about boxed mac and cheese? And who bought who bought boxed mac and cheese as an undergrad?

154
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:10,100
That's always good. Okay, I'll keep it.

155
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:16,519
Okay. So box mac and cheese might be a normal good, but again, some of you might say, well, wait a second,

156
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:22,880
I want good mac and cheese, like with real things in a mac and cheese steak and mac and cheese.

157
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:30,020
Okay. So a lot of things we think are sort of normal goods. If we got a raise, we'd imagine we would buy more of them, but not everything.

158
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:37,190
There are some things that, you know, if we we buy them because they're staples that we can afford on a low income,

159
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:44,140
we ramen noodles and boxed mac and cheese is a great way of getting a lot of calories per dollar spent.

160
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:53,559
It could be a certain amount of calories to get my. However, given the choice, you're probably right.

161
00:16:53,560 --> 00:17:05,660
There are other forms of calories you might prefer. We kind of further divide normal goods into two categories.

162
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:12,499
And I want I don't want you to take these sort of words too seriously because they're really just technical definitions.

163
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:21,650
And the words obviously have a lot of everyday baggage. So a luxury just means a good where consumption rises at a faster rate than your income rises.

164
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:25,340
And necessity is a good word. It's a normal good.

165
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:31,639
Still, you buy more of that as you get richer, but it goes up at a slower rate than your income goes up.

166
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,400
So think of it as what share of your budget will it take up?

167
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:41,390
A luxury is going to take up a greater share of your budget as you got richer, and a necessity is going to take up a lower share of your budget.

168
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:46,130
So think of some goods that might be like that for you.

169
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:50,220
If you got a raise, what would you buy? Sort of a lot more of those.

170
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,380
For example, if your income doubled, you would more than double your consumption of this good.

171
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:59,390
So proportionately, it's going it's going up faster than your income is going up.

172
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:10,910
Any particular kind of food? Restaurant, shrimp, lobster, salmon, if you like seafood steak.

173
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:20,290
If you're a vegan or vegetarian, maybe some wild mushrooms or something like that.

174
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:27,819
Look at them now and say they're asking how much you pound for those. No thanks, but they sure are good if you're a rich guy.

175
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:32,810
More of them. What about something that would be kind of a necessity?

176
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:37,309
Yeah, you'd buy more of it, but it really wouldn't keep up with your income before income doubled.

177
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:41,360
You wouldn't double your consumption. That's a guess.

178
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:48,440
That's probably a great example for a lot of people that, you know, if my income doubled,

179
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:55,879
it really wouldn't change my commute to work very much unless I move out to a much bigger place that way farther from campus.

180
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:01,490
But I probably wouldn't do that. Yeah, bills that phone bills.

181
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:07,820
Phone bills, you know, so you might upgrade something or get a, you know, upgrade something in your plan,

182
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:11,270
but it's not going to like double your cost of your phone bill if your income doubled.

183
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:17,989
So if I think of something like food in general, so we talk about specific types of food.

184
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:24,170
Yeah, I buy, you know, less ramen noodles. I buy maybe more lettuce, but not proportionately more.

185
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:31,400
I wouldn't double my lettuce consumption and I'd buy more than double as much shrimp and lobster if my income doubled.

186
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:37,610
So you've got some food products are inferior, some are necessities, some are luxuries.

187
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:47,380
I think some of our food in general. So if they get specific things through, people's food budgets tend to double if their income doubles.

188
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:59,249
I think so, yeah. What about switching from two organic vegetables that were higher in the organic vegetables?

189
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:04,440
And probably if you think of that sort of as a different good, I can buy organic carrots or not conventionally grown.

190
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:09,209
I get a raise in my income. There probably is probably a necessity, probably more than a luxury,

191
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:13,730
probably more than double your organic social consumption of your income doubled, right?

192
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:25,430
I was thinking about it in the way of once you get like a raise in your income, you would switch from regular vegetables to organic vegetables.

193
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:32,389
So you might switch so that regular vegetables would be inferior, organic vegetables would be normal,

194
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:35,690
and they'd probably be in the luxury category, probably more than double.

195
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:43,760
Yeah, it's a regular thing. I was to go at zero from one to access organic carrots and want to access conventionally grown carrots.

196
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:50,000
Conventionally grown carrots would be an inferior good. An organic carrots would be a normal juice.

197
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:59,720
So for food as a whole, people tend to consume more as they get richer, but not proportionately more.

198
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:05,520
And so if my income doubled, I wouldn't probably be twice as much food.

199
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:14,310
And so here's just one example with an inferior good look.

200
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:18,270
I showed up around noodles here instead of Kraft macaroni and cheese because apparently.

201
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:23,790
But again, these are my preferences, not yours.

202
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:29,630
You don't have to agree. And we see that as I get richer, I'm buying a lot more shrimp.

203
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:38,220
I'm going way up on the shrimp axis as my budget goes up. But I'm actually kind of coming down a little bit on the Kraft mac and cheese axis.

204
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:44,459
It's not very strongly the way this is drawn, but still I get buy a little less Kraft, mac and cheese and a lot more shrimp.

205
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:50,480
I think we only have two goods in the world like in this graph.

206
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:53,580
Is it possible for both of them to be inferior?

207
00:21:55,410 --> 00:22:03,080
Mac to second. That kind of doesn't make sense for both to be inferior because.

208
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:09,280
That says if I get richer, I buy less of everything. So if there's only two goods in the world.

209
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:13,000
There is the world. Or is there 100 goods in the world? All hundred can't be a theory.

210
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:18,009
There has to be a normal good in the world. Know for your preference,

211
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:24,309
because if if we believe the pay principle is one of the sort of guiding assumptions

212
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:28,420
about preferences and we're working with preferences to satisfy those assumptions,

213
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:34,510
there has to be a normal good. If everything were inferior, that would imply that if you got richer, you'd buy less of everything.

214
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:40,150
And that kind of seems to go against that principle assumption.

215
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:46,330
So it has to be at least one kind of good in the world. What a change.

216
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:51,130
And can't change the shape of the indifference curve or would they remain parallel?

217
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:58,360
Okay, great question. Income and prices have nothing to do with the shape of the indifference curves.

218
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:04,600
The shape of the indifference curves have nothing to do with income and prices. And I was thinking these two separate domains, I have my preferences.

219
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:13,030
If you are back in the first class, we defined everything about preferences before we even mentioned prices and income or to a budget constraint.

220
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:21,399
So my preferences are there and then they interact with my budget constraint with

221
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:26,170
income and prices to say among the things that I can actually afford at the store,

222
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,720
what combination do I like the best?

223
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:37,600
So think of them as sort of separate domains that are interacting and preferences existed independent of discussing prices and income.

224
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:43,180
I could sit and I could I could do that very simply. I could say, I'm going to give you a choice.

225
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:49,300
Do you like this bundle of this bundle? Which one do you like better? I'm not charging you for either giving you that.

226
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:56,680
Which one do you pick? You only have one and you'll be able to look at that and hopefully say, I want the bundle in my in your left hand.

227
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:00,639
I want the bundle in right hand or I like some equally. Well, give me either one.

228
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,750
I don't care. They're different bundles, but they generate the same happiness to me.

229
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:13,210
So you can say that independent of me charging you a price or take or telling you what your income is, I just say there is a gift.

230
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:19,330
You have a choice, which one you like. So it had nothing to do with prices or income and you could make that choice.

231
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:24,910
So the indifference curve is really just a representation of your preferences of what you like,

232
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,859
and then the interaction of that with the budget constraint and tells you, well,

233
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:35,170
among the things you can actually afford which bundle you like best services.

234
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:41,170
So great question. I'm glad you asked that. And all this comes up.

235
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:51,520
Okay. So suppose that initially I've got the lower income represented by the lower of those two budget constraints and my choices bundle a.

236
00:24:53,920 --> 00:25:03,639
And then I get a raise. So if X is inferior, what that implies is of a higher income.

237
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:07,660
I should buy less than I originally label. That's what I originally bought x1.

238
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:13,960
So I pick a bundle like C has to be somewhere on this part of the budget constraint.

239
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:22,629
On the other hand, if X were normal, I'd say, well, which of these new bundles B or C is consistent with X being a normal good and say,

240
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:27,370
well, it has to be bundle D because bundle B as more of X that I originally had.

241
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:36,669
So if I asked you sort of, well, assume X is inferior, could only or bundle C possibly be that utility maximizing bundle and say,

242
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:40,600
well, if it's inferior, it has to be bundle C because that's the only one of those two.

243
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:46,210
If has less good X that originally had I said assume x is normal,

244
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:52,180
which of those two bundles on the higher budget constraint could possibly be the new utility maximizing bundle?

245
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:55,599
So I don't I haven't given you enough information since exactly.

246
00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:03,399
D But you know, it can't be C So if it's simply about the same B or C, that's the bundle that has more good X,

247
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:09,430
that original I'm going to think of as a sort of dividing line between X being inferior, X being normal.

248
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,500
I'm a little confused between just the terminology. So in one point you use inferior.

249
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:18,910
Is that the same as necessity?

250
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:23,220
No. So because normal goods are either luxury or necessity, but.

251
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:28,520
Right. So it's not that what makes it inferior, I guess it's.

252
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:44,970
And so my income goes up. If that implies that I say increase the consumption of products, that is normal.

253
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:56,640
If that were to imply that I would decrease the consumption of goods that would be inferior,

254
00:26:57,810 --> 00:27:02,280
and then normal goods can be further divided into necessities and luxuries.

255
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,940
So there is for both the necessity and a luxury.

256
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:11,340
Consumption goes up with income. But for a luxury, it goes up more than proportionately.

257
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:15,570
So if I got a 10% raise, I buy 15% more of that.

258
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:19,680
Good for necessity. It goes up less then proportionately for a 10% raise.

259
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:26,370
I buy, say 5% more of that good. But I'm still buying more inferior means I'm literally buying less, so my income goes up.

260
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:31,950
Got it. Thank you. And that's actually going to be right there.

261
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:38,760
It's the perfect segue way to the income elasticity of demand for the fact that you are not.

262
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:47,510
Thank. This is going to be the first elasticity that we defined.

263
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:51,830
It's going to be a concept that we're going to use over and over again in various contexts.

264
00:27:52,610 --> 00:28:00,439
And elasticity is just a calculation of how responsive a choice is to a change in some

265
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:07,760
variable and is put it in proportion of terms or percentage terms rather than absolute terms.

266
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:18,930
And that's going to allow us to actually get a mathematical definition of normal and subdivisions in a society in luxury or inferior.

267
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:24,020
Okay, let's just take a simple example.

268
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:43,140
Suppose my initial income is $100 and my initial consumption.

269
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:54,010
Good access, ten units and I get a 10% raise.

270
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:57,070
So my new income is 110.

271
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:03,700
And in response to that, I change my consumption of good acts to 12 units.

272
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:13,580
So it's kind of looking at those numbers as inferior or normal. It has to be normal because my income went off and my consumption went up.

273
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:19,030
That's the definition of a normal good. And now just kind of eyeballing that, do you think access is a luxury or necessity?

274
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:23,690
We know it's normal, it's not inferior, but it could still be a luxury or it could be a necessity.

275
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:27,769
It went up more than 10%. So it's a it's a luxury.

276
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:33,170
It's a luxury. Right. Because when I see all my income went up 10% by consumption of X went up 20%.

277
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:41,330
So that's calculate the income elasticity of demand. So it's a change in quantity demanded divided by the original quantity.

278
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:47,900
And that's really just the proportion of change divided by the change in income, divided by the original income.

279
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:51,680
So you can just write down a simple equation.

280
00:29:55,790 --> 00:30:00,540
You knew minus Q old divided by Q Old must be.

281
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:06,350
That's my proportion of change and consumption. Divided by income.

282
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:10,040
You? I think I'm old.

283
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:17,340
Divided by the old income by proportion of change in income. So get some plug in these numbers.

284
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:23,760
And what's the new quantity? That's 12, 12 minus ten.

285
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:37,210
Divided by ten uncovers 110 minus the old income of 100 divided by the old income of 100.

286
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:44,300
So now I'm just kind of plugging in the numbers to get to this formula change in quantity demanded divided by quantity.

287
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:53,020
So that's the there's the change divided by where I started, change in income, divided by where I started.

288
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:57,730
But what's 7.2? Two divided by ten?

289
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:06,660
That's point one. So the income elasticity of demand is two.

290
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:15,520
So exactly as you predicted, it's a luxury. Good. So we're defining luxuries as those that have an income elasticity of demand of greater than one.

291
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:22,900
And what that implies, as my income goes up by a certain percentage I consumption is going to go up by even more than that percentage.

292
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:29,030
So this is going to end up taking up a bigger share of my budget the richer I am.

293
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:41,800
Had this been, say, 10.5 rather than 12, it would still be a normal good.

294
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:48,090
But now it'd be a necessity to change that to 10.5.

295
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:07,910
.05 divided by 21. So the income elasticity of demand to be positive 0.5 still a normal good because it's positive excessive.

296
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:12,340
But now it's a necessity. It went up, but it did.

297
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:17,810
It's not keeping up with my income. It's not keeping pace. I got a big raise and I'm only buying a little bit more of this.

298
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,859
It's still normal because I'm buying more, but it's the necessities.

299
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:27,290
I'm just buying a little bit more proportionately to my friends, this actually been.

300
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:41,110
Here it is. What would that look like? So we can eyeball that and say, I must be inferior, I got richer, I'm buying less of it.

301
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:51,460
So let's plug that into the equation. Since nine minus ten divided by ten.

302
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:59,760
Negative point one divided by 0.1.

303
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:05,380
And we have an income elasticity of demand of negative one.

304
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:15,500
You know, that gives us sort of a clear way of defining sort of inferior, normal and luxury normal goods, positive income elasticity of demand.

305
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:20,389
But then we can further subdivided them into luxuries in income elasticity,

306
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:25,910
demand of greater than one necessities and then call last history of demand that's positive.

307
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:28,040
So it's still normal, but it's less than one.

308
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:35,089
And then finally, inferior goods, those that have a negative income elasticity and question without doing math,

309
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:38,270
are we supposed to assume that like if your consumption of something goes up,

310
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:44,150
it's a luxury and then anything less than that is necessary or an inferior inferior good.

311
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:52,020
So if it's a 10% income increase, so so it's proportionate to income.

312
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:58,950
So if I had a 50% income increase or something, it would be a luxury consumption to go up by more than 50%.

313
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,860
So it's always proportionate. Okay.

314
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:11,880
And one thing that's nice about being proportionate is, does it matter what units we're measuring income in dollars or euros or pesos?

315
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:18,180
You know, so I get a 10% raise. So who cares what financial unit I'm using?

316
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:24,780
Does it matter what unit, which financial year I'm measuring price in? Price in dollars, place price in euros, price and pesos.

317
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:26,940
And doesn't matter as we're just kind of saying, well,

318
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:36,150
how much does proportional is price change if we are doing a price elasticity of demand like we will later.

319
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:45,840
Yeah. So does this is there's is there an assumption here that the price of the good is not doesn't change?

320
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:52,830
It's the same before and after your income, right? The income elasticity of demand or changing income or holding everything else constant.

321
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:57,059
So my preferences are what my preferences are or the price of goods is what it is.

322
00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:00,090
The price of a Y is what it is. None of those three things are changing.

323
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,860
So all this is unless we tell you otherwise, we're all just changing one factor at a time.

324
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:10,440
So in this case, they're saying, hey, you got to raise the whole rest of the world is unchanged.

325
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:16,650
The fact that you got to raise didn't make cars more expensive. It didn't make apartments more expensive.

326
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:21,510
It just meant that you've got more money to spend at the given prices.

327
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:24,989
You probably wouldn't have a reason to inherently change your preferences.

328
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:30,720
We're assuming it kind of like we didn't sponsor your preferences sort of exist, you know what you like.

329
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:36,270
And getting a raise isn't going to suddenly make you say, Well, I used to like this, but now I like that.

330
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:40,320
So we're kind of assuming all those things are unchanged except the income.

331
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:47,100
So we're trying to see sort of a stimulus response sort of thing. The stimulus says you got a raise in the responses.

332
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:52,110
How do you change your quantity? And it doesn't make sense to.

333
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:58,270
Finally, can a good be inferior at all income levels?

334
00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:00,430
That's sort of logically makes sense.

335
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:10,900
Yeah, because if your income were to decrease, of course, I think you would find more of that good as opposed to the normal.

336
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:16,540
So imagine you had literally no income by definition.

337
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:21,220
How much could you buy? Zero. So if it's a good did you ever buy?

338
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:25,990
So if you would never, ever buy ramen at any income whatsoever.

339
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:33,469
We kind of ignore that case, but if you ever buy ramen, so by definition, if you had no income, you could buy no ramen.

340
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:36,650
And if you have a low a very low income, you buy some ramen.

341
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:42,890
So over that income change. It had to have been a normal good because you went from zero to positive.

342
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:48,560
So in other words, the income elasticity of demand can change as your income changes.

343
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:53,030
If you're a very, very, very, very poor ramen is a normal good.

344
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:54,890
If you got a raise, you'd buy more ramen.

345
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:01,940
But then once their income gets above a certain level, you say, Well, wait a second, now, I've got enough income.

346
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:07,429
I don't need to rely just on ramen for calories I can choose.

347
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:10,480
Other things have more variety in my diet, healthier foods here.

348
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:18,320
Look at the sodium content from around the package. You know, it's like on ramen package, just like a month's worth of sodium.

349
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:22,670
It's ridiculous, you know?

350
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:28,580
So if you ever buy ramen, it must have been a normal good, at least at very low income levels.

351
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:36,790
It's kind of by definition, if you had no income, you couldn't buy any. If you had a low income, you're buying positive amount.

352
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:43,240
So the income elasticity around again, it depends on it may be different when your income is going from 10000 to 20000,

353
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:46,000
then if it's going from 100000 to 200000.

354
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:55,950
So it's nothing sort of inherent about the you know, if we estimate your income elasticity of demand at a particular change in income,

355
00:37:56,340 --> 00:38:00,990
that doesn't mean it has to stay exactly that for every possible change in income you could ever have.

356
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:08,100
That makes sense. So I don't have I'm not sure how that answers the question.

357
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:15,270
Can it be true at all? If you ever if you ever buy any of the good, it can't be inferior at all, at all income levels.

358
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:21,280
If there's ever if there's ever an income level where you buy a positive amount of that good.

359
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:25,530
Right now, by definition, if your income was zero, you couldn't buy any.

360
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:32,379
So it would have to be if you ever buy any of it. There's got to be at least some range of income where consumption rises with income.

361
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:43,570
In other words, it's a normal good. Oh, yeah. It changes in price.

362
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:50,650
It will see a slightly different. We're now in this world to see my income.

363
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:57,370
So what in this example, I income didn't change. The price of food didn't change, but the price of gas changed.

364
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,610
So it's a little bit more complicated.

365
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:07,780
We with an income change, we just had a parallel shift of the budget constraints on the slope of the budget constrains relative prices.

366
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:13,810
So if the only thing that's changing is your income, the budget constraint was just bouncing around parallel.

367
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:23,530
You know, I start here, I get a raise under shifting out parallel to here I get another ratio of self parallel to here versus the price change.

368
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:32,670
What we're getting is a pivot for. We started out with this budget constraint and then the price of gas fell in half.

369
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:39,600
And what it did is at this point didn't change at all because nothing that affects the

370
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:43,410
food industry changed or got the same number of dollars in the price of food is the same.

371
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:51,990
Then the budget constraint pivots against flatter the price of gas getting cheaper means that now used to only be able to buy that much gas.

372
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:55,650
If I hypothetically spent all of my money on gas, I can buy double.

373
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:02,520
So we get a change in the slope. But is this person getting richer as well?

374
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:12,630
He he does benefit nobility by not playing politics with one of.

375
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:21,210
And all those bundles that I just shaded were unaffordable.

376
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:25,840
At the original price level, and they're suddenly now affordable.

377
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:34,840
So unless this person literally only buys food and doesn't buy gas, in that case, the price of gas is utterly irrelevant to them.

378
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:42,489
But as long as they are somebody who actually buys some food and some gas and say, Oh,

379
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:53,500
wait a second, now I can afford all kinds of bundles that I like better than the original one.

380
00:40:55,700 --> 00:41:01,820
And are now on or below you budget constraint for.

381
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:06,760
We're after the utility maximizing bundle. We serve our regular sources.

382
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:12,010
If you can find this sort of len shaped area of bundles that says, well,

383
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:22,299
this can't possibly still be the utility maximizing bundle because any bundle in that pink lens shaped area shares two properties.

384
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:25,820
I like it better than the original bundle and now I can afford it.

385
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,520
So I'm going to move somewhere out here.

386
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:37,630
So my utility maximizing bundle is definitely going to change.

387
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:44,380
So when a price changes, it doesn't just change the relative trade off of the two goods in the shopping cart.

388
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:51,390
It also changes the person's real level of income, their purchasing power changes, the price goes down.

389
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,660
It's kind of like getting a raise.

390
00:41:54,830 --> 00:42:01,670
But it's literally it's different than a literal race because the trade off also changes the slope of the budget constraint changes.

391
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:06,080
But I got a literal raise and nothing else happened in that parallel shift.

392
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:10,120
So whatever the relative trade off was is still the same. Yeah.

393
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:17,260
I'm just curious, does the new coins have to be vertically parallel with the old models?

394
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:25,640
I think I could have drawn as an agency sort of anywhere along here that depends on the person's preferences.

395
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:35,340
So instead of that parallel shift, where we get is this pivot.

396
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:42,120
So this graph is kind of the same as is that one where I've got a decrease in the price of the good on the x axis.

397
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:45,540
So the budget constraints sort of starts out relatively steep.

398
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:55,040
Price of X goes down or the slope is negative X over Y, the price of X goes down, the slope is getting flatter.

399
00:42:56,030 --> 00:43:02,300
So that trade off is changing. Now we got a bunch of kind of garbage on this axis.

400
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:07,040
This ends up being a relatively complicated graph, and you're not going to really have to worry about that.

401
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:11,509
We're just going to get the intuition of what's going on with this.

402
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:19,999
Really, it's kind of trying to do is sort of subdivide how much of the change in demand for good X was due to the person facing a different

403
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:26,360
relative trade off that the slope is different and how much of it is from the fact that they're effectively getting richer,

404
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:34,910
their purchasing power is going up. So it's trying to sort of subdivide those two different forces that might change the person's consumption.

405
00:43:35,450 --> 00:43:39,620
When income change, there was only one force. I became richer or I became poorer.

406
00:43:40,010 --> 00:43:43,370
My income changed. But the relative trade off didn't change.

407
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:47,120
The relative prices were exactly the same. So it was easier.

408
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:50,779
It was there was only sort of one thing going on, which is about price changes.

409
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:53,870
You kind of have two things going on that relative trade off in the shopping

410
00:43:53,870 --> 00:43:59,420
cart changes used to be that let's say the slope was negative one originally.

411
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:04,700
It's about what it looks like. So that says as if I put a unit of y back up on the shelf.

412
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:08,060
I could take one unit of X off the shelf and put it in the cart.

413
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:14,179
Now the relative trade off is change. If I put a unit of y back on the shelf,

414
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:20,989
I can now take two units of X off the shelf and put them in the cart so the relative trade off

415
00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:28,600
is changed and I'm effectively richer for the reason that we saw over there for that long.

416
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:33,500
We saw the price of the second half on one of the right.

417
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:40,880
So if we go back and what good would the people be like, that can't be seen.

418
00:44:41,450 --> 00:44:49,640
So that's a good question because half of both goods, it's exactly equivalent to your income doubling and the relative price is not changing.

419
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:13,040
And so the price of gas is half of where it started.

420
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:18,740
Price of food is half of where started by income is the same. So originally, maybe I was.

421
00:45:22,270 --> 00:45:26,650
Yeah. Well, what happens if the price of food falls in half? Well, it's going to double the food and or such.

422
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:32,350
What happens to the price of gas falls in half? Well, it's going to double the gas intercept.

423
00:45:35,110 --> 00:45:40,030
That's soon to be perfectly parallel to the original budget constraints.

424
00:45:40,390 --> 00:45:45,850
Why? Because a slope is the relative price as well. The relative prices didn't change if they both fell in half.

425
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:53,170
Then the ratio of the price of food to the price of gas is exactly the same as it was.

426
00:45:53,950 --> 00:46:06,610
So this is the exact equivalent. If I had said we would increase double, you know, exactly.

427
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:18,069
Those two are exactly equivalent. The price of everything falling by the exact same proportion is the exact equivalent of getting a raise.

428
00:46:18,070 --> 00:46:22,300
And it's going to be a parallel shift in the budget constraint. So we're back to the easy world.

429
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:31,299
Relative prices haven't changed. There's no change in my trade off the number of cans of good that good y that I have

430
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:34,920
to put back on the shelf in order to take another can of goods off the shelves.

431
00:46:34,930 --> 00:46:38,830
Exactly the same as it used to be. But I can afford twice as many cans.

432
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:44,610
So said, this is the functional equivalent of an income change.

433
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:51,930
He said the relative prices are unchanged. This is going to be these curves are going to be budget constraints in parallel to each other.

434
00:46:52,230 --> 00:47:01,440
Thank you. So we're back in the easy world. So let's try to understand the intuition in a price change.

435
00:47:02,850 --> 00:47:09,630
We've got both of those factors by purchasing power has changed that become richer or poorer.

436
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:15,390
Two things prices have gone up or down, and the relative trade off between the two goods has changed.

437
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:24,620
We call the response to the relative trade off changing the substitution effect.

438
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:31,969
So a change in the slope of the budget constraint is going to cause the consumer to shift towards the

439
00:47:31,970 --> 00:47:37,250
goods that's become relatively cheap in a way from the grid that's become relatively more expensive.

440
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:47,540
So in this case, if the price of gas fell in half relative to food, that force and that force alone would say, you know what,

441
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:51,139
you ought to shift your consumption a little bit away from food towards gas,

442
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:55,520
because gas has become relatively cheap, therefore, food has become relatively more expensive.

443
00:47:57,050 --> 00:48:03,980
But that's not the end of the story. There's also the income effect when the price of gas fell, if that makes me richer.

444
00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:10,550
And let's say that food and gas are both normal goods. If I become richer, I know I want more of a normal good.

445
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:17,160
Saying say one of those was their inferior good. Well, then want less of it. One of the Cambridgeshire.

446
00:48:18,830 --> 00:48:23,750
So I've got these sort of two factors potentially changing my utility, maximizing bundles.

447
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:27,110
With the change in income, there is only one of these. I became richer.

448
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:32,900
There was no substitution effect because the relative prices of two goods that were unchanged.

449
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:42,260
But when prices change, I've got that relative trade off at the grocery store and my shopping cart changes and

450
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:46,010
I've become richer if the price has gone down or I'm poorer if a price has gone up.

451
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:51,730
So I've got sort of two separate things going on.

452
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:55,300
So if you go back to this graph, you kind of think of, well,

453
00:48:56,020 --> 00:49:00,520
I've kind of substituted maybe a long in indifference curve curves kind of a way of thinking about that.

454
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:07,100
But I'm also able to move to a higher indifference curve because I'm becoming richer.

455
00:49:09,130 --> 00:49:16,100
That sort of movement, kind of like along the indifference curve towards the good that's become relatively cheap as being the substitution,

456
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:20,870
the response to the fact that the relative prices have changed.

457
00:49:21,230 --> 00:49:27,170
And then that movement to a higher indifference curve altogether as the income effect, that price gets cheaper.

458
00:49:27,410 --> 00:49:30,739
I become a richer person. I real purchasing power.

459
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:34,040
The value of my dollars goes up. So it's kind of like getting a raise.

460
00:49:42,990 --> 00:49:47,190
So if we have what we call standard indifference curves, what are standard indifference curves?

461
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:56,180
If I see that, what is that shortening for? I say assume standard preferences or assume indifference curves have the standard shape.

462
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:02,000
Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. The curves flatter, the steeper.

463
00:50:02,630 --> 00:50:12,350
So anytime I say standard preferences or assume standard indifference curves, all I'm talking about is that steeper to flatter.

464
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:20,709
The Pizza and Coke example. So diminishing marginal utility of those goods so that I willingness to trade

465
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:24,070
off between the two is very different here than it would be in this final.

466
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:32,960
So with standard indifference curves, the person is always going to move or is going to substitute towards the good that's become relatively cheap.

467
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:46,700
In terms of the income effect, it depends whether the good is inferior or normal and whether prices went up or went down if prices went up.

468
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:51,740
I've become poorer, so I consume less normal goods when I'm poor.

469
00:50:53,210 --> 00:50:57,860
Flipside Normal goods says, Well, I buy more if I get rich, or conversely, I buy less if I didn't work.

470
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:02,960
It says that the direction of consumption change is the same as the direction of the income change.

471
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:07,260
Inferior in the direction of consumption. Change goes in the opposite direction.

472
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:12,620
If I get rich or I buy less, and conversely, if I get poorer, I'm going to buy more of an inferior glass.

473
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:21,550
If you get poorer, you buy more ramen noodles, you're going to go back to the store and say, Well, I kind of gave up ramen noodles for a while.

474
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:26,000
Well, I'm back for a while.

475
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:27,050
Hopefully not forever.

476
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:42,510
So one final sort of price concept and then we'll talk about kind of how we get to the demand curve from utility maximizing choices.

477
00:51:44,190 --> 00:51:53,790
So if we looked at. This graph, we could say, well, not only is the price a good exchange is, not only is the quantity of exchange.

478
00:51:53,790 --> 00:52:01,460
And we started. Here we end here with the quantity of y is also changing.

479
00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:07,520
So we can also look at what we call cross price effects the price of one good changes.

480
00:52:08,570 --> 00:52:18,650
How does the demand for the other goods change? Else was expressed.

481
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:30,440
So here, let's take look at A and C. B is sort of that where we're using this graph to try to divide between the income and substitution effect.

482
00:52:31,210 --> 00:52:34,910
You don't have to worry about it. Tell our intuition that when our price changes.

483
00:52:35,330 --> 00:52:40,190
There's sort of two distinct forces affecting how you would change your consumption.

484
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:44,540
The fact of that relative trade off between the two goods in the shopping cart has changed.

485
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:49,280
Substitution effect in the fact that your purchasing power has changed.

486
00:52:49,310 --> 00:52:57,110
That's going to be the income effect. So it is focused kind of you're on A and C, A is kind of original bundle and C is the new model.

487
00:52:58,250 --> 00:53:09,290
And we see that good X has gotten cheaper. We have a decrease in the price of goods x.

488
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:18,120
Not surprisingly, if we look at good UX.

489
00:53:23,290 --> 00:53:28,390
We get an increase in the quantity of x. X gets cheaper. We buy more of it the whole way for us to.

490
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:39,700
Here is what's happening to the quantity of good. Why? See the date which the price of good acts results in a small.

491
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:50,590
Decrease in the quantity of good. Why? So in this case, we're going to call X and Y substitutes.

492
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:54,650
Think of them as things you consume instead of each other.

493
00:53:54,670 --> 00:54:02,470
So if you want to have a clear example at the moment, so if X gets cheaper, you're going to buy more X, but you're going to buy less good Y.

494
00:54:02,950 --> 00:54:08,200
We could have also drawn this sword in the opposite direction that if X got cheaper you would buy more good Y.

495
00:54:09,070 --> 00:54:12,160
If that were the case, we would call them complements and we'll see in a moment.

496
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:17,860
Why can't you buy the same amount of Y and still get more x?

497
00:54:18,310 --> 00:54:32,400
You can't because it's still on that different screen. So if this tangent C had been exactly here right then that would be that would be the case.

498
00:54:32,410 --> 00:54:39,790
So basically, if the you know where I drew it, you're buying less good y I could have drawn it up here.

499
00:54:40,570 --> 00:54:44,080
So some people might respond by saying, you know what, I'm going to buy more of it.

500
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:47,410
I'm going to buy more good X and more good Y. We're going to get it cheaper.

501
00:54:47,830 --> 00:54:53,320
Somebody else might draw exactly where you were suggesting and say, Well, I'm going to buy more good X and I keep the same amount of good Y.

502
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:59,490
So all those scenarios are possible and it's going to depend on preferences between those two goods.

503
00:55:00,990 --> 00:55:02,980
And I think this may tell me a little bit more clear.

504
00:55:04,450 --> 00:55:11,530
Can we call X and Y complements if a decrease in the price of one causes an increase in the consumption of the other?

505
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:18,720
So think about coffee. I mean, if you have cream with your coffee.

506
00:55:21,030 --> 00:55:25,200
So to you, you define a cup of coffee, not as a black cup of coffee.

507
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:30,420
You define a cup of coffee as a black cup of coffee to which you've added and stirred some cream.

508
00:55:31,710 --> 00:55:37,930
So if the price of coffee went down and that caused you to buy more coffee, would it also cause you to buy more cream?

509
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:43,050
Because those are things you consume together. They're complements to you.

510
00:55:44,490 --> 00:55:51,920
You know, when you go to cereal aisle at the grocery store, why do they have bananas in the cereal aisle instead of just keeping them in produce?

511
00:55:52,070 --> 00:55:58,580
They have bananas and produce, but they also have bananas in the cereal aisle like eight miles away from all the rest of the produce in the store,

512
00:55:59,510 --> 00:56:07,520
because those things are complements. A lot of people put slice of banana on their cereal, so the grocery store is cleverly thought out.

513
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:11,090
Well, if you forgot to pick up your bananas when you walk through the produce aisle.

514
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:16,980
But now you're buying your cereal. You might remember. Hey, I need some bananas to.

515
00:56:19,150 --> 00:56:26,709
That's why there's produce in the cereal aisle because it complements this X and Y would be

516
00:56:26,710 --> 00:56:31,790
substitutes if a decrease in the price of one of them caused you to buy less of the other.

517
00:56:31,990 --> 00:56:35,740
Or conversely, if an increase in the price of one caused you to buy more of the other.

518
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:41,200
So the relative directions of matter. Suppose you like both coffee and tea?

519
00:56:41,210 --> 00:56:51,340
Who drinks both coffee and tea at times? So if the price of coffee went up, you might buy less coffee, but you might buy more tea.

520
00:56:52,570 --> 00:56:56,590
So those are things you tend to consume instead of each other. You probably.

521
00:56:57,070 --> 00:57:00,640
How many? If you had both a cup of coffee and a cup of tea with your breakfast this morning.

522
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:08,860
I fear of you, which is perfectly valid preferences.

523
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:17,590
Not my preferences, but yours. So most of us are going to consume coffee or tea with breakfast, not coffee and tea.

524
00:57:19,170 --> 00:57:24,090
So for those, if coffee became more expensive, I would substitute away from coffee.

525
00:57:24,090 --> 00:57:27,419
Towards tea. Say, well, coffee's more expensive.

526
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:34,440
I'm going to have more tea. If coffee became more expensive, I would buy less cream.

527
00:57:34,470 --> 00:57:41,250
The fact that I'm buying less coffee and having less cups of coffee and more tea unless I know some people have cream in their teeth.

528
00:57:43,550 --> 00:57:49,490
Whereas cream in their teeth. In one fewer sort of sun.

529
00:57:49,490 --> 00:57:53,270
But let's say you're something physical. I put cream in my coffee.

530
00:57:53,270 --> 00:58:01,700
I don't put pretty much. So if the price of coffee went up for me, I would buy less coffee and therefore less cream.

531
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:05,990
The complement to coffee and therefore more tea. The substitute for coffee.

532
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:14,799
So it makes sense how we're dividing goods based on how the demand for one good responds to a

533
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:21,250
change in the price of the other good goods bananas be a complement and a substitute for cereal.

534
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:28,090
The price of cereal goes down. You buy more bananas to put in it, but if it goes up so much, you replace it altogether with bananas.

535
00:58:30,730 --> 00:58:33,340
And it depends how your preference preferences change.

536
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:40,240
I guess you can't rule that out, but if you you know, if you're going to have a banana instead of cereal,

537
00:58:41,710 --> 00:58:49,090
so maybe in certain price ranges of cereal became a little bit more expensive, you'd buy less bananas, which became a lot more expensive.

538
00:58:49,090 --> 00:58:58,590
You might say, you know, I'm just going to have bananas for breakfast. Very unusual, but I guess you can't rule it out for different price changes.

539
00:58:58,830 --> 00:59:03,210
It's kind of like the incumbent question can goods be inferior at all income levels?

540
00:59:03,630 --> 00:59:08,910
It can change, you know, at some price levels. It might be one thing at other price levels and another.

541
00:59:09,690 --> 00:59:19,320
So you just say, well, ramen noodles are a normal good at very low ranges of income, and then they become an inferior good at higher ranges of income.

542
00:59:19,830 --> 00:59:23,069
So their behavior definitely changes. I get richer of it.

543
00:59:23,070 --> 00:59:27,300
Initially, I buy more ramen noodles if I get richer. If I started with nothing.

544
00:59:28,650 --> 00:59:31,680
Eventually, if I keep getting richer, I buy less ramen noodles.

545
00:59:33,420 --> 00:59:38,420
So those things can change. Okay.

546
00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:48,290
Finally, demand curves. Take a look at how quantity demanded changes with price and sort of graph out of demand curve.

547
00:59:49,130 --> 00:59:53,180
So this is kind of the one of the two curves you've probably seen of supply and demand.

548
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:58,310
See one graph in economics before you took this class. That's the graph you probably saw, right?

549
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:07,550
I didn't see indifference curves and budget constraints. I knew if you've never had econ, but supply and demand might be something you've seen.

550
01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:11,210
So how do we get the demand curve? Where does it come from?

551
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:21,700
Therefore, what does it mean? We can take a look at how quantities demand a change as price changes and then graph that as the demand curve.

552
01:00:22,690 --> 01:00:29,470
So let's hold everything constant except the price of goods X and we're looking at the quantity of that X,

553
01:00:29,590 --> 01:00:36,040
so we're holding price so good Y constant, we're holding income constant and we're holding the person's preferences constant.

554
01:00:36,570 --> 01:00:42,850
You got one set of preferences, one income, one price, a good Y and let's have sequentially very.

555
01:00:46,790 --> 01:00:53,920
So draw this out from scratch rather than someone easier to see it from scratch than the deconstructed sort of the.

556
01:00:56,160 --> 01:01:06,210
Fully drawn graph. And so on the top we've got our utility maximizing consumer making decisions.

557
01:01:20,580 --> 01:01:24,660
So we're holding this constant because the only thing we're varying is the price of good x.

558
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:28,650
So the Y intercept is going to just stay fixed.

559
01:01:28,890 --> 01:01:34,470
And we're pivoting the budget constraint around that fixed wireless subs and let's say X is fairly expensive.

560
01:01:36,580 --> 01:01:38,860
It is budget constraint as initially steep.

561
01:01:40,060 --> 01:01:45,400
So the consumer's got to give up a lot of units of good wine to put another unit of good X into their shopping cart.

562
01:01:48,020 --> 01:01:53,770
Now. Let's take a look at. But this consumers utility maximizing bundle is.

563
01:01:57,540 --> 01:02:07,150
They're buying and they're buying. It's one. That's going to give us one point on this consumer's demand curve.

564
01:02:07,870 --> 01:02:11,769
I suppose we know where all these numbers are. We know what the income is. We know what appliance.

565
01:02:11,770 --> 01:02:16,680
We know what access. So that's a fairly high price of good X.

566
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:22,720
But packs on the success of the demand curve.

567
01:02:23,850 --> 01:02:27,980
The quantity of X on that axis. So that's kind of the convention for drawing a demand curve.

568
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:33,780
You put quantity on the x axis price in the Y axis. So there we've got.

569
01:02:35,780 --> 01:02:43,560
Strap this down to here. There's X-1, and let's say the high price of X was here.

570
01:02:49,660 --> 01:02:53,330
So that gives us one point. Again, if we go back, we know all of these numbers.

571
01:02:53,330 --> 01:02:56,030
If we can drop this demand curve, we kind of know all these numbers.

572
01:02:57,290 --> 01:03:03,200
So one point on this consumer's demand curve is that this high price of good access that's reflected in the steep budget constraint.

573
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:07,340
Their utility maximizing bundle at x one units of good x.

574
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:15,840
Now suppose price goes down a bit. Price of air corrects.

575
01:03:15,850 --> 01:03:21,640
Going down again doesn't change any of this. Pivoting the budget constraint along that fixed y intercept.

576
01:03:22,540 --> 01:03:37,040
And now we observe that this person. Isaacs two units was their utility maximizing bundle at the new budget constraint includes x two units of good x.

577
01:03:37,910 --> 01:03:42,110
That's a lower price of x. So let's graph that lower price of x.

578
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:54,870
Against that new higher quantity. That gives us a second point on the persons demand curve.

579
01:03:55,830 --> 01:04:00,690
Now, we could keep doing this as many times as we wanted, despite good, actually even cheaper.

580
01:04:03,140 --> 01:04:09,440
Observe how much they buy. Let's plot that lower price.

581
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:23,679
Instead higher quantity. We've got a third point of the demand curve. I could keep doing this either ten times more.

582
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:29,459
I do 20 times more. Every time I do it. I'm adding another point, saying quite a different price of go to x.

583
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:37,570
How much x is what eventually? The graph out and higher demand curve.

584
01:04:44,510 --> 01:04:50,330
So every single point on the demand curve corresponds to a utility maximizing bundle.

585
01:04:51,540 --> 01:05:00,800
Nor is how much good access the person chooses at a particular price of good X holding income price of good y and their preferences constant.

586
01:05:02,570 --> 01:05:05,840
Is a demand curve supposed to be a straight line or can it be a straight line?

587
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:09,260
And also be sure it can be a straight line, can be a curve.

588
01:05:09,270 --> 01:05:15,379
So a lot of times we're going to work with straight line demand curves because if we want to put it in algebraic terms,

589
01:05:15,380 --> 01:05:19,640
it's obviously much easier to work with straight lines, but it doesn't have to be a straight line.

590
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:26,120
And the main part is we're going to argue the demand curve is always going to slope down.

591
01:05:26,930 --> 01:05:34,670
There is a theoretical exception to that where can slope up, but it's so incredibly rare and implausible that we essentially don't work.

592
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:39,770
So it'll slow down, but it doesn't have to be a straight line or it doesn't have to be a curve.

593
01:05:40,340 --> 01:05:48,350
And we're usually going to work with straight lines. And just because algebra is a lot easier working those lines on the demand curve,

594
01:05:49,250 --> 01:05:55,160
every single point of this demand curve is related to some utility maximizing bundle.

595
01:05:55,850 --> 01:06:00,640
Now another thing. It could happen as we make a shift of the demand curve.

596
01:06:01,810 --> 01:06:04,900
Why be a spot? We held a bunch of things constantly redrawing this.

597
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:11,000
What does this person got to raise? I suppose this is a normal good for this person.

598
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:13,760
They got a raise. What do you think the demand curve is going to look like?

599
01:06:15,830 --> 01:06:23,960
This is if this is the original one, the higher their demand curve we expect ought to shift out.

600
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:29,870
This is a normal good and I become richer than I get to kind of redo this whole exercise.

601
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:41,310
But I'd be redoing it from a much higher point here. That's my new income.

602
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:52,990
If X is a normal good, well, every one of those bundles now ought to have more good access than it had before,

603
01:06:53,650 --> 01:06:57,160
because they all reflect the person being richer than they were in this graph.

604
01:06:57,700 --> 01:07:03,190
So I'd have to redraw the whole demand curve, and I expect that whole demand curve would have shifted.

605
01:07:04,860 --> 01:07:07,919
Further out of exhibit inferior than I said.

606
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:13,010
Well, in respect of that demand curve. Shut it down.

607
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:20,960
I could also say what happens at the white price of the Y? Changes of x and Y are substitutes.

608
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:26,990
If the price of if X is coffee and y is t, if the price of T went up, I would buy more coffee.

609
01:07:26,990 --> 01:07:30,830
So I'd also expect to see the demand curve shift out.

610
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:38,930
So in other words, if any of those things I held constant in the background change, I have to redraw the whole demand curve.

611
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:48,999
Because each one of these demand curves I've drawn, like the first one that I drew, assumed that I was this and why was that?

612
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:53,860
And my preferences are what their preferences are if my preference and preferences change.

613
01:07:54,820 --> 01:08:00,270
So I said, you know, hey, I didn't. Have you ever had your preferences change something you eat now that you used divided?

614
01:08:01,250 --> 01:08:08,410
Yeah, it happens to everybody. So as preferences develop, you know, maybe you said well I what did you used to not eat?

615
01:08:08,710 --> 01:08:15,040
Sushi. Sushi. Okay. So what did you learn?

616
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:20,650
Join. Okay. So you didn't before? Before I was like, oh, that's raw fish.

617
01:08:21,580 --> 01:08:24,820
That's disgusting. It's not going to eat sushi.

618
01:08:25,610 --> 01:08:30,880
I'm sorry. You tried it. Somehow you convinced yourself to try it. Was that bravery involved there?

619
01:08:31,290 --> 01:08:33,970
Okay. And then I said, wait a second, this is good.

620
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:41,290
And so your preferences changed, so therefore you'd have a different demand curve for sushi now than you used to have.

621
01:08:41,620 --> 01:08:47,080
Your income hadn't changed even if the price of sushi hadn't changed, and even the price of everything else hadn't changed.

622
01:08:48,310 --> 01:08:52,960
So if any of those factors that we held, constant drawing, that first demand curve change,

623
01:08:53,380 --> 01:09:02,440
we're going to get a whole new demand curve if income changes, if the price of the other good changes, or if my preferences change.

624
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:08,349
And all of us have had our preferences change over time. So we kind of assume as we're drawing these graphs, that it's sort of at a point in time,

625
01:09:08,350 --> 01:09:11,800
I've got this stable set of preferences I can use to predict behavior,

626
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:16,750
but that doesn't mean that my preferences today are the same as my preferences were 20 years ago.

627
01:09:17,350 --> 01:09:22,959
Those things can and do evolve, so if any of those things change, it's going to shift.

628
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:29,860
The whole demand curve, zero demand curve for sushi shifted way out your demand curve for sushi probably before.

629
01:09:37,780 --> 01:09:41,110
Different color here. It was probably vertical.

630
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:49,030
It's got a quantity of zero, right. If you have a peanut allergy, your demand for peanuts probably looks like that.

631
01:09:49,990 --> 01:09:53,139
At any price, subpoenas, you're say, well, peanuts are really cheap today.

632
01:09:53,140 --> 01:09:57,400
I'll go to the E.R. and maybe die because I have also peanuts now that cheap.

633
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:02,720
I don't think so. Your demand for peanuts is going to be vertical at zero.

634
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:07,810
Your demand for sushi, if you literally don't like it, I don't know that you like it yet, is going to be zero.

635
01:10:08,290 --> 01:10:17,380
Now all of a sudden, your demand for sushi looks like that your preferences changed and you went from a vertical at zero demand for sushi.

636
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:23,770
You wouldn't eat it at any price. If I literally don't like something, just because it's cheap doesn't mean I'm going to want it.

637
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:33,580
Now. You got a downward sloping demand for sushi. If it came cheaper, you'd buy more expensive.

638
01:10:33,590 --> 01:10:38,290
No surprise to shoot sushi fell in half.

639
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:43,810
What would you do if you moved down your demand curve?

640
01:10:46,450 --> 01:10:54,550
I price at sushi. The low price of sushi that's going to be a movement down an existing demand curve.

641
01:10:54,970 --> 01:10:58,720
That's not going to be a shift of the demand curve because we didn't change income.

642
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:01,960
We didn't change the price of what whatever other goods are in the world.

643
01:11:02,260 --> 01:11:05,590
We didn't change your preferences. All we change was the price of sushi.

644
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:09,670
So that's a movement down that or that one demand curve.

645
01:11:11,050 --> 01:11:12,430
When your preferences change,

646
01:11:12,430 --> 01:11:20,860
that was a shift of your demand curve from the vertical at zero to this now downward sloping demand curve where you do buy sushi at some prices.

647
01:11:22,450 --> 01:11:23,170
Does that make sense?

648
01:11:23,950 --> 01:11:31,779
So if prices are good changes, just a movement along the demand curve, if one of those other things changes the price of something else,

649
01:11:31,780 --> 01:11:36,410
your income or your preferences, we're probably going to have to draw an entire new demand curve.

650
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:41,259
The whole thing's going to shift and we can kind of predict the way it shifts based on some information we're given.

651
01:11:41,260 --> 01:11:44,950
If it's a normal good, well, it would shift out. If your income went up, it would shift.

652
01:11:44,950 --> 01:11:48,850
And if your income went down, if it's inferior, good. The exact opposite.

653
01:11:50,170 --> 01:11:56,380
Shift out if your income went down and shift in if your income went up, the two of those are substitutes.

654
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:03,360
Our compliments would go in opposite directions. Price of coffee goes up.

655
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:06,090
That would shift the demand for tea out.

656
01:12:06,860 --> 01:12:15,360
The coffee goes down or shift the demand for tea and price of coffee goes up, or shift the demand for cream in the bank puts,

657
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:20,220
complements or substitutes is always easier to just kind of have that prototypical example in mind.

658
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:26,550
So was it positive or negative or just is it like coffee and cream or is it like coffee and tea?

659
01:12:27,250 --> 01:12:32,110
So ask yourself that you kind of figure out, well. The price of coffee went up.

660
01:12:32,110 --> 01:12:39,710
What would happen to the demand for tea? On a shift out there substitutes.

661
01:12:44,110 --> 01:12:47,370
We can kind of if we change a variable that's on the axis.

662
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:52,650
In other words, the price of sushi is on the axis. There is moving along that demand curve.

663
01:12:52,950 --> 01:13:00,330
If we change one of those other things that we didn't draw on the axis but was held constant in the background as we were driving this demand curve,

664
01:13:00,810 --> 01:13:06,970
then we've got a shift of the entire demand curve. This was kind of the examples we gave.

665
01:13:07,020 --> 01:13:11,790
The price of coffee goes down. Well, it's just a movement down that demand curve.

666
01:13:11,790 --> 01:13:17,910
It doesn't change the demand curve. The fact that demand curve is the relationship between the price of coffee and the quantity of coffee.

667
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:24,060
So the price of coffee goes down. We just read off the new quantity from that existing demand curve.

668
01:13:25,340 --> 01:13:31,670
If one of those background things changes, then we're going to have to figure out, well, what would happen to the entire demand curve for coffee?

669
01:13:32,870 --> 01:13:36,320
Price of tea goes up if coffee and tea are substitutes.

670
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:40,460
I'd buy more coffee. Demand for coffee would shift a lot.

671
01:13:42,420 --> 01:13:48,540
Price of cream goes up by less coffee so complements the entire demand curve which shut down.

672
01:13:49,590 --> 01:13:52,680
The third example my income went up in coffee is a normal good.

673
01:13:53,540 --> 01:14:00,070
I buy more of it. My income went down and coffee was somehow an inferior good.

674
01:14:00,460 --> 01:14:04,660
I buy more of it. Probably normal for most people.

675
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:13,350
So it's kind of makes sense. If we're changing the variable on the access wall, then it's just a movement along that given curve.

676
01:14:14,190 --> 01:14:18,809
If we're changing, one of the things that we'd held constant as we were drawing that curve in the first place,

677
01:14:18,810 --> 01:14:21,540
with that exercise I went through with the pivoting budget constraints,

678
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:29,610
then we'd have to actually redo that exercise conceptually because we'd have to get a whole new demand curve we got.

679
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:33,990
Every point on the demand curve comes from a utility maximizing model.

680
01:14:34,410 --> 01:14:41,820
So it tells us something about how much the consumer values each additional unit price is high.

681
01:14:42,510 --> 01:14:45,600
I'm only willing to buy a relatively small amount of coffee.

682
01:14:46,470 --> 01:14:51,470
I'm only willing to buy those units of coffee that are worth at least $10 a pound to me.

683
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:54,900
So that's how many beans I'm going to buy £3 of beans in a month.

684
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:58,140
If the price went down to $5.

685
01:14:59,350 --> 01:15:09,890
I said, Well, all those things that are worth less than $10 a pound to me, my subjective value valuation of them all go back to opportunity cost.

686
01:15:09,900 --> 01:15:14,640
I'm willing to give up $10 of other stuff in order to get this pound of beans.

687
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:23,970
If I was only willing to give up $8 for this next pound of beans, I wouldn't buy it at the old price, but I would buy it at the new price.

688
01:15:24,300 --> 01:15:26,640
In fact, I'd buy now £6 of beans.

689
01:15:28,410 --> 01:15:35,820
So we're using the interpretation of the height of the demand curve as saying How much does a consumer value each unit?

690
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:45,479
What are they willing to give up to get it? If I've had no coffee at all, I would pay a very high price to get a little bit of coffee there,

691
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:49,770
as I'd be willing to give up a lot of other goods to get that first pound of coffee in a month.

692
01:15:51,930 --> 01:16:00,060
If I've already had £10 of coffee this month, I'm not willing to give up a lot of other goods to get an 11th pound of coffee beans.

693
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:07,600
It relates to the diminishing marginal utility of coffee as well.

694
01:16:07,630 --> 01:16:11,860
What am I willing to give up to get another pound? It depends how many piles I already had.

695
01:16:14,110 --> 01:16:17,860
I hadn't had any coffee all month and I drank. I tend to drink coffee every morning.

696
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:26,530
I'd be willing to pay a lot to get that first part as much as get the second pound out as much as a third pound.

697
01:16:26,950 --> 01:16:32,980
So the fact that the demand curve slows down is actually a direct measure of that diminishing marginal utility of income.

698
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:37,270
In order to tempt me to buy more. You have to lower the price.

699
01:16:40,060 --> 01:16:43,330
If you say, Well, you don't need to give up as much to get another pound.

700
01:16:43,780 --> 01:16:49,830
Okay, I'll buy more pounds. It makes sense.

701
01:16:51,580 --> 01:16:55,000
And so as we're working with demand curves kind of through the rest of this course,

702
01:16:55,660 --> 01:16:59,860
just remember that they're sort of tightly related to utility maximizing choices

703
01:16:59,860 --> 01:17:04,390
and hence to how much the consumer values each additional unit of the good.

704
01:17:06,230 --> 01:17:10,740
In the downward slope of the demand curve actually is sort of a direct measure of

705
01:17:10,740 --> 01:17:14,910
how much the consumer is willing to pay to get each additional unit of the good.

706
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:24,459
Any questions? We are about 3 minutes left before any questions.

707
01:17:24,460 --> 01:17:40,510
Otherwise, we can initiate a bio, step down and say we're back to more applications and less be replaced.

708
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:47,170
I think the palate cleanser election are eventually.

709
01:17:50,650 --> 01:18:08,520
You know, I'm sure that's going to be a huge, huge, huge change.

710
01:18:09,020 --> 01:18:15,280
But how do you think about that?

711
01:18:15,430 --> 01:18:22,930
Yeah, it's like, you know, so I started something like that.

712
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:32,049
So I just I think that's kind of what I was thinking.

713
01:18:32,050 --> 01:18:34,930
I'm like, what it sounds like, okay, it's kind of warm out.

714
01:18:34,930 --> 01:18:45,000
And I think maybe after today and where there's of stuff think, I think know how to figure it out.

715
01:18:46,530 --> 01:18:51,100
Yeah. I'm not going to get into that.

716
01:18:52,120 --> 01:18:58,000
And I was like, I think I didn't listen to it and I really have to clear it up.

717
01:18:58,050 --> 01:19:05,530
Yeah, I know what you're trying to do.

718
01:19:06,220 --> 01:19:10,210
You just sit with that.

719
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:22,660
You're no longer here. So I'm I'm I'm going to different again.

720
01:19:22,870 --> 01:19:29,140
It's going to be very lonely.

721
01:19:31,770 --> 01:19:39,030
One single that's not going to impress me.

722
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:47,080
You want to make sure it's something that I mean,

723
01:19:48,050 --> 01:19:55,270
but it's really expensive compared to the things that make you more expensive, like buying something.

724
01:19:55,270 --> 01:19:58,528
Well, I'm going to buy it. We actually would.
