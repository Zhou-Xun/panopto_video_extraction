1
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:44,210
You know, I think for yourself because I don't think I was like, I think this is the point where we have to really know what they're talking about.

2
00:00:44,360 --> 00:01:00,570
I think it's like I mean, we are going to see a little bit more serious stuff,

3
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:31,760
but I think we do a little bit like it looks like like other kinds of things.

4
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:38,000
So I have to do it.

5
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,300
Yeah, I think that's something that I have an issue with, you know?

6
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,160
Oh, my God. Well, that's where you look online.

7
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,610
I mean, I. Oh, okay.

8
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,870
Yeah, I wouldn't want that.

9
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:11,550
But the newscasters, I'll tell you, they knew it was good.

10
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:18,690
So they were like 25, 20% say it again.

11
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:38,819
So when she forgets questions like I told her, I have never have I ever heard this story we had in the last day.

12
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:42,360
Everybody. Well, our last class.

13
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,830
Anyway, happy last Thursday with me in person.

14
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:51,860
I will say you had some finally get the final online going.

15
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,740
We're not going to leave the music. It's the Michael Jackson station going right now.

16
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:03,360
So as typical, just a few things before we get into the presentation today.

17
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:13,799
Next Thursday, 4 to 530 will be the final as we eventually before we come to terms with the online and we'll give you the Zoom link

18
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:22,740
prior to and I'll open the exam a little bit before and I will remain until the last person is done with the exam.

19
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:40,680
So just so that you can be done by 8 p.m., that's why I but just letting you know that we'll be able to do that and plenty of cheer.

20
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:45,720
All right. So Icebreaker in what we wanted to do today.

21
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:56,250
Before I introduce Brian, which reality TV series would you like to be a part of or what is the best joke that you know?

22
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:08,550
I put mine up there. Why is it so windy in the stadium? There were a bunch of fans I saw I saw Guy go blue in that regard.

23
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:12,600
And I'm looking forward to seeing the TCU frogs go down.

24
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:20,600
This should be very anybody's got tickets to the game. Anybody going to get anybody from Arizona going to say no?

25
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,870
Yes. You got anything about it now? Okay. All right.

26
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:29,940
Very good. Very good. Very good. All right. So I'm going to start with my middle zone.

27
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:36,060
Yeah, I think Survivor. Okay.

28
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,800
Okay. I am coming to the season one.

29
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:46,590
Yeah, I don't know who's winning, but I know I saw something like that, but I think I would do the great British Bake Off.

30
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:54,089
Yeah, I see. Yeah. I got to give props to Topshop.

31
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:59,010
I would do my little characters. Yeah, I want to do the investigation.

32
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:02,990
Okay. I want to learn how it goes. Okay. Okay. Love it.

33
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:08,010
I urge you to.

34
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:12,370
I recently saw something called the Bible.

35
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:17,810
I know the one about a hundred people.

36
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:33,240
Okay. Okay. I'll look for it, because I'm just going to say the answer to that question.

37
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:39,710
Okay. I just want to know what reality you see on TV.

38
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:46,840
You could be on TV, what TV show, which is the part of you that there is a Chinese show where you answer questions.

39
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:50,480
You're telling me this, okay, because I was like, I don't have a friends today.

40
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:56,480
Okay. So in that God apologize for that because I wasn't listening to what you were saying.

41
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:07,400
So there's a TV show that you can watch to a maximum life in America or even some similar.

42
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,990
Yeah. But you re on the game show.

43
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:16,490
Okay, great. I'm satisfied.

44
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:24,470
I mean, maybe I would be the bachelorette, but it's not like, you know, just me.

45
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:35,870
Oh, I mean, yeah. I would love to be on Wipeout.

46
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:42,550
Oh, yeah. Okay.

47
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:46,280
I was, you know, strapped to the helmet, you know?

48
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:50,390
You know. All righty. I love it.

49
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:53,600
I am a star. Here are some tips. I'll get to you guys later.

50
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:58,220
When you go here like Top Chef.

51
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:03,409
Okay. Very good. Madison, Wisconsin. Sunset Spelling's on selling.

52
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:07,870
Sunset. Okay. Yeah, it's. It's like they're realtor realtors.

53
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,070
Calhoun. Yeah. Yeah. Love Island.

54
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:18,739
I wasn't. I was down below deck. Below deck.

55
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:24,350
Like they get on the cruise. I'd be on cake, boss.

56
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:29,590
I do. I do. I'm so glad he feels well. And he's doing better in the home.

57
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:38,810
Yes. Okay. I'd also be a really experienced survivor.

58
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:42,890
Survivor? The Great British Bake Off. I'll be very honored.

59
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,320
So here's what you. It's. It's hilarious. Thank you.

60
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:50,830
I got to go with cash on The Bachelorette. Okay.

61
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,230
I wouldn't be me if I didn't tell a joke. So this one. This one.

62
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:57,530
Appropriate, but not that one.

63
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,890
What's the difference between wallpaper and toilet paper?

64
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:07,130
You really. You don't know the difference between. Don't want to. That's gross.

65
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,909
And you acting it all out. Everything okay? It sounds interesting.

66
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:17,450
Just like, why do I not know the answer to that?

67
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:25,850
Okay, I think I'm using that. I'm going to use something you should think, oh, I'd be a big brother or.

68
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:29,440
And TV's. The challenge is the challenge.

69
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:32,720
Okay, I'll get to you guys in a minute. Let's go to you guys.

70
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:42,050
You know, those judges like the people who they talk to the most blind contestants.

71
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:50,880
You love it. Love it when you say I.

72
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:56,240
Reporter And I realize it's not real. You got a joke?

73
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,250
Okay. All right. I'll come back to you guys in a second.

74
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:07,580
Very remote here. You an expert on Married at first sight?

75
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:16,430
Communications is getting to be invested in, like, the love stories and not a TV drama.

76
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:25,630
Okay, that's at least one. You still don't know too many of these marriages that have lasted around the same group.

77
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:29,400
I would be insights on American Idol. American Idol.

78
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:41,480
Okay. Okay. Is a joke. Just got to get a little caffeine for Kate or our great America's next summer.

79
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:49,010
Okay. You've got a master chef.

80
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:55,610
And yet love is blind.

81
00:09:56,050 --> 00:10:02,130
Okay. No real deal or no?

82
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:10,970
Oh, would you agree with that? You know, when you get your chances, the chances of my out, they're going to be in jeopardy.

83
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:16,670
Jeopardy! Up and down. Now with Ken Jennings always in jeopardy together.

84
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:22,579
Yeah, I hold up this house. Hunters are international.

85
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:36,530
House monsters are local, domestic, domestic. I guess like I watch lot somewhere, like Korean reality TV.

86
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:45,620
And so one of the one of those reality shows, I'm going to let you guys go maybe.

87
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:49,530
Do you know how you get a joke?

88
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,120
She gets out? No. Oh, okay. I don't know.

89
00:10:54,740 --> 00:11:00,170
Maybe like a family feud here.

90
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:03,260
Okay. Okay. So make everybody with. Yeah, or, like, Love Island.

91
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:08,059
And that was not a contestant.

92
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:14,740
We just got to look it out. Yeah. Tell her to.

93
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:22,310
Yes, you have. Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead. Let's finish this one.

94
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:27,050
Oh, okay. Oh, there's a dad.

95
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:34,850
And I heard Brett Kavanaugh, what do you call a nosy parent?

96
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:46,630
I took over your business. I guess we got to get to this.

97
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:57,790
Okay. You guys know you doing the ice breakers with me, so you try to go ahead and move into our presentation here.

98
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:09,580
I'm going to click off. I mean, that's my music to turn on the music and then I'm going to unplug it.

99
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:20,649
Mr. Watson I love it here, but I never hear from Michael Jackson.

100
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:24,459
But I think I can do it while he's plugging in.

101
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:31,690
Let me do his a quick introduction. If he's going to do the ice breaker, he will he will introduce that himself.

102
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:33,610
I gave you my bad, bad joke.

103
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:42,909
So Brian Watson and I have been together for about ten years, working in a working relationship here at the University of Michigan.

104
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:46,590
And he is the senior director director for benefits. No.

105
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,680
That's Fancher OC Assistant director. Excuse me to Brian's. Yeah.

106
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,030
Yeah. Okay.

107
00:12:52,030 --> 00:13:01,419
So he and I have worked on a number of projects that really you've seen throughout the class where I talked about benefits and I brought up

108
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:11,230
sort of the the infographic around benefits when we talk about the data that we manage for the 51 plus thousand employees that are here,

109
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:19,569
I cannot speak more highly of what Brian does and the acuity and detail by which he looks

110
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:25,090
at the data and how we manage the health care claims systems and how we manage the system,

111
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:29,290
the health data that surrounds our benefit designs.

112
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:37,749
So as you keep hearing me say, when you go into your next position, you know you're a leader, there's someone behind who's doing those benefits,

113
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:44,440
but who's behind managing those benefits to make certain that they are as effective as they can be.

114
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:55,450
And they actually allow you to gain the benefit from the benefit design that you may very well need sometime during your health care journey.

115
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:59,770
We are very thoughtful about our benefits and our benefits design.

116
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:04,390
It is linked into university human resources, which is linked in to benefit finance,

117
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:10,330
which again is linked into the university's mission with with our president and our executive leaders.

118
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:20,979
Brian and I have been together in multiple ways of sitting in front of executive leaders looking at retirement benefits and what's effective for them.

119
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:24,910
We've looked at in healthy and healthy incentives for our staff.

120
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:36,130
We have managed what I consider requests that come with and I'm going to say it obviously transgender benefits and the fact that

121
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:45,820
nothing is nothing is off the table when it comes to a benefit design that may very well help the quality of life for an employee.

122
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:49,270
So, again, you have a medical assistant, you have a nurse, you have a physician.

123
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:58,750
They're providing a service with the benefits that you you literally will be entitled in intertwined with,

124
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:06,160
will actually keep that group that's providing the service healthy for you going forward.

125
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,370
So this is a deeper dive, what we're going to do.

126
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:15,879
I'll get a moment, Brian, sort of introduce a little bit more about himself, but just the connection of how we've worked together.

127
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:23,170
And he's he's provided some information, wonderful information to our leadership to help make leadership decisions.

128
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:25,990
So when you think about the man behind the curtain.

129
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:40,030
He's here for an intro so ice breaker I have to see my heart would want to do American Ninja Warrior at my age and gray hair.

130
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:44,410
I probably would fail in the first obstacle, so it probably would.

131
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:49,180
My head says probably two prices. Right is watching that show.

132
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:53,620
So you come on down. So yeah.

133
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:58,900
So I work in the benefits office here at the university. So just a little bit more about the benefits office.

134
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,960
We are a centralized unit.

135
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:14,320
We're not decentralized, meaning that we do all the benefits for all the employees on campus, all three campuses, Michigan Medicine retirees.

136
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:19,089
We have one, one place to go and and one set of benefit programs for everybody.

137
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:22,510
So we're centralized in that regards.

138
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:26,200
You know, some of things that we do. We do some customer service.

139
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:32,230
We do have a shared service center that handles a lot of what we call kind of tier one customer service issues.

140
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:38,740
So if you you're near the university and you want to sign up for benefits or you need a change to add a dependent or do those types of things,

141
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:41,110
the shared service center can help you do that.

142
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:49,480
Now we get involved with a lot of tier two type questions problems with benefits, you know, problems with a claim.

143
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:58,479
Maybe your provider's not paying that claim or submitting that claim properly, or maybe the vendor,

144
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,530
the health insurance company, stop paying it for some reason we can get involved in that.

145
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:06,220
And those level two kind of are tier two kind of kind of questions.

146
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,339
So the things that we do in the benefits office,

147
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:16,780
obviously we're always working with departments and leadership because compensation is such a big part of,

148
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:21,999
of, of, of, of what we do here at the university.

149
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:31,420
I mean, our biggest asset is our people. And the compensation, the salaries, benefits are important part of that compensation.

150
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:35,620
So we're working with leadership on that.

151
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:45,189
It's, you know, benefits for the university as a major recruit and retain a benefit for four departments that they

152
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:50,259
can go out and and show people what we offer as a benefits package and get people to come here.

153
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:53,290
So that's that's another aspect.

154
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:58,450
One the other aspects that we have is obviously we're working with a lot of vendors.

155
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:07,930
I'll go through those in just a little bit. But you know, our vendor relationships with Blue Cross Blue Shield, vcN Magellan,

156
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:11,750
our acts, you know, we've got a lot of vendors that we work with and just, you know,

157
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:13,390
making sure that, you know,

158
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:20,260
we're getting the best deal possible through them as well and working on issues that we have with with the benefit design as well.

159
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:28,300
One other thing I wanted to point out was also, did you guys study the difference between what self-insured and fully insured looks like?

160
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:35,290
I asked them about Assad and I think just a few. Okay. Self-funded services.

161
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,360
Yeah. So and so is part of self-funding.

162
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:50,360
So so if you're self-insured, the university takes on or the employer group takes on the risk for any gains and losses resulting from from claims.

163
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:55,370
So you're setting the premium and you're responsible for for paying those those claims.

164
00:18:56,810 --> 00:19:05,090
If you're fully insured, you contract with a vendor and they will provide you with a premium.

165
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:09,560
And any gains and losses, you pay the premium on any gains and losses that they have.

166
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:17,600
It's the problem of the insurance company. So we are fully insured for three free products.

167
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:23,900
We have life insurance through MetLife, Legal and Vision.

168
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:29,209
All happen to be through MetLife right now. So we're applying for those three products.

169
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:38,960
We're actually our self insured for medical, our ex, and then those benefits we have in a self-insured basis.

170
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:46,520
And some of the reasons for being self-insured are that if you have a large employer group or large membership group like we have,

171
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:51,920
we have over 100,000 lives in our our medical and dental plans and our acts.

172
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:58,130
So we have a large base. We have about 600 to 700 million in premiums.

173
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:03,200
And, you know, we can spread that risk out over a large group.

174
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:11,089
And, you know, if we get some unexpected high claims, that big,

175
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:17,450
huge base of people that we can spread that out over how small and player group might want to go fully insured

176
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:23,390
their premiums like come out of 25 million but they have a few large claims that are over $1,000,000.

177
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:28,520
You know, I don't really think that would be a real problem for them and setting premiums and

178
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:33,770
stuff so large employers like us tend to be part of a self-insured arrangement,

179
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,030
so we're responsible for those gains and losses.

180
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:43,890
Another reason to be self-insured is that when you're dealing paying premiums to insurance company, they have their profit margins built in.

181
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:54,290
So they're trying to make a profit on that. They're trying to build up their reserves because they have to insure all the other members that they pay.

182
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:58,490
And there are other employer groups. So reserve requirements are a little bit higher.

183
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:06,740
Also, we also save money in that we're not paying taxes and insurance companies have to pay through our premiums.

184
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:12,919
So that's about one or 2% of our premiums usually are paying taxes that the

185
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:17,590
insurance company has to pay so we can save all that buying by self-insurance.

186
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,440
That's why we do that. Any questions on that?

187
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:25,849
I guess it's kind of an overview of what the benefits office does.

188
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:32,780
And and, you know, some of the things that we have to work with possibility.

189
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:38,870
I know I'm probably putting a little bit on the blue book here know talking about the principles, the core principles,

190
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:48,740
maybe just maybe one or two that we have and that we sort of monitor ourselves by when we really are thoughtful about the benefits that we have.

191
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:53,210
Right. So one core principle that we have is choice.

192
00:21:53,930 --> 00:22:04,100
So we do have our own health system, does partially own a health plan, but we don't force people to take it.

193
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:07,309
It's part of a menu of options for choice.

194
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:13,780
So that's a strong value that we have as a choice.

195
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:22,040
Also, I mentioned, you know, being able to recruit, retain, having a competitive benefits package is one that we're we're interested in.

196
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:28,120
And to that point, you know, we do market studies. There is a market study on the first dashboard I'm going to show you,

197
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:37,610
which shows how competitive we are against our peer institutions, both from a university and from a michigan medicine standpoint.

198
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:43,020
So we'll get into that during your thing.

199
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,350
Yeah, I don't have the core values,

200
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:52,970
but those are the two that jump out to me are the those two and not being able to the other one was being able to provide affordable benefits.

201
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:53,510
Right.

202
00:22:53,510 --> 00:23:04,069
So we've had to make some changes to our benefit plans over the years to make them not just affordable to employees, but affordable to university.

203
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:08,719
So we'll get into that just a little bit and the discussion.

204
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:18,050
So right now I'm going to show you the first dashboard here is a benefits dashboard that kind of just it's a high level dashboard,

205
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:25,040
you know, for this is a kind of dashboard we would show to somebody who was near the university and wanted to learn about benefits.

206
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:29,470
So when you do dashboards and kind of the thing that we.

207
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:33,870
Kind of, you know, figuring out over the years is that, you know, people don't have time.

208
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:38,280
They don't have a lot of time to go through a 50, 60 PowerPoint presentation.

209
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:42,420
They want to take away the top five or ten things that you're telling them.

210
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,439
Don't show me. Page 35 is your slide deck.

211
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:51,310
I'm already I'm already zoned out. Now, if you put all the important stuff in the back, then I'm not going to write.

212
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:52,350
You know, you're not going to remember that.

213
00:23:52,680 --> 00:24:00,450
So you want to be able to focus your discussions with leadership and and others on those top 5 to 10 things.

214
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:10,380
So one of the first things you might think to ask about benefits program is, yo, yo, what's, what's the enrollment look like?

215
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:16,530
How much are we spending on benefits? How much what is our most expensive benefit?

216
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:21,290
What is the trend for those benefits? Are we market competitive with what we're offering?

217
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:27,120
Those are kind of questions. We kind of try to answer a few more questions with this dashboard.

218
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,050
So we'll just walk through this. Any questions so far?

219
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,070
And please ask questions as we go along. I'm not holding the last 20 minutes or so for Q&A.

220
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:42,870
If you have questions, please ask is going in. How do you judge what is affordable?

221
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:48,239
A good question. Yeah.

222
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:57,780
So I think one of the ways that that, you know, we kind of look at it within a committee group was that,

223
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:03,000
you know, we when we have issues like that and we want to make changes to our benefit plans.

224
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:10,230
Usually it's we're going to make things more affordable for the university and possibly more expensive for the employee.

225
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,840
That's just the way it works. So we're we're trying to do affordability for us as an institution.

226
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:21,330
We know that's going to make things more expensive for the employee, whether it's raising co-pays or changing the premium model.

227
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:32,610
So one of the ways that we we did that back about ten years ago, we actually implement a salary banding of differential and the premiums.

228
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:38,100
So instead of charging lower paid employees more where we thought it could be unaffordable to them,

229
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:43,950
we put in a salary banding mechanism that that kept basically their costs right where it was at.

230
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:51,120
Just a little bit of a change and started charging higher paid employees more for the benefit.

231
00:25:52,070 --> 00:26:01,850
So we're conscious. We know. I think one of the things also, too, is that, you know, we can look at enrollment by by salary.

232
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:07,249
So you can see if there's people in the lower end of the salaries that aren't participating.

233
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:13,730
For whatever reason, we can explore why somebody at the lower end of the pay scale in the university is not participating.

234
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,449
So all we figure it's for, we can afford it.

235
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:22,470
And they're going to have to benefit from from a benefit that they're molded.

236
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:33,810
Good question. Just to go through our first dashboard here, you can see the enrollment here broken out by plan.

237
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:36,990
So health care would actually include medical and our ex.

238
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:44,430
We don't differentiate we we combine those premiums for one health care plan.

239
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:52,630
The health care providers that we use on the medical side our BCM Blue Cross Blue Shield,

240
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:59,760
Michigan and Physicians Health Plan, which is the plan that's 25% owned right now by Michigan Medicine.

241
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:06,120
On the prescription drug side, we have a carved out prescription drug plan.

242
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:14,520
We use Magellan, our acts as our vendor. So one of the reasons why we build contract with with vendors, obviously with the benefits office,

243
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:22,739
we're not staff to handle all the communication goes through and the health plans also with health plans for really buying their in-network.

244
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:23,100
Right.

245
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:33,059
So they negotiated to have a bunch of providers be part of their networks and in their network they provide discounts to employer groups for claims.

246
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:38,580
So a chance to be part of that employer network and also to have a experienced

247
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:44,219
claims adjudicator and also helps with with as well personal health information.

248
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:51,720
We don't want to know why somebody, you know, in the hospital didn't care by going through a third party,

249
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:56,790
they can de-identified data and give it to us and request that information.

250
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:09,810
As far as, you know seeing clients so health care is at about 62,000 member are contracts actually and so they have would include active employees,

251
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:14,400
like I said, all three campuses. Michigan Medicine. Michigan Medicine makes up about half of that figure.

252
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:23,009
A lot of people thanks a lot of a lot of people, a lot of humans to run a 24 seven operation, as you know.

253
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:27,900
So there's a lot of employees at the health system, a lot of contracts there.

254
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:33,630
Health care membership as just under 120,000.

255
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:39,150
We put the membership counts up here in the top right hand corner because, you know, there's a difference.

256
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:45,480
For instance, I'm a contract holder here, so I'm part of the 62, 62, 67.

257
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:49,800
I have my my wife and my two kids on my contract.

258
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:54,450
That's for members. So they're part of the member count.

259
00:28:54,900 --> 00:29:03,330
So that's how that center. So we have almost 118,000 members and health care, dental is a little bit higher.

260
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:08,940
Almost 64,000 allied dental wise are more in dental and less and health care.

261
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:13,260
Well, we allow people to opt out of benefits if they get benefits cheaper somewhere else.

262
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:19,589
On the dental plan, we do offer a free option for preventative maintenance kind of services,

263
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:22,980
so there's no reason for people to really opt out of dental.

264
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:28,830
That first dental option is free to people, so we tend to have a little bit higher moving dental.

265
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:35,010
We use we use Delta dental for for dental retirement plan.

266
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,770
We provide a 10% match up. The employee puts in 5%.

267
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:50,880
That's not unusual for a university to have a two for one match if what advice I have to anybody sitting here.

268
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:58,890
If your employer offers a match, take it when you're, you know, enroll in the retirement plan and take it because even if it's a 10%,

269
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:03,450
you're put in 10% and they're put in 2% and you just got a 20% return on your money.

270
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:09,030
Basically, you put the 10% and they're giving you 2%. So that's that's a pretty good return on your investment.

271
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:12,149
Plus, you know, over time that that that that balance will grow.

272
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:18,840
So we use TIA and Fidelity for our retirement savings LTV.

273
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:23,180
That's the only plan that we do not use really an outside administrator deal.

274
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:36,050
We are completely self-administered and self-insured for that that benefit probably because it's a salary placement and benefit, continuation benefit.

275
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:41,400
Yeah. I just want to put it in perspective for the students. I just Googled real quickly.

276
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:53,220
Cities that have populations around the 117 123 and that includes Lansing is at 115,000, Ann Arbor, that 113,000 citizens.

277
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:59,190
The reason why I'm saying that is if we care about the Ann Arbor population health.

278
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:07,680
And here we are at the University of Michigan with 123,000, between 170 120,000 individuals.

279
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:12,690
Why does a health care institution would we not care about the people who are taking care?

280
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:18,300
Of the clients. And it's it's just for me, it's 1 to 1.

281
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:23,220
You get 113,000 people. And, you know, I know Washington County Health Department takes care of them.

282
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,200
So this is our way of doing the same thing, just trying to put the relevancy around.

283
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:34,260
We're managing whole cities here and I'm not sure where you're working and where you're going to connect and work,

284
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:39,300
but these are some of the things you want to think about and think through.

285
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:48,650
So I just want to put in yeah, yeah. I'm always consider a university like a small city and it's a city and you your own public safety, you know,

286
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:55,450
like ground crews and, you know, just everything that you see, a city that you never see pretty much has it to.

287
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:59,640
So yeah. So back to, you know LTV.

288
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:03,090
Like I said, it's a self-administered plan.

289
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:08,980
We use payroll obviously to pay salaried placement for individuals and we allow them to continue our benefits.

290
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:15,210
That's a major advantage on our team plan. I can see the differences between vision and life.

291
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:23,370
You see it would be the university life policy, the university life contribution, up to $30,000 benefit.

292
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:28,380
So we passed away. The University of Penn paid $3,000 to their beneficiary.

293
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:33,660
We do have life optional, which is entirely paid for by the employee.

294
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:42,180
They can get up to eight times salary for that benefit. And we have legal and FSA, which is a flexible spending account.

295
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:48,900
You can get a flexible spending account for dependent care also as well as health, health care.

296
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:58,770
So and then we have an HRA for a small trade union or the university actually contributes money into a health reimbursement account arrangement.

297
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:04,200
Why is the enrollment for the life insurance that you see contribution is so low?

298
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:08,310
If it's essentially free to employees, certain groups aren't eligible.

299
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:14,280
Yeah. So this is everybody who is actually eligible to get the benefit.

300
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:24,150
So while there's, you know, 62,000 health care enrollees, you know, there's probably 12,000 numbers.

301
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:27,630
Retirees are not in not in the U.S. for 30,000.

302
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:33,719
And then grad students don't get that benefit.

303
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:40,670
So that's in place. So there's a couple other groups that are excluded.

304
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:46,490
That's why. Yeah, it's a good question. Life options open to more groups.

305
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:50,160
It's almost the same number, although it's optional coverage.

306
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:55,950
There's a lot of people, just some 3000. But there's there's more more more to the optional serving.

307
00:33:55,950 --> 00:34:03,420
So you end up being pretty close in number. So that's kind of a snapshot of our benefit enrollment.

308
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:10,580
So again, if you're trying to introduce people to benefits, this is how we would do it and kind of give them an idea.

309
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:18,030
This is how many people have enrolled. These are the plans that we have and how many how many people we're servicing and each one of these plans.

310
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:22,500
So just very high level. Next question.

311
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:29,970
So we might ask, is this trying to anticipate questions people ask for benefits is how much does it cost?

312
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:36,810
Right. So you can see here we've broke it out into pie charts as are able to see that segment.

313
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:49,170
Okay. You could see our university contribution spend is about 938 million in 2022.

314
00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:53,970
It's 584 million. That's the employee contributions.

315
00:34:54,750 --> 00:35:03,720
So we're managing about 1.5 billion when you add it all together, that last pie chart of benefits at the university.

316
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:08,219
So we're managing quite a bit now.

317
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:14,879
When somebody looks at these charts, they say, you know, you look at you got health care at 58%.

318
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:19,590
You see that's the most expensive benefit for the university.

319
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:30,600
And then next one's retirement contribution at 37.4%, you get a bunch of little buckets for dental, disability, life insurance, that 155,000.

320
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:35,190
So that small rate plan, the health reimbursement arrangement that we have for the trades union.

321
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:44,970
So when somebody looks at this and says, well, the university needs to actually cut costs now we need to look at ways of saving money.

322
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:49,950
What two buckets are they going to be looking at to try and save money?

323
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:55,110
It's going to be going to be the health care bucket, right? It's going to be retirement.

324
00:35:55,590 --> 00:36:03,510
So a lot of our focus on the finance and has been to really kind of really manage those benefits.

325
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:07,080
Health care, of course, includes prescription drugs.

326
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:16,740
So, you know, we've had some committee groups over the years taking a look at at how we could reduce retirement cost,

327
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:21,060
how they could reduce health care costs.

328
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:24,720
Part of the example I gave earlier where we put in the salary banding,

329
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:30,209
where we kind of kept the lower paid employees kind of harmless, a little, little bit of a change.

330
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:34,680
But it's really the higher paid employees that are actually going to end up paying more.

331
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:38,940
And that's how the university saved my it's a shifting of costs really to the employee.

332
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:47,430
That's one way we can do it. We did differentiate contributions for part time employees and for retirees.

333
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:57,330
We created some some grandfathered groups. So every couple of years we had a reduction in and the contribution towards retiree health.

334
00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:05,710
And change the eligibility rules. So it made it a little bit harder for somebody to retire with benefits at the university.

335
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:10,650
So those are some of the things that we've done in the past to kind of help contain the costs a little bit.

336
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:19,730
You can always pull co-pay, co-pay levers, too. You know, we want to be able to reduce, you know, people going to the emergency room.

337
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:23,250
We don't need to go to the emergency room. That should be going to their primary care physician.

338
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:33,180
So, you know, tack on $100 co-pay to discourage people from going to the emergency room when they when they don't need to.

339
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:37,980
And if you go to the emergency room and you're admitted that copays wait.

340
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:43,260
So it's like you're you're there for the right reason there because you have an ear infection.

341
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:46,750
There's there's a less costly way to get your care.

342
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:58,140
So go to go see your primary care physician or go to a, you know, get get care somewhere else other than the emergency room.

343
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:04,829
So for the retirement savings plan, we did a couple of things in the last ten, 15 years.

344
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:09,299
We instituted a one year waiting period for university contributions.

345
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:16,470
We allow people to enroll in the plan. But the university has a lot of people that that are that come in and leave within one year.

346
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:21,880
So they're not on that part of the staff for very long.

347
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:26,270
So we instituted a one year waiting period to get get a university contribution.

348
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:34,830
So you got to be here a full year before you get it. Also, we limited the university contribution to base pay only.

349
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:42,420
So that was another thing that we did. We were writing contributions and overtime pay and other things, so.

350
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:46,360
Just ways that we could reduce cost and save money.

351
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:51,830
So that's the kind of bucket that people go to for those two buckets when they're looking for us to cut cost.

352
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:56,480
Yeah. Approximately how many individuals are benefits eligible?

353
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,250
Oh, let's see how many in benefits eligible.

354
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:10,820
So, yeah, you know, we probably have about 5000 waived employees and retirees that don't pick up our benefits.

355
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:16,070
So, uh, how about 67,000?

356
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:23,270
Just this one number of employees. Now, we don't have information on their dependents, so we won't be able to give you a dependent count.

357
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:30,590
But there are there is about 5000 ways that you we're not seeing in those numbers if.

358
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:38,720
So employer contributions is kind of interesting though too, because from our standpoint,

359
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:44,150
we watch that because we've instituted some programs, particularly in the retirement savings plan.

360
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:52,040
And you can see the retirement savings plan is actually, you know, 62% of the of the employee contributions.

361
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:57,530
And it's a much bigger piece of the pie than that related to health care.

362
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:07,740
So one of the things that we implemented in that space was a deferred compensation plan about ten, 15 years ago.

363
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:11,179
It's called 457 B Deferred Compensation,

364
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:20,870
which allowed employees to put in an additional $20,000 or so on top of what they could put in the retirement plan way of savings.

365
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:25,550
So also, we created some Roth options for them.

366
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:33,229
So Roth option, the way those work are is that you get taxed up front when usually it usually it works.

367
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:38,420
Is that in retirement funds you would you would it come out pretax or contributions

368
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:44,480
come out pretax profits reverse your your contributions come out after tax.

369
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:52,490
And and that's kind of advantage for people because one day they allow their balances to accumulate in the retirement fund.

370
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:58,120
They don't get taxed on the back end. So when they pull their money out they're not getting taxed.

371
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:08,440
Way it works. Before Rosberg for round they you saw a lot of you know that the dollars and contributions came out

372
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:12,630
pretax and then you'd have to be taxed when you pull it out when your balance was a lot higher.

373
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,940
So people like the Roth options.

374
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:20,139
So and they're like the 457 B options.

375
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:25,330
So for the first time it's actually switched over about three or four years ago.

376
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:29,739
The employee contributions, as I told you, for you do a ten five match.

377
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:33,700
So the employee employer contributions 10%, right?

378
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:42,249
So that's 351 million B employee contributions actually now higher than that, 364 million.

379
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:48,490
So our employees are put you know, they're only putting having required to put in a matching 5% to get their 10%.

380
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:53,320
They're actually now putting in more dollars than what the university has into the retirement accounts.

381
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:59,500
Three or four years ago, that was not the case. And we look at the ten year charts which we have for trending.

382
00:42:00,130 --> 00:42:04,060
You can see that that's much lower ten years ago than what the university is putting in.

383
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:13,570
It's more like 9% and total, so putting over 10% of their income into different retirement vehicles now.

384
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:19,990
So kind of shows kind of a success that we've had with with those additional options for retirement.

385
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:28,089
And obviously, when you look at the totals, obviously health care and retirement savings are the two biggest buckets here.

386
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:31,720
And then total contributions. It's well over 90% of the total.

387
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:36,560
Any questions on our cost?

388
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:50,960
The next chart I'm showing here is just a comparison over time between the U.S. University contribution and the employer contribution pieces here.

389
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:58,060
So you can see that ten years ago I went up from 584 million to 903.

390
00:42:58,230 --> 00:43:03,370
That seems like a big jump in examining that number.

391
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,880
Half of that is just due to growth in the population.

392
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:13,930
We had only 49,000 health care contracts back in 2012.

393
00:43:14,350 --> 00:43:22,090
Our at 62,000. So half of that growth in our our cost is due to just the university just growing.

394
00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:25,610
And a lot of that growth has been at Michigan Medicine. You know,

395
00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:35,200
they got new facilities down Northville that they didn't have before and brighten and and there's that much larger health care provider right now.

396
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:40,660
So more bodies at the health system, more retirees.

397
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:46,750
Our retiree population is growing as well. So those are the big factors as far as population growth.

398
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:55,480
The other growth factor factors has just been, you know, retirement savings just being a part of that's a percent of salary benefit.

399
00:43:55,690 --> 00:44:00,670
So people are making more than they did ten years ago. So there's more contributions going in.

400
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:06,310
And to those for those individuals that are they're making more than they did ten years ago.

401
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:11,160
So also just medical trends, right.

402
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:16,300
So there's on the medical side, the other piece of that would just be, you know, we're paying more per person.

403
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:22,240
So there are some some growth and trends in health care cost that we have to deal with.

404
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:28,559
So those are the two pi as the two pi pies on on the left hand side there.

405
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:33,570
That's the university contribution and then the employee contribution.

406
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:42,930
So you can see those stacking up. And again, if you look at 2012 number for retirement savings, that's 203 million.

407
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:57,390
You see was 229 million. So that's less than 99% contribution for employees with the 229 10% and the two, two or three is about 9%.

408
00:44:58,290 --> 00:45:05,040
So that's you know, we've seen a growth and in what employees are doing as far as saving for retirement.

409
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:15,520
So strategies that are actually working for us. Right. Any questions on these two trends?

410
00:45:15,670 --> 00:45:19,190
Trend charts. Okay.

411
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:28,840
So when you actually get your own job and you get your own benefits and look at how much your employer's going to be asking you for your basic costs,

412
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:37,660
and then you see cost. But then also managing what you think and what you know about your own staff and what they're doing and what the costs are.

413
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:48,070
Because that rules all up. You saw that we talked about total, total, total rewards, total money, and just trying to apply that for you personally,

414
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:53,179
but also not only the stats that you have, but how you are engaged within that employer.

415
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:56,440
And who's looking at that? Who's monitoring that? What does that look like?

416
00:45:56,440 --> 00:46:00,010
Why are you concerned? Why are you paying $500 for your benefits?

417
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:05,350
Can a medical assistant pay $500 out of their pocket every time for their portion?

418
00:46:05,830 --> 00:46:11,110
Who's who's making those decisions? And it's coming to you if you do not have a benefits department.

419
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:15,400
We talked about outsourcing. h.R. What does this look like for you?

420
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:23,560
How are you making these decisions? How will you question making these decisions?

421
00:46:25,090 --> 00:46:28,930
It's you and your staff and the physicians and you going to provide some benefits.

422
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:33,070
You might use a vendor like what are you looking at exactly?

423
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:38,640
Just trying to spin the wheel, giving you a little bit more insight into it now.

424
00:46:39,010 --> 00:46:44,050
So it's important. Pay attention. Those things. We have a lot of faculty members that do and they let us know it.

425
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:52,030
I think as time goes on, sometimes they don't know what they're talking about.

426
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:58,180
Yeah, but you know, I mean, everybody's got to get a level set on understanding benefits.

427
00:46:58,180 --> 00:47:07,450
It's not always easy and you have to be able to explain it to them in a way that just, you know, for this particular service, you needed an author,

428
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:15,610
you know, prior authorization from your doctor to go do that, you know, so that will work with the vendor and see if we can't get that get that paid.

429
00:47:15,850 --> 00:47:20,950
So, you know, those kind of things. So this is our benefit index.

430
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:26,410
Benefit index is actually produced by Agent Hewitt, what we do.

431
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:37,990
So that's our benchmarking study. So what we what we do is we get our peer list for, for the university from the provost office.

432
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:43,000
They look at recruit and retain it efforts for faculty and say, okay,

433
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:53,440
here are the top 20 or 25 institutions that that were either losing faculty to or that were for hiring faculty from.

434
00:47:53,680 --> 00:48:04,270
So that is, you know, we we use that list of recruiting retention to kind of build our our pure list for benefits.

435
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:11,470
And now they have to have the the peer actually in the database for us to use them.

436
00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:18,760
So we actually have 23 peers for the university based on that criteria for the health system,

437
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:23,380
there's not a lot of mental system space as far as peers.

438
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:32,139
There's only about nine other actually in the database. They would like to have more, but you can see how how this kind of stacks up.

439
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:39,280
So what anyone will do is they'll they'll average our peer group to be a score of 100 across the board.

440
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:44,139
So they look at our peers benefits and say, okay, we're going to average all those peers.

441
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:52,450
So that that and every benefit it's a it's a 100. And so if you score more than 100, your benefits are more generous than your peers.

442
00:48:53,110 --> 00:48:58,360
You score less than 100. Your your your benefit is less generous.

443
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:06,190
So on the thing that we look at, there's total value on here and employer value sum total values,

444
00:49:06,190 --> 00:49:10,770
the yellow, yellow bars and the employer values that we pass,

445
00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:15,370
we focus more on the employer value because the total value is just to start plan,

446
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:20,210
site plan design that both the employer and employee contributes to.

447
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:25,930
So we know we have a pretty generous plan and science here at the university faculty side,

448
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:32,290
we score 105, which is good on the all benefits score and employer paid values score.

449
00:49:32,290 --> 00:49:35,290
We score 100, so we're right at pure average.

450
00:49:37,330 --> 00:49:40,900
About 15 years ago we were actually at 107.

451
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:49,210
So and then we started making all those changes, subscribing earlier to get us back down to where our peers were.

452
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:54,309
So, so all benefits were at 100.

453
00:49:54,310 --> 00:49:59,080
And so just focus on the blue bars as we go across all health and welfare and retirement.

454
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:05,600
That is just a score that excludes paid time off. We don't manage paid time off the benefits office.

455
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:12,160
We thought we should have a score for ourselves. So so we got them to take paid time off out of the equation.

456
00:50:12,970 --> 00:50:16,510
Paid time off, actually dragged our score down. And I'll get to that in a second.

457
00:50:17,470 --> 00:50:24,950
Retirement income. We're at 10%, and that's the average of our peers in the university sector is about 9.1.

458
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,360
So we're slightly more generous as far as a contribution.

459
00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:35,330
We're not the most generous. I think there's one that actually gets 15 and requires no match.

460
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:40,450
So that would say we would drag our sport on just a little bit.

461
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:50,930
Overall, we're doing better than our peers. On average, health care, we're a little bit better due to our lower contributions for our employees.

462
00:50:51,110 --> 00:50:56,850
Basically is helping our score there sort of slightly better than ten universities.

463
00:50:56,870 --> 00:51:03,830
We have our own health system. So there there's ways we can negotiate with our own health system and keep our costs down.

464
00:51:04,250 --> 00:51:07,490
And we'll get to some of that maybe a little bit later in the presentation.

465
00:51:09,050 --> 00:51:14,510
Health care costs for retirees. Now we're one we're one of 15 peers.

466
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:19,970
There's like 15 peers actually actually have a gives a contribution towards retiree health.

467
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:25,909
There are a few that provide access only, which means the retiree has to give access to the benefit.

468
00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:27,890
But the retiree has been hundred percent of the cost.

469
00:51:28,850 --> 00:51:33,560
So there's access all in and there's a couple universities that don't offer it at all to the retirees.

470
00:51:34,670 --> 00:51:42,500
So we're at 119. But when you strip that down and look at those that just contribute, those 15 versus us,

471
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:46,070
we're all kind of right in the middle of the pack with those those universities.

472
00:51:46,370 --> 00:51:51,350
As far as what were our contribution levels paid time off.

473
00:51:52,830 --> 00:51:56,750
Real close here. Obviously, there's heavy weighting in the paid time off category.

474
00:51:58,230 --> 00:52:00,709
You've got vacation schedules, peatos.

475
00:52:00,710 --> 00:52:11,750
When you get to the health system chart, the biggest difference here is happy holidays where you count season days and are our holidays.

476
00:52:11,930 --> 00:52:16,010
We have 11 paid holidays here at university.

477
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:25,760
Our peers are averaging about 13.4. So slightly higher there, which is by our score, gets just a little bit better death benefit.

478
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:32,620
Like I mentioned earlier, on the university side, we have a $3,000 benefit which is lower more than the industry average.

479
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:35,810
So that's why we're lower there. Long term disability or higher?

480
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:43,730
A lot of places only offer benefit, continuation or I'm sorry, salary replacement continuation.

481
00:52:43,730 --> 00:52:50,840
So they'll look at your you're making a hundred thousand, you get a 65% salary replacement, they'll give you a $65,000.

482
00:52:51,170 --> 00:52:58,240
That's all they give you. They don't continue your benefits. One of the things that we do that's nice at the University of those at LG,

483
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,900
we we look at the data and say, we're going to continue your benefits while you're disabled.

484
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:11,390
And that's why our scores are much higher. They're cash based benefits for this chart is looking only at dependent benefit.

485
00:53:13,850 --> 00:53:20,450
Dependent benefit. Tuition reimbursement university doesn't offer it.

486
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:26,960
18 of our 23 peers have some form of dependent benefit tuition reimbursement.

487
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:33,600
Still a sore spot with our faculty. I mean, it's a kind of game.

488
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:41,110
But, you know, if you add something here and you're still want to be at 100, you're going to have to to change something else.

489
00:53:41,110 --> 00:53:44,110
I guess that's the only way we're going to kind of balance that out.

490
00:53:46,630 --> 00:53:52,960
Doesn't score high, doesn't factor in to the overall score that much because for the benefit index, you have to have people that are.

491
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:57,530
No dependents at the age that they would be actually getting the benefit.

492
00:53:57,580 --> 00:54:04,350
Right. So you you've got to have a group of employees that are have kids in that 18 to 20 to,

493
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:08,080
you know, age range that for that dependents benefit would kick in.

494
00:54:09,530 --> 00:54:13,160
Any questions on that? On the faculty peer?

495
00:54:14,410 --> 00:54:19,569
That's. It's here in Michigan.

496
00:54:19,570 --> 00:54:22,300
Medicine score is much higher. It's 122.

497
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:33,160
One of the things that's nice and then Michigan has to consider this a recruitment and retention advantage for them is that they offer university

498
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:42,880
benefits because in the health care industry that they're training themselves to hear health systems don't offer that great of a benefits package,

499
00:54:43,510 --> 00:54:55,270
to be honest. So our score here goes off the chart because of our not necessarily when we compare ourselves to the health system industry,

500
00:54:55,270 --> 00:55:00,730
we're just much higher than that. They do offer usually pretty good health care benefits.

501
00:55:02,410 --> 00:55:06,580
They're in the health care industry. And so they they want people to go go use our health system.

502
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:11,559
So so just a couple numbers to point out here.

503
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:14,800
You know, retirement income is really high. It's weighted, weighted pretty high.

504
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:25,749
And the index at 143. And that's because our 10% match applies to the health system and there are average of the peer groups.

505
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:31,810
5.7 So significantly higher retiree health care.

506
00:55:32,950 --> 00:55:40,420
We didn't have enough bars to to what extend the chart any further they go up to 651.

507
00:55:40,750 --> 00:55:50,350
That's a pretty high score. Only two other health systems in the database actually have a retiree health program that they're contributing to.

508
00:55:50,410 --> 00:56:00,370
So that's two out of nine. So that that really makes the score look really out of whack for for for for the health system.

509
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:05,510
Paid time off, so they have a more generous PTO schedule. I talked about LTV.

510
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:08,930
The cash base benefits a little bit different here.

511
00:56:08,930 --> 00:56:14,030
They don't look at dependent tuition reimbursement only they're looking at tuition benefit and,

512
00:56:14,230 --> 00:56:16,880
you know, adoption credits, you know, some other things that they're looking at,

513
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:24,630
the fact that they're tied to the university and they're eligible for the tuition benefit way,

514
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:29,180
assistance benefit for tuition, and they actually score a little bit higher here.

515
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:37,570
For more than 100. That's some of the differences between, you know, university and health system.

516
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:47,180
Any questions on that? So you take a look at this entire chart.

517
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:53,120
Hopefully you can see the value in somebody who doesn't know anything about university benefits.

518
00:56:53,450 --> 00:56:53,750
Right.

519
00:56:54,380 --> 00:57:00,709
They're seeing something for the first time that you can actually walk through this and have them get to study a higher level understanding, you know,

520
00:57:00,710 --> 00:57:03,050
understanding of our enrollment and our standard cost,

521
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:11,030
understanding of how we compete against our peer groups and where we set the market for those those types of benefits.

522
00:57:11,030 --> 00:57:15,200
And before I move on to the next.

523
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:21,900
And then you get the question.

524
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:25,450
Yeah, what about enrollment satisfaction?

525
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:32,040
Like, how do they feel about all those different categories? Like, yes, you may be higher than your peers, but are they still satisfied?

526
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:40,820
Oh, yeah, we're we do you know, we do an open enrollment survey every year that employees can participate in and they can let us know.

527
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:45,719
You know, how satisfied or dissatisfied they're with their benefits?

528
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:54,570
Yes, we're we're doing those kind of things as well. Our vendors will actually do those as well and want to know for their own information.

529
00:57:54,570 --> 00:57:57,960
They'll share that data with us as far as satisfaction.

530
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:12,090
We never know. We've had a few plans that people were very dissatisfied with at hand and vendors, so we actually did move off of them over over time.

531
00:58:12,810 --> 00:58:19,290
I'd say most of our vendors now are getting pretty, pretty high satisfaction scores with our employees.

532
00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:26,549
It can change. The other companies are making changes all the time.

533
00:58:26,550 --> 00:58:33,480
Are vendors making changes all the time. And sometimes those changes don't necessarily equate to customer service very well.

534
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:36,960
And so they will start seeing their the scores go down.

535
00:58:40,390 --> 00:58:45,530
Any other questions? I ask that you challenge in your fellowships?

536
00:58:46,430 --> 00:58:50,870
Just asking. Just simple questions. Someone help me explain or understand.

537
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:56,600
Your benefits. You say you have benefits. What are they and what does it mean to that employer?

538
00:58:57,290 --> 00:59:03,350
Especially if you've got a preceptor, you're linked with someone. Sometime during your fellowship.

539
00:59:07,590 --> 00:59:15,340
So. Now that you have that basic understanding of our benefits, now we can drill down into like specific benefits.

540
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:23,700
We develop dashboards for health, medical, our access to that one for retirement savings plan.

541
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:32,640
And one of the questions that people, when they get specific about retirement savings plan is are people say, are people saving enough for retirement?

542
00:59:33,420 --> 00:59:42,220
So you go out and find benchmarks to say, okay, well, people need to have X number X times their salary at the point of retirement to retire.

543
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:49,870
So you're able to compare those and that information. But again, we'll kind of limit our dashboards to being information about, you know,

544
00:59:49,890 --> 00:59:55,080
the top five or ten things that we think that somebody might want to know about our benefits specifically.

545
00:59:55,740 --> 00:59:59,879
So while we've got that on nice overall dashboard that we can share with somebody,

546
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:05,340
now we've got somebody who wants to get into the details, the information about our health plans.

547
01:00:06,030 --> 01:00:11,129
And I got walk through a lot of these lot numbers on on the page and I have for you with numbers I know we don't

548
01:00:11,130 --> 01:00:17,400
have a lot of time so but one of the things some of the things that we have on here that we can talk about,

549
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:21,390
so just financial highlights, you know, we're self-insured.

550
01:00:21,450 --> 01:00:33,080
So we're responsible for, as I said earlier, the gains and losses resulting from where we set our premiums and and and the claims that are coming out.

551
01:00:33,090 --> 01:00:43,440
So we have reserves now. We have, you know, our you know, depending on the activity that's going on in the in the health plan,

552
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:47,010
we're able if we're either adding to that surplus or we're taking away.

553
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:52,350
We've been pretty healthy position.

554
01:00:52,770 --> 01:00:56,060
We've been trying to give dollars back through the premium model, you know,

555
01:00:56,100 --> 01:01:02,700
so charge lower premiums more than we expected the expenses to be so that we can give it back

556
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:06,660
to the employees and give it back to the departments that are paying those low that cost.

557
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:17,370
So basic income and, you know, some some real statistics, indicators on a per employee per member basis.

558
01:01:17,370 --> 01:01:20,969
So we're getting kind of into how much does it cost per employee?

559
01:01:20,970 --> 01:01:26,310
How much does it cost per member? We have our balance sheet card numbers on here as well.

560
01:01:27,630 --> 01:01:31,890
We'll tell you some of the challenges that we've kind of had in 2021.

561
01:01:33,180 --> 01:01:41,790
You know, we were not you know, we're a little bit higher on the expense on prescription drugs than than than what we had projected.

562
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:44,760
A couple of things happened.

563
01:01:44,790 --> 01:01:55,650
And particularly at the end of 2021, there were some new drugs on weight loss and diabetes that came out, injectable drugs that were really expensive.

564
01:01:56,520 --> 01:02:01,350
And, you know, that was those those hit the market.

565
01:02:01,810 --> 01:02:06,360
Our cost for those drugs and the utilization skyrocketed for those.

566
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:17,520
So that was something we weren't anticipating. Specialty drugs, largely injectable type drugs, they're very expensive.

567
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:22,829
They're about 2% of our our prescription drug scripts. But right now, it's about 55% of our plan.

568
01:02:22,830 --> 01:02:27,120
Spend had a much higher trend rate than normal.

569
01:02:27,610 --> 01:02:34,200
We used to seeing double digit ten trend rates and specialty drugs, but it's closer to 20% last year.

570
01:02:34,210 --> 01:02:43,080
So that was kind of a shocker to us as well. So specialty drugs is kind of driving some for some of our performance.

571
01:02:44,550 --> 01:02:46,550
So we have financial highlights on here.

572
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:52,799
And so I get into more details about per employee, per member costs as well as showing a financial statements.

573
01:02:52,800 --> 01:03:02,850
As far as, you know, income statement and balance sheet were where we set I won't go through the numbers are going to play by the sleepier stuff.

574
01:03:04,020 --> 01:03:11,820
You know, we had more detailed enrollment figures here, you know, table two here as the enrollment figures by plan.

575
01:03:13,050 --> 01:03:18,570
So you can see how much is rolled in and premier care versus the people impact here in Michigan care plan.

576
01:03:19,530 --> 01:03:23,429
One thing that's interesting is that we introduced Michigan Care in 2021.

577
01:03:23,430 --> 01:03:32,399
It was a new plan in 2021. So you see that the enrollment was zero and now it's 3000, 3000 and the member accounts at 6671.

578
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:35,430
So that was our our initial rollout of the product.

579
01:03:36,030 --> 01:03:39,170
And it kind of shows where most of those members came from. Right.

580
01:03:39,450 --> 01:03:44,130
You can see that most of them came from primary care. Very similar plan.

581
01:03:45,060 --> 01:03:49,470
Rick Perry has a network. It's primarily southeast Michigan,

582
01:03:49,980 --> 01:03:59,610
but Michigan has a more narrow network and it's just basically across Michigan are University of Michigan and Saint John's as the network hospitals.

583
01:04:01,050 --> 01:04:05,440
So. Market comparison.

584
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:10,470
You'll see the benefit index on here as well. There is another indicator that we look at.

585
01:04:10,770 --> 01:04:18,270
It's called the Health Health Value Initiative. Again, this is another one that Aegon actually puts together for us.

586
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:24,120
You can see based on the pie charts, how much the university is actually contributes to health care.

587
01:04:24,930 --> 01:04:31,200
And the blue box, yellow boxes, employee contributions, and then the red boxes of pocket cost.

588
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:37,820
So you can see that the university's pie is a lot or the bar is a lot lower than our peers.

589
01:04:38,070 --> 01:04:44,180
There's a few reasons for that. We have some, you know, very effective management of care.

590
01:04:44,330 --> 01:04:50,390
We also have our costs is a little bit lower because our dependent ratio is as favorable to us.

591
01:04:53,090 --> 01:05:02,210
We have about 1.9 members per contract, or even in most universities it's about 2.2.

592
01:05:02,390 --> 01:05:06,280
So you're going to add cost per premium for for each employee.

593
01:05:06,290 --> 01:05:10,790
You get to tell that, you know, there's more dependents in some of the other other other universities.

594
01:05:11,630 --> 01:05:16,100
The Pathfinders Group would be other universities here and HPI, that's the entire index.

595
01:05:16,100 --> 01:05:25,040
So you can see we have much lower out-of-pocket costs and a much higher university percentage of our paying for our plans.

596
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:32,140
We're at 74%. Rest of the universities in the database are at 71%.

597
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:41,050
So we're contributing more to a much smaller overall total, if you will.

598
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:53,430
The benefit and access down there. We do a comparison here on premiums, also comparing that to industry.

599
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:58,440
So the broad dollars per employee are on the.

600
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:11,990
Back over here. Table four here you can see the contributions of employee and see how that's trended over time.

601
01:06:12,260 --> 01:06:20,510
Hmm. Those are two straight premium dollars university and then the employee contributions and see what levels those have been out.

602
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:23,540
And then we can look at premium trends.

603
01:06:23,540 --> 01:06:34,490
So Siegal does a national benchmarking of premium trends, so we can benchmark ourselves against that and you can see the lines going up and down.

604
01:06:34,820 --> 01:06:43,090
A lot of this was impacted by the pandemic. Yeah. So you saw 2020 look a little drop for the industry a little bit there.

605
01:06:43,110 --> 01:06:47,540
They're giving back premiums during the year, changing their formulas.

606
01:06:48,860 --> 01:06:54,200
We did not do that because we were already in a good position with where we're at as far as premiums.

607
01:06:54,650 --> 01:07:00,500
But you can see our premium average increase, which is the dotted line at the bottom, was less than 2%.

608
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:05,320
You can see that single average is about 5.5.

609
01:07:06,070 --> 01:07:10,600
So we're premiums we're going up less than what what we saw in the industry.

610
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:14,950
Part of that was also we're giving back we've been giving back surpluses.

611
01:07:15,580 --> 01:07:19,960
Right. So we've been keeping our rates lower because we wanted to get back money through the through our rate model.

612
01:07:20,050 --> 01:07:26,770
So that's lower premiums. You look at table six, this compares our planned expense on a per member basis.

613
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:32,260
So it's a little bit different as a per employee basis before, but this is on a per member basis.

614
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:36,430
You can see how that's grown over time and you can see that dip in 2020.

615
01:07:37,780 --> 01:07:48,430
So 2020 was, of course, the pandemic year where health systems were shut down only handling COVID patients.

616
01:07:49,030 --> 01:07:53,050
Didn't get outpatient services for about six, six weeks, seven weeks.

617
01:07:53,770 --> 01:08:01,719
Can't go see your physician for that same amount of time. Everything was geared towards the pandemic, so we saw a dip in our overall cost.

618
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:06,040
They're expecting a bounce back in 21, and that's what we saw.

619
01:08:06,820 --> 01:08:14,620
You look at the percentages over here both and industry, which in this case is that the east and southeast Michigan trend,

620
01:08:14,620 --> 01:08:20,820
you can see as it went up to 13.9%, our trend went up to 11.5%.

621
01:08:20,830 --> 01:08:28,090
But you can see the dip that both we experienced and and the and benchmark experienced in 2020.

622
01:08:28,780 --> 01:08:37,360
So averaged out really just trend to continuing IBM of the same spot.

623
01:08:37,690 --> 01:08:44,700
That's what we were expecting. So I get some information on trends for our health plans.

624
01:08:45,660 --> 01:08:50,160
One of the things is what areas of health care are experiencing the growth?

625
01:08:50,650 --> 01:08:57,960
Right. So you look at table eight here, we're able to see that because it was a pandemic year,

626
01:08:58,620 --> 01:09:07,349
a lot of outpatient use contributed $20 of the $60 change that we saw on a per member per month.

627
01:09:07,350 --> 01:09:11,819
So about a third of that was for outpatient services, professional use.

628
01:09:11,820 --> 01:09:20,030
That's that's gone to your primary care physician and your doctor's offices, you know, contribute another 12 or $13 to that.

629
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:24,040
So and then you see the arts pieces at the bottom.

630
01:09:24,060 --> 01:09:27,330
So use and price, which was kind of unexpected for us.

631
01:09:31,340 --> 01:09:35,690
Then the church, everybody was at the university, this church, nine.

632
01:09:36,710 --> 01:09:41,690
We are our own health care provider, right? So we know how much of that money is coming right back into the university.

633
01:09:41,740 --> 01:09:48,740
Right. So you saw the numbers on that. Are medical costs $550 million or so?

634
01:09:50,180 --> 01:09:53,360
Ah, that's, you know, admin costs and other things.

635
01:09:53,380 --> 01:09:57,560
But the pure claims dollars throwing through the medical plan,

636
01:09:57,680 --> 01:10:04,200
you can see how much of that is coming back into Michigan medicine, 58% of our spending goes right back into Michigan bars.

637
01:10:04,250 --> 01:10:10,940
And so while our premiums are high, it's also feeding, you know, revenue to Michigan medicine.

638
01:10:10,940 --> 01:10:18,379
So so that's a that's a good thing. And it can't be much more than that.

639
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:23,270
I mean, Michigan medicine is is at capacity a lot.

640
01:10:23,570 --> 01:10:26,059
So, you know, there's a there is a thought.

641
01:10:26,060 --> 01:10:30,800
Well, all these services that didn't get done during the pandemic, we're going to get done in 2021 because,

642
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:35,290
you know, if people people didn't get the surgeries that they needed,

643
01:10:35,450 --> 01:10:43,310
but we have we see a huge bump more than what the natural trend would have been because the health system was already at capacity,

644
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:47,930
so that all the health systems in this area are at capacity.

645
01:10:47,990 --> 01:10:55,700
They couldn't schedule more services. They didn't have the bed space to schedule more services to to make up for that loss in time.

646
01:10:55,700 --> 01:10:58,939
So. And then you can see what?

647
01:10:58,940 --> 01:11:07,169
Puckett. Okay. Well, you know, we're here to tell you that, you know, facility outpatient services went up, you know, $20 to the total.

648
01:11:07,170 --> 01:11:12,350
Well, how much of that is the total spend for a health care facility?

649
01:11:12,350 --> 01:11:15,530
Outpatient by far is our largest spend in health care.

650
01:11:15,950 --> 01:11:23,740
36%. Facility and in-patient 16% and drugs at 20%.

651
01:11:25,370 --> 01:11:28,339
So again, this is just a dashboard.

652
01:11:28,340 --> 01:11:40,310
This allows us to take more of a deeper dive into the health care I get and be able to kind of explain to people at a high level ten charts,

653
01:11:40,610 --> 01:11:47,540
you know, you take away ten pieces of information on each chart, and that's about what we would expect to know.

654
01:11:47,540 --> 01:11:57,679
We're talking to leadership. You know, these are their takeaways. Now I can go through the medical plan to really have a few minutes here.

655
01:11:57,680 --> 01:12:03,560
But one thing I want one say I do want to point out is that, you know, we got the help.

656
01:12:03,890 --> 01:12:08,450
We showed you the overall benefits dashboard and got into specifically the health plan dashboard.

657
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:12,799
Now we have the you know, both the health plans, medical and our X, right?

658
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:16,040
So now we can take a deeper dive in the medical piece here.

659
01:12:16,070 --> 01:12:22,850
So we do have we do have our dashboards. But, you know, the thing that, you know, that's critical,

660
01:12:22,850 --> 01:12:28,310
a lot of the same stuff ends up on both dashboards, trends and stuff like that, specifically for medical.

661
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:37,010
But this particular chart here, I don't know if you guys can see it, our top, you know, 15 conditions or so and spend.

662
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:44,210
So when you get to something like cancer is it's not really a heck of a lot you can do to manage that.

663
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:51,980
But for diabetes, we do have a program that we started the benefits office working with our vendors,

664
01:12:52,550 --> 01:12:57,260
a diabetes prevention program, looking at people that are at risk for diabetes,

665
01:12:57,260 --> 01:12:59,850
type two diabetes and and, you know,

666
01:12:59,930 --> 01:13:10,430
getting them in a program to help them with their condition and lower their probability of being diabetic in the future.

667
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:17,990
You know, we've had success with the program. Those that have participated have seen good results.

668
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:25,340
Unfortunately, it's a voluntary program and you only get like five or 6% of the people participating in those programs.

669
01:13:25,340 --> 01:13:26,590
So it's a challenge.

670
01:13:26,610 --> 01:13:36,680
It's a challenge to get people to participate, you know, so we can use this to kind of, you know, look at areas that we can program with.

671
01:13:36,980 --> 01:13:45,380
Obviously, we have a healthy unit that tries to help employees work on, you know, their overall health.

672
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:49,880
You get see, the obesity is one of those conditions that show up on here.

673
01:13:51,050 --> 01:14:02,750
So exercise active, you weightwatchers those kind of things that we can we can do to to help that depression obviously is you know,

674
01:14:02,750 --> 01:14:08,720
that's kind of been growing a little bit for us over over time.

675
01:14:10,260 --> 01:14:12,010
I think it's just part of it.

676
01:14:12,020 --> 01:14:20,659
Maybe just mental health awareness contributes a lot to that increasing and then having mental health parity where people are not,

677
01:14:20,660 --> 01:14:26,280
you know, it's okay to get services if you're if you have mental illnesses and stuff like that.

678
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:28,250
And then exciting is also on here.

679
01:14:28,580 --> 01:14:34,640
So we can use a lot of this data and say, okay, well what can we do to help people with with these specific conditions?

680
01:14:35,210 --> 01:14:39,050
So we help these people with these specific conditions we might be able to help or cost.

681
01:14:39,290 --> 01:14:42,559
Right. So that's that's kind of thing that we're looking at.

682
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:47,450
And those programs I just mentioned are a few examples of some of the things we have to actually

683
01:14:47,450 --> 01:14:52,759
have a lower back program on here or back pain programing on here through I'm Healthy.

684
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:56,870
That's a pilot program as well that they're doing so.

685
01:14:58,370 --> 01:15:05,180
Yeah. So we're we're we're experimenting and trying to get, you know, programs in place to help with some of these conditions.

686
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:15,830
All right. Really kind of like this. This is the one I usually focus in on just because it's the symptoms.

687
01:15:16,670 --> 01:15:22,040
You've got 117 contracts and 67,000 members.

688
01:15:22,430 --> 01:15:25,940
They're going somewhere for health care. And who are we?

689
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:29,660
The question we get asked is, how much do you know about my health?

690
01:15:29,930 --> 01:15:37,700
You know, big brother's watching and is my HPI. But when we look at this in aggregate data, it really will help our cost.

691
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:45,950
But it also when our members are going somewhere, our employees will come to your services and you become health care leaders.

692
01:15:46,580 --> 01:15:50,270
They're looking for a certain service. We get that information on the back end.

693
01:15:51,260 --> 01:15:54,919
Both of us should be looking at what do we have as benefits? How are we management?

694
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:59,960
Are we aware? And on your side, it's what are you coming to me for?

695
01:16:00,110 --> 01:16:02,360
What am I seeing in my clinic? Practice? What is it?

696
01:16:02,360 --> 01:16:08,930
And how am I helping rightsize the services being being delivered by those employees that are yours?

697
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:16,970
And so it's it's just important to see the big picture of you as a statistic in this information.

698
01:16:18,590 --> 01:16:27,169
Dez Bryant said, you're one of the 62,000 counts. So when you join an employer, you become the count, somebody watching that.

699
01:16:27,170 --> 01:16:32,660
And then once they know that information, you get a ton of emails, we get a ton of information.

700
01:16:33,020 --> 01:16:39,530
But what are what is your employer really trying to tell you about trying to help control health care costs?

701
01:16:40,340 --> 01:16:43,670
Then what are you as health care leader to your staff?

702
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:48,230
Your place is saying to yours, would it be even in a staff meeting?

703
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:57,240
Would it be on a staff agenda to talk about what's happening in that employer and how your staff can help come up with that?

704
01:16:57,530 --> 01:17:01,130
Let's go walking around the park to be healthy.

705
01:17:01,430 --> 01:17:02,780
What does healthy look like?

706
01:17:03,170 --> 01:17:12,920
These kind of benefits, this kind of level of information and caring, as Bryant said, as part of the recruitment is you can't really get that.

707
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:19,370
But this is where you get the confidence and comfort from a staff person working for you wanting to stay.

708
01:17:19,790 --> 01:17:23,870
And we talked about the longevity of having somebody there and the benefits that they can provide.

709
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:28,790
How are you keeping your employees healthy?

710
01:17:29,150 --> 01:17:32,480
How is the employer keeping the employees healthy?

711
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:38,089
What does that look like? Who's monitoring? What numbers should you be thinking about?

712
01:17:38,090 --> 01:17:43,220
What what information? What does your benefit package look like?

713
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:51,530
I would I don't have my thumb ball here to raise and ask you, but I'm curious, when you got hired, did anybody look at that benefit package?

714
01:17:51,530 --> 01:17:54,530
Can anybody tell me what's in your benefit package?

715
01:17:57,920 --> 01:18:02,150
You just signed away. All right. I don't want to put you on spot, but I'd love to hear.

716
01:18:02,450 --> 01:18:10,459
Tell me what you. Tell me what you know about your benefits. I guess with my internship in CBS, I'm matches me, like, all my contributions.

717
01:18:10,460 --> 01:18:14,120
Like, equally. So that was maybe back. Okay.

718
01:18:14,150 --> 01:18:20,060
All right. All right. Very good. Anybody else knew anything about the benefits?

719
01:18:21,140 --> 01:18:28,210
You going to sign up for long term? My employer will pay my cell phone bill when I graduate.

720
01:18:28,780 --> 01:18:34,030
Right. We and one of the things we didn't get into is pet care.

721
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:45,669
I mean, I just had to bring it up. Just what are what are ways we can have you as an employee come in and say, here's the pot of money.

722
01:18:45,670 --> 01:18:51,990
This is what is a must have and here's a certain portion that you might be able to apply and or, you know, never do.

723
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:56,200
But yeah. So that's a benefit, right? Let me I'll get your medical.

724
01:18:56,200 --> 01:19:00,200
But you've got cell phone, so I won't. So, you know, we don't offer pet insurance at the university.

725
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:03,960
And it's probably the second thing we talked about. We don't. Oh, I see. That's what happens.

726
01:19:04,030 --> 01:19:09,420
Okay. The second most what's behind dependent tuition reimbursement, you know,

727
01:19:09,490 --> 01:19:14,240
when you ask about satisfaction and what we hear and what we do and we did look into it, we were pretty.

728
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:18,549
It's not a good deal. I mean, obviously, you can pay a premium help cover, you know,

729
01:19:18,550 --> 01:19:25,690
things like your your veterinary appointments, your annual checkups, your cat, but they put a cap on it.

730
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:33,100
So anything that's really expensive, like if your dog needed heart surgery, that's why I got paid, like a few hundred bucks here.

731
01:19:33,190 --> 01:19:39,250
Be stuck with a couple thousand dollars. You know, that still doesn't really cover a heck of a lot, so.

732
01:19:39,790 --> 01:19:42,819
Right. Will hang around for a little bit and towards the future.

733
01:19:42,820 --> 01:19:48,520
Now, signing is an issue and it seems like I think you.

734
01:19:58,130 --> 01:19:59,570
They've got hydro.
