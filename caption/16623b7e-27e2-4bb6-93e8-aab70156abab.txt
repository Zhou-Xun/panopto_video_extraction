1
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:09,600
One of the big goals of this

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,040
course is to teach you how to

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,280
analyze data using basic
biostatistical methods.

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,765
To get there, we'll
have to start with

5
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:18,990
understanding datasets
including what they look like,

6
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:20,940
how they're organized and how we

7
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,370
actually code data for analysis.

8
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:25,980
In this module, we'll
go over the details

9
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,830
of the three datasets that
we will use in this course.

10
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,960
A low birth weight
study Data Set,

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,225
the Medical Expenditure
Panel Survey,

12
00:00:33,225 --> 00:00:35,610
and the general social survey.

13
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,240
Now, we're learning objectives
like I stated were to

14
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,960
become familiar with
these three datasets,

15
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,740
and the second goal is to

16
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:44,540
apply the concepts of exposures,

17
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:48,605
outcomes, and supporting
variables to these datasets.

18
00:00:48,605 --> 00:00:51,815
Now, in general a
typical data set

19
00:00:51,815 --> 00:00:53,930
has the following structure.

20
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:56,360
Each individual in your data set

21
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:00,035
comprises a single
row of your dataset.

22
00:01:00,035 --> 00:01:04,160
Whereas each column in your
dataset will correspond to

23
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,215
a single variable
that is measured

24
00:01:06,215 --> 00:01:09,380
on all of the individuals
in your data set.

25
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:12,200
So that each row describes all of

26
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,175
the variables that were collected
on a single individual.

27
00:01:16,175 --> 00:01:20,150
From this dataset, we can
use one column to examine

28
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:22,070
how one variable will vary

29
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:24,575
among all the individuals
in the data set,

30
00:01:24,575 --> 00:01:26,480
and we can use two columns of

31
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,045
the dataset to look
at how two variables

32
00:01:29,045 --> 00:01:30,725
are associated with each other

33
00:01:30,725 --> 00:01:33,535
among all individuals
in the dataset.

34
00:01:33,535 --> 00:01:35,360
The first dataset
that we will use in

35
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,770
this course is the
low-birth-weight dataset.

36
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:39,320
Now, a woman's behavior during

37
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,000
her pregnancy including her diet,

38
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,560
her smoking habits and

39
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,570
whether she received
prenatal care,

40
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:46,370
can all greatly alter the chances

41
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:48,005
of her carrying the baby to term

42
00:01:48,005 --> 00:01:49,910
and consequently of delivering

43
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,860
a baby of normal birth weight.

44
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:54,200
So we have a set
of data containing

45
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,795
11 variables that were
collected in 1986

46
00:01:56,795 --> 00:01:59,690
and a total of a 189
women who were treated at

47
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:02,660
base State Medical Center in
Springfield Massachusetts.

48
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:05,060
These data are publicly
available and were first

49
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:08,275
presented in a textbook that
is cited on the slides.

50
00:02:08,275 --> 00:02:11,675
Now, although these data
are over 30 years old,

51
00:02:11,675 --> 00:02:14,179
low birth weight and
the later outcomes

52
00:02:14,179 --> 00:02:17,870
continue to be a contemporary
issue in maternal health.

53
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:21,095
Now, any good
dataset will also be

54
00:02:21,095 --> 00:02:23,120
supplemented by a data dictionary

55
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,755
and in the Data Dictionary,

56
00:02:24,755 --> 00:02:26,120
you should see a description of

57
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,175
every variable name
and the data set,

58
00:02:28,175 --> 00:02:30,380
as well a description
in words as to

59
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,630
what that variable
would represent.

60
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,085
In this Data Dictionary,

61
00:02:34,085 --> 00:02:35,750
there are 11 rows describing

62
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:39,170
the 11 variables in this dataset.

63
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:42,040
This slide contains a subset of

64
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,150
the data that will be

65
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:45,320
examined in the
low-birth-weight dataset.

66
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,680
As I stated, typically
in all datasets,

67
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,450
the first column will contain

68
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:52,000
a unique identifier
for each subject.

69
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,470
So the first subject in

70
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:56,155
this dataset is given
an identifier four.

71
00:02:56,155 --> 00:02:57,760
It is not necessary that

72
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,440
the first person have
an identifier of

73
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,010
one and follow consecutively
with two, three, etc.

74
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:05,860
We can use any value
we want as long as

75
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:09,415
one value is unique to each
individual in the dataset.

76
00:03:09,415 --> 00:03:11,170
Following this first column are

77
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:12,640
the 10 variables that we will

78
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,335
be analyzing in this course.

79
00:03:14,335 --> 00:03:16,120
As an example, we'll talk about

80
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,939
the second column in this
dataset which represents

81
00:03:18,939 --> 00:03:21,845
whether or not a baby was born

82
00:03:21,845 --> 00:03:25,160
of low birth weight and as
the Data Dictionary states,

83
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,540
a one indicates that yes

84
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,850
this baby was born with
a low birth weight,

85
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:31,910
and a zero will represent that
this baby was not born of

86
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,980
low birth weight
and description of

87
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,450
all the other variables can be

88
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:37,460
seen in the data dictionary.

89
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,215
Now, in this dataset,

90
00:03:39,215 --> 00:03:41,660
we might want to do
an analysis that

91
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:44,390
looks at why a child is
born of low birth weight.

92
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,550
So our outcome variable in

93
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:48,620
that analysis would be

94
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,060
the indicator of
whether the child

95
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:51,860
was born of low birth weight.

96
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:54,305
We might want to know
how low birth weight

97
00:03:54,305 --> 00:03:57,050
is related to whether or not
the mother smoked or not.

98
00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:00,260
So the data contained
in the columns smoke,

99
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:04,310
would contain the exposure
yes for smoking one, or no,

100
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:07,610
no smoking zero and the
relationship of smoking and

101
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:09,500
low birth weight could be

102
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,140
impacted by many other
characteristics of the mother.

103
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,809
For example, that association

104
00:04:14,809 --> 00:04:16,280
might change with
how old the mother

105
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,260
is so that age would
play the role of

106
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:21,640
a supporting variable
in this analysis.

107
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,710
The second dataset
in this course is

108
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:27,860
the Medical Expenditure
Panel Survey or MEPS.

109
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,690
Now, the MEPS is all set of

110
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:32,375
large scale surveys of
families and individuals.

111
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:35,300
Their medical providers
such as doctors, hospitals,

112
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,860
pharmacies and so forth,

113
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,300
as well as employers across

114
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,355
the entirety of
the United States.

115
00:04:40,355 --> 00:04:43,460
The MEPSs contains many surveys.

116
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,850
One of which is the
household component,

117
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,360
and this collects data on

118
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,850
the specific health services
that Americans use,

119
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:51,365
how frequently they use them,

120
00:04:51,365 --> 00:04:53,015
the cost of these services

121
00:04:53,015 --> 00:04:55,925
and how those services
are paid for.

122
00:04:55,925 --> 00:04:59,630
The entirety of MEPS contains
thousands of variables on

123
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:02,975
tens of thousands of individuals
in the United States,

124
00:05:02,975 --> 00:05:05,720
and in this course, we
will use a subset of 23 of

125
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,730
those variables
and we have values

126
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:10,610
measured on just
over 9,000 adults.

127
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:13,295
The Data Dictionary
again tells us

128
00:05:13,295 --> 00:05:16,400
what each column in the
dataset represents,

129
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,830
and you will see that in
this Data Dictionary,

130
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,180
we actually have four columns of

131
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,845
information rather than two,

132
00:05:21,845 --> 00:05:24,800
and that is because much
of the MEPS contains

133
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,660
categorical variables so that

134
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:30,460
each person has one
value in the category.

135
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:33,045
For example, Column B,

136
00:05:33,045 --> 00:05:35,025
the second row in
this Data Dictionary,

137
00:05:35,025 --> 00:05:38,365
describes the region in
which each person lives.

138
00:05:38,365 --> 00:05:39,890
We've divided the
United States into

139
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:41,660
four regions: the Northeast,

140
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,565
the Midwest, The
South and The West.

141
00:05:43,565 --> 00:05:46,070
We did not type the words
Northeast, Midwest,

142
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:48,140
South and West into
the dataset and

143
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,960
instead use a number to
represent each of those regions.

144
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,485
We do this to avoid
data entry errors.

145
00:05:54,485 --> 00:05:57,290
Most statistical analysis
packages are not

146
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,380
case sensitive as
well as misspellings,

147
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,720
and so anything that
does not follow

148
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,760
the same capitalization or

149
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,840
spelling will be seen as
a different category.

150
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,520
Here's an example of
the first few rows of

151
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,260
the MEPS data that
we will examine.

152
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,970
Again, the first column is

153
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:16,040
the unique identifier
for each person

154
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,690
and the remaining
columns describe

155
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:20,290
different variables
for each individual.

156
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:22,140
Again, as an example
of an analysis,

157
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:25,565
we might consider doing
with MEPS data is

158
00:06:25,565 --> 00:06:30,500
examining why BMI varies in
the United States population.

159
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,350
So again, the outcome
of interest in

160
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:36,230
this analysis would be the
BMI of each individual,

161
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:39,530
and we might want to know
how BMI is related to

162
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:43,370
whether or not someone gets
regular physical exercise is

163
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:45,215
indicated in the variable

164
00:06:45,215 --> 00:06:50,090
P-H-Y-E-X-E. How BMI and
exercise are related

165
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:53,390
to each other is a complicated
relationship and could

166
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:56,920
be impacted by for example
how old someone is.

167
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,490
So age would play the role of

168
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:00,560
a supporting variable
in this analysis,

169
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,335
and certainly BMI and
Physical exercise

170
00:07:03,335 --> 00:07:04,640
might also change in

171
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,560
their relationship
depending upon whether

172
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,860
someone indicates that they
currently are a smoker.

173
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:12,965
The final dataset that we'll
be using in this course,

174
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:16,195
comes from the general
social survey or GSS.

175
00:07:16,195 --> 00:07:18,980
Now, this is an ongoing
bi-annual survey

176
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,840
of US adults that
was first started in

177
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,185
1972 by the National
Opinion Research Center

178
00:07:24,185 --> 00:07:26,095
at the University of Chicago.

179
00:07:26,095 --> 00:07:28,100
This study aims to gather data

180
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,199
on contemporary American society

181
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,850
in order to monitor and explain

182
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:34,520
the trends and the
constants in the attitudes,

183
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,400
behaviors and attributes
in US adults.

184
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,170
Now like the MEPS,

185
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:40,580
the GSS is publicly

186
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:43,025
available but it is
an enormous dataset.

187
00:07:43,025 --> 00:07:45,260
So in this class, we
will use a subset of

188
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:48,740
the data that was
collected in 1993.

189
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:51,395
Again, these data come
with a data dictionary

190
00:07:51,395 --> 00:07:54,200
with two columns describing
each variable name,

191
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,840
as well as what each
variable represents

192
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,735
in the dataset in actual words.

193
00:07:59,735 --> 00:08:02,570
Here's an example of
the first few rows of

194
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:05,095
the GSS data that we
will have in this class.

195
00:08:05,095 --> 00:08:06,620
Again, the first
column has a unique

196
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,300
identifier telling you for

197
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,620
each individual what their data

198
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:12,170
are followed by a
series of variables.

199
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:14,015
Now, as I stated earlier,

200
00:08:14,015 --> 00:08:16,220
usually with categorical
variables with words,

201
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:19,210
we typically use numbers to
represent each category.

202
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:20,880
But you will see in
this dataset for

203
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,365
example, one of the variables,

204
00:08:22,365 --> 00:08:25,590
marital status, we
do not have numbers.

205
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,005
We have the actual word

206
00:08:27,005 --> 00:08:29,630
describing the category
for each individual.

207
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:31,660
We certainly can do this in data,

208
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,710
it just increases
our chance of making

209
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,645
typographical or
data entry errors

210
00:08:35,645 --> 00:08:37,430
complicating the Analysis.

211
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:38,930
The other thing I
want to point out in

212
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:42,340
the GSS Data is the
presence of missing values.

213
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,800
Anywhere where we see a blank,

214
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,170
for instance there, we
see in birth month,

215
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:49,385
there is a blank here.

216
00:08:49,385 --> 00:08:51,530
A blank is used to

217
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:54,455
represent an unknown
value for that subject.

218
00:08:54,455 --> 00:08:57,050
Now, the danger of
using blanks is

219
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:58,250
that it may just be that someone

220
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,735
forgot to enter the data.

221
00:08:59,735 --> 00:09:01,640
So typically in datasets,

222
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,950
we like to have an indicator
of missingness rather

223
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:06,560
than using a blank to
demonstrate missingness.

224
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,500
The two most common approaches
for missing data is

225
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:17,320
either enter a dot or a
period to represent missing.

226
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:22,415
We could also use NA to
represent not available.

227
00:09:22,415 --> 00:09:25,520
As long as the same indicator is

228
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,535
used across all variables
and all subjects.

229
00:09:28,535 --> 00:09:32,150
The other approach for
example in age being married,

230
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:34,355
we see the blank there
that I highlighted here.

231
00:09:34,355 --> 00:09:35,925
Right here that missing value.

232
00:09:35,925 --> 00:09:37,875
Because this is a
numeric variable,

233
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,620
sometimes we use a single number

234
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,895
to represent missingness,

235
00:09:40,895 --> 00:09:42,800
and often we use a
number that is not

236
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,825
plausible for an actual value.

237
00:09:44,825 --> 00:09:46,380
So for example in age,

238
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:49,445
we use negative 99
to represent missing

239
00:09:49,445 --> 00:09:53,325
because no one can have
an age of negative 99.

240
00:09:53,325 --> 00:09:55,940
Again, anything can be
used as long as it is

241
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:59,810
consistently used across all
variables in the dataset.

242
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:03,775
As a third example of an
analysis that might be done,

243
00:10:03,775 --> 00:10:05,390
in the social survey data,

244
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:07,655
we might be interested
in figuring out

245
00:10:07,655 --> 00:10:09,350
why someone has the number

246
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,985
of children than they
do in their life.

247
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:13,280
So the outcome of interest

248
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,380
might be how many children

249
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,500
has the person had in their life.

250
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:21,320
We might want to examine
how this variable is

251
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,955
related to the number of

252
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:25,465
siblings they had when
they were growing up,

253
00:10:25,465 --> 00:10:27,650
and certainly the
relationship of having

254
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:29,480
children and just the number of

255
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,330
children they grew up with
is complicated and could

256
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:35,705
change by many other factors
including for example,

257
00:10:35,705 --> 00:10:39,520
how old that person is or
maybe their educational level.

258
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,030
Those two variables also play

259
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:43,940
a role in someone's
decision to have children.

260
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,770
Now, inside a set of data,

261
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,290
lies the story that
you want to tell

262
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:50,240
and all of the variables
in the dataset

263
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,145
are like the characters
in your story.

264
00:10:52,145 --> 00:10:54,350
Each of them has something
to contribute to

265
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:56,675
your understanding of the
health of a population.

266
00:10:56,675 --> 00:10:58,700
So in this course, we're
going to teach you how

267
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,590
to use variables in a dataset

268
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:02,180
that tell the story of
what is happening in

269
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:05,465
a community and how to make
data driven decisions.

270
00:11:05,465 --> 00:11:08,780
Thus, we need to fully understand
the types of data that

271
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,820
exist and when each can be used

272
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:14,073
appropriately to best answer
the questions that you have.
