1
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,774
After watching this video, you will
be able to describe basic concepts of

2
00:00:13,774 --> 00:00:17,630
correlated data,
in particular, survey data.

3
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:20,902
So, so far, you have been
working with independent data.

4
00:00:20,902 --> 00:00:22,552
Observations, subjects,

5
00:00:22,552 --> 00:00:27,610
whatever you were using in the analysis
were all independent of each other.

6
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:32,230
We were taking that for granted based
on the nature of the study design.

7
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:34,819
For example, our case-control analysis.

8
00:00:34,819 --> 00:00:39,277
Cases were incident cases of
myocardial infarction recruited from 6

9
00:00:39,277 --> 00:00:41,625
hospitals in San Jose, Costa Rica.

10
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:44,509
People who did not know each other or
were family or

11
00:00:44,509 --> 00:00:49,430
had any other link,
completely independent.

12
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:52,792
But, there are other type of data,
correlated data,

13
00:00:52,792 --> 00:00:56,388
in which observations are not
independent of each other.

14
00:00:56,388 --> 00:00:59,276
These are some examples
of correlated data.

15
00:00:59,276 --> 00:01:03,646
For example, when you have longitudinal
data with repeated measures.

16
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:08,086
If I measure the blood pressure of
a cohort of people today and then every

17
00:01:08,086 --> 00:01:13,272
month, clearly the blood pressure is going
to be correlated within each subject.

18
00:01:13,272 --> 00:01:15,568
They are not independent measures.

19
00:01:15,568 --> 00:01:17,807
Another example is family data.

20
00:01:17,807 --> 00:01:19,950
Families share many things in common.

21
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:23,815
Not only genetic background in many
occasions, but also environmental

22
00:01:23,815 --> 00:01:28,420
conditions, they share the same house,
eat the same food, and so on.

23
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:32,835
Or another example is when you
are studying units that belong to the same

24
00:01:32,835 --> 00:01:33,424
entity.

25
00:01:33,424 --> 00:01:36,662
For example,
if you're doing a study in mice legs,

26
00:01:36,662 --> 00:01:42,700
clearly every mouse has four legs and
those four legs will be correlated.

27
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,421
So all of them have one thing in common.

28
00:01:45,421 --> 00:01:49,792
We have to account for
the correlation between observations.

29
00:01:49,792 --> 00:01:53,918
Traditional methods,
that is the method using so far, linear,

30
00:01:53,918 --> 00:01:57,296
logistic, etc.,
calculate the point estimates,

31
00:01:57,296 --> 00:02:03,270
betas or ratios, accurately but
standard errors are wrong.

32
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:07,703
One type of correlated data that is very
common is when you have survey data,

33
00:02:07,703 --> 00:02:12,330
because the sampling design is
not simple random sampling.

34
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:16,133
There are two main types of
sampling used in survey data,

35
00:02:16,133 --> 00:02:18,441
stratification and clustering.

36
00:02:18,441 --> 00:02:23,404
Stratification will divide the population
in groups that are different

37
00:02:23,404 --> 00:02:26,424
from each other, for example, sex or age.

38
00:02:26,424 --> 00:02:31,418
While clustering will divide the
population in comparable groups such as

39
00:02:31,418 --> 00:02:33,518
town, neighborhoods, etc.

40
00:02:33,518 --> 00:02:37,769
In a stratification,
we will sample randomly from each group,

41
00:02:37,769 --> 00:02:43,550
while in clustering, we will
randomly sample some of the groups.

42
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:46,395
Both methods are often
use in national service.

43
00:02:46,395 --> 00:02:47,995
In this national service,

44
00:02:47,995 --> 00:02:51,615
you really want to get
a representative sample of the nation,

45
00:02:51,615 --> 00:02:56,082
but clearly doing simple random sampling
would be extremely inefficient.

46
00:02:56,082 --> 00:02:59,349
Imagine you want to conduct
enhance the nutrition and

47
00:02:59,349 --> 00:03:02,987
health survey running the US
with simple random sampling.

48
00:03:02,987 --> 00:03:07,755
You have to go to tons of different places
all over the country just to recruit one

49
00:03:07,755 --> 00:03:08,324
person.

50
00:03:08,324 --> 00:03:09,887
That's not how it's done.

51
00:03:09,887 --> 00:03:11,107
In this situation,

52
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:15,760
what we use is a complex multistage
probability sampling design.

53
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,428
For example, in enhance,

54
00:03:17,428 --> 00:03:21,198
in the first stage of random
number of counties are selected.

55
00:03:21,198 --> 00:03:25,364
In the second stage, within those
countries are random number of segments is

56
00:03:25,364 --> 00:03:31,230
selected, and so on for
households and finally, individuals.

57
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:34,998
So you happen to work with
survey data that was collected

58
00:03:34,998 --> 00:03:39,015
using a complex multistage
probability sampling design.

59
00:03:39,015 --> 00:03:41,423
These are the key questions to ask.

60
00:03:41,423 --> 00:03:45,835
First, is sample selected in
a single stage or multiple stages?

61
00:03:45,835 --> 00:03:51,100
Second, is clustering of elements
used at one or more sample stages?

62
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:55,070
Third, is stratification employed
at one or more sample stages?

63
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:59,042
And finally four, are elements
selected with equal probabilities?

64
00:03:59,042 --> 00:04:01,160
This is a very important question.

65
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:05,725
Because although there are ways of
designing complex multistage sampling so

66
00:04:05,725 --> 00:04:10,219
every individual observation has
the same probability of being selected,

67
00:04:10,219 --> 00:04:12,619
that is an equip probabilistic design.

68
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:15,175
The truth is that in
most of these surveys,

69
00:04:15,175 --> 00:04:20,240
the probability of selection is
different for each individual.

70
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:24,987
So this has tremendous implications for
the analysis because you will need to take

71
00:04:24,987 --> 00:04:29,030
into account that imbalance
in probability of selection.

72
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:32,360
For that,
you use sampling weights in the analysis.

73
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,462
Sampling weights are usually
the reciprocals of the selection

74
00:04:36,462 --> 00:04:37,627
probabilities.

75
00:04:37,627 --> 00:04:42,896
For example, in one observation is
selected with a probability of 1 over 10,

76
00:04:42,896 --> 00:04:45,340
its weight will be 10.

77
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:50,532
Sometimes sampling weights also include
nonresponse adjustments, post sampling,

78
00:04:50,532 --> 00:04:56,410
stratification or regression adjustments
using supplemental information.

79
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:58,126
So in summary, in this video,

80
00:04:58,126 --> 00:05:02,288
we learn the most basic concepts of
correlated in particular survey data.

81
00:05:02,288 --> 00:05:07,691
In the next video, we will start with
our first example of survey data.
