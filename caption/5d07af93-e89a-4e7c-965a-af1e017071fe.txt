00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:15,510
At the end of 2019, a new respiratory virus emerged from Asia that would later cause a global pandemic.

2
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:22,979
As the days went by. There was a desperate attempt to identify who was newly developing the disease in order to form

3
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:27,720
how quickly the virus was spreading and the interventions required to slow its development.

4
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:33,900
In addition, there was a need to count the number of people in the population who had the disease as

5
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:39,060
a way to anticipate how many beds in the ICU and ventilators would likely be needed.

6
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,549
In this video, we're going to talk through two of the most common measures of disease,

7
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:49,620
occurrence and frequency that are used by epidemiologists incidence and prevalence.

8
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:57,510
By the end of this lecture, you should understand how to distinguish prevalence from incidence and understand when you'd want to use each measure.

9
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,730
You should also be able to calculate measures of incidence and prevalence using proportions.

10
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,660
Now I note that this video is likely a refresher of what you've learned previously as you prepare for new material.

11
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:16,350
Therefore, feel free to skip ahead if you're very confident in your knowledge regarding incidence and prevalence.

12
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:23,510
Let's first start with a measure of prevalence, as you likely recall from your earlier coursework.

13
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:32,450
Prevalence is defined as the proportion of a specific population who has a particular outcome, be it a disease or a characteristic of interest.

14
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:41,600
This can be defined as a specific point, and we call that a point prevalence or it can be measured over a time period,

15
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,110
at which point the measure becomes a period prevalence.

16
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:52,160
Its definition, as shown here, is the number of people in a population that have an outcome of interest.

17
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,790
Divided by the total number of people in that population.

18
00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:01,630
For example, we might see this type of data for people in the United States,

19
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:09,010
like those living with congestive heart failure or some other characteristic like owning firearms or being vaccinated.

20
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:15,850
As you might imagine, prevalence numbers have high importance from a population health perspective.

21
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:21,579
Ultimately, these are the measures that can tell us how many beds might be needed to care for the

22
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:25,780
population of people living with a certain disease like congestive heart failure,

23
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:31,660
or how we should target interventions or spend limited resources for care on individuals.

24
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:37,360
For example, if we were public health officials in charge of managing city resources,

25
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:44,580
we might be using the prevalence of drug users by neighborhood to inform our purchase orders for a needle exchange program.

26
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:54,640
Or if we were health care providers, the prevalence of drug users in the area would tell us how many doses of naloxone are needed on our ambulances.

27
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:59,740
Because prevalence estimates are used for real world decisions.

28
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:06,200
It's critically important for us as epidemiologists to report our information in terms of who we've measured,

29
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:12,590
what we are reporting and when the data are from, as opposed to just some measure of frequency.

30
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:20,210
The reason why is that we know that disease and exposure frequency is changed dramatically by person, place and time.

31
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:30,770
For example, we'd expect to see very different numbers of people owning firearms in nations where weapons are banned from the general population.

32
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:36,770
Just as we would see very different numbers in locations that are currently in the throes of civil war.

33
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:46,890
Similarly, I'd expect to see very different vaccination rates of children if we hopped back in time before vaccines were as common.

34
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:55,630
Now prevalence is extremely helpful when we want to think about allocating resources among people that already have a disease.

35
00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:03,700
But what if we want to try and conduct interventions or implement policies to prevent people from getting those diseases at all?

36
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:08,410
In these situations, what we really need are measures of incidence.

37
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:15,280
This is because, whereas prevalence gets at the number of people with existing disease incidence estimates,

38
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,060
the proportion of a population that newly develops a disease.

39
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,579
The equation for incidence proportion is the number of people that newly develop an

40
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:30,190
outcome over time divided by the number of people who are at risk for that outcome.

41
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:38,290
As you can see here, this is a different equation, both because of the numerator and also the denominator.

42
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:48,100
Unlike for prevalence, which looks at the full population, incidence is calculated based solely on the fraction of people who are at risk for disease.

43
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:53,470
So for example, if we were interested in estimating the risk of uterine cancer,

44
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:57,850
we would only look at those individuals with a uterus in our denominator.

45
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:02,320
Because without this, people are not at risk of developing uterine cancer.

46
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:04,849
In this way,

47
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:13,220
you'll often hear people calling incidents proportion a risk because of the way in which it reflects the probability of developing disease.

48
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:17,210
Another common synonym is cumulative incidence.

49
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:24,430
Here are a few examples that showcase the type of data that might be reported as an incidence proportion.

50
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:29,740
For example, the risk of testicular cancer, dementia and fatal car crashes.

51
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:36,070
You'll notice that I've added color coding to this slide as well to remind you that just like with prevalence,

52
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:43,870
it's critically important for you to always present your information in terms of who, what, when and how much.

53
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:54,520
In fact, timing can be an especially important issue for risk estimates, and you must not compare estimates if there are for different time periods.

54
00:05:55,390 --> 00:06:02,320
Take, for example, the extreme case of mortality. Even though the risk of death in a single year for a young,

55
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:09,160
healthy person is expected to be very low, they do not escape the likelihood of death in the end,

56
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:17,890
such that their likelihood of death over their full lifetime is still 100%, just as it is for an older and less healthy person.

57
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:27,150
This example of mortality is also helpful in realizing that incidents proportions are likely to change over time,

58
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:37,020
especially when you're thinking about age. As a result, it is often best to report incidents proportion separately for shorter time periods.

59
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:43,200
Say, for example, a five year age block as opposed to pooled across long periods of time.

60
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:48,340
With that, we wrap up our review of incidents and prevalence.

61
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:57,670
Hopefully in this video you've been reminded of the definition of incidence and prevalence and understood when each measure is very useful to use.

62
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:05,500
In the next videos, we'll build upon these basic definitions to estimate incidents when populations are not stable

63
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:11,230
and to understand the relationships between incidence prevalence and the duration of disease.
