1
00:00:10,829 --> 00:00:16,229
All right. Let's jump back in.

2
00:00:18,389 --> 00:00:25,259
Let's jump back in. All right.

3
00:00:25,259 --> 00:00:30,889
So as you recall, we were talking about the various parts of this.

4
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:37,529
So the key here that I want to emphasize is first that we're identifying correctly what the situation is.

5
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:41,729
So what's our situation? I heard some different suggestions last time.

6
00:00:42,749 --> 00:00:46,459
We were kind of around the lines of decision. Do we agree with that?

7
00:00:47,419 --> 00:00:51,869
For all the consensus around decision. Okay.

8
00:00:52,709 --> 00:01:02,369
Well, let's review real quick. I would say decision, which was finally had more than two options to choose from and something to choose.

9
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:14,479
Why not? Evaluation? Celebrations to judge the value of the outcome.

10
00:01:15,559 --> 00:01:19,819
And we don't have an outcome because you are weighing different options.

11
00:01:20,509 --> 00:01:23,778
So, I mean, yes, he's deciding yes or no, am I going to do something that, you know,

12
00:01:23,779 --> 00:01:28,669
maybe evaluation could be I've got five different choices here and I'm going to pick between that.

13
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:32,659
I've got a bit of a menu to choose from. So sometimes you might see that happen.

14
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:41,449
You know, you might have a decision that you're making. Let's think back to let's think back to early days of COVID.

15
00:01:41,779 --> 00:01:46,429
You know, I'm confronted with an outbreak shut down or not.

16
00:01:46,669 --> 00:01:52,489
So binary choices, a decision I'm going to make versus weighing all the different options.

17
00:01:52,909 --> 00:01:55,959
Do we close for two days? Do we close for three days?

18
00:01:55,969 --> 00:01:59,689
Do we stay open for this group? How do we evaluate that or what do we do for that?

19
00:01:59,779 --> 00:02:06,559
So that and more evaluation. Okay, so decision evaluation, what's our third take?

20
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:17,429
Model problem, right? So why not problem? What's the problem?

21
00:02:17,449 --> 00:02:31,049
Remind us what a problem. It. Not affected by it.

22
00:02:31,859 --> 00:02:38,099
There's a lot of problems in the world, but the problem in the context of our are something that causes distress.

23
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:41,789
Okay. But what's the problem in terms of how we look at it as a case?

24
00:02:43,469 --> 00:02:48,949
What are you trying to address and who's responsible? Excellent. Thank you. So so, you know, we've got we've got it.

25
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,739
So we've got to make a distinction when we're looking at these between the three different choices.

26
00:02:53,429 --> 00:02:57,388
So we're addressing problem versus decision.

27
00:02:57,389 --> 00:03:04,769
I have a discrete decision that I'm going to make versus an evaluation where I've got options and I'm selecting between them.

28
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:10,589
All right. So that's it sounds very nuanced and very granular.

29
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,858
But again, I want to you I want you to use it as a matrix to kind of decide how you want to take apart the case.

30
00:03:16,859 --> 00:03:19,919
So we're not just reporting on the case in the situation section.

31
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:22,489
We're not just saying, yeah, this is what's happening. And great.

32
00:03:22,499 --> 00:03:28,229
You know, there's a lot of cases where we could just sort of say that we're trying to focus on what is important.

33
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:35,999
And that's a key managerial skill that I want to kind of have you thinking about

34
00:03:35,999 --> 00:03:42,019
every session is what exactly is happening and what how would I characterize it,

35
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:45,059
what what it is. A lot of times in the leadership,

36
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:52,199
there's a lot of anxiety around making some kind of a call on something you don't really necessarily know what you're making a call on.

37
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:59,668
You know, I have to I have to decide if I'm going to build a new building, maybe a nonprofit CEO is going to make that call.

38
00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:01,619
Well, that's a lot of different things.

39
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:09,718
So if I just looking at it as a giant situation of new building, that's that's that's a lot of a lot of noise around that.

40
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:18,089
So now I have to boil it down new building because it go and this zip code is this zip code, this evaluation.

41
00:04:18,979 --> 00:04:28,159
Am I going to build it or not? That's a decision. I don't have any place to put services for this population.

42
00:04:28,729 --> 00:04:34,369
That's a problem. So we have to kind of get specific what what each thing is and justify why.

43
00:04:34,789 --> 00:04:38,359
All right. Questions. Questions. What do we say are the questions?

44
00:04:39,109 --> 00:04:44,699
What it would just remind us? What are the questions? In our in our framework here.

45
00:04:55,679 --> 00:05:03,859
Yeah. So I remember the questions that I had centered around the idea of Bluebird Flu Meridian and saying they're going to expand.

46
00:05:04,069 --> 00:05:08,929
What do they mean by national expansion that they mean it's going to enlarge the organization, make it look tired?

47
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:15,139
National is going to be a location in multiple cities just for their information about what that expansion would look like.

48
00:05:16,669 --> 00:05:21,199
So this is a good example. We're getting real specific now on what we need to know.

49
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:24,649
These are the the situation that we've identified.

50
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:29,809
So if I'm evaluation, I'm going to be thinking about the questions associated with each of those options.

51
00:05:30,559 --> 00:05:36,559
If I've got you know, if I have a if I have, you know, this option, this out for this option, this option under that,

52
00:05:36,559 --> 00:05:45,769
I have many different questions that I might be asking under each one in order to properly even have the ability to evaluate if I'm making a decision.

53
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:49,639
I've got to guess and to know what are the implications of one versus the other.

54
00:05:50,679 --> 00:06:00,279
And what do I need to know in order to make that decision, which will get you to the moment where the answer is OC hypothesis.

55
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:07,259
A big star next to this one. So attractive drawing here.

56
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:13,829
What? What, what? What do we think? Hypothesis. What's the distribution easiest on what?

57
00:06:13,849 --> 00:06:17,309
What's another word for that in our framework? Recommendation. Thank you.

58
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:21,919
Recommendation. Why? Recommendation what? What. What are we trying to get to here with these.

59
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:26,689
So just a solution to the situation. Okay.

60
00:06:27,289 --> 00:06:29,179
So we're suggesting a solution, right?

61
00:06:31,009 --> 00:06:38,149
So let's let's kind of think back to being in leadership, not enough to just say, yeah, we're going to do this or Yeah.

62
00:06:39,109 --> 00:06:46,219
This is an issue we've got to contend with. We need to recommendation now sometimes if you're in an interim position.

63
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:52,548
So, for example, you've haven't been really hired or brought on to make those decisions and you're kind of in a caretaking role.

64
00:06:52,549 --> 00:07:00,079
So you're sort of seeing that things run day to day. You may not make a very large decision around one of these types of situations.

65
00:07:00,499 --> 00:07:05,119
You might choose to just kind of go with what's been going on and just sort of like keep things moving,

66
00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:10,519
you know, keep the store open, so to speak, make sure the lights are on in the morning, they go off.

67
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:15,439
But you're not thinking about whether or not we're going to expand or contract or close or whatever.

68
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:23,629
But here, I want you all to think about yourselves as being the decision maker with the authority to decide.

69
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:30,909
So your recommendations, your hypotheses should be very discrete and very deliberate.

70
00:07:32,379 --> 00:07:35,379
Okay. All right. Proof and action.

71
00:07:37,849 --> 00:07:41,359
I would say that most pertains to the question.

72
00:07:42,349 --> 00:07:48,829
What evidence, what pieces of information do I need in order to answer the questions that I'm asking?

73
00:07:51,099 --> 00:07:57,069
And then we talked about alternatives last time. Alternatives to what?

74
00:08:02,429 --> 00:08:05,999
Occurrence hypothesis. Good. Okay.

75
00:08:06,289 --> 00:08:09,509
So that's an alternative recommendation. Why do we generate alternatives?

76
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:12,739
We talked about this a little bit at the end. Yeah.

77
00:08:13,219 --> 00:08:17,789
So I never get tired.

78
00:08:17,849 --> 00:08:19,309
I'm not being very deliberate. Yeah.

79
00:08:20,419 --> 00:08:28,409
So whenever you're standing in front of, like, stakeholders, you can say, hey, this is my recommendation, and I have looked at every other option.

80
00:08:28,569 --> 00:08:31,319
This is why I think this is the best one. You okay?

81
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:40,779
So I'm armed now with the ability to have considered the other options, and I'm honoring what the other people in the room may have considered.

82
00:08:41,749 --> 00:08:45,169
So I'm not saying we're doing this and that's it.

83
00:08:46,339 --> 00:08:49,158
No, that's very deliberate. That's very direct. I know.

84
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:55,759
I just had to be deliberate and direct in your decision making, but deliberate and direct through the lens of consensus building,

85
00:08:55,999 --> 00:08:59,539
through the lens of honoring the different stakeholders that are part of the process.

86
00:08:59,929 --> 00:09:05,419
And that's part of that whole approach of top down versus bottom up that we talked about, basically.

87
00:09:05,599 --> 00:09:14,169
We'll talk more about. Okay. And then our discussion is mainly that you're having offering questions for discussion for what?

88
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:17,649
For what you think should be going on. All right.

89
00:09:17,829 --> 00:09:20,888
So we talked about this situation.

90
00:09:20,889 --> 00:09:25,419
We're labeling it a decision. We talked about some of the questions last time.

91
00:09:25,419 --> 00:09:31,299
What were some other ones that that we want to throw out there? Questions that you need answered in order to kind of get some context on this.

92
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:39,139
Other questions. Yeah.

93
00:09:39,499 --> 00:09:42,049
We, we talked about like an understanding of what,

94
00:09:42,769 --> 00:09:48,888
like the commitment to the expansion would actually entail and how much work it would be like on the CEO's part,

95
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:52,399
but also some part of like the full organization. Okay. What kind of information?

96
00:09:52,729 --> 00:09:58,968
Like, like like just very practically, like work hours and like any more staff,

97
00:09:58,969 --> 00:10:04,759
do they have the capacity to hire more staff and just like operational things like how would you compute?

98
00:10:06,709 --> 00:10:11,059
Like how would we would you look for them? I don't know.

99
00:10:14,569 --> 00:10:29,279
Okay. Where else are you? Isn't he about to take a phone call and be able to get answers to that question?

100
00:10:30,479 --> 00:10:33,249
I think that's where the story goes.

101
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:39,208
Or maybe you're impressed with them in advance because you said, all right, I should probably have the answers to these with me.

102
00:10:39,209 --> 00:10:42,029
So I kind of know what I might be getting a call about.

103
00:10:42,749 --> 00:10:51,839
Some of the great stories of of leaders and managers are about knowing before someone comes and telling tells you.

104
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:57,719
And so very famously, the current speaker of the House.

105
00:10:58,989 --> 00:11:06,218
Story about her having people come to her office and say, you know, did you know, blah, blah, blah, reporting.

106
00:11:06,219 --> 00:11:10,118
And she already knew about that a month ago. So, you know, the point is,

107
00:11:10,119 --> 00:11:17,769
in sort of thinking about how to make a decision that you're being very deliberate in terms of knowing that you have a move that you want to make,

108
00:11:17,829 --> 00:11:23,289
but also strategically that you're really armed with the information so that you're you're ahead of it.

109
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:26,769
You're not necessarily being reactive, but more proactive.

110
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:35,179
Okay, good. So recommendations I heard last time we heard some recommendations that were kind of coming out.

111
00:11:35,479 --> 00:11:38,899
So, I mean, let's go around. I just want to hear a group. The group. What were your recommendations?

112
00:11:39,439 --> 00:11:47,549
Your hypothesis was maybe let's start in the best topics, maybe just expansion into some the city, I mean, some of the pieces.

113
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:53,649
Again, I said expansion into just some of the places that doesn't like you know, I,

114
00:11:54,259 --> 00:12:02,898
I was the focus of the LA so just focusing on like some of the places and also like keeping Harlem as a central focus

115
00:12:02,899 --> 00:12:10,119
so that the progress that's being made is not activated politics and where do we agree with that recommendation?

116
00:12:10,149 --> 00:12:14,958
We did that. Groups have other recommendations in a question about this.

117
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:20,749
So if we're looking at this as a decision between two alternatives as opposed to multiple options,

118
00:12:21,439 --> 00:12:25,578
are we supposed to use our hypothesis to say like expand or not expand?

119
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:31,549
Or should we can we use like one of essentially all our alternatives as our hypothesis?

120
00:12:31,969 --> 00:12:37,909
So you should make it based on what you are characterizing the situation as you characterize the situation,

121
00:12:37,909 --> 00:12:42,079
and then your hypothesis should speak to what you characterized it as. So.

122
00:12:42,259 --> 00:12:47,838
So you get to decide, though, as the case presentation group how you characterize that.

123
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,459
I'm there's not if I could be a situation in our course I'm going to say, no, that's wrong.

124
00:12:52,819 --> 00:12:58,889
As long as you are kind of justifying why you characterize it that way and that your hypothesis,

125
00:12:58,909 --> 00:13:04,009
your recommendation follows from what it is that you characterize this case as.

126
00:13:04,459 --> 00:13:07,819
That's what we're looking for, is a reasonable you know,

127
00:13:07,819 --> 00:13:17,429
I think others other groups do we did we think that the way the RV process group characterizes.

128
00:13:17,959 --> 00:13:22,999
Yeah I oh yeah same but so we characterized as like a situation that's just are

129
00:13:22,999 --> 00:13:27,468
they ready to explain was expand with already and are they and so our hypothesis

130
00:13:27,469 --> 00:13:31,429
was well I guess our recommendation was that they're not ready just because

131
00:13:31,429 --> 00:13:35,748
they have a lot of issues and and I think they have to focus on their plate.

132
00:13:35,749 --> 00:13:40,878
So we said they shouldn't, but one of our alternatives was that they could delay the partnership if that's

133
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:47,029
a possibility or do it in like a slow have it be a slow expansion and good.

134
00:13:50,469 --> 00:13:54,309
He also said to delay and not to partner with them right now.

135
00:13:54,579 --> 00:14:03,009
But one of our alternatives was to just have like an oversight role, maybe on a board since HCV kind of was already like starting their plan.

136
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:10,509
So maybe that Kwami and his organization can just kind of get inside and it looks great.

137
00:14:11,289 --> 00:14:12,969
So ours was very similar to that.

138
00:14:12,969 --> 00:14:20,079
We said that he should remain with HCV, but then sit on some kind of advisory council that can provide support for expansion.

139
00:14:23,789 --> 00:14:33,339
On. It's another alternative we have with all we had was to possibly try to see about getting more staff so that it could be possible.

140
00:14:33,729 --> 00:14:37,079
Okay. How do we get more staff? What's the what's our what's our path to doing that?

141
00:14:39,619 --> 00:14:42,729
Funding. Funding, funding.

142
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:47,589
Okay. And how do we get funding? Make it a condition of the deal.

143
00:14:48,549 --> 00:14:53,559
Think you are provided resources to support your central mission.

144
00:14:54,669 --> 00:15:02,649
All right. So Ali Ali is cutting a deal. I know we talked about this before.

145
00:15:03,139 --> 00:15:07,089
Our hypothesis was your recommendation was to not take the money,

146
00:15:08,409 --> 00:15:19,519
but we one of our thoughts was to do an internal audit first to audit what the missing links are within

147
00:15:19,539 --> 00:15:25,599
the organization currently in focus and words and then maintain the relationship between future.

148
00:15:27,689 --> 00:15:34,829
I have a question regarding, though this organization seems very much linked to the community that they're in.

149
00:15:35,249 --> 00:15:43,048
And so it's in their name, right? So I wonder how much I do believe that they need to find funding, obviously,

150
00:15:43,049 --> 00:15:47,429
because if they do want to work on building up that, they need more capacity.

151
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:53,399
So what we're seeing and this but if it be possible, I don't know if this is like something that we would include in a case,

152
00:15:53,399 --> 00:16:02,789
but to look for funding within Harlem or within the area, because that could be a potential alternative rather than like going to expanding.

153
00:16:04,109 --> 00:16:11,759
So two groups here coming up with a very important correlate of how we're going to make these decisions and that it's this word.

154
00:16:17,569 --> 00:16:24,189
Focus. Right? But my focus for this case really is in my way.

155
00:16:24,189 --> 00:16:31,539
I read it. That's what thought that my serving our lamb or my trying to serve all these other places.

156
00:16:32,589 --> 00:16:36,789
What's my mission like? My vision with my charter?

157
00:16:36,819 --> 00:16:43,989
What does my board expected? Me? And the point of funding if I'm all over the place.

158
00:16:44,539 --> 00:16:49,149
What's my case to a funder? I can say, Yeah, give me funding.

159
00:16:49,149 --> 00:16:53,349
I'm going to do it here and here, here, here, here and here. But then the next question is from the thunder.

160
00:16:53,589 --> 00:16:58,448
And how are you measuring that? That's actually making an impact and you demonstrate that it did anything.

161
00:16:58,449 --> 00:17:00,159
Can you demonstrate that it was useful?

162
00:17:00,509 --> 00:17:07,599
Know what are the metrics that you're modeling off of so very I'm glad to hear kind of group sort of coming in this direction.

163
00:17:08,629 --> 00:17:13,669
Because these are the questions that we have to kind of keep pushing toward, which is, yeah, it's great.

164
00:17:13,729 --> 00:17:17,089
I mean, it's a great idea. Of course, we should expand. Everyone should expand.

165
00:17:19,009 --> 00:17:22,429
So he heard time and again where, you know, if you kind of lose your focus,

166
00:17:22,429 --> 00:17:28,668
if you start to drift and this is what we'll be talking about quite a bit about mission creep as a concept that we,

167
00:17:28,669 --> 00:17:34,818
you know, I shared, we'll kind of keep coming back to, um, you know, if there's a drift away from your mission.

168
00:17:34,819 --> 00:17:37,909
Remember we talked about last week how the mission is very broad,

169
00:17:38,719 --> 00:17:44,149
but you got to kind of stay somewhere in the zone of being, you know, in the parentheses, so to speak.

170
00:17:44,449 --> 00:17:50,179
And if you want to take the step of expanding or going further, that doesn't mean that that's the wrong decision.

171
00:17:50,689 --> 00:17:53,029
Very often expansion is a positive step,

172
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:59,419
but you got to be in the right place to do it and you got to have the right sort of support around you to be able to have that being feasible.

173
00:18:00,649 --> 00:18:09,389
So focus is key. Yeah. No, I think one of our main questions was also is $100 million even enough to create a sustainable, sustainable entrance?

174
00:18:10,069 --> 00:18:18,319
It seemed like $100 million going to Harlem would be great and they could probably do it in a couple of cities with just like.

175
00:18:21,639 --> 00:18:27,369
So for me, this is awesome. Well, that's excellent.

176
00:18:27,429 --> 00:18:33,819
How many of our A-Team here have taken a program planning course?

177
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:37,659
I know. I don't know if our students how much I'd have to say went done. One of those.

178
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:40,569
Yeah. Okay, that's fine. So.

179
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:46,478
So in a program planning process, the first thing that we usually do is we take a program and we say, okay, here's a great idea.

180
00:18:46,479 --> 00:18:49,839
Let's do this. Then we build a budget for it. We start looking line by line.

181
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:52,359
You know how much it takes to do what it is we're talking about.

182
00:18:52,989 --> 00:18:59,229
So very quickly, what we usually find in developing a program is we have to really, really narrow what we're doing,

183
00:18:59,529 --> 00:19:06,039
because after you add everything up, it starts to be very difficult to actually make good on what it is you're saying you're going to do.

184
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:13,538
You know, with all the different costs that you have to figure out, the personnel costs of salaries, insurance benefits,

185
00:19:13,539 --> 00:19:23,049
cost of infrastructure, costs of of equipment, cost of time, you know, volunteers that you may or may or may not have all those factors.

186
00:19:24,069 --> 00:19:27,548
So the one thing I would challenge all of you also to think about as we kind of

187
00:19:27,549 --> 00:19:31,359
take apart each of these cases is every time you hear a number thrown out there,

188
00:19:31,719 --> 00:19:36,739
we'll come back to this actually quite a bit. I can't see. Okay, I'll smile.

189
00:19:37,869 --> 00:19:45,219
We'll come back to this quite a bit. In the case with Jp morgan Chase, which is when you see a number thrown out there.

190
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:50,239
That number is just a number. You got to get real specific.

191
00:19:50,259 --> 00:19:54,489
What does that number actually buy me? Does it get me?

192
00:19:54,969 --> 00:19:58,899
How many staff people? How many centers? How many services?

193
00:19:58,909 --> 00:20:06,159
What is actually getting me? Once I know what it gets me and I can make a value determination on whether or not it's actually doing something.

194
00:20:06,729 --> 00:20:11,049
Is it worth it? So the noise point. I appreciate you sharing that.

195
00:20:11,469 --> 00:20:14,469
Is it actually going to do? Yes, it will make an impact.

196
00:20:14,649 --> 00:20:18,069
Anything will make an impact. But what impact is that?

197
00:20:18,069 --> 00:20:21,219
And how are we then measuring the impact, one versus the other?

198
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:29,058
Just sort of this is kind of how I think through these sort of we can sort of work through these.

199
00:20:29,059 --> 00:20:38,298
How does this feel to folks? Is this sort of we are we we kind of kind of getting a sense of it to basic, to complex, just about.

200
00:20:38,299 --> 00:20:44,379
Right. Yeah. Yeah. Not really a question, but is a solution provided?

201
00:20:44,819 --> 00:20:49,079
Like, I mean, I know we didn't get it, but this is. And no, I'm smiling.

202
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:52,909
I'm smiling because the answer is there is no solution there.

203
00:20:52,939 --> 00:20:57,209
Really? Well, what actually happened to my math? I don't know the answer.

204
00:20:57,239 --> 00:21:02,218
I don't really. It's a great question. I don't know the answer. We should look on many of these.

205
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:05,729
We can look at some of these, I believe are de-identified.

206
00:21:05,729 --> 00:21:11,608
So I don't know if they're exactly as they happened. This one, though, I believe, was pretty accurately done.

207
00:21:11,609 --> 00:21:15,209
So I if someone wants to take a look at it on our break, I'd be very curious myself.

208
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:19,289
I looked at Bluebird website and this is not on their website at all.

209
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:23,729
So maybe they didn't. I don't know whether or not. Yeah, it's very possible.

210
00:21:23,729 --> 00:21:31,919
I mean, it's interesting. Usually a case like this gets written up after the decision gets made is a little embarrassing to kind of put it out there,

211
00:21:32,579 --> 00:21:34,619
you know, when when you're deciding.

212
00:21:35,819 --> 00:21:41,999
But and it's also very generous of those who are featured in the case to be willing to let them write up this whole story.

213
00:21:42,209 --> 00:21:47,819
And so, for example, I'm writing a case right now where we're working on it and identifying because it's just

214
00:21:48,269 --> 00:21:53,069
a little bit impolitic to sort of speak directly to people who did one thing or another.

215
00:21:54,689 --> 00:21:58,289
But it just depends. It just depends. That's a great question.

216
00:21:59,189 --> 00:22:03,929
The solution, though, that we'll take on for our cause is really the one that you put together.

217
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:07,619
And that's, again, to reemphasize, there's not a right or wrong.

218
00:22:08,219 --> 00:22:12,628
We just have to kind of see what do you propose and then what are the downstream impacts?

219
00:22:12,629 --> 00:22:16,079
And sometimes, you know what, we make a decision. We don't even realize what's going to be.

220
00:22:16,539 --> 00:22:23,849
I mean, who knew three years ago that knocking on doors during an election was a safe activity, most likely covered wise?

221
00:22:23,879 --> 00:22:27,629
You know, outside that was by today's standards, measured that way.

222
00:22:28,049 --> 00:22:34,409
But the three years ago, you know, public health experts were saying, well, we're not sure, so maybe don't do it if you think that it's a problem.

223
00:22:35,609 --> 00:22:41,189
So again, I'm not saying that one is right or wrong. It's just that's a decision based on the facts that you in that moment.

224
00:22:43,209 --> 00:22:48,399
Okay. Was this helpful? Did we get do we feel like we got a sense of how to take one of these apart?

225
00:22:48,969 --> 00:22:52,359
I know we have a group going today, so I don't want to leave them on the spot.

226
00:22:52,749 --> 00:22:59,769
I'm sure it'll be excellent. But I'm glad that we stepped through this together so that we could sort of see what

227
00:23:00,099 --> 00:23:04,029
what this process looks like and the kinds of questions that I was asking to you.

228
00:23:04,479 --> 00:23:12,459
If I continue to ask for the kinds of questions that I'd like, our case presentation groups be pushy, push back on us, all of us.

229
00:23:12,909 --> 00:23:17,199
You know, let's get let's get let's kind of solve them and try to role play through them.

230
00:23:17,589 --> 00:23:21,339
Okay. All right. What are we doing today?

231
00:23:22,649 --> 00:23:26,308
I want to go through really quickly the 1990 assignment again one more time.

232
00:23:26,309 --> 00:23:29,339
Just the high level pieces, just in case. Anything. All.

233
00:23:29,489 --> 00:23:33,229
Any questions. And then we've been practice analysis.

234
00:23:33,469 --> 00:23:37,829
I'll talk a little bit about achieving excellence in a number of four events. We'll take a break.

235
00:23:37,829 --> 00:23:41,039
Can probably take a five minute break. And here in the middle and five.

236
00:23:42,069 --> 00:23:47,319
Okay. 996 So I'm part of this assignment.

237
00:23:47,349 --> 00:23:53,889
Here is this evaluation piece. So I'm expecting that you're evaluating the information on the 1990.

238
00:23:55,149 --> 00:24:00,609
We talked quite a bit about the page length last time. Please adhere to those page limitations.

239
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:05,079
It says one page. It's one page, not less, not more.

240
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:14,099
And try to have headers separate the sections. Make it easy to read again, not because I'm trying to make it easy for myself, but in fact,

241
00:24:14,109 --> 00:24:19,479
it's kind of organizing it so that if you're thinking about someone who is reviewing this and trying to make a strategic

242
00:24:19,479 --> 00:24:24,459
decision as a as a stakeholder that may be able to walk through it and really understand what you're trying to say.

243
00:24:25,569 --> 00:24:31,618
Okay. So discrepancies again in your evaluation.

244
00:24:31,619 --> 00:24:35,069
What are you noticing between the 1990 and the annual report?

245
00:24:35,669 --> 00:24:43,549
What type of revenue and expense are you reporting or their affiliations?

246
00:24:43,589 --> 00:24:48,359
So again, you're not going to get that out of the 1990. You're going to have to go further into researching the organization.

247
00:24:49,109 --> 00:24:57,929
Where is the growth happening or not? Where did the organization seem to be leaving things behind and then again focusing on that mission?

248
00:24:58,779 --> 00:25:02,399
And that's kind of high level what we're talking about in this assignment.

249
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:12,369
Five pages. Yes. And should we or is this accurate to include things like a or like snippets of this information in like a visual manner?

250
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:16,389
That's fine. I do it. I will ask that if you're going to do that.

251
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:21,459
One page does not equal three quarters of the graph and then three sentences.

252
00:25:21,939 --> 00:25:29,798
So if the graph is appropriately placed, then fine. Don't please don't put me in a position of having to take off like half the point for that.

253
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:34,779
And I'm confident all of you know how to appropriately put in a figure, but it's not a requirement.

254
00:25:34,899 --> 00:25:40,809
So if you don't want to do that, you don't have to. If you want to put it as a as a separate X, that's fine, too.

255
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:45,659
That's helpful to you. Um, but I. Okay.

256
00:25:46,539 --> 00:25:52,969
All right. Questions on our assignment. Anything else? Is there a standard like font and size?

257
00:25:53,329 --> 00:25:56,989
I think I put in their 12.1 inch margin.

258
00:25:57,379 --> 00:26:03,019
I think it's in there. I don't care if it's Ariel or times Roman, but he's not Thomastown.

259
00:26:05,569 --> 00:26:08,779
I mean, it's okay. I'd never mind that.

260
00:26:09,079 --> 00:26:12,709
No. No judgments on comic books. Very. 1997.

261
00:26:13,609 --> 00:26:16,529
Okay. Let's talk about achieving excellence.

262
00:26:16,549 --> 00:26:22,878
So due to achieving excellence in terms of how we're going to think about this is what we are going to call it,

263
00:26:22,879 --> 00:26:26,149
transactional versus transformational leadership.

264
00:26:26,659 --> 00:26:35,269
So I I'm putting up this table here for you to see just kind of the the the key questions along these key constructs here.

265
00:26:35,579 --> 00:26:41,239
So we've got the on the left are all these different key points that I want you to think about,

266
00:26:41,479 --> 00:26:44,599
sort of what the difference is between transactional and transformational.

267
00:26:45,529 --> 00:26:50,229
So, you know, what are our main goals in a transactional versus transformational leadership model?

268
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:53,659
Efficiency versus effectiveness.

269
00:26:54,229 --> 00:27:01,909
You know, in a motivational analysis of one versus the other, transactional leaders might be asking, how are we doing things right?

270
00:27:02,509 --> 00:27:05,209
Transformational leaders are asking, should we be doing this at all?

271
00:27:05,719 --> 00:27:13,249
So remember, I talked quite a bit about sort of that idea of humility by talking about that idea of a caretaking leadership capacity.

272
00:27:13,249 --> 00:27:17,689
And I'm just kind of making sure the lights turn on. So that's more in the transactional category.

273
00:27:17,749 --> 00:27:21,789
Am I doing it right? Am I running things appropriately?

274
00:27:22,929 --> 00:27:27,009
But that's different than should we even be doing this and asking that bigger question?

275
00:27:28,699 --> 00:27:31,759
Transactional leaders are often controlling through a hierarchy.

276
00:27:31,909 --> 00:27:39,139
So you're not really getting the transactional leader making a whole lot of very discrete decisions at the close.

277
00:27:39,409 --> 00:27:43,939
Unlike transformational leadership, they're not really relating or engaging with their team.

278
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:49,129
It is kind of like getting the information and just deciding based on where to put it, right.

279
00:27:50,029 --> 00:27:55,939
So that approach then is really critical because rather than in a transformational case,

280
00:27:55,939 --> 00:28:01,039
we're problem solving and innovating versus sort of a linear thinking and kind of a status quo.

281
00:28:01,699 --> 00:28:07,608
So we often see this in mature corporations, both nonprofit and for profit.

282
00:28:07,609 --> 00:28:13,789
But let's take some nonprofits. Let's think about an organization like the American Heart Association, the American Cancer Society.

283
00:28:14,479 --> 00:28:23,509
We might think about an organization locally there. There's an organization in Oakland County called Common Ground that does behavioral health work.

284
00:28:24,049 --> 00:28:29,609
All these organizations have been a long, long time. And they might go through cycles of leadership.

285
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:35,849
Sometimes they may have a leader who's in charge with more transactional stuff, and the leader might come in who's more transformational.

286
00:28:36,569 --> 00:28:39,659
Who do you think is sort of designed in the organizational,

287
00:28:39,659 --> 00:28:50,339
in the nonprofit organization landscape to sort of be the that metaphor of the the T is cool through the software or anyone's familiar with that.

288
00:28:51,869 --> 00:28:53,669
I'll tell that story on the break. Interesting.

289
00:28:53,939 --> 00:28:59,339
But who who sort of cools down a transformational leader that maybe is a little bit too transformational.

290
00:29:00,059 --> 00:29:04,289
What's the what's the check on that in the organization's governance?

291
00:29:06,149 --> 00:29:10,259
If the board the board board is not changing a whole lot.

292
00:29:10,469 --> 00:29:16,229
Usually. I mean, we talked about what we saw in that case in the Texas trustees.

293
00:29:16,349 --> 00:29:22,139
You know, that the boards aren't necessarily representative of the community, but the board is usually pretty stable.

294
00:29:22,859 --> 00:29:26,009
They might change some here and there, but the board is there.

295
00:29:26,009 --> 00:29:31,379
So the board's role in a lot of ways to help kind of guide what those decisions are.

296
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,788
And it works in quite a bit of cases that the board has that ability.

297
00:29:35,789 --> 00:29:44,369
Now, sometimes the board can be truly very transactional in its approach and really squeeze out any kind of transformational approach.

298
00:29:44,669 --> 00:29:47,159
Usually when we see that kind of dynamic happen,

299
00:29:47,489 --> 00:29:53,159
the leader typically will leave because a transformational leader, someone who's sort of taking that approach,

300
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:59,609
is going to he's going to find it very difficult to make good on what their vision is if there's no real appetite for making that happen.

301
00:29:59,939 --> 00:30:04,229
So there is some empowerment that we need to keep in mind that needs to happen in order for that to work.

302
00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:12,429
Okay. So if we look then at the hierarchy of these models, you can kind of see up to step ladder, directing,

303
00:30:12,429 --> 00:30:19,599
participating, delegating, transforming and some of the key parts of what make up those different styles.

304
00:30:19,959 --> 00:30:27,189
So at the very base level in the directing construct, deriving style from command authority,

305
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:34,749
encouraging following over collaboration, supervising considering only short range goals.

306
00:30:35,769 --> 00:30:48,719
So here's an example. My organization is currently delivering a program to assist with vaccination uptake among children 5 to 7.

307
00:30:49,379 --> 00:30:53,459
For Anon, we're not going to say phobic or non infectious disease.

308
00:30:54,629 --> 00:30:57,389
My program is $100,000 to spend this year.

309
00:30:58,579 --> 00:31:04,429
My job is to make sure we spend $100,000 not thinking about whether or not we're going to grow that or whether

310
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:08,689
we're going to try to get money from somewhere else or whether we're going to try to expand our reach.

311
00:31:08,719 --> 00:31:13,969
I'm just laser focused on directing those $100,000 get spent.

312
00:31:14,449 --> 00:31:16,369
We aren't with the deficit at the end.

313
00:31:16,969 --> 00:31:25,889
I'm not going to be reporting in to my superior that I messed up and didn't kind of keep track and now we're off by ten or $20,000.

314
00:31:26,779 --> 00:31:31,279
I'm very much just on that directing level sort of approach.

315
00:31:32,069 --> 00:31:38,849
And then as we move up the ladder, we get to the transformational component where we're thinking about strategic awareness,

316
00:31:39,389 --> 00:31:47,069
where we're thinking about empowerment, where we're making decisions with a team, where we're aligning our vision and our goals.

317
00:31:48,709 --> 00:31:50,299
We're maximizing productivity.

318
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:58,459
And again, I just want to emphasize, every time I kind of give you one versus another one, does that mean one is right or one is wrong?

319
00:31:58,579 --> 00:32:04,189
It just means it's different. And so you'll find these types of leadership styles in organizations quite often.

320
00:32:04,429 --> 00:32:11,649
And the key is to think about, a, what kind of leader that person is and how to kind of work with them and be for your purposes,

321
00:32:11,659 --> 00:32:16,789
what kind of leader do you want to be? Some people don't want to work in transformational leadership.

322
00:32:17,329 --> 00:32:19,519
It's been a role that may not be their area.

323
00:32:19,609 --> 00:32:28,819
They may want to really just focus on the narrower part, you know, administer and be, you know, an excellent steward of the resources they're given.

324
00:32:28,819 --> 00:32:34,489
And run it run it with great precision and and discipline.

325
00:32:35,639 --> 00:32:38,849
And then others will kind of come in and they'll say, you know, that's not really for me.

326
00:32:38,849 --> 00:32:43,739
I'd like to be thinking about something, something new, something that I can invent, something that I can create.

327
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:52,089
Okay. So that leads us to our next key topic here, which is strategy versus strategic planning.

328
00:32:52,109 --> 00:32:54,299
I've used this term strategic planning quite a bit,

329
00:32:54,359 --> 00:32:58,379
so I just want to kind of define it for us because we're going to keep using it throughout the term.

330
00:32:58,859 --> 00:33:04,919
So strategy, we say, is focused on sort of those long term goals and objectives.

331
00:33:05,699 --> 00:33:12,959
And this metaphor that I put in here, a longer term course of the ship, not those intermediate waves.

332
00:33:13,529 --> 00:33:16,889
So is my ship making it all the way to its destination?

333
00:33:17,189 --> 00:33:19,979
Not whether or not there's a storm tomorrow or the next day.

334
00:33:20,699 --> 00:33:28,469
Strategic planning, though, is a process for outlining the particulars of that strategy and then how to implement the strategy.

335
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:37,639
So very often what you'll find is transformational leaders of organizations aren't necessarily engaged in the detailed strategic planning.

336
00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:42,409
They might be thinking about broadly, you know, hey, we should expand into this network.

337
00:33:42,409 --> 00:33:49,279
We should do more of X. And I'm going to ask some of my director level team members to help me implement that.

338
00:33:49,789 --> 00:33:55,759
And it's their role to that strategic plan and sort of help the CEO or the leader to say,

339
00:33:55,759 --> 00:34:01,069
okay, well, that's a great idea, nice idea, but we need to consider this, this and this.

340
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:08,299
Now, the key to that dynamic is that strategic planning doesn't become kind of a naysaying type activity.

341
00:34:08,299 --> 00:34:13,159
So it's not designed to be a let's put the brakes on everything, but rather empowering the idea,

342
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:17,479
empowering the vision, empowering that step and saying, hey, we have this great idea.

343
00:34:17,779 --> 00:34:21,469
How are we going to make it happen and how do we make sure that we remove the barriers for it?

344
00:34:22,369 --> 00:34:31,249
So it's deliberate, it's disciplined, and it's designed to produce fundamental decisions for action and guide the what and the why.

345
00:34:32,769 --> 00:34:36,399
Okay. So we're determining our future direction.

346
00:34:37,859 --> 00:34:41,069
And I know I keep saying it, so I'll say it again.

347
00:34:41,489 --> 00:34:44,579
But a key part of it here is the allocation of resources.

348
00:34:44,969 --> 00:34:49,349
That is why we start with looking at our 1990 for our first assignment.

349
00:34:49,649 --> 00:34:53,729
That is why we really start to think about the organization's financial health.

350
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:58,409
Again, to think about those resources. Where are those resources going?

351
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:06,629
And this is a key aspect of of considering what constitutes an organization as reflecting key principles of diversity.

352
00:35:06,629 --> 00:35:15,479
Equity inclusion is whether or not the organization is prioritizing in its budget the values or the mission that it says that it's pursuing.

353
00:35:16,049 --> 00:35:22,139
And so that this part of allocating resources becomes a key question for what direction the organization is taking.

354
00:35:24,439 --> 00:35:31,729
So the strategic planning process then is one that we step through quite often in a very formulaic way.

355
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:36,589
There's not a whole lot that debates that you'll see.

356
00:35:36,919 --> 00:35:40,818
So people don't usually come up with their own brand new model for strategic planning,

357
00:35:40,819 --> 00:35:48,379
although that means that's not to say that we shouldn't have one. But, you know, very often in organizations kind of see the same approaches taken.

358
00:35:49,279 --> 00:35:54,619
Okay. So first, in a strategic plan, we're looking at the mission.

359
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:59,149
What's the mission of the organization? We're kind of looking at it as, all right.

360
00:35:59,179 --> 00:36:05,989
Is this falling inside our mission? If it's not, probably shouldn't we go in there or we need to work with our board to update our mission.

361
00:36:07,699 --> 00:36:10,789
The second component is looking at what is situational.

362
00:36:11,149 --> 00:36:15,679
So we may do an environmental analysis, we might conduct a SWOT analysis.

363
00:36:16,009 --> 00:36:19,939
We're going to conduct a SWOT analysis as part of the second assignment in our course.

364
00:36:20,509 --> 00:36:24,799
Specifically to identify the strengths, the weaknesses, the opportunities and the threats.

365
00:36:25,579 --> 00:36:30,109
You'll hear it all the time in management slides. That's what. So I thought, you know, yeah, we're going to a swot.

366
00:36:30,379 --> 00:36:31,759
It's not about the acronym.

367
00:36:32,179 --> 00:36:38,508
It's about the steps that you are taking in that process to really uncover and consider to the point that was made earlier.

368
00:36:38,509 --> 00:36:41,959
All the different angles of what this part of a decision.

369
00:36:43,989 --> 00:36:48,429
Following that situational analysis. The next thing that we're going to need to do is set up objectives.

370
00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:52,628
What our objectives, what are our goals? What are our targets?

371
00:36:52,629 --> 00:36:53,649
What are key results?

372
00:36:53,979 --> 00:37:01,959
The third assignment in our course is going to set us in a situation in which we are writing a strategic plan for the organization.

373
00:37:02,439 --> 00:37:06,879
And as part of that plan, what we're going to be doing is setting clear objectives.

374
00:37:07,689 --> 00:37:10,958
So have you heard the term smart? We'll come back to that toward the end of the term.

375
00:37:10,959 --> 00:37:16,869
What is a smart objective? Specific, measurable, attainable, time oriented?

376
00:37:17,379 --> 00:37:22,149
These are objectives that we have to set some kind of a metric around so that they actually can happen.

377
00:37:22,179 --> 00:37:25,339
We'll talk about this as we get into that third assignment. You know what?

378
00:37:25,419 --> 00:37:32,498
What does it mean to make one that is specific, but that we're really being intentional about saying that we're going to deliver our case,

379
00:37:32,499 --> 00:37:44,539
that we took our practice case that we took last time. Not just should we expand or not, should we expand to see x number of cities by what date?

380
00:37:45,799 --> 00:37:50,139
How much money will it take? By. When are we going to make that decision?

381
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:55,419
All these things become part of the strategic plan. Then and only then.

382
00:37:55,749 --> 00:38:02,949
And we started to craft, okay, if we know what our goal is, if we know what our target is, then we can start to make a strategy.

383
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:12,488
If we need to have 25 new people here on our staff in order to deliver on our food assistance program for our organization,

384
00:38:12,489 --> 00:38:17,289
well, then we better be hiring them. And if we need to start the food assistance program next year,

385
00:38:17,589 --> 00:38:23,049
then we better be hiring those folks in the next six months so that they have time to be on board and to be trained.

386
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:31,389
Time to get with the flow. And that is precisely why we started to think about an operating plan.

387
00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:37,289
Because what? So I don't have enough personnel to deliver on what I'm saying.

388
00:38:38,069 --> 00:38:42,179
So they're not going to be able to do it. So we need to have that as part of it.

389
00:38:42,629 --> 00:38:47,609
And that is the key part here that that really guides us, which is the evaluation.

390
00:38:48,419 --> 00:38:56,249
So we're evaluating consistently and you can see here on this figure, it feeds back that evaluation process feedback.

391
00:38:56,639 --> 00:39:02,479
So we're constantly evaluating what it is we're doing. You did back in the figure in the middle.

392
00:39:02,479 --> 00:39:06,809
That sense and team plan. What's that mean? So these are different.

393
00:39:06,989 --> 00:39:13,499
They're so medium term, long term. These are usually referring to sort of incremental plans.

394
00:39:13,919 --> 00:39:23,159
So we have to kind of think about how we're going to make our goals associated with the temporality of our strategic plan.

395
00:39:23,699 --> 00:39:28,059
Sometimes, if it's future plans for five years, we're not going to necessarily be able to say like,

396
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:34,529
Hey, we're going to have all these done in the first year. We have to have a set of what categories they fall into to make it.

397
00:39:36,649 --> 00:39:40,339
Okay. So we're asking three questions. What are we going to do?

398
00:39:41,149 --> 00:39:44,599
Why are we going to do it? And how will we do it?

399
00:39:45,879 --> 00:39:51,189
In terms of the different ways that we want to accomplish. So here's another model.

400
00:39:51,189 --> 00:39:55,809
This is sort of this comes from a strategic planning approach and specifically in health care.

401
00:39:56,409 --> 00:39:58,359
You can see it follows a very similar path.

402
00:39:58,959 --> 00:40:08,259
The organization's vision and values, its mission statement, and then the plan development sits nested inside of these different steps,

403
00:40:08,619 --> 00:40:14,079
you know, followed up by gap analysis, operational planning, and then again in that evaluation step.

404
00:40:16,279 --> 00:40:20,179
So there are three levels of strategy that we can kind of think about.

405
00:40:20,629 --> 00:40:25,969
Level one is the corporate strategy. So what sector is the organization in?

406
00:40:25,999 --> 00:40:31,038
What's the emphasis between the sectors? Second is our organization strategy.

407
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:34,609
So how is the organization going to compete within a sector?

408
00:40:35,179 --> 00:40:39,019
And given the organization's resources, how are those going to be allocated?

409
00:40:39,809 --> 00:40:42,479
So you might see two organizations competing.

410
00:40:42,479 --> 00:40:48,059
I alluded to the case that we'll have in a few weeks where the American Red Cross is competing with the Carolina blood bank.

411
00:40:48,979 --> 00:40:55,339
It's competition. It's the same sector. And so we have to think about then what are the resources that need to be allocated there?

412
00:40:56,449 --> 00:40:58,219
And we'll also have a functional strategy.

413
00:40:58,369 --> 00:41:06,589
So effective and consistent functional strategies are those that are then predicated on implementation via operational planning.

414
00:41:07,159 --> 00:41:09,769
So standing planning, single use planning budgets,

415
00:41:09,769 --> 00:41:17,509
these are all tools that we're using to have a functional strategy distinct from the organization strategy for understanding the environment.

416
00:41:19,449 --> 00:41:26,079
We have to adjust for risk. So we take into account, you know, what are the underlying health statuses of our population?

417
00:41:26,439 --> 00:41:30,429
What are the health spending groups of enrollees were doing with insurance?

418
00:41:31,919 --> 00:41:36,539
And then we have to also consider what makes a risk adjustment.

419
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:42,119
So this is where, you know, we have to keep in mind, again, to our core principles that we set out on our first session.

420
00:41:43,529 --> 00:41:47,969
The fundamental issue with assumption is that we might just be playing the game.

421
00:41:49,709 --> 00:41:54,959
So we're not really trying to figure out what can really help or what can really make a difference.

422
00:41:54,959 --> 00:41:58,139
We're just sort of we're just implementing we're just doing it.

423
00:41:58,709 --> 00:42:06,749
We're not asking those questions. And as a result, there are really limited ways to account for measuring social determinants of health.

424
00:42:06,779 --> 00:42:12,249
We see this quite a bit with hospitals. They're required to file a Schedule H on their 919 recognizer.

425
00:42:12,269 --> 00:42:14,428
I'm going to be doing hospital. No, ninety's in here.

426
00:42:14,429 --> 00:42:22,019
But just as a as a reference point, they have to file schedule and they have to try to measure what their impact was on social determinants of health.

427
00:42:22,349 --> 00:42:27,209
It's difficult. It's difficult to really conceptual, to compute or to quantify.

428
00:42:28,899 --> 00:42:34,689
So we're an organization that's delivering services in health services.

429
00:42:35,409 --> 00:42:41,709
We think about that these five core areas that our strategic plans need to address, the quality that we're providing,

430
00:42:42,009 --> 00:42:47,618
how much access is available to our constituents, whether or not our employees are being retained.

431
00:42:47,619 --> 00:42:55,089
We're seeing that as a very difficult component right now in organizations, whether or not we can even maintain employees,

432
00:42:55,479 --> 00:43:02,829
retain excuse me, employees with our differentiation in the market, and then how do we align our resources?

433
00:43:03,009 --> 00:43:06,759
All these questions that you need to be asking and all I might add,

434
00:43:06,759 --> 00:43:12,909
questions that we're kind of contending with in this practice case with the organization you're thinking about.

435
00:43:13,919 --> 00:43:18,989
What its quality would be if it expanded access would be set up,

436
00:43:19,979 --> 00:43:23,459
whether or not you would be able to retain the employees if you do make that decision.

437
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:29,039
How it will differentiate itself, the organization, and how to spend the resources.

438
00:43:30,799 --> 00:43:38,689
So there are other models that we've seen, you know, to think about sort of how we how we model organization,

439
00:43:38,689 --> 00:43:45,279
employee type workforce questions, a hierarchy of needs is a very famous one.

440
00:43:45,919 --> 00:43:53,299
There are motivators and hygiene factors that we might consider organizations we use my or my Myers-Briggs.

441
00:43:54,169 --> 00:43:59,298
Although I would say that many of these have been classically used and there are likely ways they're a little

442
00:43:59,299 --> 00:44:05,359
bit more inclusive and a little bit more reflective of the diversity of the organization's workforce,

443
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:08,149
as opposed to ones developed many, many years ago.

444
00:44:08,419 --> 00:44:14,569
But I wanted to just bring them to your attention, because you'll see them commonly used inside of management settings.

445
00:44:17,169 --> 00:44:25,119
Another theory that we can kind of think about in terms of achieving excellence is the three needs.

446
00:44:25,719 --> 00:44:31,719
So the need for affiliation, how we affiliate with the organization itself, the need for achievement.

447
00:44:31,929 --> 00:44:39,519
So do we get some results? So I can hear this for folks who are mid-career and I don't really feel like I'm achieving anything.

448
00:44:39,999 --> 00:44:44,019
I'm doing great. I'm making my salary. I'm doing my job.

449
00:44:44,439 --> 00:44:49,439
I have my life. Everything's moving along according to plan.

450
00:44:49,449 --> 00:44:50,769
But I don't feel like I'm really achieving.

451
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:58,458
Sometimes in capital campaigns, we see this quite a bit inside of nonprofits, so they're raising a lot of money for a goal.

452
00:44:58,459 --> 00:45:02,769
They're going to build a brand new building. It's very exciting. You know, it's a five year plan.

453
00:45:02,779 --> 00:45:06,589
We're going to build the building, we're going to put it up. We're going to have all new services.

454
00:45:06,589 --> 00:45:09,858
We're going to have people coming in. It's going to be beautiful. It's going to be incredible.

455
00:45:09,859 --> 00:45:16,729
And then it's five years later, the building goes up, it opens, everyone comes in and then, okay, oh, well, what am I going?

456
00:45:17,819 --> 00:45:27,339
So yeah, I think that the third need which you find in leadership offer, which is the need for power, a power you could kind of characterize two ways.

457
00:45:27,339 --> 00:45:34,469
You could say, well, power is serve a thirst to have control and be powerful and and have or you could think about it in terms of empowerment.

458
00:45:35,129 --> 00:45:40,229
Do I feel that I have power? Do I feel that I have agency as a leader in my organization?

459
00:45:40,639 --> 00:45:44,009
I feel that I have the ability to be transformational at all.

460
00:45:44,519 --> 00:45:54,809
If my managerial structure or my hierarchy doesn't really give me much room to develop or my leadership is kind of saying, Yeah, that's nice.

461
00:45:54,839 --> 00:45:59,159
Now we're not doing that. Well, I may not really have much interest in continuing.

462
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:11,439
So change management. Then when we think about sort of what predicates change is really all about unleashing those pieces of intrinsic motivation.

463
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:21,549
So we're critically then thinking about how we can unleash that motivation to start co-designing through

464
00:46:21,729 --> 00:46:27,249
change associated with different people in our organization and really get to the point where we're adapting.

465
00:46:28,209 --> 00:46:33,519
Through a distribution of power. Okay, stop there.

466
00:46:37,289 --> 00:46:47,789
I don't. So the reason I set all that up for us today is because what I want you to think about as we're kind of moving forward, our three principles.

467
00:46:48,419 --> 00:46:51,689
One, what's the landscape that the work that we're working in?

468
00:46:52,859 --> 00:46:56,939
What's the landscape? We talked about that in our first sort of discussion.

469
00:46:57,629 --> 00:47:01,979
There's a lot of organization, there's a lot of different sectors. There's a lot of people working in that.

470
00:47:02,819 --> 00:47:09,179
Number two, how do the organizations start to really differentiate themselves through a mission, a vision and values?

471
00:47:09,539 --> 00:47:12,899
And how do they help their boards understand what those are?

472
00:47:13,679 --> 00:47:25,679
And number 333, how do we start to think about achieving excellence out of the organization driven to make an impact in that capacity?

473
00:47:26,889 --> 00:47:34,279
Questions there. Okay.

474
00:47:35,029 --> 00:47:40,099
I think I'm sure to be back here at five.

475
00:47:40,509 --> 00:47:46,158
Oh. It.

476
00:47:48,714 --> 00:47:58,104
Oh, that's right. That's right. Everyone goes initially, but they don't speak.

477
00:47:58,824 --> 00:48:05,114
It's. Okay. Welcome back. All right, I want to try something today.

478
00:48:05,164 --> 00:48:10,254
Just make it a little easier to move through with our timing. I'm going to ask that for presenters today.

479
00:48:10,284 --> 00:48:12,864
Let's try. We did this last year and I thought it worked well.

480
00:48:13,554 --> 00:48:18,864
I'll click aside and if you want a present from either where you are or come up, that's fine.

481
00:48:19,194 --> 00:48:25,404
But I'll this is the thing that we kind of keep moving, follow the after and maximize time for a case group.

482
00:48:26,124 --> 00:48:31,644
So I make sure we have time. Okay. Wants to go first. There's no order that's required.

483
00:48:33,284 --> 00:48:46,604
I think. Just tell me when you open your mouth.

484
00:48:48,974 --> 00:48:54,604
So, hello, my name is Mariah, and today I will be discussing the current opioid epidemic.

485
00:48:55,354 --> 00:48:59,104
So just a quick disclaimer. I understand this could be a sensitive topic for some.

486
00:48:59,104 --> 00:49:06,694
Some may be stressful as well. So if you do feel the need to step out or take a moment, please feel free to do so again.

487
00:49:07,474 --> 00:49:14,314
So just to dove in, I wanted to go over a brief historical timeline of the U.S. opioid epidemic.

488
00:49:14,824 --> 00:49:20,704
So starting in the early 1990s, operations were prescribed at greater rates for pain treatment.

489
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:26,223
And this is primarily due to the fact that pharmaceutical companies assured medical

490
00:49:26,224 --> 00:49:32,344
communities that patients would not get addicted to opioid pain relievers forever.

491
00:49:32,374 --> 00:49:40,894
As time goes on, we can see that that kind of changes. So that essentially resulted in the first wave of the opioid epidemic in 1991.

492
00:49:41,854 --> 00:49:44,314
Moving forward to the second wave,

493
00:49:45,244 --> 00:49:52,144
this increase increase occurrence of prescriptions resulted in widespread misuse of both prescription and prescription opioids.

494
00:49:52,594 --> 00:49:58,893
So the second wave occurred in 2010 with increased overdose deaths involving heroin leading into the third wave,

495
00:49:58,894 --> 00:50:06,904
which occurred in 2013, which involved overdose deaths involving synthetic opioid, such as ethanol.

496
00:50:08,944 --> 00:50:16,494
And then also in 2017. In 2017, the opioid crisis was declared a public health emergency.

497
00:50:18,754 --> 00:50:29,134
So with regard to the current state of the opioid epidemic, we can recognize the opioid overdose death rate has been a rapid increase.

498
00:50:29,494 --> 00:50:31,084
So on the left here,

499
00:50:31,084 --> 00:50:40,894
you can see a graph showing the total number of U.S. drug opioid deaths involving both illicit and prescription opioid drugs from 1999 to 2020.

500
00:50:41,794 --> 00:50:45,994
And most recently, having little over 68,000 in 2020.

501
00:50:46,804 --> 00:50:54,474
And then to point out a few more key statistics, we can see that a little over 17,000 people died from drug overdoses in 2019.

502
00:50:54,814 --> 00:50:59,694
10.1 million people in Missouri, misuse of prescription opioids in the past year,

503
00:51:00,154 --> 00:51:07,864
and 1.6 million people also misuse great opioid prescription pain relievers for the first time.

504
00:51:08,924 --> 00:51:18,403
So moving on to the next slide, we can see that the opioid epidemic was declared a public emergency in 2017,

505
00:51:18,404 --> 00:51:22,454
leading to the current strategy, which is a ten pronged strategy.

506
00:51:22,874 --> 00:51:31,964
And just to name a few strategies that they decided to implement to kind of get the prevention started targeted naloxone distribution,

507
00:51:31,964 --> 00:51:38,814
medication assisted treatment, academic detailing and eliminating prior authorization requirements for opioid use disorder.

508
00:51:41,194 --> 00:51:48,094
So the nonprofit I decided to choose to discuss today is Sunrise Navigation Center,

509
00:51:48,844 --> 00:51:53,014
which is a nonprofit in Austin, Austin, Texas, with a five on C three status.

510
00:51:53,974 --> 00:52:01,234
They were originally established in 2015 as a church and expanded to function as a homeless service center in Austin, Texas.

511
00:52:01,294 --> 00:52:06,064
More specifically, Travis County. So they worked to provide free meals, water.

512
00:52:06,484 --> 00:52:10,834
They even provide mail services as well, if you need to pick up your mail or anything like that.

513
00:52:11,674 --> 00:52:16,684
And their primary mission is leveraging human humanitarian aid, mental physical health care,

514
00:52:16,684 --> 00:52:24,534
substance abuse care and housing navigation assistance to build onramp services needed to acquire safe and supportive housing,

515
00:52:24,574 --> 00:52:29,314
also through community partnerships as well. Moving on.

516
00:52:29,494 --> 00:52:36,904
So the current crisis is obviously a very broad current event seems to be nonstop.

517
00:52:36,914 --> 00:52:40,504
So I'm just connecting it to something a little bit more current,

518
00:52:41,844 --> 00:52:47,583
etc. as navigation centers want to implement Narcan vending machines in the city of Austin.

519
00:52:47,584 --> 00:52:52,684
So just for a little background, Narcan is a prescription nasal spray, if medically known as naloxone,

520
00:52:53,614 --> 00:52:58,054
and it's utilized during opioid overdose emergencies that converse effects and restore brain

521
00:52:58,054 --> 00:53:04,134
function as well as breathing and that helps individuals save lives will help can arrive so and it

522
00:53:04,144 --> 00:53:09,634
was a short term solution for now but we can see that significantly progress in terms of remedy

523
00:53:11,434 --> 00:53:17,164
sonar can usually requires a doctor's prescription and it varies between 35 and $70 per dose,

524
00:53:17,374 --> 00:53:20,494
which can be a lot for some, especially if that utilization adds up.

525
00:53:21,634 --> 00:53:26,493
So Sunrise Navigation Center partnered with Nice, the Nice project specifically,

526
00:53:26,494 --> 00:53:32,014
which is Narcan in case of emergency to implement these machines in the state of Texas.

527
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:37,323
And these machines are available 24 seven and are free of cost.

528
00:53:37,324 --> 00:53:42,153
So if you actually click again, that's just a little example of what it looks like.

529
00:53:42,154 --> 00:53:49,804
And then if you can press the thank you, that's the vending machine that has been implemented.

530
00:53:50,704 --> 00:53:59,614
And with that being said, this machine was the first one in Texas established by Sunrise Navigation Center.

531
00:54:00,004 --> 00:54:04,924
And they've actually gone months with empty machines, especially because they serve around 300 people a day.

532
00:54:04,924 --> 00:54:14,014
So it's definitely surprising. So this machine has been proven successful in Austin as well as Philadelphia across the U.S., Google and Ann Arbor.

533
00:54:14,374 --> 00:54:19,054
So when I do upload this presentation, there is a link for that article if anybody is interested,

534
00:54:19,054 --> 00:54:21,364
if they wanted to speak a little bit more about that.

535
00:54:22,294 --> 00:54:30,004
But this is just a little bit of information about the work our community is doing to target and mitigate the opioid crisis.

536
00:54:30,724 --> 00:54:34,294
So with that being said, we can move on to discussion portion.

537
00:54:38,154 --> 00:54:41,574
Excellent. So if I should just jump into it.

538
00:54:41,844 --> 00:54:46,134
But the first question, outline it for the.

539
00:54:46,144 --> 00:54:50,964
Sorry, sorry, go, go. First question, it's just to kick us off.

540
00:54:51,174 --> 00:54:57,474
Are there any disadvantages to the implementation of the non prescribed Martin vending machines?

541
00:54:57,744 --> 00:55:02,364
So if anybody had any ideas for that, we can kind of go through them one by one.

542
00:55:02,844 --> 00:55:10,034
The Environment Team. Yes. So I don't know if this is necessarily specific to the vending machines,

543
00:55:10,034 --> 00:55:20,234
but I think one of the major disadvantages with Narcan is that there's such a stigma on drug use that oftentimes people still are using alone.

544
00:55:20,244 --> 00:55:26,024
So it's not effective to prevent an overdose unless somebody is with you who has Narcan.

545
00:55:26,914 --> 00:55:37,424
Yeah. And I think that's a really great point, too, because I did read and one of the targeted strategies that there's a educational program

546
00:55:37,424 --> 00:55:42,454
where people are trained to identify an opioid crisis and what they can do in that situation.

547
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:47,084
So I think that's a really good point. That's kind of a connection to their strategy.

548
00:55:47,444 --> 00:55:52,574
What does the vending machine put up? You said the one that you're talking about, it was sort of very similar.

549
00:55:52,594 --> 00:55:56,114
The August pills. Yeah, it was pretty good.

550
00:55:56,234 --> 00:55:59,264
The first one in the state of Texas. In the state and in Austin, Texas.

551
00:56:00,104 --> 00:56:05,524
The first one in the state. Like Austin. Not the first one or not in a.

552
00:56:08,294 --> 00:56:12,253
So I. I know I always talk about the city of Dearborn.

553
00:56:12,254 --> 00:56:15,584
Don't kill me over information to you, but we just actually implement.

554
00:56:15,614 --> 00:56:19,454
We actually just got marketing vending machines that we're going to put in Dearborn.

555
00:56:19,874 --> 00:56:25,004
And some of the disadvantages that we actually discussed were, for example, placement.

556
00:56:25,364 --> 00:56:28,894
Where could we place this where people actually come to it?

557
00:56:29,384 --> 00:56:36,434
Does it need to be somewhere the you know, where will people actually go and use this market?

558
00:56:36,464 --> 00:56:42,253
Right. We also talked about some people like I remember when it was first posted that people in the community were like, oh, it's free.

559
00:56:42,254 --> 00:56:45,634
Everyone's going to go and take it. So maybe they need to know.

560
00:56:45,644 --> 00:56:49,874
Well, you can always get in our card for free anywhere, any pharmacy or whatever.

561
00:56:49,874 --> 00:56:55,003
So it's always available. So it's always like like Katie mentioned, there's like a lot of stigma surrounding it.

562
00:56:55,004 --> 00:56:58,904
So it's actually getting people to go in and use it. Definitely a disadvantage.

563
00:56:59,064 --> 00:57:04,034
Yeah, that's a really great point. Um, so we can move on to discussion too.

564
00:57:04,034 --> 00:57:17,564
So in the previous press we can see that in this graph on the left you can see there's a little bit of a gender disparity between the overall stats.

565
00:57:17,654 --> 00:57:22,364
And that kind of got me thinking why is there such a disparity, especially 2016 and on?

566
00:57:22,364 --> 00:57:28,934
It tends to widen the gap a little bit. So I was just wondering if anybody had any ideas as to why this might be occurring.

567
00:57:32,924 --> 00:57:38,204
Which I'm sure is a very loaded question. It can be a million different things, but.

568
00:57:42,214 --> 00:57:46,143
Oh, I hope I'm just going to what I think.

569
00:57:46,144 --> 00:57:51,784
And I'm not I don't have a lot of life experience or anything, so I'm sorry because it's like a really stupid answer agenda.

570
00:57:51,784 --> 00:57:57,654
I'm not that informed, but I guess like what I was thinking right off the bat, maybe because it seems like it's higher.

571
00:57:57,754 --> 00:58:01,384
Higher in males, maybe females feel like.

572
00:58:02,484 --> 00:58:06,594
Even feel stupid for saying this is all right. You must have, like, a better.

573
00:58:08,574 --> 00:58:12,954
Of support system, like they feel like they can talk through it with their friends or something,

574
00:58:12,954 --> 00:58:18,384
but maybe males don't feel that comfortable, like if they're going through.

575
00:58:19,744 --> 00:58:25,323
You know, if they're going through it, they just want to keep to themselves like, oh, I don't really have a problem.

576
00:58:25,324 --> 00:58:29,914
But maybe females like, notice it more and then. Solve it?

577
00:58:29,914 --> 00:58:33,654
I don't know. And we know. Yeah, that totally makes sense. Um,

578
00:58:34,774 --> 00:58:39,933
does it have to do with prescriptions from providers and that emails are provided opioids

579
00:58:39,934 --> 00:58:45,234
or commonly than females become addicted to prescriptions and over using that way.

580
00:58:46,164 --> 00:58:50,064
That is actually a really good point. I personally, I don't know the answer.

581
00:58:50,094 --> 00:58:55,464
So that's why I was just hoping to gather some ideas. But I actually like that idea because be practical to say.

582
00:58:55,464 --> 00:59:03,684
That's all I said. If it is related to prescription opioids and like women generally when they're in pregnancy,

583
00:59:04,044 --> 00:59:07,314
they have like you're like consulting with like medications.

584
00:59:08,154 --> 00:59:12,394
So that can also. Yeah.

585
00:59:13,334 --> 00:59:15,344
There's something. I have a point over here.

586
00:59:18,374 --> 00:59:25,334
Oh, I was going to say kind of like what we care about, like the mortality versus morbidity rate and like, woman and man.

587
00:59:26,444 --> 00:59:30,974
And a lot of it may have to do with, again, like stigma may be men are less likely to reach out for help,

588
00:59:31,454 --> 00:59:37,244
like they have some kind of health care need versus women who are more likely to go to a physician or reach out for help.

589
00:59:37,904 --> 00:59:41,564
It's not that kind of conversations are not really great points.

590
00:59:42,494 --> 00:59:45,614
And then finally, just a very brief question.

591
00:59:45,614 --> 00:59:52,903
So could the implementation of Narcan vending machines be a long term solution to the potential eradication or reduction of the opioid epidemic?

592
00:59:52,904 --> 00:59:59,654
And I know it's on that a little bit, but this is more so like a yes or no answer in a way.

593
01:00:01,334 --> 01:00:06,644
I think it's much more of a downstream solution, so probably less likely to eradicate.

594
01:00:06,834 --> 01:00:10,124
You know, you could certainly reduce the mortality impact.

595
01:00:12,954 --> 01:00:23,063
I have a follow up question on that. So in terms of Sunrise's contribution to this, is this machine, you know,

596
01:00:23,064 --> 01:00:27,114
is it branded with their information or is it just that they paid for it to be there?

597
01:00:27,744 --> 01:00:33,154
It's the latter. They don't have any branding information on there.

598
01:00:33,174 --> 01:00:39,143
It's more so because they've partnered with the Nice Project, which as much as an organic case of emergency, it's address for.

599
01:00:39,144 --> 01:00:43,014
So put out that remedy for people as opposed to giving them that resource.

600
01:00:44,184 --> 01:00:51,343
So. Given the answers, just given or some others, I'm happy to hear what are our thoughts collectively,

601
01:00:51,344 --> 01:00:55,244
if it's okay, if it is a jump on past great work because it's a great question.

602
01:00:55,724 --> 01:01:02,234
What are our thoughts and of Sunrise's strategic decision to continue in that capacity?

603
01:01:02,564 --> 01:01:09,284
Is it how is it adhering and maybe you know best because you know or is it really how is that adhering to its mission?

604
01:01:09,854 --> 01:01:17,173
You know, if it's seen as a very down to stream impact, you know, I think there would be challenges justifying continuing with it.

605
01:01:17,174 --> 01:01:21,134
Or you of how does the organization start to contend with this decision?

606
01:01:22,074 --> 01:01:29,584
What do you think? Essentially it is the organization is making a contribution to that long term.

607
01:01:39,334 --> 01:01:44,434
I think I'm sorry, but I was going to say, I think any form of harm reduction.

608
01:01:48,264 --> 01:01:54,414
Watch. You know, the Narcan vending machines could be doing our.

609
01:01:55,804 --> 01:02:03,424
You know, contributing to their mission, which was, as you mentioned earlier, to reduce the.

610
01:02:05,294 --> 01:02:09,464
Like help, help with eradicating the opioid epidemic or reducing it, right.

611
01:02:09,474 --> 01:02:18,374
So even though this may be might not be a standalone solution, it's still something like who's to say that there is a stand alone solution?

612
01:02:18,374 --> 01:02:23,384
So putting any effort towards it is ultimately fulfilling the mission as far as you.

613
01:02:23,684 --> 01:02:28,784
Yeah, I agree with that too. And I know I mentioned too that it's a very short term solution.

614
01:02:28,784 --> 01:02:32,563
Obviously, it's got a good chunk of progress, especially the machines are empty every day.

615
01:02:32,564 --> 01:02:36,944
But in a way it almost looks like a cycle where there are constant opioid

616
01:02:36,944 --> 01:02:40,333
overdoses and people just go to the vending machine and then they don't get help,

617
01:02:40,334 --> 01:02:44,444
and then it could just become like a cycle or that it just keeps happening. And it's not really.

618
01:02:45,524 --> 01:02:50,624
A primary or permanent solution to actually eradicate or let alone reduce the epidemic.

619
01:02:50,844 --> 01:03:00,364
So it's a really good point. And I actually was also thinking about like the gender disparity still.

620
01:03:00,384 --> 01:03:03,354
I interned with the Drug Policy Alliance, which is really big on this as well.

621
01:03:03,824 --> 01:03:10,403
And and the one thing I like is like the fear of, I guess, criminalization and policing and stuff.

622
01:03:10,404 --> 01:03:14,964
So that might also be a reason why males are likely to overdose more because they don't

623
01:03:14,964 --> 01:03:18,384
want to like ask for help and call the police and have to deal with law enforcement.

624
01:03:19,494 --> 01:03:27,444
But I just think, like as a long term solution, I think I want to lean towards no, I think could be part of the solution.

625
01:03:27,444 --> 01:03:30,444
But like the opioid crisis, definitely.

626
01:03:30,834 --> 01:03:36,774
Like on your timeline, I would even go further to like the war on drugs 1970s and how it became like a racial issue.

627
01:03:37,074 --> 01:03:41,454
So I think there's lots of different aspects of the opioid epidemic.

628
01:03:41,874 --> 01:03:47,834
So I think this helps, but I don't think like for the point like eradication, it's definitely a part of the.

629
01:03:51,024 --> 01:03:55,074
Yeah, I agree. I'll just also go off your point about the gender disparity.

630
01:03:55,084 --> 01:04:03,294
I was thinking about one of the most high risk populations for opioid overdoses are those reentering society from jails and prisons.

631
01:04:03,294 --> 01:04:07,584
So we tend to incarcerate more males. So I wonder if that might have something to do with that too.

632
01:04:08,124 --> 01:04:16,494
And then as far as a long term solution, like I agree with what everyone else has said, that it's a it's definitely more downstream,

633
01:04:17,574 --> 01:04:24,804
but it might be worth looking at like the cost effectiveness of having that machine and then also comparing like if they had something to compare to,

634
01:04:24,804 --> 01:04:31,583
like maybe they were handing out Narcan at the front desk before, but people weren't getting it or same thing like a mirror set in pharmacies.

635
01:04:31,584 --> 01:04:38,214
A lot of times people don't want to have to have that like human interaction to ask for it because of stigma.

636
01:04:38,224 --> 01:04:41,634
So yeah, no comparing those different strategies.

637
01:04:41,814 --> 01:04:48,084
Yeah. Thank everyone for your points and for your attention in the excellent presentation.

638
01:04:48,084 --> 01:04:53,004
And I think I appreciate that you brought to our attention how this organization is making this

639
01:04:53,004 --> 01:05:00,624
contribution and specifically how we can think about what the contribution is to the larger social issue,

640
01:05:00,774 --> 01:05:01,763
which I think it is.

641
01:05:01,764 --> 01:05:09,714
You are right, it's a broad debate, but it's one where we we can see a very specific, measurable program that the organization's delivering.

642
01:05:10,614 --> 01:05:15,114
Thank you. Excellent. All right.

643
01:05:20,964 --> 01:05:24,234
That's good.

644
01:05:24,994 --> 01:05:32,393
Quickly. But let's out wherever you all want to go from from your seat, from here, from there.

645
01:05:32,394 --> 01:05:35,604
Whatever you want, it doesn't matter. I just want to make sure I can help to move it.

646
01:05:35,754 --> 01:05:39,234
I'm going to sit. I'm going to be.

647
01:05:39,264 --> 01:05:47,454
For those of you who don't know me today, I'm going to be talking about the role of and my which of nonprofit in response to the monkeypox outbreak.

648
01:05:48,264 --> 01:05:52,434
I do just want to acknowledge quickly got the W.H.O. has announced plan to rename

649
01:05:52,434 --> 01:05:56,454
the virus given the harmful racial overtones and stigma associated with it.

650
01:05:56,784 --> 01:06:01,074
But they haven't done that yet. So for now it's content to be referred to as monkeypox.

651
01:06:02,334 --> 01:06:09,144
So quickly. What is monkeypox? It was first discovered in humans in the 1970s, and it's been endemic to multiple African countries.

652
01:06:09,834 --> 01:06:12,804
However, it's usually been spread by rodents and small animal bites.

653
01:06:13,194 --> 01:06:20,484
But in early 2022, infections by human to human transmission started occurring and were reported in over 50 countries in multiple regions,

654
01:06:21,054 --> 01:06:26,094
so that in June of 2020, the W.H.O. declared an evolving public health risk.

655
01:06:27,384 --> 01:06:36,384
As most of you probably already know, it's spread by close, intimate contact with the main symptoms being rash, fever, chills and body aches.

656
01:06:36,384 --> 01:06:41,874
And it's preventable by the same vaccine that we use for smallpox in terms of who it's impacting.

657
01:06:42,204 --> 01:06:49,283
The New England Journal of Medicine recently published an article looking at the transmission between April and June 2020 to this year.

658
01:06:49,284 --> 01:06:53,813
And the study showed that the vast majority of the cases were among gay and bisexual

659
01:06:53,814 --> 01:06:59,004
men with a disproportionate impact on those who already have a diagnosis of HIV.

660
01:06:59,904 --> 01:07:02,964
And it showed that most cases were transmitted through sexual activity.

661
01:07:04,854 --> 01:07:11,754
So focusing on the US here, the response to monkeypox has been slow to say the least,

662
01:07:12,594 --> 01:07:21,294
in terms of the government's role it has been to obtain and distribute vaccines and that effort has been lacking as people are probably aware.

663
01:07:21,714 --> 01:07:28,583
And we had access to vaccine manufacturers early on, but we didn't get on top of it on them on board soon enough.

664
01:07:28,584 --> 01:07:34,554
And so now we have resorted to the strategy of splitting vaccines into smaller doses in order to get them to more people,

665
01:07:35,064 --> 01:07:46,494
but with less protection, obviously. And so, yeah, despite being declared a public health risk in June by the W.H.O., Biden didn't announce a name,

666
01:07:46,494 --> 01:07:55,494
a team to lead the response until August, and then due to large pressure, it was pretty quickly, then declared a public health emergency.

667
01:07:56,454 --> 01:08:01,464
So just quickly, a snapshot of what's happening in the US right now, perhaps unsurprisingly,

668
01:08:01,464 --> 01:08:07,434
we have the largest number of cases in the world with around 22,000 as of when I.

669
01:08:08,624 --> 01:08:15,434
I took the statistic off the CDC website, and while cases have been decreasing over the past couple of weeks,

670
01:08:16,154 --> 01:08:22,964
disparities have been worsening with a larger percentage of new cases in black Americans.

671
01:08:23,804 --> 01:08:31,184
And there's a number of factors that might go into this, including lack of access to vaccine vaccines, as well as an element of vaccine hesitancy.

672
01:08:32,474 --> 01:08:38,264
So where do non-profits come in here? So I actually found this article in the AP news.

673
01:08:38,264 --> 01:08:43,634
I was pointing out that there has been quite a lack of funding for nonprofits and charities for monkeypox,

674
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:49,504
and this article was positing that this is likely due from sort of fatigue from COVID.

675
01:08:49,514 --> 01:08:58,784
The fact that it's a less the disease has less mortality and also potentially because it impacts the LGBTQ community largely.

676
01:08:59,834 --> 01:09:06,884
But so to address this gap in funding, a few pharmaceutical companies have come forward,

677
01:09:06,884 --> 01:09:12,644
have stepped in to provide funding largely aimed at educational and advocacy campaigns.

678
01:09:13,094 --> 01:09:22,304
And so all of the organizations listed on this page are some of the folks that they said that they've given funding to.

679
01:09:23,414 --> 01:09:30,824
And the goal, the role here is to basically address the poor government response and account for the growing disparities.

680
01:09:33,044 --> 01:09:37,094
So the organization that I'm focusing on is an organization called And Max.

681
01:09:37,784 --> 01:09:42,524
So they were founded in the 1980s, originally as the National Minority AIDS Council.

682
01:09:42,914 --> 01:09:47,414
They in recent years have decided to just go by the moniker and Mark because they

683
01:09:47,414 --> 01:09:53,594
thought that both the word minority and AIDS were less relevant in recent years,

684
01:09:54,734 --> 01:10:00,164
and as opposed to many of the organizations I talked with talked about thus far in this course,

685
01:10:00,164 --> 01:10:06,764
and Mark has made it mainly focused on education and policy as opposed to sort of direct programing and aid.

686
01:10:07,244 --> 01:10:11,474
And so there are three sort of ways that they have are their treatment division,

687
01:10:12,704 --> 01:10:20,084
which advocates for HIV research and treatments and educates through webinars, newsletters and social media.

688
01:10:20,924 --> 01:10:27,764
Their training center, which works with health departments and community organizations to end HIV epidemics,

689
01:10:28,274 --> 01:10:31,723
and the government relations and public policy wing,

690
01:10:31,724 --> 01:10:37,544
which is responsible for advancing the legislative priorities on Capitol Hill and within the federal administration.

691
01:10:38,744 --> 01:10:43,903
So you might be asking yourself, why is the HIV organization playing a huge role here?

692
01:10:43,904 --> 01:10:51,464
But get to that. So what is their role in the monkeypox response?

693
01:10:53,114 --> 01:10:58,114
As as I mentioned, they're mainly a policy and advocacy organization.

694
01:10:58,124 --> 01:11:07,364
So with this funding from Julianne, they're acting as the I'm organizing center to advance the policy priorities of distributing more vaccines,

695
01:11:08,174 --> 01:11:12,224
advocating for vaccine equity and overcoming vaccine hesitancy.

696
01:11:13,184 --> 01:11:21,913
So they're doing this through leading meetings with officials from the White House and other federal agencies weekly newsletters, townhalls,

697
01:11:21,914 --> 01:11:29,984
and then some direct service type stuff with partnering with local health organizations to distribute and encourage vaccination.

698
01:11:32,234 --> 01:11:36,643
So as I mentioned earlier, I actually forgot to actually say what their mission was.

699
01:11:36,644 --> 01:11:44,354
But their mission is to lead with race, to fight for health equity and racial justice, to end the HIV epidemic in America.

700
01:11:45,314 --> 01:11:52,694
And so, as I mentioned, the disparities are increasing even as monkeypox cases are declining.

701
01:11:53,144 --> 01:12:01,754
So and Mark's mission to lead Grace seemingly puts them in a very good position to lead this response.

702
01:12:02,384 --> 01:12:11,863
But that does kind of lead into my first discussion question, which is, you know, we've talked a lot about in this class,

703
01:12:11,864 --> 01:12:19,844
or at least last class, we talked about how nonprofits often have broad mission statements in order to adapt to new challenges over time.

704
01:12:20,804 --> 01:12:26,324
So wondering if people think that and that specific mission of ending the HIV epidemic

705
01:12:26,774 --> 01:12:30,704
in America impacts how much of a role they can play in addressing monkeypox,

706
01:12:30,704 --> 01:12:34,124
or how much they afford authority they may be involved in this space.

707
01:12:45,154 --> 01:12:48,454
I definitely think that they can play a role in this.

708
01:12:48,484 --> 01:12:55,264
When I first started hearing about monkey parts, listening to podcasts, listening to the news in my head, I was like, Didn't we already,

709
01:12:55,264 --> 01:13:03,423
like go over the fact that the way that AIDS and HIV was framed in the eighties was just like awful for the LGBTQ community?

710
01:13:03,424 --> 01:13:11,734
And we already addressed that. And like, the monkeypox epidemic was literally being framed in like a very similar way.

711
01:13:12,034 --> 01:13:21,064
So I do think that and Merck has a role that they can play, especially in the education and kind of reducing those inequities.

712
01:13:23,514 --> 01:13:28,844
I kind of leading off that similarly, you know in the stats you provided right,

713
01:13:28,884 --> 01:13:35,424
that there's a large portion of those individuals who are contracting monkeypox who already are living with HIV.

714
01:13:35,874 --> 01:13:42,254
So I think there is already a natural overlap there that they can identify as a kind of a jumping off point to.

715
01:13:45,664 --> 01:13:49,044
And knowing that, don't.

716
01:13:50,384 --> 01:13:59,804
Yeah, I was just going to say jumping off point too is when a lot of non-profits, I think, use opportunities like this,

717
01:13:59,804 --> 01:14:06,824
like currently monkeypox is like a really scary thing at the forefront of a lot of people's minds, especially LGBTQ youth.

718
01:14:07,244 --> 01:14:14,204
And so they could use this also as an opportunity to like provide a monkeypox vaccine

719
01:14:14,204 --> 01:14:19,363
or information on it and information about HPV and kind of do like two for one,

720
01:14:19,364 --> 01:14:28,144
which is that like sticking with information also like helping reach people about this currently scary monster country.

721
01:14:30,964 --> 01:14:39,493
Because others have said the organization definitely has relevant experience that can kind of, you know, inform the monkeypox situation.

722
01:14:39,494 --> 01:14:44,864
And also, as you mentioned in the presentation, right, they kind of changed their acronym to kind of be more broad.

723
01:14:44,864 --> 01:14:49,993
And, you know, if they're contributing to the monkeypox epidemic and trying to help solve things,

724
01:14:49,994 --> 01:14:53,214
I mean, people really know what their position stands for.

725
01:14:53,234 --> 01:14:59,654
Not I mean, if they're doing good work, I don't think I think that's more important than the overall mission statement.

726
01:15:02,794 --> 01:15:10,884
I also had like similar points to what they mean that because of their experience with an epidemic like HIV, they have the access,

727
01:15:10,894 --> 01:15:20,224
they have the experience which they can definitely leverage and, you know, do similar kind of work for monkeypox.

728
01:15:21,004 --> 01:15:27,394
So before we jump into the other, I just would pose this back to your question and kind of expand the question just slightly,

729
01:15:27,754 --> 01:15:35,014
which is so your in your first question, you know, do you think that their specific mission impacts their role?

730
01:15:36,854 --> 01:15:40,094
Do we think that it would be appropriate to change their mission here?

731
01:15:40,664 --> 01:15:48,224
Or does this now call a bit of a reckoning on whether or not it's sustainable to keep a mission like this?

732
01:15:48,744 --> 01:15:56,374
You know, does it does a condition become or an infectious disease or have you seen it become more manageable?

733
01:15:56,374 --> 01:15:57,823
And we see this quite a bit with disease.

734
01:15:57,824 --> 01:16:08,504
And specifically, the more things become more manageable and more sort of funded the mission then start to not really match with what's going on.

735
01:16:11,704 --> 01:16:15,574
No. Go ahead. Or do I go ahead.

736
01:16:16,214 --> 01:16:19,534
Just again, I would say leaving.

737
01:16:19,954 --> 01:16:27,994
It seems like monkeypox is something that is coming up and it's probably not going to be like as extending as long as the HIV epidemic was.

738
01:16:28,294 --> 01:16:40,323
So I think using your mission, maybe the mission is to eradicate HIV as an epidemic, but creating a new adding monkeypox to it,

739
01:16:40,324 --> 01:16:50,604
or like changing your unless you're going even more broad with like general any infectious disease, then like leaving it.

740
01:16:50,614 --> 01:16:57,243
And I think we saw with the COVID pandemic a lot of organizations where it wasn't in their mission to combat

741
01:16:57,244 --> 01:17:02,434
work are like infectious disease weren't jumping into a lot of things with COVID because it was necessary.

742
01:17:02,804 --> 01:17:05,854
So that's more of what's happening here with monkeypox then.

743
01:17:08,844 --> 01:17:12,474
Yeah. I was going to say, like, I wouldn't go so far. It's like change the mission.

744
01:17:13,254 --> 01:17:21,174
It gets so much broader. But like, reminds me of case one with like it's like just reacting to COVID and being that anchor in the

745
01:17:21,174 --> 01:17:26,844
publisher's office and like being called to move and address this issue in a timely manner.

746
01:17:27,354 --> 01:17:33,504
So I think they should still continue to do this work, but not so the change that you see.

747
01:17:34,624 --> 01:17:38,874
Corporations. So I'm on their board and it's not a challenge or anything, Kristie.

748
01:17:38,874 --> 01:17:42,324
And I saw, you know, I was just kind of going to echo what they said.

749
01:17:42,584 --> 01:17:46,913
Like, I think there are certain times where emergencies arise where like your audience

750
01:17:46,914 --> 01:17:51,834
will look to you as that voice of like help or reason or whatever the case may be.

751
01:17:52,044 --> 01:17:55,973
And I think this is just one of those situations like where they're in a place where

752
01:17:55,974 --> 01:18:01,864
they have the knowledge and expertize and the connections to do something about it,

753
01:18:01,864 --> 01:18:05,714
and they should for their audience and their community, I think they're supporting your membership.

754
01:18:06,204 --> 01:18:11,993
So I think that like 35, 20,000, you know, I appreciate I mean, if I'm on that board,

755
01:18:11,994 --> 01:18:19,674
I'm on again in the spirit of being pushing all of you, if I'm on their board and I'm saying, okay, where does this stop?

756
01:18:20,034 --> 01:18:23,724
You know what? What's the next thing that comes out? What's the means test?

757
01:18:24,084 --> 01:18:26,964
How do we decide if we're going to respond or not?

758
01:18:27,354 --> 01:18:32,394
You know, this time we responded, but we're in our governance and our mission is specifically about HIV.

759
01:18:32,694 --> 01:18:35,704
You know, how does it now become kind of a question of, you know, does it.

760
01:18:35,724 --> 01:18:40,084
Is it based on, you know, how much advocacy from the board is saying to the to the CEO?

761
01:18:40,104 --> 01:18:44,063
We got to respond to this. You know, is there a vote that needs to happen?

762
01:18:44,064 --> 01:18:46,074
Like, how do we decide, you know,

763
01:18:46,404 --> 01:18:52,634
long term strategic planning what we're going to do to actually have a feasible response every time something happens like this?

764
01:18:52,654 --> 01:19:01,584
How do you go ahead? And then I saw Alex. I think it also depends on which or any of those of so many diseases be.

765
01:19:01,764 --> 01:19:12,924
We're asked to respond like what additional resources would need or would be to build new capacity in which we did not have any previous experience.

766
01:19:13,614 --> 01:19:19,194
If, if it is like a global thing, I mean, that we would need to want but we, we,

767
01:19:19,224 --> 01:19:29,094
if we've had experience in not dealing with or approaching in similar kind of this began me before like reallocate resources

768
01:19:29,094 --> 01:19:35,204
only for the time being because we don't have to build additional skillset or additional capacity in those things.

769
01:19:36,534 --> 01:19:41,344
So if I frame it for you differently, this is great.

770
01:19:41,424 --> 01:19:51,204
But if I find it for you all differently, if the disease in question is diabetes or heart disease or cancer.

771
01:19:52,204 --> 01:19:55,664
Why not respond just like this?

772
01:19:55,684 --> 01:19:58,724
What constitutes an emergency? Okay.

773
01:19:59,474 --> 01:20:08,334
And then Ali. I saw Ali. I saw you Ali. Go first. I was just going to say I was actually going to make the same point.

774
01:20:08,354 --> 01:20:16,874
I think it would become problematic if we were talking about a disease that were completely unrelated to the population at the heart of the mission.

775
01:20:17,264 --> 01:20:24,073
But this isn't a population that's eccentric to the heart of the mission that I'm

776
01:20:24,074 --> 01:20:29,954
sort of framing it in my mind in reverse of how many people here are describing it,

777
01:20:30,524 --> 01:20:37,274
which is to say monkeypox assistance is not to this side of the mission.

778
01:20:37,694 --> 01:20:44,653
It is. It is that outreach is targeting the population I want to reach anyways and I

779
01:20:44,654 --> 01:20:51,794
can bring all of my services to them under the guise of helping with monkeypox.

780
01:20:52,324 --> 01:21:02,114
It will raise my profile. It will bring those people coming who I want to come, come and access my services.

781
01:21:02,444 --> 01:21:05,804
So to me, it feels not at all like mission creep.

782
01:21:06,814 --> 01:21:12,004
If you change the disease to diabetes, then I think we have a problem.

783
01:21:12,274 --> 01:21:19,204
But as long as the population is the same or has a large overlapping Venn diagram,

784
01:21:19,564 --> 01:21:24,934
then this feels like it's it's still consistent with our values and the goals.

785
01:21:28,964 --> 01:21:35,413
Yeah, I was going to say something really similar, but I think you see a lot of times HIV organizations,

786
01:21:35,414 --> 01:21:45,884
organizations that work specifically also do stuff with tuberculosis, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, because the two kind of play hand-in-hand.

787
01:21:46,184 --> 01:21:50,024
From the statistics you provided that there is that overlap, as you were saying.

788
01:21:50,024 --> 01:21:58,784
So if monkeypox, I don't know how much of a risk factor like how much of an issue having monkeypox, if you have HIV is.

789
01:21:59,144 --> 01:22:08,344
But I think if you. But if you are doing something that is directly not only impacting the people that you're already trying to serve,

790
01:22:08,344 --> 01:22:14,674
but also that is could be an extra risk factor for someone living with HIV.

791
01:22:14,974 --> 01:22:19,534
Then you could make an argument as to like CEO or executive director to your board

792
01:22:19,574 --> 01:22:27,374
that this is something that is very close to the heart of ending major epidemics.

793
01:22:28,684 --> 01:22:32,434
We're out of time, but I think it speaks to your second question, very much so,

794
01:22:32,464 --> 01:22:38,403
which is facing an uphill battle with certain legislatures and keeping in mind what those legislatures are

795
01:22:38,404 --> 01:22:44,764
asking and whether or not they have certain priorities that they feel their funding and to that extent,

796
01:22:44,764 --> 01:22:47,944
funders as well, you know, making that case.

797
01:22:48,034 --> 01:22:51,214
So you're not just making the case to your board and to your CEO,

798
01:22:51,604 --> 01:22:58,534
making the case to the funders that are funding you and what types of latitude those funders will give you.

799
01:22:58,864 --> 01:23:06,394
Again, not right and wrong and just these are challenging questions that you have to kind of start to ask in terms of decisions to step forward.

800
01:23:06,814 --> 01:23:13,954
Many organizations have sort of lamented in the last six or eight months, you know, we never had a SARS-CoV-2 line item in our budget,

801
01:23:14,524 --> 01:23:20,034
but all of a sudden every organization has some kind of SARS-CoV-2 part of their operation.

802
01:23:20,244 --> 01:23:23,344
What happens when not to say shall happen?

803
01:23:23,384 --> 01:23:27,664
SaaS Covi three comes to me or some other version. You know, something comes out.

804
01:23:28,594 --> 01:23:34,874
Where does the organization start to have? So perhaps it's in governance, perhaps it's in other attributes.

805
01:23:34,874 --> 01:23:38,943
But I appreciate everyone's thoughtful discussion on this point because I think what you brought

806
01:23:38,944 --> 01:23:43,384
to our attention is a very important question of submission in both presentations today,

807
01:23:43,384 --> 01:23:51,114
really to this point of mission and of what what is the organization tasked to do and how to respond the next time?

808
01:23:51,994 --> 01:24:00,094
I have an excellent presentation that's now for outstanding presentations before an event.

809
01:24:00,394 --> 01:24:04,473
We're like, we're getting real good at it. Okay, we're going to take a ten minute break.

810
01:24:04,474 --> 01:24:09,934
We'll be back here at 550 well, nine and a half minutes and we'll be on our case.

811
01:24:10,034 --> 01:24:14,343
Beastie Boys students Yeah, that's a great idea.

812
01:24:26,533 --> 01:24:31,842
Let's get back to class. So I was like pacing on breaks today.

813
01:24:31,843 --> 01:24:34,993
Do a little better. Better breaking it up.

814
01:24:35,023 --> 01:24:38,053
Yeah. Okay. That's about the pace will take every session.

815
01:24:38,053 --> 01:24:41,833
A five and a ten minute break. Okay.

816
01:24:41,843 --> 01:24:53,242
I'm an inventor. Case presentation group. Just next time, when you're ready and you can present from wherever you'd like to sit and seated.

817
01:24:53,243 --> 01:24:58,043
Standing how everyone speaks. Yeah, absolutely.

818
01:25:01,383 --> 01:25:06,413
Consensus. I'll.

819
01:25:07,313 --> 01:25:13,793
Hi, everyone. Our presentation tonight is on the case Maple Tree Cancer Alliance.

820
01:25:15,823 --> 01:25:21,743
So you can turn to the next slide, please. We are called International Wildlife Refuge.

821
01:25:21,833 --> 01:25:28,193
So a little bit about us located in the Detroit River and western shoreline of Lake Erie.

822
01:25:29,153 --> 01:25:36,293
This is the only or North America's only International Wildlife Refuge.

823
01:25:36,683 --> 01:25:44,933
It spans over 6200 acres of habitat, which is kind of broken into different parts and not one big continuous land.

824
01:25:45,563 --> 01:25:57,622
And this refuge is actually was a result of the collaboration between Canada and Detroit and the different conservation leaders,

825
01:25:57,623 --> 01:26:08,293
politicians and things like that, to protect the different species that are located within the Detroit River and other towns.

826
01:26:08,933 --> 01:26:12,933
Yes. So protect habitats and ecosystems that fish plants and other animals.

827
01:26:12,953 --> 01:26:18,413
You can see three of the species that they protect.

828
01:26:19,133 --> 01:26:29,083
Some of the things they do are water management. So this is by building different structures for water, controlling the water prescribed fire.

829
01:26:29,123 --> 01:26:36,503
So they try to mimic natural fires in the environment by setting fires to protect certain plant life,

830
01:26:37,193 --> 01:26:42,413
invasive species management, conservation plans and also biological research.

831
01:26:44,963 --> 01:26:49,723
So hopefully everyone's read the case and everyone read the case.

832
01:26:49,733 --> 01:26:55,903
Right. Okay. Just a little brief overview for Maple Tree Cancer Alliance.

833
01:26:55,913 --> 01:27:02,513
Their mission is to improve the quality of life for those walking through cancer treatment, through programs and emotional support.

834
01:27:02,843 --> 01:27:15,473
So the alliance in Maple Tree Alliance with the Alliance of Exercise, Nutrition and Emotional Support Programs and this is Dr. Karin Wanders.

835
01:27:15,473 --> 01:27:18,593
She is the founder of Maple Tree Cancer Alliance.

836
01:27:19,013 --> 01:27:32,303
Her situation is that she wants to expand this individualized cancer treatment to outside of the Midwest and wants to make MTA a sustainable business.

837
01:27:32,303 --> 01:27:39,563
So her in our situation, she has to make a decision and decide on a sustainable growth model.

838
01:27:41,053 --> 01:27:49,433
And some of the questions that we raise are how will they fund a national expansion?

839
01:27:50,683 --> 01:27:55,483
Because one of the questions that she was posing was how will we expand outside of the Midwest?

840
01:27:55,523 --> 01:28:03,613
So we read that drawing to get funding for just the Midwest portion.

841
01:28:03,623 --> 01:28:09,853
She was selling bowls. She had to hire an event planner to organize a fundraiser event.

842
01:28:10,273 --> 01:28:14,023
So how will this be feasible if we're doing a bigger expansion?

843
01:28:14,893 --> 01:28:18,433
Do they need additional partnership models to sustain a national expansion?

844
01:28:18,463 --> 01:28:23,473
There were two models that were discussed in this case.

845
01:28:23,713 --> 01:28:27,133
I'd like to see a turnkey solution and a licensure solution.

846
01:28:27,133 --> 01:28:34,003
So if you're a member, the turnkey solution was that they were trying to do a satellite operation at a cancer center,

847
01:28:34,393 --> 01:28:40,633
whereas the licensure solution was that they were just going to train the personnel for the cancer center.

848
01:28:42,553 --> 01:28:43,543
So should it.

849
01:28:43,573 --> 01:28:50,383
So then another question that I posed Why should they develop a national training program if they're going to be expanding beyond the Midwest?

850
01:28:50,833 --> 01:28:56,803
Would it make sense to do a national training program for their professional staff to get them licensure?

851
01:28:57,553 --> 01:29:05,363
And then what about a potential partnership with Livestrong, which was mentioned that focuses more on emotional support group?

852
01:29:05,523 --> 01:29:11,773
So another thing to consider is, instead of having expanding by itself,

853
01:29:11,773 --> 01:29:19,963
what if they were to partner and collaborate with the different organizations that are there like Livestrong and NCAA?

854
01:29:21,173 --> 01:29:24,703
I have and I do. All right.

855
01:29:24,703 --> 01:29:33,863
So you hypothesis or a recommendation for to use is this growth model that we kind of came up with that combines a few different things.

856
01:29:33,883 --> 01:29:42,043
The first is to continue partnering with hospitals, utilizing the turnkey and licensor methods so that they keep treatment in a clinical setting.

857
01:29:42,053 --> 01:29:47,113
Since many of these oncology patients will be at the hospitals receiving other types of treatment as well.

858
01:29:48,463 --> 01:29:57,192
The second part is to partner with an established national organization such as Livestrong and the YMCA for sustainability and ease of expansion,

859
01:29:57,193 --> 01:29:58,843
since they do have a national presence.

860
01:29:59,473 --> 01:30:09,253
This may allow you to kind of ease of expansion through the rest of the nation and then as far as the health equity aspect.

861
01:30:09,283 --> 01:30:17,083
So one of the key things that Dr. Wonder's wanted to see implemented in MTC is basically to offer this exercise treatment for free.

862
01:30:18,103 --> 01:30:20,503
And so as part of this recommendation,

863
01:30:22,183 --> 01:30:29,893
one of the suggestion we have is continuing to offer this exercise treatment so that the health equity component of the program sustains as well.

864
01:30:31,333 --> 01:30:36,643
All right. So here are some of the things we have. According to this revenue figure that was provided with the case,

865
01:30:37,033 --> 01:30:44,383
we see that the purple bars are kind of showing how much revenue increased when they started to establish partnerships with hospitals.

866
01:30:46,753 --> 01:30:53,713
Now, one of the barriers that Dr. Wonder Wonder's described when she was discussing this partnership was hospitals,

867
01:30:53,713 --> 01:30:57,133
was that some of the hospitals didn't have the space,

868
01:30:57,823 --> 01:31:04,383
the personnel or a lot of the administrative factors that are needed in order for this expansion to occur.

869
01:31:05,773 --> 01:31:09,643
And so we thought that this partnership, maybe with a stronger YMCA,

870
01:31:09,673 --> 01:31:19,783
could help with assisting with the funding aspects and with basically ease of finding a space for this to happen.

871
01:31:20,353 --> 01:31:22,403
Now, what we need to know is if Livestrong, the wife,

872
01:31:22,603 --> 01:31:31,243
is willing to provide those funds or help with assisting those funds to finance and as well as allowing for the program to continue for free.

873
01:31:31,993 --> 01:31:40,123
Now, the action is kind of to implement a two phase approach where the way that the partnership I envisioned it would work would be,

874
01:31:40,993 --> 01:31:45,313
you know, these people are going through cancer treatment. That includes the exercise aspect.

875
01:31:45,733 --> 01:31:49,932
And then after maybe they complete this treatment, as we know, the strong,

876
01:31:49,933 --> 01:31:54,162
it kind of promotes emotional support but also confused from what like fitness in the after part as well,

877
01:31:54,163 --> 01:31:56,803
so that it can be kind of like a feeder program as well.

878
01:31:56,803 --> 01:32:04,483
So for people who do make it to recovery but also, you know, just to participate and to live strong so it kind of functions with the same system.

879
01:32:07,753 --> 01:32:09,653
And so some of the alternatives we discussed,

880
01:32:09,713 --> 01:32:16,033
obviously the first one is to continue operating with only the turnkey and licensor hospital partnership methods.

881
01:32:16,063 --> 01:32:21,673
What's wrong about this is that MTC remains independent and without outside influence to continue to make their own decisions.

882
01:32:22,813 --> 01:32:26,953
Some weaknesses include maybe slower progress and expansion.

883
01:32:27,223 --> 01:32:30,963
And again, with the initial barriers that they have,

884
01:32:30,973 --> 01:32:35,143
as some of these hospitals may have financial barriers or the inability to

885
01:32:35,143 --> 01:32:40,453
provide the resources necessary in order to expand or implement such programing.

886
01:32:41,833 --> 01:32:49,103
Now, another alternative is kind of exit or I'm sorry,

887
01:32:49,103 --> 01:32:55,223
not doing the hospital partnership model anymore and just implementing programing only through YMCA in partnership with the strong.

888
01:32:55,713 --> 01:33:00,643
The strength of this, our national presence of MTC and secured space that can comes out of these programs

889
01:33:00,653 --> 01:33:06,653
at YMCA is across the nation all weaknesses as it may shift from a treatment model,

890
01:33:06,653 --> 01:33:13,282
which is the original intention of this program. And then discussion.

891
01:33:13,283 --> 01:33:16,083
And we're going to do kind of like our role play together.

892
01:33:17,043 --> 01:33:24,243
As we know, sometimes the boards, even if leadership does decide something, the boards may not be okay with that.

893
01:33:25,023 --> 01:33:34,413
And so the way we're going to do this is to board are going to act as the leadership and you guys are going to be our board.

894
01:33:34,563 --> 01:33:38,043
So basically, we're going to try to convince you that we have the right method.

895
01:33:38,403 --> 01:33:46,293
We have some questions. That well kind of guide this shrewd kind of set the scene as well.

896
01:33:46,303 --> 01:33:50,822
We can start with the first one. So right now we're trying to convince you, hey, let's do this.

897
01:33:50,823 --> 01:33:55,413
I'm partner, but you guys are telling us, no, we want to remain independent.

898
01:33:56,613 --> 01:34:00,493
Where's the money going to come from? For.

899
01:34:00,683 --> 01:34:04,273
For doing that for you? Yeah. You want to do it? Where's the money come?

900
01:34:04,543 --> 01:34:11,173
So, kind of like Ellie mentioned earlier when she was discussing something like the first case.

901
01:34:11,653 --> 01:34:18,373
You don't have to say anything. I'm just referring to your earlier statement. That would be a trustee, Ali.

902
01:34:18,383 --> 01:34:19,003
Trustee. Trustee.

903
01:34:19,273 --> 01:34:30,492
There would be a clause that we would possibly implement in the original or maybe a manner of understanding between us and YMCA or Livestrong,

904
01:34:30,493 --> 01:34:35,443
where we would appreciate funds in order to allow for this for us to continue.

905
01:34:36,333 --> 01:34:42,153
So how are you going to justify then, if your finger correctly, you're showing us that.

906
01:34:43,483 --> 01:34:48,253
Money. Revenue went up dramatically when we started partnering with hospitals.

907
01:34:48,373 --> 01:34:52,143
So how are we going to keep that moving? Because right now we are looking at this.

908
01:34:52,153 --> 01:34:55,333
We doubled revenue in 16 and again in 17.

909
01:34:56,543 --> 01:35:00,833
Right. So the way that that happened was through the partnerships with the hospitals.

910
01:35:01,343 --> 01:35:07,403
And for us to be if we expand nationally and be able to kind of get coverage through the nation,

911
01:35:07,403 --> 01:35:14,752
we'll be able to implement this programing in the other hospitals using some fiscal resources through it from our partnership.

912
01:35:14,753 --> 01:35:20,393
Right. And so through those, hopefully our revenue will continue to expand because of the expansion into the hospitals as well.

913
01:35:22,593 --> 01:35:25,883
Hi. Uh, my okay.

914
01:35:25,883 --> 01:35:29,333
So this case, I read it and there was three main issues and you hit.

915
01:35:31,153 --> 01:35:40,432
Then kind of. But my main question is a lot of what is discussed throughout is that wonder is confronting

916
01:35:40,433 --> 01:35:45,493
the lack of understanding of why exercise ecology is important and why it's necessary.

917
01:35:45,763 --> 01:35:50,893
Which if that is, if people understand that, then we can get many more insurances on board,

918
01:35:51,493 --> 01:35:53,763
you know, work with the system that we already have in place.

919
01:35:53,773 --> 01:35:58,633
And so if we're going to assume that, as we see from the graph, that our hospital partnerships,

920
01:35:58,933 --> 01:36:01,783
that's really where a lot of our money is coming from at the moment.

921
01:36:02,623 --> 01:36:07,453
This, again, I think Dr. Rubin kind of hit upon a little bit with this question as well.

922
01:36:08,323 --> 01:36:13,873
But your solution does not address the fact that we're not educating the public on why this is important for cancer patients.

923
01:36:13,873 --> 01:36:18,703
We're not educating the insurance companies on why this is important for patients or not.

924
01:36:19,183 --> 01:36:24,433
So we have a lot of other avenues that would mean that we could remain an independent

925
01:36:24,433 --> 01:36:29,353
entity if simply educating our people and our cause was known as exercise,

926
01:36:29,353 --> 01:36:35,322
oncology was born. So how does your solution address that key point of this,

927
01:36:35,323 --> 01:36:42,073
that a lot of people just don't understand why exercise pathology is different from anything else, any other treatment we could provide?

928
01:36:42,823 --> 01:36:49,603
Thank you very much. So right now, education through our operation in the Midwest is a component of what we're doing.

929
01:36:50,053 --> 01:36:54,523
One of the issues, like I mentioned earlier, we're facing is that it's difficult for us to continue expanding nationally.

930
01:36:54,793 --> 01:37:04,393
So with a partnership through an institution or organization such as Livestrong and YMCA, which is known nationally,

931
01:37:04,393 --> 01:37:12,193
we can continue to integrate that educational component to help with promotion, with the educational component through their services as well.

932
01:37:12,553 --> 01:37:18,703
And through that, we'd be able to kind of spread that idea that education is what's important to the college

933
01:37:19,033 --> 01:37:24,583
and spread that education to show that exercise and ecology treatment is important.

934
01:37:25,213 --> 01:37:30,313
Essentially spreading the word, building more of rapport across the nation,

935
01:37:30,643 --> 01:37:38,472
gaining more support that could eventually potentially concern the insurance companies outside the nation or was lost.

936
01:37:38,473 --> 01:37:44,743
Because I believe funders mission statement is the Midwest because she saw disparities specifically within this area.

937
01:37:45,073 --> 01:37:47,713
So that's where the decision aspect comes.

938
01:37:47,713 --> 01:37:55,393
And she's thinking, are we going to switch this over from just the Midwest operation to a national operation just to support that small,

939
01:37:55,393 --> 01:37:59,173
I would say like YMCA at least I don't know anything really strong.

940
01:37:59,543 --> 01:38:03,522
Like they offer like Parkinson's classes or like more well known like that.

941
01:38:03,523 --> 01:38:08,443
Taichi is beneficial for Parkinson's because they're offered at that kind of like national level.

942
01:38:08,443 --> 01:38:15,343
And all the gyms you go to, you see on the program list. So I think that would be a useful way of getting the word out.

943
01:38:15,733 --> 01:38:24,243
Thank you so much. Trust the FBI on the health insurance aspect.

944
01:38:24,733 --> 01:38:31,603
Once we try to partner more with hospitals across the nation and make it more of a standard of care,

945
01:38:32,083 --> 01:38:35,863
then the insurance companies would be more likely to cover it.

946
01:38:36,343 --> 01:38:39,553
And we can expand that way. It kind of works.

947
01:38:47,843 --> 01:38:55,243
Okay. Members of the trustees. Our Wonder staff have proposed the great solution for us.

948
01:38:56,003 --> 01:38:59,123
Well, seem to be objecting in some regard.

949
01:39:00,053 --> 01:39:08,833
You got something for us? You hired them to do a job.

950
01:39:10,243 --> 01:39:21,763
What you think you should do? What should they do instead? I'm recusing myself.

951
01:39:22,603 --> 01:39:27,123
So would it be possible to. Are you proposing that we leave the hospital space?

952
01:39:27,133 --> 01:39:29,443
Are you. Is it possible to maintain both spaces?

953
01:39:29,833 --> 01:39:36,853
So the memo of understanding that we will memorandum of understanding that we will propose will be for us to remain in both spaces,

954
01:39:37,183 --> 01:39:40,273
as we see in the hospitals is where most of our revenue comes from.

955
01:39:40,753 --> 01:39:47,083
And on the Livestrong YMC view, the partnership will help us again with exposure increasing rep for getting us,

956
01:39:49,063 --> 01:39:52,693
you know, clients, getting us clients getting us exposed nationally.

957
01:39:56,663 --> 01:40:05,273
As for your solution, because I feel like that hospital revenue increase is not sustainable,

958
01:40:05,423 --> 01:40:13,343
I think it won't take very long for hospitals to look around and begin to create their own programs.

959
01:40:14,963 --> 01:40:26,213
I don't know that we have a way of differentiating ourselves from what can be invented locally in any hospital setting,

960
01:40:26,783 --> 01:40:38,303
and the partnership with Livestrong and YMCA will allow us to have more sustainability when that hospital revenue begins to decrease.

961
01:40:38,543 --> 01:40:46,073
Once, I think once they sort of know and understand our mission, that it will be easily adaptable without our assistance.

962
01:40:46,343 --> 01:40:53,033
Absolutely. Because a lot of doctor wonder is worried about is that this is a very novel treatment and it's the first of its kind,

963
01:40:53,033 --> 01:40:59,963
which is really helping with its expansion. And so partnerships such as this one will allow us to sustain, which is kind of what you just said.

964
01:41:01,523 --> 01:41:11,663
So if the idea that you're proposing is that they would bluntly rip it up and basically just do their own version of that actively.

965
01:41:11,933 --> 01:41:18,073
Yeah, they're happy with that. Yeah. Okay. So if that's the case, what can we do?

966
01:41:18,083 --> 01:41:22,433
Attempts to stop that from happening. What's our strategy?

967
01:41:22,763 --> 01:41:27,093
What do you think? And patenting car.

968
01:41:29,633 --> 01:41:32,993
Okay, play with that last thing.

969
01:41:34,553 --> 01:41:38,933
I thought one of our board members is a patent attorney. I guess we should recruit a new board.

970
01:41:40,703 --> 01:41:44,943
So if we can, let's assume for what we can't patent. What can we do, though?

971
01:41:45,113 --> 01:41:49,643
What are our thoughts and what can we do to keep it from getting ripped off?

972
01:41:51,243 --> 01:41:58,643
We built a brand around it. What you. I mean, it's like, I don't know, the concept agreement that we have with Livestrong, the way I see it.

973
01:41:58,893 --> 01:42:01,763
Like, we can't just assume that they won't work this out.

974
01:42:01,803 --> 01:42:06,522
We have to put in writing right now and say what the hospital systems as well will ensure that

975
01:42:06,523 --> 01:42:10,473
it is in writing that we will be the sole providers of the treatment in their institution.

976
01:42:11,163 --> 01:42:17,173
200. Well, but we're already not right then.

977
01:42:17,563 --> 01:42:22,003
Are we providing training to them and their people so that they can provide the services?

978
01:42:23,803 --> 01:42:28,183
For the licensure agreements.

979
01:42:28,273 --> 01:42:40,793
That's right. Look, look, I thought and a bet here for south Jersey tried to that line with a janitor.

980
01:42:41,443 --> 01:42:47,682
Know. No. Try this one. No, it wasn't about no other than I still get.

981
01:42:47,683 --> 01:42:50,803
I'm getting there unnamed everybody. I'm making progress.

982
01:42:51,553 --> 01:42:54,852
No, I was going to say that. I don't think that. I only don't know his name.

983
01:42:54,853 --> 01:42:59,682
So is his. No. Is when my advice? That's what I was going to say.

984
01:42:59,683 --> 01:43:04,303
I don't think that the most immediate thing to worry about is people ripping off the.

985
01:43:05,743 --> 01:43:11,293
Services that are provided by MTA because a lot of these places are getting free

986
01:43:13,843 --> 01:43:18,853
trainings and they're also providing us some sometimes are providing a space.

987
01:43:18,853 --> 01:43:30,193
And I don't see the need if you're offering riders to rip you off when it's already being provided for you.

988
01:43:31,443 --> 01:43:35,523
Hospitals look at that hospital standing and want to replicate and replicate on their own.

989
01:43:36,483 --> 01:43:43,233
I mean, yeah, they could have rebuilt the wheel. I think that it's like it it seems like it would be like a bigger,

990
01:43:43,773 --> 01:43:48,963
like the job that MTA would have to do is like show them it's going to be more difficult,

991
01:43:49,143 --> 01:43:53,703
difficult for them to recreate reality than just to use our services.

992
01:43:54,483 --> 01:44:02,723
And I think that is like the most important thing in order to really just use know.

993
01:44:05,423 --> 01:44:18,243
You know, the brand, especially because it's so expensive to train the people that all the clothes that they have and they're licensed nationals.

994
01:44:19,473 --> 01:44:23,023
That's where the majority of their costs. Yeah.

995
01:44:23,043 --> 01:44:28,683
And I also don't see that hospitals are going to, like, build a program that insurance is not going to cover.

996
01:44:29,793 --> 01:44:40,653
Yes. That's how they make the most. I think a central concern that I would be worried about is with the partnership with the YMCA,

997
01:44:40,663 --> 01:44:47,653
how would we ensure that people don't associate this program with YMCA as opposed to us?

998
01:44:47,803 --> 01:44:53,203
Like, how do we make sure that people know that it's outside despite the fact that it's happening at the YMCA?

999
01:44:55,303 --> 01:45:08,893
So this is where the build the brand. I keep hearing whispers about and I guess my answer to that would be that we would continue to,

1000
01:45:08,923 --> 01:45:12,403
you know, the same way the YMCA offers like certain classes,

1001
01:45:12,403 --> 01:45:17,502
those classes would continue to have maybe our acronym or other like phrasing that is

1002
01:45:17,503 --> 01:45:24,013
unique to us to ensure that they know that this programing is unique to our program.

1003
01:45:25,713 --> 01:45:34,092
Question that is that MTV are we've tried to focus on individualized exercise rather than group based,

1004
01:45:34,093 --> 01:45:38,832
and I believe YMCA is really focused on that group. So that's true.

1005
01:45:38,833 --> 01:45:41,683
And that's why we're going to remain in hospital settings.

1006
01:45:41,683 --> 01:45:48,672
And if our program was to be implemented, it led to the idea is to continue to offer on an individual basis.

1007
01:45:48,673 --> 01:45:54,673
It'll be separate from their group classes, which are more geared towards a recovering population.

1008
01:45:55,333 --> 01:46:00,763
Question Are you using a YMCA as.

1009
01:46:02,073 --> 01:46:12,783
Fitness instructors for RB, bringing their own people into YMCA for those individual exercise classes.

1010
01:46:13,263 --> 01:46:20,703
So as part of the agreement, we will also provide training to fitness instructors, if for any reason for YMCA,

1011
01:46:20,703 --> 01:46:23,923
the kind of the same models that we have with the turnkey licensure,

1012
01:46:23,943 --> 01:46:28,583
how we have like either they provide staff and we train them or we provide training to staff.

1013
01:46:28,593 --> 01:46:33,843
It would it would function that model depending on funding of the specific facilities.

1014
01:46:34,633 --> 01:46:39,573
Thank you. So do you kind of see that as a deal breaker if, say,

1015
01:46:39,663 --> 01:46:45,563
YMCA is not willing to have the individualized classes versus their kind of more generic group settings,

1016
01:46:45,573 --> 01:46:52,323
is that something there's flexibility with or do you see this model as being got individual exercise classes in there?

1017
01:46:52,323 --> 01:47:01,023
So wiggle room there. So I so the only I think that maybe not necessarily a dealbreaker,

1018
01:47:01,023 --> 01:47:07,053
but we would maybe market it maybe as something else or as a kind of like an

1019
01:47:07,053 --> 01:47:10,832
option based thing where if you would like to receive group based treatment,

1020
01:47:10,833 --> 01:47:14,053
then it would be over here or at the YMCA.

1021
01:47:14,073 --> 01:47:21,493
However. Actually maybe.

1022
01:47:21,493 --> 01:47:29,563
Okay, let's say this since our mission is since, you know, treatment, oncology treatment typically does an individualized thing,

1023
01:47:29,563 --> 01:47:33,972
we would retain the individualized concept to make sure we're still abiding with our

1024
01:47:33,973 --> 01:47:39,552
mission of patients feel comfortable in that role in the alliance that we have,

1025
01:47:39,553 --> 01:47:49,602
which is the exercise, nutrition and emotional support. And then we can also partner when we're doing these hospital partnerships and we can actually

1026
01:47:49,603 --> 01:47:54,493
have consultations with these individual patients while they're still in the hospital.

1027
01:47:55,213 --> 01:48:02,463
Another one of the things we can do is maybe send them a referral and then three that they can then

1028
01:48:02,473 --> 01:48:09,653
individualized plan and then they can take the classes at the Y at or more where they're in a group,

1029
01:48:09,653 --> 01:48:20,002
but they're still doing that individualized care. I feel like with the kind of structure that people know of the YMCA,

1030
01:48:20,003 --> 01:48:25,313
you could maybe propose a hybrid where you do like individual consultations and do

1031
01:48:25,313 --> 01:48:29,992
that maybe once a week and then facilitate more of a group environment where people,

1032
01:48:29,993 --> 01:48:30,233
you know,

1033
01:48:30,233 --> 01:48:36,803
like they talked about doing that and then having people do homework and exercises on their own and maybe have like an open facilitated kind of

1034
01:48:37,433 --> 01:48:44,773
group setting which would benefit from both the exercise portion of things as well as kind of the community and the mental and physical support.

1035
01:48:46,133 --> 01:48:51,903
Absolutely. I think that's a great idea. I think that's maybe what I was trying to get to because of my before I abruptly something so.

1036
01:48:53,153 --> 01:49:02,143
Thank you. I bet this kind of gets to another important question about like if we enter into these partnerships, like,

1037
01:49:02,273 --> 01:49:06,313
like how much input are we going to give these other organizations in like our

1038
01:49:06,313 --> 01:49:11,143
services and our like ideas about our future directions and like what are,

1039
01:49:11,203 --> 01:49:16,993
what are we going to do, if you like, have conflict at a certain point, have this agreement about how we want.

1040
01:49:20,663 --> 01:49:28,373
So I can disagree about like, like, like about like the services we're performing or like how we want to grow in the future.

1041
01:49:28,653 --> 01:49:33,143
Um, yeah, like, like, like how, how much power are we going to give them over our decisions?

1042
01:49:38,883 --> 01:49:48,903
I guess it depends on how involved, how much, I guess, of that partnership is going to be, like how much we're utilizing our services.

1043
01:49:50,493 --> 01:49:56,013
I'm not giving up. That's something else for us to consider.

1044
01:49:56,013 --> 01:50:07,653
Probably something we outlined in our ago in our Emily and our new IOU and in our standards of procedure,

1045
01:50:07,953 --> 01:50:19,983
potentially creating like a joint board or advisory council between the two organizations so that we can resolve any conflict through that.

1046
01:50:20,373 --> 01:50:25,723
And it would be like equal representation from both sides.

1047
01:50:26,013 --> 01:50:30,593
You want to call time on 1/2. I want to point out a couple of things about our discussion.

1048
01:50:30,603 --> 01:50:33,953
Just Texas, our first one. Couple of things have happened. Great.

1049
01:50:34,443 --> 01:50:37,653
One, I appreciate that. Very stimulating. This is good.

1050
01:50:37,803 --> 01:50:41,432
So we want to keep sort of simulating. I appreciate that.

1051
01:50:41,433 --> 01:50:46,083
We're posing very challenging questions to kind of keep everybody thinking.

1052
01:50:46,743 --> 01:50:55,413
I injected a term on purpose in there that has been used sometimes in colloquial terms,

1053
01:50:56,163 --> 01:51:01,413
but perhaps is not always a term that carries the same meaning or the connotation.

1054
01:51:01,743 --> 01:51:05,513
I did it to simulate for you what the impact is.

1055
01:51:05,513 --> 01:51:13,503
And when we have board members introducing terminology that may not necessarily reflect the inclusivity of what we're talking about.

1056
01:51:14,013 --> 01:51:16,363
I want to kind of use this again as an example.

1057
01:51:16,473 --> 01:51:23,492
I did it intentionally to sort of remind you that there will be times where board members or others will say things that you might go,

1058
01:51:23,493 --> 01:51:24,693
Oh, why did they say that?

1059
01:51:25,713 --> 01:51:32,762
And this is an important component of of thinking through the dynamics of the board and the staff to remember that not all board members

1060
01:51:32,763 --> 01:51:43,683
will be coming to the table with the same kinds of values or clear sort of ways of communicating that you might be accustomed to.

1061
01:51:43,983 --> 01:51:48,033
And it's important to keep that in mind, because they may carry power in the board,

1062
01:51:48,963 --> 01:51:55,203
but they may not necessarily be espousing what you are, what you necessarily as a leader think is an important style.

1063
01:51:55,233 --> 01:51:57,992
So I wanted to say I'm encouraging everyone to kind of keep that in mind,

1064
01:51:57,993 --> 01:52:02,673
that as we simulate that, we also think about how these dynamics play out in a board room.

1065
01:52:03,393 --> 01:52:07,922
And also keep in mind as well that, you know, we also have the opportunity to think about,

1066
01:52:07,923 --> 01:52:11,973
you know, how do we want to sort of carry ourselves as communicators in that discussion.

1067
01:52:12,423 --> 01:52:17,733
So I just want to sort of call to your attention to different dynamics that are emerging here, which is great.

1068
01:52:18,753 --> 01:52:24,693
And sort of you can see kind of the role of the simulation as a way for us to see how this might play out,

1069
01:52:24,903 --> 01:52:31,203
because these are the types of things challenging questions posed, language choices pose, etc., that we might that we might find.

1070
01:52:31,503 --> 01:52:37,743
Okay, continuum. I have a question.

1071
01:52:37,803 --> 01:52:49,613
Just not as a board of guys may be potentially considered providing online exercise classes like Zoom or

1072
01:52:49,743 --> 01:52:58,243
like maybe because I'm not sure how much equipment is needed for the individuals to do certain exercises.

1073
01:52:58,243 --> 01:53:06,243
So if we're talking about like yoga mats, like yoga bong or like some bands like we can potentially deliver that to them and then do the classes

1074
01:53:06,243 --> 01:53:13,443
online to maybe like help with not necessarily needing to find an exclusive facility for work,

1075
01:53:13,833 --> 01:53:15,843
but just like having like setting them,

1076
01:53:16,623 --> 01:53:26,883
helping them set up like an individual exercise program and then like doing like those individual classes with an instructor like via like online,

1077
01:53:27,483 --> 01:53:32,882
maybe that can be like a, an avenue. Oh, definitely.

1078
01:53:32,883 --> 01:53:34,442
I think that's a really good idea, actually.

1079
01:53:34,443 --> 01:53:40,772
Then it also helps with the individualized aspect of it for maybe people who have similar exercise treatments,

1080
01:53:40,773 --> 01:53:44,823
they can watch this like maybe like a webinar style video.

1081
01:53:45,873 --> 01:53:50,643
And maybe this could be for patients who are a little more accustomed to the exercises and know what they're

1082
01:53:50,643 --> 01:53:59,073
doing a little bit more than maybe new patients so that their form can be adjusted and they can be more,

1083
01:53:59,403 --> 01:54:07,433
you know, guided through the exercises. I think it's a very equitable solution for those patients who are who may not have, like,

1084
01:54:07,503 --> 01:54:18,333
transportation to get to these locations or who may not yet who may not have the time or the transportation or needs to get to these places.

1085
01:54:18,753 --> 01:54:25,053
But at the same time, it would I mean, we can't just go one way or another.

1086
01:54:25,053 --> 01:54:30,843
I think having both options would be a good idea. So that's a great idea.

1087
01:54:36,503 --> 01:54:45,832
It raises the potential for inequities as well. So it's reassuring to me to hear that you think you would want to offer both options.

1088
01:54:45,833 --> 01:54:54,593
And certainly it limits that service to people with access to technology and because cancer and HIV positive correlation.

1089
01:54:55,193 --> 01:55:04,883
You're also asking 70 and 80 and 90 year old people to just jump on Zoom for their exercise class, which will limit their participation as well.

1090
01:55:09,353 --> 01:55:12,333
For something to come out. You are a contractor.

1091
01:55:13,043 --> 01:55:18,293
Have you discussed any trial runs or anything to see if this is something that patients really interested in?

1092
01:55:18,953 --> 01:55:22,063
Am I going to be proud of?

1093
01:55:22,583 --> 01:55:33,443
Stay in the hospital with some much? So the way that this would likely occur is that there would be kind of a pilot,

1094
01:55:33,443 --> 01:55:37,493
as you mentioned, like a trial run in another area other than the Midwest.

1095
01:55:38,603 --> 01:55:42,533
And from there, maybe we would do that in a few different cities across the nation,

1096
01:55:42,923 --> 01:55:48,833
whether that be, you know, five, ten, 20, depending on what you see fit.

1097
01:55:50,233 --> 01:56:00,233
And from there, depending on the success of those or the success or, you know, lack of success, we would move forward with the trial run.

1098
01:56:00,983 --> 01:56:06,313
Would it be easier and less expensive to do a trial run in the Midwest first?

1099
01:56:08,853 --> 01:56:14,873
So. We want you to look into our.

1100
01:56:16,413 --> 01:56:20,963
Funding projections in order to attract. Christine.

1101
01:56:22,373 --> 01:56:27,173
Oh, I was just thinking on what you said about the release, because I was also thinking that.

1102
01:56:27,713 --> 01:56:32,063
But. How many staff would there be in the actual place?

1103
01:56:33,503 --> 01:56:39,322
If you're sending all this stuff to do it alone at home and if they're older, what are that like?

1104
01:56:39,323 --> 01:56:42,713
The liability of the amount?

1105
01:56:44,323 --> 01:56:52,603
Actual place. Like. Like how many, like five would be able to, like, help and assist with, like the YMCA versus them doing it on their own?

1106
01:56:52,603 --> 01:57:01,173
Like what if they're home alone with a family to help them? What would happen if something happens during your class unlock.

1107
01:57:02,373 --> 01:57:16,233
So that's why we we mentioned that maybe the online option will be for more people who have maybe finished the first phase of,

1108
01:57:16,243 --> 01:57:22,463
you know, they go through four phases, the first three, the first 12 weeks of the program, then uncomfortable.

1109
01:57:22,923 --> 01:57:30,363
And then from there, we would have like liability forms set up and people who, of course, don't have access maybe to technology.

1110
01:57:30,633 --> 01:57:37,683
Obviously, we'll go with the option to make a note like not all cancer patients are.

1111
01:57:38,883 --> 01:57:45,483
I just feel like the online part could have been like another option for people not be in that age bracket.

1112
01:57:46,233 --> 01:57:51,062
Also, I guess to target that the older age bracket,

1113
01:57:51,063 --> 01:58:00,333
we can probably consider providing our services with like senior home facilities because usually they have like a little gym sport,

1114
01:58:00,393 --> 01:58:08,552
like some activities classes that they kind of host. Because like into like home care, like, like those kind of facilities,

1115
01:58:08,553 --> 01:58:18,303
like assisted living facilities may be another area where we can expand and like they maybe have a contract with them like we do with hospitals.

1116
01:58:18,783 --> 01:58:22,163
So actually asking you to consider.

1117
01:58:23,093 --> 01:58:32,083
Not just biopsy. Okay.

1118
01:58:32,883 --> 01:58:38,333
I've just been thinking about this. No, I may not be a trustee, though, because I just have a question.

1119
01:58:38,343 --> 01:58:43,593
I'm just thinking, like, from a patient perspective. Yeah.

1120
01:58:44,283 --> 01:58:46,713
Oh, for example, like St Joe's.

1121
01:58:47,043 --> 01:58:56,643
And I'm not sure since COVID if this is still around, but they offered services specifically for cancer patients at a salon massage.

1122
01:58:56,943 --> 01:59:02,643
Like you could go there to get your nails done, yoga classes and different services that they provided at the hospital.

1123
01:59:02,643 --> 01:59:12,183
Because when you're going through chemotherapy, they, the oncologists typically advise people not to be in,

1124
01:59:12,393 --> 01:59:21,212
you know, very populated spaces due to like your lowered immune system and other reasons.

1125
01:59:21,213 --> 01:59:27,303
But so I'm just curious if the option has been explored for Livestrong and YMCA to.

1126
01:59:28,303 --> 01:59:35,383
Like have sister locations in the hospital facilities and we can how what that partnership would look like.

1127
01:59:35,413 --> 01:59:43,063
I know the hospitals don't always have the capacity or the space to offer these services,

1128
01:59:43,063 --> 01:59:50,563
but I think that would be a way to address inequities, keep it individualized as well.

1129
01:59:51,403 --> 01:59:54,553
And I just wondered if that was something you talked about at all.

1130
01:59:55,633 --> 02:00:05,623
So you mean spaces that will not put the patients at risk because of care?

1131
02:00:06,763 --> 02:00:10,723
Yeah. Like a more private location for cancer patients to go.

1132
02:00:10,723 --> 02:00:20,143
That's actually at the hospital. They are probably spending a lot of time at the hospital already, so it's convenient.

1133
02:00:20,143 --> 02:00:26,143
And like I said there, some hospitals have other services for like personal care.

1134
02:00:26,533 --> 02:00:38,442
When you're going through cancer treatment. So I wondered if you know anything about like why aren't why isn't there more like a

1135
02:00:38,443 --> 02:00:44,143
little gym in a hospital for patients for these who are going through these programs?

1136
02:00:44,483 --> 02:00:51,133
Yeah. So with our hospital partnership program, which remember, we're not disclosing that will still be available to the patients.

1137
02:00:51,883 --> 02:00:55,233
And then you mentioned the issue of space. Some hospitals don't have the space to offer,

1138
02:00:55,663 --> 02:01:05,293
and that's where the YMCA could provide that kind of safety net in the case that a nearby hospital maybe might not have the space,

1139
02:01:05,653 --> 02:01:12,732
the service can be offered at the YMCA and not maybe not in partnership with the hospital,

1140
02:01:12,733 --> 02:01:21,882
because I don't know how much we can do in terms of partnering, you know, coming from a third party perspective, partnering a hospital and the Y.

1141
02:01:21,883 --> 02:01:32,193
But from there, we could just kind of. Work on, you know, doing maybe like doing stuff to kind of see where our locations are going to be,

1142
02:01:32,233 --> 02:01:36,203
make sure we have certain locations in a certain radius.

1143
02:01:36,213 --> 02:01:41,193
And I understand that there is the aspect of patients who are in hospitals and want to get that treatment over there.

1144
02:01:42,873 --> 02:01:50,583
If it is further away or we can't provide it in the hospital, that would be our option for us.

1145
02:01:53,383 --> 02:02:04,303
Yes. In terms of staffing and in terms of the licensure solution, how would it like how would it look?

1146
02:02:04,303 --> 02:02:13,962
So in hospitals, you have dietitians and P.T. and OTI and and therapists that know what they're doing.

1147
02:02:13,963 --> 02:02:18,363
And their training might not need to be as like.

1148
02:02:19,643 --> 02:02:22,673
I don't even know what's the word, but it doesn't need to be as rigorous.

1149
02:02:23,543 --> 02:02:28,822
How would you like train differently or would you have a different program in terms of YMCA?

1150
02:02:28,823 --> 02:02:35,093
Because their fitness instructors might not be as strong or have that medical background.

1151
02:02:35,663 --> 02:02:43,163
They might not have dietitians or therapists. So how if they were to take the licensure agreement with to certify everyone?

1152
02:02:43,823 --> 02:02:49,553
So I think one of the strengths of our certificate program is the standardized,

1153
02:02:50,573 --> 02:02:59,153
and it would likely have to remain that way just to ensure that no matter the person's level of training in whatever area it may be,

1154
02:02:59,393 --> 02:03:03,983
they're still getting that full training to be able to help the patients.

1155
02:03:06,843 --> 02:03:10,113
I mean, standardization and then in the future kind of similar to how.

1156
02:03:12,043 --> 02:03:17,053
For example, you take like an implicit bias training that's for a day, and you get that certificate.

1157
02:03:17,053 --> 02:03:20,413
And then every year you take like you like an hour long one.

1158
02:03:20,923 --> 02:03:25,513
I mean, a lot of providers are familiar with that. It would be kind of a similar model where like, you know what you're doing.

1159
02:03:25,513 --> 02:03:34,813
So we have kind of like a of a version of the program that is for people who are more familiar with the treatment.

1160
02:03:35,413 --> 02:03:39,463
But that is something that we will consider as those.

1161
02:03:41,783 --> 02:03:47,303
As we face one of the questions we post also it's like training.

1162
02:03:48,053 --> 02:03:56,093
What if we were to create like an online program or something like that that focuses on training individuals and

1163
02:03:56,123 --> 02:04:03,053
partnering with universities and different schools and recruiting students from there and then licensing them.

1164
02:04:04,253 --> 02:04:05,363
That's another option.

1165
02:04:06,683 --> 02:04:16,883
So as trustee, I'm curious, you know, in 2016, you had isolated in nine locations in southwest Ohio and one in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

1166
02:04:17,453 --> 02:04:21,203
Why are we focused on national expansion and not more states in the Midwest?

1167
02:04:22,013 --> 02:04:28,253
Are we ready for national expansion? Does this get us away from our missing with being focused on Midwest?

1168
02:04:29,453 --> 02:04:35,393
Right. So. Our mission, yes, is in the Midwest.

1169
02:04:35,393 --> 02:04:40,942
But I think our ultimate mission is to expand oncology treatment for all patients who need it.

1170
02:04:40,943 --> 02:04:44,813
And we know that cancer is prevalent all over the nation, not just in the Midwest,

1171
02:04:45,503 --> 02:04:48,893
which is part of the reason that we would like to expand nationally.

1172
02:04:48,923 --> 02:04:54,893
Now to you know, it makes sense for your question that we are focused on the Midwest and we didn't get too far into the Midwest.

1173
02:04:55,223 --> 02:04:58,203
So maybe with that national expansion, this kind of ties back what you were saying earlier,

1174
02:04:58,343 --> 02:05:06,082
what we would like to begin to spread out from the Midwest into states that are close to us and then from there

1175
02:05:06,083 --> 02:05:13,693
continue the expansion while maybe also piloting in a few other areas just to see how the model would work in,

1176
02:05:14,523 --> 02:05:24,233
you know, across the region. So really kind of addressing your third question discussion.

1177
02:05:24,953 --> 02:05:30,773
And to this point, as I suggest, you ask the same thing about what is the profitability of these big trading programs?

1178
02:05:31,073 --> 02:05:35,013
And did you guys see the information when you guys were discussing these options?

1179
02:05:35,633 --> 02:05:44,083
When I go to her graph, I can't tell exactly what part of this are they currently charging students like I know that she's trying to recruit people.

1180
02:05:44,133 --> 02:05:51,503
She needed more trainers. So like, is it something that they're using to make profit or is that just what we're looking like could do in the future?

1181
02:05:52,733 --> 02:05:56,602
With the partnership with Livestrong or with the hospital.

1182
02:05:56,603 --> 02:05:59,123
So if we're training their staff,

1183
02:05:59,123 --> 02:06:09,353
are we charging is that part of the hospital's profits or are we training independent people to do this on their own terms through MDC?

1184
02:06:14,383 --> 02:06:18,403
So with with what we already had. The Turkey elections are solutions.

1185
02:06:19,323 --> 02:06:24,873
That is where most of the revenue is coming from. So answer is yes.

1186
02:06:24,873 --> 02:06:31,353
We will continue to make revenue through using those models based on the projections from the graph.

1187
02:06:32,543 --> 02:06:36,473
But would you pay for an individual go pay to then be certified?

1188
02:06:36,923 --> 02:06:41,133
What is that? Is there room for that in the rock? Oh, sorry.

1189
02:06:41,423 --> 02:06:45,143
Like, like individually and as a not part of a hospital, not part of the YMCA.

1190
02:06:45,293 --> 02:06:49,433
Just like someone you want to be trained to this kind of therapy to be able to give this to their wherever they are.

1191
02:06:50,123 --> 02:06:51,463
That's a great suggestion.

1192
02:06:51,473 --> 02:06:59,753
So if we're able to provide those kind of services, I think they would come following the expansion just so we can see more with them from their.

1193
02:07:03,153 --> 02:07:10,123
Providers may be able to offer that treatment. I think that's something we're looking into doing in the future, which.

1194
02:07:14,253 --> 02:07:22,863
Yeah, I think it's one of the main things is that it's supposed to be like free treatment for free for all patients if we're at YMCA.

1195
02:07:23,493 --> 02:07:30,663
I don't know how they generally do that with the patients have to have a membership at the YMCA in order to take a class there.

1196
02:07:31,503 --> 02:07:37,353
I would just like. What's your. Part of a partnership agreement.

1197
02:07:38,963 --> 02:07:44,093
But we have to pay for that. That's a very good question.

1198
02:07:47,503 --> 02:07:51,973
What do we think? You could write it in the contract and win the contract.

1199
02:07:53,613 --> 02:08:01,153
Yeah. So we're going to make it clear to the Sterling YMCA that equity in providing this free treatment is one of our priorities.

1200
02:08:01,153 --> 02:08:07,153
And in order to maintain that, we will write in the contract. What if they say they don't want it?

1201
02:08:12,103 --> 02:08:21,343
So I think that we could implement the certification program, which would then generate more profits for us.

1202
02:08:23,953 --> 02:08:32,983
Yeah, very, Christiane. Interesting, Christiane. I just trust the classification program.

1203
02:08:33,223 --> 02:08:38,803
You're saying like individual people, like I can go get a certification in Little Rock, right?

1204
02:08:40,023 --> 02:08:45,823
So. Yes, however.

1205
02:08:49,833 --> 02:08:53,023
Okay. You have to have an undergraduate background in exercise science.

1206
02:08:53,043 --> 02:09:02,252
I think you specified earlier. Yeah, exactly. And so there is you know, you have a little background in exercise science.

1207
02:09:02,253 --> 02:09:05,583
Thanks for writing science and math.

1208
02:09:06,503 --> 02:09:13,923
But back to your point with like the whole ripping it off thing, like how do you how do you maintain that it's empty fields.

1209
02:09:15,963 --> 02:09:19,693
Like if anyone can just go get certified. What if I'm gonna, like, start my own?

1210
02:09:21,213 --> 02:09:32,862
Well. Since it is our certification program, we will be getting you know, you will be generating profit from you going and certifying from there.

1211
02:09:32,863 --> 02:09:44,673
And then I got those the stuff that we talked about earlier with short sellers, I guess,

1212
02:09:46,393 --> 02:09:51,283
in terms of this relationship with Livestrong and YMCA, a potential relationship.

1213
02:09:51,913 --> 02:09:54,463
How do you kind of envision that relationship?

1214
02:09:54,463 --> 02:10:02,022
Is this more of a situation where we're just paying rent to YMCA for their facilities or are they going to get a lot more input there?

1215
02:10:02,023 --> 02:10:06,403
Seems like there could be a broad spectrum of what that relationship entailed.

1216
02:10:07,063 --> 02:10:16,933
So as I detail earlier, we would potentially be helping them in that we, you know, patients that go through our program and,

1217
02:10:17,143 --> 02:10:21,342
you know, finish with our program might continue and feed into their program afterwards.

1218
02:10:21,343 --> 02:10:27,793
So they do get some more clientele from us as well, which is basically what they'll be getting from this agreement as well.

1219
02:10:28,123 --> 02:10:39,973
And then again, with like the joint board suggestion that will entail that, you know, both sides will be heard and will be like the partnership.

1220
02:10:43,973 --> 02:10:54,033
The other questions. Well, um.

1221
02:10:57,513 --> 02:11:03,033
So this is for our trustees and for our staff.

1222
02:11:04,473 --> 02:11:07,563
In a border city situation in which this has happened.

1223
02:11:07,893 --> 02:11:12,213
And the staff has now gotten a lot of wonderful input from our board.

1224
02:11:13,293 --> 02:11:20,073
But we think it's the role now for the staff to play back and take every idea.

1225
02:11:20,973 --> 02:11:27,753
We try to report back on every question, but we kind of try to just make a strategy as best we can.

1226
02:11:27,873 --> 02:11:31,742
What do we think is sort of the what's the next step in this process?

1227
02:11:31,743 --> 02:11:39,123
Because what we've simulated here in an excellent way is pretty much how this would have looked, you know, in a board meeting.

1228
02:11:39,423 --> 02:11:43,683
A lot of different questions, a lot of different challenges to the idea.

1229
02:11:44,283 --> 02:11:50,963
But what next? I think at this point we would take all of these suggestions in there and pull it back to the drawing board, essentially,

1230
02:11:51,803 --> 02:11:56,033
and come up with a plan that addresses all of these things that maybe we didn't address the first time around.

1231
02:11:57,293 --> 02:12:03,253
And then, of course, it's going to be a one time decision, since that is a very big decision for the four of you.

1232
02:12:03,953 --> 02:12:12,983
From there, we would come up with maybe solutions or strategies that will address all of these efforts to come back, reconvene for another meeting,

1233
02:12:14,063 --> 02:12:17,692
and then continue through this kind of evaluation and improvement process

1234
02:12:17,693 --> 02:12:21,983
until we are we have something that we're ultimately satisfied with any form.

1235
02:12:23,883 --> 02:12:28,953
And Christine, second question for you. I realize a situation like.

1236
02:12:30,003 --> 02:12:43,303
Would you actually be able to and I guess take everyone's suggestions and put it all he likes to do, you know what I mean?

1237
02:12:44,083 --> 02:12:45,783
And what's your intuition?

1238
02:12:46,323 --> 02:12:54,063
Based on a lot of different things that like to probably take a lot of money, a lot of time, a lot of resources and may not all work together well.

1239
02:12:54,063 --> 02:12:58,873
So, you know, what do we make of the great ideas?

1240
02:12:59,463 --> 02:13:04,353
Thank you for the question. That's an excellent question. But also logistically, I agree.

1241
02:13:04,533 --> 02:13:11,643
And logistically, I think boards typically meet on like a schedule, you know, usually like every quarter or, you know, whatever they set up.

1242
02:13:12,243 --> 02:13:19,443
So if you were to like every time present something that you're going to do and then they say, oh, actually I want to do something different.

1243
02:13:19,443 --> 02:13:22,293
Do it like never get anything done, because you can't do it.

1244
02:13:22,353 --> 02:13:25,953
If you're like waiting for that approval, then you're not going to be able to move forward with that.

1245
02:13:25,983 --> 02:13:34,792
Any ideas? I. Like a man just goes from brainstorming to like planning and drafting plan.

1246
02:13:34,793 --> 02:13:41,032
So like having to draft a plan between like Netscape and Livestrong.

1247
02:13:41,033 --> 02:13:47,363
What I'm saying like that look like what the concept of one would like this advisory council to like, like, you know,

1248
02:13:47,723 --> 02:13:52,403
just having that on paper to bring to the board the next conversation and taking this feedback

1249
02:13:52,403 --> 02:13:58,973
that we're giving you and seeing like what aligns with the name just outlined their case analysis.

1250
02:14:02,953 --> 02:14:10,303
I think in part I think in a real world situation we'd have a lot more information and we could come to

1251
02:14:10,303 --> 02:14:17,743
a meeting like this with an actual plan that could be edited and revised and with a lot less ambiguity.

1252
02:14:18,103 --> 02:14:22,753
So I don't I mean, obviously there's going to be disagreements, but end of the day, I feel like.

1253
02:14:23,673 --> 02:14:27,572
It's maybe, maybe easier, maybe not never in that situation to make a decision.

1254
02:14:27,573 --> 02:14:34,593
But yeah, you're in it today. So yeah, I think there are a lot of common themes among most the question.

1255
02:14:34,743 --> 02:14:41,493
Most of the questions and I feel like most of the time when you go to a board, it's like this is the proposal we have.

1256
02:14:41,913 --> 02:14:46,323
And I think it's very likely that the point is that they're going to like you.

1257
02:14:46,923 --> 02:14:51,633
I guess if I were in your position, I would have come to the board like this is our proposal.

1258
02:14:52,083 --> 02:14:53,283
What are your thoughts on it?

1259
02:14:53,283 --> 02:15:00,783
And then taking the four common themes back and suddenly I will have something ready for like a final vote at the next meeting or something.

1260
02:15:01,293 --> 02:15:05,883
So that way there's like certain stages. But I would have I wouldn't go back with every question.

1261
02:15:06,783 --> 02:15:14,012
Even some of the questions I asked weren't really not pertinent, but but they were like fun questions to ask, right?

1262
02:15:14,013 --> 02:15:17,733
So like, I wouldn't go back to every question. I go back to common things and live.

1263
02:15:17,943 --> 02:15:24,992
Right. Yeah. I also think that like it's important that I feel like board meetings that go in with a lot

1264
02:15:24,993 --> 02:15:28,413
of different like financials and statistics that they all walk in with that information.

1265
02:15:28,413 --> 02:15:36,603
So they're going to have some questions from the get go. And then also I think that like whenever you're coming in with a new solution or something,

1266
02:15:36,873 --> 02:15:42,813
I think there's usually a few key board members that if you know, you can convince them, then you're pretty set.

1267
02:15:42,813 --> 02:15:44,222
So I don't think you need to answer everyone.

1268
02:15:44,223 --> 02:15:50,193
I think you just need to be able to read the room and say, yes, this is really like this or these two people.

1269
02:15:50,793 --> 02:15:54,633
And I think that would be politically speaking, that would help be how you do it.

1270
02:15:54,633 --> 02:15:58,953
Even Barbara, I'm a great CEO. Well, no.

1271
02:16:00,223 --> 02:16:07,883
One important answer. How every single member of the board is going to vote.

1272
02:16:09,683 --> 02:16:16,763
No plans, no presentations, nothing until you know how every person is going to vote.

1273
02:16:17,813 --> 02:16:20,033
And that's the one on one meetings you're talking about.

1274
02:16:20,513 --> 02:16:26,183
That all happened months before this presentation ever happened because you know what everyone's going to say?

1275
02:16:26,183 --> 02:16:30,803
Because remember, you're anticipating what they're going to say, not reacting.

1276
02:16:30,833 --> 02:16:36,113
Now, that doesn't mean if you talk about the great ideas. I think Christiane's excellent question.

1277
02:16:37,963 --> 02:16:42,223
It's ambiguous. Can we respond to all of it? You know, maybe.

1278
02:16:42,763 --> 02:16:48,733
But the biggest mistake maybe in this simulation, which we didn't get there, it's okay with me to get there.

1279
02:16:48,733 --> 02:16:54,753
This way is if we start calling a vote. Because once you call a boat, you don't know where everyone's going to vote,

1280
02:16:55,683 --> 02:16:59,613
you know, and that you can't pull back as the board members do have a vote.

1281
02:17:00,033 --> 02:17:03,213
And once the vote is called, whatever the vote is, that's the vote.

1282
02:17:03,513 --> 02:17:08,703
You don't get to go back and go. I didn't like that vote assignment. It was well, that's another story.

1283
02:17:09,693 --> 02:17:11,522
But but but the point is,

1284
02:17:11,523 --> 02:17:18,303
is that that's that's that's critical critical to this case and critical to what we just did here in terms of that that dynamic.

1285
02:17:18,813 --> 02:17:23,703
So the role that we can play in terms of what you all like done and you all did it organically,

1286
02:17:24,123 --> 02:17:27,633
if you think about our and how do we provide input, how do we provide guidance?

1287
02:17:27,633 --> 02:17:31,923
And then think about who we need to talk to in order to gather consensus.

1288
02:17:32,283 --> 02:17:38,973
And then when we come back with the plan for coming back with the plan, not one at a time, every question answered,

1289
02:17:38,973 --> 02:17:45,092
but what's the new plan that takes into account and maybe acknowledge, you know, trustee so-and-so said this.

1290
02:17:45,093 --> 02:17:49,863
I mean, no one called themselves trustees, but, you know, Doctor So-and-so said this.

1291
02:17:49,863 --> 02:17:53,913
You know, Mrs. Smith said that, you know, Jimmy said this.

1292
02:17:54,933 --> 02:18:03,183
Keesha said that, you know, everybody has different, you know, ideas, but you have to kind of come with with a consolidated plan.

1293
02:18:03,183 --> 02:18:07,563
So it's an excellent presentation. That was an excellent simulation.

1294
02:18:08,223 --> 02:18:12,483
And what I appreciated most about today's simulation and presentation was it was

1295
02:18:12,483 --> 02:18:17,453
extremely clear to me and saw really good at hiding it that everybody read the case.

1296
02:18:18,213 --> 02:18:29,673
So we'll be back here next week with everybody reading the case because it's not going to be fun at all if everyone isn't reading case, I know I will.

1297
02:18:30,033 --> 02:18:35,553
So things get busy, but every week when you show up here, I expect you read the case.

1298
02:18:35,973 --> 02:18:39,453
Okay. What about you want to know? Hold on. Before you leave.

1299
02:18:39,573 --> 02:18:47,103
You got one minute. September 27, September 27.

1300
02:18:47,523 --> 02:18:54,753
We're meeting on Zoom. That was number 27, because the syllabus is not next week.

1301
02:18:55,233 --> 02:18:59,372
Not next week. So you're next week, September 27th.

1302
02:18:59,373 --> 02:19:02,693
We're meeting on Zoom. It's in the syllabus. I just want to call it your attention.

1303
02:19:02,793 --> 02:19:08,193
Everybody knows I didn't want to just say next week because then you will meet.

1304
02:19:08,463 --> 02:19:13,563
I'm not sure because we have ever had good work today.

1305
02:19:13,563 --> 02:19:20,733
Again, I really appreciate. I didn't say different reason and I'm always appreciative of all of you and all their great contributions.

1306
02:19:20,733 --> 02:19:31,503
And as always, it's a pleasure working with the great job right now all the time.

1307
02:19:32,283 --> 02:19:36,213
I would never do that.

1308
02:19:36,213 --> 02:19:42,343
It talks like this. You know, I think I have a picture of me here.

1309
02:19:42,383 --> 02:19:47,373
All right. I see.

1310
02:19:48,003 --> 02:19:53,073
I don't know where it is, but it's not okay.

1311
02:19:53,193 --> 02:20:01,403
You. It's it's just so hard to be the one to go after those people.

1312
02:20:01,503 --> 02:20:10,383
They are just that you give us a picture.

1313
02:20:13,383 --> 02:20:22,253
A picture without us anyway. Sorry. That's all I needed.

1314
02:20:26,373 --> 02:20:40,713
That was kind of what the activity that set up. I also know what you can say.

1315
02:20:41,943 --> 02:20:45,783
Yes. No, no, no. It wasn't what I know.

1316
02:20:45,813 --> 02:21:03,363
Everything I looked at before because, you know, I don't know.

1317
02:21:04,683 --> 02:21:09,523
Everybody says, oh, god, I know.

1318
02:21:09,603 --> 02:21:19,653
It's like about somebody. And then I don't know why.

1319
02:21:20,203 --> 02:21:35,493
I was like, you know, this is outside the 24 years on the job of communicating.

1320
02:21:37,753 --> 02:21:49,803
You should give me that.

1321
02:21:50,543 --> 02:21:51,593
You didn't show me this one, I.

1322
02:21:52,233 --> 02:22:12,073
It says that it's intended to its focus which I want you can drop that you're doing okay by 160 but I don't like that too much.

1323
02:22:14,313 --> 02:22:21,183
We're not quite sure any of the things, but some of the stuff we use.

1324
02:22:21,303 --> 02:22:27,783
And, you know, she's just writing songs that are out there for her.

1325
02:22:28,923 --> 02:22:36,033
If you ask the question she did for 30 years ago, there go.

1326
02:22:38,003 --> 02:22:42,583
Yeah. So what? I would try.

1327
02:22:42,813 --> 02:23:01,433
So I'm just saying it's going to be an introduction to epidemiology, but do you want to highlight that works for you?

1328
02:23:02,523 --> 02:23:13,233
So think about it. The last time you were working with addiction, but I told you last year I was thinking,

1329
02:23:13,653 --> 02:23:32,833
is there something you want to buy, buy, buy, buy, shouldn't buy houses along the border with India.

1330
02:23:32,853 --> 02:23:39,883
So you're going to experience I mean, that's what happens when you go, yeah, you know,

1331
02:23:39,903 --> 02:23:47,403
because typically when I did give you an opportunity for people giving you a lot of that is thinking,

1332
02:23:47,423 --> 02:23:53,493
yeah, yeah, you, I would say like I can bring my experience of discomfort, but I think,

1333
02:23:53,803 --> 02:24:07,622
oh yeah, you don't even really know much about these are all pretty cool.

1334
02:24:07,623 --> 02:24:15,103
How you guys like listening to this topic was like, you know what you're talking about, you know, you're just trying to.

1335
02:24:15,403 --> 02:24:23,343
I think that would also put you in strategic position that we can bring in a perspective now is great.

1336
02:24:24,063 --> 02:24:37,833
Yeah you know I'm excited that I of you know stressed out.
