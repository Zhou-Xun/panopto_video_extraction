1
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:05,630
I wanted to walk down here today, so.

2
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:31,350
Okay. So it's a little warm review from where we left off last week.

3
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:40,020
We started discussing marginal structural models for Msmes not to be confused with the mainstream media.

4
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:50,069
So this is essentially a situation where we have potentially exposure at news confounding.

5
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,900
So we may be another way of looking at it, of course, was our sort of.

6
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:08,870
Multiple mediation situation seems to strike here.

7
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:21,160
There. Well, I'm going to have to.

8
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:36,700
We have a. We've been.

9
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:43,850
Forgetting a confounding issue,

10
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:51,440
but space and looking at situations where we have multiple mediators because there could be many here, not just the two.

11
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:57,200
But initially, we assumed independence between these two.

12
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,880
These these things do not affect each other. And we could be in a situation where.

13
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:10,400
You know, could could go either direction in both directions. But we want to sort of try to sort out.

14
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:16,430
So one way to try and deal with this is essentially try to.

15
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:25,560
Sort of separate these these pathways and.

16
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:35,420
Just using regression approaches doesn't doesn't successfully do this.

17
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:40,790
So we turn this idea of a propensity way.

18
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:52,850
So, so we're basically trying to sort of be absorbed in separate, direct and indirect effects.

19
00:02:54,140 --> 00:03:04,530
So what what else at this. Now I'm an EL.

20
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:19,510
All right. So Ellis immediately went to have one observe.

21
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:29,410
It is in direct effect and we're basically going to replace the assumption of the contents of em.

22
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:35,600
And now by adding Palin.

23
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:44,030
So basically it becomes a confounder from the perspective of a propensity score approach.

24
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:50,490
So. Okay.

25
00:03:50,590 --> 00:04:00,030
So the trick to this was to start off with our usual game preparatory score for the total effect.

26
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:11,160
So basically looking at the predicted value of being in, let's say whatever care,

27
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:17,010
focusing on a little a sort of probability of B to treatment little A given X.

28
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:26,010
And then we went out in the probability of being a little A and little L.

29
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:36,460
I'm sorry. I've been given a X and L.

30
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:43,600
So that second piece then becomes a way to essentially lose weight, to try and balance out,

31
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:52,060
sort of to think about breaking the arrows here with L and you just have the piece left that relates.

32
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:59,660
A through him. So.

33
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,240
And of course our control direct effect allowing for interactions between.

34
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:09,190
And that's going to be given by the system here.

35
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:24,100
Right. So are basically back to the same game we were when we first looked at it at mediation but now using the weights to fit this.

36
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:29,130
So-called. Structural model.

37
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:40,770
So this is the I think the term structural here, to my mind, means like the underlying causal structure that we're trying to estimate.

38
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:47,310
And it's considered marginal because we are not conditioning on any axes or else,

39
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:52,560
but instead we're using the weights to try and estimate this marginal effect.

40
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:02,709
Okay. So basically just noting that, you know,

41
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:11,410
we can use logistic regression if in our binary multi-domain regression we have categorical levels

42
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:20,319
and then the actual PDFs from but they do this as required appropriate distribution of model for.

43
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:25,180
And we'll come back to the structural main model idea later.

44
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:31,719
We'll reach that today with support. But that's a that's an alternative.

45
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:39,820
So these are probably most popular when when we have categorical type measures.

46
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:50,570
So so again, the idea being that we the first week gets a representative sample from a counterfactual population randomized to treatment or exposure.

47
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:56,240
The second we get to reproduce sample from a counterfactual population randomized to the mediator.

48
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:03,590
So. Okay.

49
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:05,540
So we kind of work through all the details on that.

50
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:14,659
And then just a quick note, that variance estimation, the usual survey sampling rate, you're here, right?

51
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:21,580
So we're basically going to fit. This marginal model here with the weights.

52
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:33,420
So. The design matrix is an intercept vector of treatments that mediate or values in a vector of the interactions.

53
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:44,500
And then our weights. I just.

54
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,970
The product. Longer waits for the treatment and early through a mediator.

55
00:07:54,470 --> 00:08:00,260
And so we use the usual game, the kind of sandwich type escalator.

56
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:05,780
So cwc inverse c. Transpose W.

57
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:18,300
Ten times the estimate or the variance of the residuals, which you're just going to get by taking the square and dividing by the sample size and then.

58
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:24,310
Temperature barometer piece. So. Okay.

59
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:30,129
So this is entirely a very quick review of the other day.

60
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:39,780
Other questions from this other piece that. You know, I wanted to kind of get this into our heads before we look at the example.

61
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:54,900
So. I'm going to return to this Alameda County study and sample.

62
00:08:56,350 --> 00:09:01,479
So our interest now is going to be the effect of childhood poverty and death.

63
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:08,130
It's mediated through diabetes. Becomes diabetes.

64
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:20,460
And. So this is our initial model.

65
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:50,410
Yeah. So you have the poverty.

66
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:02,490
Diabetes survival.

67
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:11,900
So. Between 1965 and 2000.

68
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:25,520
So the fanciest outcome. But that's pretty much everybody, you know sample 1965 going forward, 35 years.

69
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:37,610
So first of all, we want to get the total effect when you try to estimate this this proportion explain by mediation.

70
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:43,100
So we start with just looking at the effect of childhood survival using a propensity weighted estimate.

71
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:48,860
So the first thing we've got to do is get this propensity.

72
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:53,150
So propensity of right. So this is basically a give an X.

73
00:10:54,170 --> 00:11:07,590
So X here is going to. So.

74
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:17,090
So basically you can see that age is a pretty powerful predictor.

75
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:20,909
So we're kind of going back in time here away. So just a bit of U.S. history here.

76
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:27,360
So 1965, a lot of most of these people in the sample would have been born here, all adults.

77
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,310
So they would have been born century in the first half or a little less of the 20th century.

78
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:40,499
So the exception of the Great Depression, pretty much the poverty rates were declining rapidly as the U.S. industrialized over this time,

79
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,800
so older people were more likely to be in childhood poverty.

80
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:55,479
How much association with gender? Here I see a big association with race, racial discrimination, playing a big role here and I guess other here.

81
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:03,090
And this would have been a much smaller percentage of the population, but basically folks identifying as Asian or possibly Hispanic.

82
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:10,410
So basically not really having big differences, some evidence of slightly less of the white population.

83
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:14,790
So okay.

84
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:20,190
So basically we use this to just compute our weight, right?

85
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:25,910
So it's just the. Win over portion of being.

86
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:44,830
Even childhood poverty. Divided by party here.

87
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:58,830
So I want to use this survival model. So I'm going to use the usual design basically to get in my weights.

88
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:05,590
And then. Yeah, that's true I feel.

89
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:15,820
And so I get both my point estimate here and an appropriate standard error since that automatically gives me this the sandwich based estimate.

90
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:19,929
And you notice I'm using a zero an outcome you may think that's not so great.

91
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:21,610
And indeed there are some issues with that,

92
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:28,450
but the variance estimate will be largely corrected because it is coming out of model based variance estimate.

93
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:32,740
So we're not assuming that the the are strongly distributed because we're they aren't.

94
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:39,010
So instead, this this sort of sandwich based estimate gives unbiased estimates of the variance.

95
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:45,610
So asymptotically unbiased estimates. So we have a decent sized sample here too.

96
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:58,900
So, so basically, you know, pretty much a surprisingly there is definitely some effect about a 6% decrease in survival rates.

97
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:10,750
There's a lot of probabilities. So the actual on on the actual probability scale, pretty, pretty strong and highly significant.

98
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:17,930
So. All right. So any quick questions there, right.

99
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,150
So now I want to consider the effect now mediated by diabetes.

100
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:29,400
So in particular, I want to look at this controlled, direct effect of childhood poverty.

101
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:35,540
So this gives me.

102
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:47,910
My. Coefficient associated with the exposure coefficient associated with the mediator than the interaction between the two.

103
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:55,680
So the control direct effect is defined in terms of of a in terms of the treatment level.

104
00:14:56,310 --> 00:15:02,400
But you'll notice that there's not evidence of no strong evidence of interaction here.

105
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:08,960
So so I'm not sure it's going to fit with a common control direct effect.

106
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:18,210
So really going back to the American model here. So basically then we put this in.

107
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:26,520
So even though the media does have a strong association, the change in this is basically zero.

108
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:33,690
So, of course, immediate, it's basically going to be zero. Right. So I think any point zero.

109
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:40,390
Six. Four before or 639, nine.

110
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:47,380
I'm down to 6394. So two, I'm not going to go that far in.

111
00:15:49,990 --> 00:16:05,180
So I get a. Association of zero here so for bootstrap for to try and get a confidence interval

112
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:13,929
for this I use bootstrapping and we've talked about this briefly but but you know,

113
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:21,010
the basic idea of bootstrapping is with regression models.

114
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:45,410
So we talked about the sample. So we.

115
00:16:49,040 --> 00:17:00,220
But for regression models. We want to keep our design matrix fixed, right?

116
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:15,110
So if we just we sample all the observations and we run the the regression model fitting rationally along with physics.

117
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:24,170
Especially if you have the full package, it's typically not going to do so.

118
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:31,010
So the trick on this then is basically to.

119
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:39,780
The fully strap an invisible.

120
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:53,140
All right. I'm sorry. They took away my markers, so I'm going to get a marker that works.

121
00:19:46,650 --> 00:21:04,979
Yeah. Okay.

122
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:08,630
So the basic idea here is we with the progression.

123
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:21,010
We checked residuals for basically you sample.

124
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:33,180
The replacement. I.

125
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:45,120
And then there was going to be a.

126
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:54,030
Bootstrap. Bootstrap is just like data.

127
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:12,950
All right, so then you and.

128
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,210
This. It's essentially a regression.

129
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:23,440
This man is producing piece from.

130
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:29,870
The residual the residual stuff in the sample would be questioned.

131
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:35,520
So that means zero overall and samples.

132
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:47,010
So you seem to be to pay to have that big difference in this with every sampling except a variation in the variance.

133
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:58,490
But a bonus in this class. See you later.

134
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:04,140
Really? So that's what we're doing here.

135
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:14,340
So I have two models. I have the model for the total effect and the model for the mediated effect.

136
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,790
I think there may be some errors have corrected on this.

137
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:25,040
So if you see a slight difference at the because I think I had an error in the slide in the post,

138
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:30,750
did you actually do over again what the issue is with bootstrap and keep indexed?

139
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:40,320
Right. So if you don't if you just bootstrap the tire to see.

140
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:57,760
So. So basically if you threw sample.

141
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:10,110
Sort of observation is because basically you're getting the joint distribution.

142
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:17,590
But you don't want that is what he is giving.

143
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:29,730
So I think he wants to do that.

144
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:35,040
So full thoroughness discussion and so forth.

145
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:43,170
But I think maybe just of the discussion, you can see the idea that basically the residuals here are all conditional marks.

146
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:49,140
So you should try to see if you have the X Factor we want.

147
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:55,230
We want if we were going to upwards the uncertainty in this conditional distribution of the uncertainty during distribution.

148
00:24:56,340 --> 00:25:00,240
So residuals residuals basically does that.

149
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:34,040
I said, I have two different models here. I have the the residuals and the beta that is associated with them,

150
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:41,930
with the just the total effect and the residuals of the model that's associated with immediate effect.

151
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:48,140
So you can actually. Mm hmm.

152
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:57,800
So let's see here. But that porcelain model one of model two or these fits right.

153
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:05,370
Some of this goes back up in here. Of course, the way it was originally done up here.

154
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:13,980
So. So I'm just using this to pull out the ax, the design matrix, and put in the intercept.

155
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:21,000
Yeah. So it conceptually, what's the difference between model and so model one.

156
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,460
All right, model one with my total effect model.

157
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:39,510
And Model two includes the mediator in the interaction between the mediator and the control direct effect model because.

158
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:52,260
So remember, this is my in control direct effect, which I'm just going to fit without the interaction, I guess.

159
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,590
Thanks for the. Hmm.

160
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:05,460
I mean, it messes up all the hair probably should have fit. To be consistent, I think going.

161
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:11,990
A model with. With this.

162
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:16,360
This is my model, too. Oh, yeah, I did.

163
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:23,260
Well, actually, I didn't. We said this or I was running it.

164
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:33,330
There might be an error here. We blow up.

165
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:46,580
You know, the earth. Yeah. So my model to.

166
00:27:49,690 --> 00:28:02,440
Close the interaction between these. But my data does not because I had here I had gotten rid of the interaction because it wasn't significant.

167
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:11,710
So I'm not quite sure what's going on here either. I might have corrected this and then just put the code up here without that, without changing that.

168
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:15,910
So you should have the interaction in beta two. Yeah.

169
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,660
It should not have the interaction and made it to what?

170
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:25,000
What should not have what. Model two should be redesigned to be this piece here.

171
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:28,780
Okay. So that's where I'm trying to think.

172
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:35,050
I don't think this wouldn't run as it is. That's why I think I might have corrected it and put that in the code.

173
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:49,710
I think the results are probably okay, but I'll double check. The Model two is intended to match this model here.

174
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:08,410
I think when it got down here, some would go back to that change. So.

175
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:16,480
Okay. So let's point off the X, is that part there and the weights.

176
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:23,720
Right. I'm just working with the. But the propensity score piece for the first part here.

177
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:33,900
So that's it. So I've just got this as x transpose w x inverse.

178
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:44,380
Each of the two models. Law could go either way.

179
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:52,630
So this is the next one, the next two, or should be that way around that we've transposed it down here.

180
00:29:53,980 --> 00:30:23,140
So. So then, of course, this is why we sampled residuals, right?

181
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:36,070
We sampling them with replacement and I'm pulling off my appropriate total effect or control direct effect.

182
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:41,730
One one minus that with a proportion median.

183
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:53,210
So 2000 bootstraps. You know, he's going to take that. The 2.5 percentile, 27 point fifth percentile.

184
00:30:55,860 --> 00:31:14,000
Takes me back. So bottom line here, of course that to suggest that there's essentially absolutely zero mediation.

185
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:30,420
Right. That. But basically all of the all the effect on child poverty through adult poverty mediation doesn't it doesn't really play.

186
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:35,700
It doesn't really play a role here. So.

187
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:43,790
So basically, this is not not a major. It's not all poverty or the pathway.

188
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:51,770
So so we have this concern, right, that we're more in a situation.

189
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:09,670
Diabetes. So.

190
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,630
But real poverty might lead to higher rates of diabetes.

191
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:54,390
So the first thing I want to do is investigate this relationship here just for any excuse of just sort of looking at the margin piece here.

192
00:32:55,980 --> 00:33:08,820
So, you know, we do see in terms of of sort of the point estimate that this is now on the on the odds ratio scale.

193
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:15,900
But what about the racial scale that. Adult.

194
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:24,920
Adult. Yes. This is is there's a, well, positive relationship, but it's not significant.

195
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,140
You might notice the very low intercept here.

196
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:36,560
So in contrast to today, adult onset diabetes was was pretty uncommon.

197
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:42,410
So. So that already gives us a hint as to what the situation might be.

198
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:49,820
So clearly, that point estimate is positive, but it's significant.

199
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:53,730
So that will plunge on forward here.

200
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:03,720
So we're now going to refit our model, this emerging structural model, ready for both the propensity of child poverty.

201
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:09,030
And I didn't write this correctly, but instead of the propensity of adult poverty in child poverty,

202
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:12,300
it should be the risk of diabetes given adult poverty and childhood poverty.

203
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:15,660
Right. That's the home. R.

204
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:26,630
L. So. I used to think she'd.

205
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:43,840
So we need to come up with. This.

206
00:34:56,660 --> 00:35:01,520
This. Wait here. Right.

207
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:15,000
By estimating this. Which is sad that we're doing here.

208
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:18,960
So we're modeling diabetes as a function of adults.

209
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:25,060
Yes. So that's our. That's our l r a these are exes.

210
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:35,700
So. You know, we could get a little fancy here and look for interactions and so forth.

211
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:41,160
Well, it's probably not a bad idea in practice to do that. Let's try to keep it as a somewhat simple example.

212
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:46,409
Also, given the relative commonness of diabetes,

213
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:52,470
there may be somewhat limited power to pick up a lot of complicated structure here in this association.

214
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:57,600
So unless we can see some stuff going on.

215
00:35:57,620 --> 00:36:02,690
But most important would of course be age associated with diabetes onset.

216
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:08,209
So you know, nothing else quite makes significance go this.

217
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:12,410
Yes. Travis?

218
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:23,840
Yes, definitely. Really not much there. So but nonetheless go ahead and predict and what the product of these two.

219
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:27,950
So this is you so this is the weight.

220
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:43,370
So the sort of stabilized probability of being being diabetic because of the sort of association relative to the overall average rate of of diabetes.

221
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:48,350
And then the product of the original weight of childhood,

222
00:36:49,190 --> 00:37:00,260
as he has given X and then diabetes given childhood poverty, the all poverty index gives us this.

223
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:08,300
So I think the weights here are not too crazy. There's definitely some variation going on, but not terribly unstable.

224
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:14,990
In part, this is because we don't have a very rich set fixes, which is another issue in this example.

225
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:25,260
Okay. So then we go ahead and compute.

226
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:33,090
Or weighted estimate. Or now and as before, I'm just going to ignore the interaction.

227
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:40,830
Okay. There was not a lot of strong evidence for it, for a controlled direct effect and just get an overall control direct effect.

228
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:50,730
So, okay, so slightly different now.

229
00:37:52,260 --> 00:38:01,770
Not a lot of difference. So in particular, right now, I'm going to compare.

230
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:12,160
I still the same total effect right by my. A weight stays the same.

231
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:17,260
So I now have this new controlled direct effect.

232
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:23,049
Still not a big difference to me.

233
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:29,860
No significant evidence that childhood poverty or the effect of childhood poverty and death is mediated by diabetes.

234
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:34,120
But now there's a slight bit of positive association.

235
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:41,080
The interval, however, has gotten quite a bit wider. Any thoughts as to why that might mean?

236
00:38:49,990 --> 00:39:00,430
Let's just compare this with the previous one. So, you know, here I was about .09.

237
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:13,870
I hear the intervals. Like about point five.

238
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:30,960
We're having a hard time. Good handle on this.

239
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:38,940
And he thought that way that would be this. I mean, I'm guessing it has something to do with kind of waiting them to.

240
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,750
Right, right. Yes.

241
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:49,650
Right. So we definitely have like enormous. But we definitely have some some more instability in this in this piece here.

242
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,650
And we also have two models that are running around with rent.

243
00:39:56,040 --> 00:40:07,680
So as I mentioned before, so some of these these estimates maybe are kind of unstable in addition to being close to zero.

244
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:21,180
But basically the trick is the same. We use our overall weights now to compute that x transpose w x piece.

245
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:30,140
And we still have the same. I think from the.

246
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:37,500
He's not going to do this. So what I would say from before for the total effect.

247
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:41,610
But now my new control direct effect is coming out of this this third level.

248
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:53,340
So. I still have this issue here. It's a mental structure.

249
00:40:53,340 --> 00:41:00,930
Still the same, but. Not going to do better as well as a new set of.

250
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:28,550
For example, simple. Okay.

251
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:49,780
Questions, for example. Okay.

252
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:59,600
So we're going to kind of finish up this this discussion of of mediation through

253
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:04,460
direct and indirect effects with this discussion of structural need models.

254
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:18,560
So this is an alternative to exposure for exposure news compounding 2 to 2 using using the weights.

255
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:25,820
So this this should be me. I'm not asking them, but the terminology here can be quite confusing sometimes.

256
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:35,450
So and basically they sort of get away from, from the weighting issue back to the modeling issue.

257
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:39,410
But of course, we now have to make some assumptions about the outcome model.

258
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:48,709
So, you know, so in some sense, I think the propensity approaches is kind of simple and conceptually easy.

259
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:53,780
But you already saw a little bit of an issue here that there's a lot of instability introduced.

260
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:04,990
So. So if we get away with some own assumptions, of course, but also talk about sensitivity analysis, then this might be an improved approach.

261
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:17,700
So you get the same issue. Basically, once we have X and L accounted for the potential confounding between them and Y.

262
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:26,850
So. So it's just that that is that assumption is basically going to be the same.

263
00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:32,460
And I'm going to focus on this estimation of the control direct effect.

264
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:41,040
Yes. I should mention you could estimate indirect effects.

265
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:47,630
I didn't do it here, but you could estimate indirect effects using this.

266
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:54,670
This weighted approach can also play the same game here, but it's a little easier to work this out in terms of the control direct effects.

267
00:43:56,040 --> 00:44:00,360
So. So the algorithm basically is as follows.

268
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:07,680
So right. We're now going to include this exposure induced confounder.

269
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:16,390
So basically the same thing we're doing before our mediation approach.

270
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:23,770
So we have the treatment, the mediator, the interaction, but now we're also going to include out in the model.

271
00:44:25,210 --> 00:44:32,410
But rather than just right, if we just sort of put a L in as part of x ray, we could have the same potential issue for that.

272
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:41,710
We're, we're, we're controlling, but we're also messing up the, the direct indirect effect path.

273
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:53,620
So to deal with that, the alternative is, rather than working directly with this estimates of beta is to compute residuals.

274
00:44:57,580 --> 00:45:06,040
Basically just with respect to the effect of the mediator and the interaction.

275
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:15,520
So, no, not the overall residuals, but just these residuals that subtract off this effect of of.

276
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:23,020
Essentially, I'm. And the interaction with him.

277
00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:39,280
And then we then regress this on the treatment and baseline covariance and the control direct effect then becomes.

278
00:45:41,650 --> 00:45:47,560
Essentially this gamma one now, plus this beta three with the interactions.

279
00:45:53,090 --> 00:45:58,010
All right. So that may seem entirely obvious how that works.

280
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:03,590
So we're going to go through this piece by piece here.

281
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:08,300
So, all right.

282
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:11,840
So sort of simplified notation I'm going to assume as a star is the control level.

283
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:21,960
So it's just zero. So we're a control direct effect that just becomes right, this v one, a plus b three and.

284
00:46:26,310 --> 00:46:35,280
So if is one, that's basically going to be. Gamma one plus.

285
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:41,600
I mean, I feel empathy for him. So.

286
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:49,130
So this is our definition of our control, direct effect. And just in general, what looking at.

287
00:46:52,580 --> 00:47:07,040
Y a m minus y a star m so we can show then these fees line up with these gammas and betas.

288
00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:14,090
Under the models that. Fit.

289
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:27,150
This model for why give an AMA now and then this model for the residual given an X with a residual to subtract off better to.

290
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:35,040
Plus B two, three. Yeah, my. So I think there's no.

291
00:47:43,530 --> 00:47:51,320
Type of illness. I think I think I'm missing a parentheses here.

292
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:54,820
Right. To sort of get these residual pieces. So.

293
00:48:17,690 --> 00:48:25,320
So the first trick. It's to show that.

294
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:36,170
Three. It's going to equal beta three.

295
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:43,610
So we treat em as being continuous here.

296
00:48:44,810 --> 00:48:47,840
And basically we look at, of course, it could be categorical.

297
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:51,440
It doesn't have to be, but we're going to have one year increase in em.

298
00:48:54,450 --> 00:49:00,720
It's going to be our change in him. So if we look at under eight versus zero.

299
00:49:03,710 --> 00:49:19,590
At. Her plus one versus m then r control direct effect via PC three hey comes in minus one plus one minus u and a plus v 3 a.m.

300
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:23,760
Right. Just gives us this interaction term here.

301
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:31,060
So if we can show that our estimate of beta three under this model.

302
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:37,930
Cause 53. Then we're done.

303
00:49:39,580 --> 00:50:51,920
And so that's seen. So this is our commercial direct effect that in plus one direct effect.

304
00:50:55,320 --> 00:51:00,730
And so. Play the usual game.

305
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:09,690
Now. Essentially air conditioning to expel.

306
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:53,590
If. So I'm going to kind of bring these pieces a little bit.

307
00:53:47,770 --> 00:53:53,800
Conditioning number four multiplied by the same to be options in that condition.

308
00:53:55,920 --> 00:54:00,460
Back up the commercial piece. So based on the brain, this one.

309
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:06,180
Yeah. I mean, the police are here and without me down there.

310
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:16,520
And of course. Yeah. Plus Susan Sarandon came this.

311
00:54:24,070 --> 00:54:33,020
You know. So I've done this conditioning back and that sort of data.

312
00:54:38,170 --> 00:54:41,290
Recognition on your or paying?

313
00:54:41,330 --> 00:55:07,910
No. It's.

314
00:55:52,710 --> 00:56:19,330
I was here for a year. And now back to my model.

315
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:41,520
So there is that the possibility of giving a X or zero x.

316
00:56:44,690 --> 00:56:53,090
Now it's still giving you an A. And because I'm sort of allowing.

317
00:56:57,310 --> 00:57:02,130
I'm fixing for the purposes of the potential outcome.

318
00:57:03,990 --> 00:57:12,570
A hero. Right. But then when I say condition, I'm l so.

319
00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:22,910
So I guess you could say it's going to be a zero.

320
00:57:26,130 --> 00:57:32,100
But more generally, just conditioning on this sort of traditional distribution is.

321
00:57:39,830 --> 00:57:51,800
We definitely want to have this. This is a little bit, you know, quite sure the book doesn't deal, particularly on this one.

322
00:57:52,320 --> 00:58:00,870
But basically we're fixing. We're fixing a given value here.

323
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:09,480
The distribution of our. So. So you have to frame this across.

324
00:58:10,650 --> 00:58:24,140
So. He's going to have these things need to be the same the same distributions, every gallon for health.

325
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:33,800
So the fact that we're fixing a bit why does it impact what we do with our.

326
00:58:35,490 --> 00:58:38,540
The value. President.

327
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:43,700
All these things are sort of changeable, right?

328
00:58:44,570 --> 00:58:52,280
So in particular, we want to be able to manipulate data separately from the Internet as well.

329
00:58:53,330 --> 00:58:59,850
So this is just. The swapping reality is here.

330
00:59:47,830 --> 00:59:55,690
All right. So we're going to basically take this model up here, down here and the plus one.

331
00:59:57,430 --> 01:00:01,510
And then I think that part here has been missing out here.

332
01:00:44,950 --> 01:00:54,630
All right. All right.

333
01:00:55,290 --> 01:00:58,550
Same thing here. So, you know.

334
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:06,230
Zero zero. We made it to.

335
01:02:01,910 --> 01:02:08,010
So. All right.

336
01:02:08,010 --> 01:02:39,420
So very handsome here. All right, so I don't have to explain how involved anymore.

337
01:02:39,690 --> 01:02:50,349
All that's been for us. You have to be a better to write for them first.

338
01:02:50,350 --> 01:03:01,170
When I speak to them to speak to. Since I basically been able to grow.

339
01:03:05,690 --> 01:03:19,940
The taxes, the panels. Here.

340
01:03:22,330 --> 01:03:35,980
To. So.

341
01:03:39,270 --> 01:03:45,610
The last trick of this is that they're both going to be the one who actually sort of fixed the air here.

342
01:03:46,390 --> 01:03:52,510
And a few of these. So you'll see some over the axis of Dallas.

343
01:03:55,140 --> 01:03:58,580
It's made of steel or something like that.

344
01:03:59,730 --> 01:04:04,290
So I'm just thinking, just cancel.

345
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:17,780
So that then has to be equal, but by definition.

346
01:04:22,970 --> 01:04:28,210
The controlled direct effect of three, three, eight. So and I have these two people to each other.

347
01:04:44,090 --> 01:04:49,160
Okay. Questions at this point.

348
01:04:56,580 --> 01:05:00,290
All right. So the next step is to show that 51 is equal to GMO one.

349
01:05:02,040 --> 01:06:15,060
And this is even a bit more delicate. So.

350
01:06:17,410 --> 01:06:23,380
And some all my usual assumptions mean I can go from my potential outcomes to my observed outcome.

351
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:40,680
So the issue was raised there. Expectation. And I would assume basically I sort of have to renew your functions.

352
01:07:16,490 --> 01:07:22,430
One that depends would only on a brief illness.

353
01:07:26,470 --> 01:07:34,180
And it also includes an annex I just come back to here.

354
01:07:59,940 --> 01:08:11,290
So my friend Diana. That's the residual regression.

355
01:08:11,380 --> 01:08:20,580
These. These few functions are very comfortable with.

356
01:08:25,650 --> 01:08:28,680
Q And when it was equal, zero.

357
01:08:39,690 --> 01:08:44,300
It's going to be the zero point. So.

358
01:08:57,670 --> 01:09:01,390
So the number proposing satisfies these conditions.

359
01:09:08,980 --> 01:09:14,020
I'm hearing on the radio now is potentially.

360
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:49,960
So. Split these components up in the edit and there's a Q&A to them.

361
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:56,710
People identify. It's a queue of.

362
01:10:03,710 --> 01:10:13,180
Pieces of. Return to the tree.

363
01:10:24,270 --> 01:10:27,470
We'll see how the next all of these actually do in Baltimore next.

364
01:10:32,370 --> 01:10:52,310
It's here. We have left over. It's been covered here.

365
01:10:55,750 --> 01:11:00,720
So. Basically.

366
01:11:07,940 --> 01:11:17,300
Can do zero. Then this part goes away.

367
01:11:18,790 --> 01:11:40,870
That just got me to thinking. But by definition way is going to be this.

368
01:11:41,860 --> 01:12:10,510
Is this. It's taken that.

369
01:12:13,610 --> 01:12:17,870
From the assumption that it would be right. This is one.

370
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:58,910
So. So now you think about the education for.

371
01:13:02,010 --> 01:13:22,340
Potential outcome with MSF for zero. And they have this equality here.

372
01:13:23,270 --> 01:13:26,450
So here is this because.

373
01:13:29,810 --> 01:13:35,040
Just why. Why such a little drop in?

374
01:13:38,110 --> 01:13:47,650
This year. I assume.

375
01:13:51,550 --> 01:14:03,710
Independence. And I have. Given how air conditioning and.

376
01:14:17,860 --> 01:14:22,180
Right. And we will make this conditional upon this assumption because.

377
01:14:23,510 --> 01:14:29,630
And. Sort of conditional here.

378
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:40,940
Not just bad. So.

379
01:14:55,190 --> 01:14:58,490
So. Right. A little loose ends justice.

380
01:14:59,570 --> 01:15:07,010
But I have this clear. So.

381
01:15:31,210 --> 01:15:38,490
So why did you write this as this? That is why we're here.

382
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:43,710
Patient. Oh.

383
01:15:45,690 --> 01:16:10,530
It just the involves. Yeah.

384
01:16:16,900 --> 01:17:26,530
Oh, sure. So.

385
01:17:29,670 --> 01:17:36,360
This is my crew residual, my model stripped out.

386
01:17:39,490 --> 01:17:46,950
Yeah. Okay. So. Actually be.

387
01:17:50,490 --> 01:18:16,150
But this is just also my cue about. So that is residual given an X.

388
01:18:26,030 --> 01:18:39,470
Here. Said.

389
01:18:49,300 --> 01:18:58,730
So. As.

390
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:36,829
Was year. Okay.

391
01:19:36,830 --> 01:19:41,770
So I guess you. This.

392
01:19:44,140 --> 01:19:47,740
Right. This is just going to be my Q&A function.

393
01:20:50,150 --> 01:20:54,070
And then. He's here.

394
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:23,810
This. Right.

395
01:21:23,830 --> 01:21:29,190
So. We've got this equality here.

396
01:21:32,170 --> 01:21:56,850
The fact I got down to here at this. So.

397
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:25,430
So now I'm going to average that out. If.

398
01:22:43,140 --> 01:22:46,170
There. There.

399
01:22:49,630 --> 01:22:58,830
So under our. Role model.

400
01:23:02,180 --> 01:23:30,110
That's why. Zero zero. Just I mean, feeling.

401
01:23:30,130 --> 01:23:33,190
Feeling. So if we go back.

402
01:23:44,930 --> 01:23:55,330
I think there. Right. So. Let's see.

403
01:24:03,500 --> 01:24:10,160
So why? Zero zero basically just becomes the intercept and then y0 becomes V when a.

404
01:24:12,690 --> 01:24:16,520
Plus U.S. factors too often U.S.

405
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:40,580
That. Right.

406
01:24:40,640 --> 01:24:48,910
So basically. They that?

407
01:24:55,040 --> 01:25:02,350
000. So.

408
01:25:05,560 --> 01:25:09,050
So then why is.

409
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:50,640
So it's expected value of play zero is just going to be this.

410
01:25:56,080 --> 01:26:11,920
It's going to be to. That's a constant.

411
01:26:34,100 --> 01:26:37,640
Traffic conditions are A because of an X.

412
01:26:41,710 --> 01:26:45,880
I've come. Now.

413
01:27:24,380 --> 01:27:44,000
All right. So way back up here. So we've worked on this and we know this, but we also know from our model we did we did the regression on on our.

414
01:27:46,340 --> 01:27:54,240
That takes us from here. So this.

415
01:27:56,480 --> 01:28:11,430
There's so. But the linkage between the outcome of the rejection of the residuals and the Marshall model piece.

416
01:28:13,340 --> 01:28:19,060
So. Once I plug all those things in.

417
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:30,430
Then I go back to my control. Direct effect here.

418
01:28:32,020 --> 01:28:39,710
We've gone way over time. I'm sorry. You know, I was debating whether to try and tackle that or not.

419
01:28:40,760 --> 01:28:47,800
But I had. But I was going. Okay.

420
01:28:48,050 --> 01:28:50,660
So, yeah, some big bites here.

421
01:28:51,690 --> 01:28:59,820
We call this help, but this is basically an alternative to try to deal with this exposure confounder issue without resorting to weights.

422
01:29:00,580 --> 01:29:08,430
Although obviously it relies on these linear model assumptions or potentially more general model assumptions,

423
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:12,960
but for the for the you'd have to work out hernias.

424
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:16,200
But for the to actually use these components, betas are going to have this linear form.

425
01:29:18,240 --> 01:29:21,990
So, right. So that's a price to pay.

426
01:29:21,990 --> 01:29:29,100
And of course, all the assumptions reduce the weights or the regression modeling in terms of what we

427
01:29:29,100 --> 01:29:34,700
need for potential outcomes to be independent of our treatments and mediators given x.

428
01:29:35,830 --> 01:29:39,550
So. Okay.

429
01:29:41,540 --> 01:29:45,590
All right. You know, we're over time. You need to go.

430
01:29:45,650 --> 01:29:48,710
Please go. If you have questions and we don't, we'll stop.

431
01:29:51,870 --> 01:29:59,100
If you do, the only. Well, I think we've with sex.

432
01:30:03,300 --> 01:30:13,460
Oh, you're right there. That's right. This is a question.

433
01:30:17,010 --> 01:30:30,650
And the second one from the bottom should be equal sign should be a plus like the institution wise or.

434
01:30:30,660 --> 01:30:48,360
Oh yeah. Right. Right story today.

435
01:30:51,090 --> 01:31:33,060
Although she wouldn't speak. So it's like using terminology, just like shorthand for Rose.
