1
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:11,010
I'm going to go ahead and start. It's like you all are the elite crowd today.

2
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:24,330
Okay. So we're coming into the homestretch here.

3
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:31,230
The last few lectures are going to be pretty heavily weighted to kind of more of an applied toxicology.

4
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:37,150
At this point, we've covered like a lot of the major organ systems and types of toxicants.

5
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:41,190
So we're going to kind of see more going into things like risk assessment and

6
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:45,900
like how the toxicology is applied and the various ways in the regulatory space.

7
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:52,440
So just a few lectures left of the exam.

8
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,780
Two will be open on Wednesday. It'll be the same deal as last time open for me.

9
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:03,520
But once you start it, you have 24 hours to finish it. So please be mindful of the time there.

10
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:09,569
We had a couple of instances where people weren't quite clear at the time, so just really pay attention to one that's going to be open.

11
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:15,300
So it'll be one week. And then once you open it, it'll be 24 hours that you need to finish it.

12
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:21,330
Right? So just select a nice 24 hour block of time for you to be able to finish it.

13
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:24,780
So next Wednesday, next class period,

14
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:33,780
I will give that time to you to prep for the exam or work on your paper or do whatever you feel is useful to you during that time.

15
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:39,810
The paper paper stuff seem really good, really interesting topics.

16
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:43,620
There's for some of you. I don't know if that's anyone here.

17
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:48,299
I kind of had a couple of notes about maybe honing in on something a little bit

18
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:54,930
more specific because there were a couple that were maybe a little bit general. That might be a lot to cover in like a page paper.

19
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,660
So I think that's about it.

20
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:06,070
One particular thing was that like because we've talked a lot about mechanisms and mechanisms are really important in toxicology.

21
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:14,249
I would like one section of that paper to be dedicated to talking about a proposed like cellular or molecular mechanisms.

22
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:19,140
That explains why exposure to that chemical could lead to a particular health outcome.

23
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:24,570
So that was kind of all the notes I had for the most part on the.

24
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:31,760
But other than that, like really interesting topics. So I'm looking forward to reading all of those.

25
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:45,290
If you have any questions about the paper or the notes that I send out in response to course, office hours or email is totally fine.

26
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:51,350
And if I don't get back to you like right away with the email, like within a day or two, feel free to email again.

27
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:55,810
I just want to make that clear. I do not care about getting multiple emails.

28
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:59,410
It's easy for me to lose track of things sometimes, so go ahead and like,

29
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:05,360
just it's not bothering me to just like resend the email and put it back at the top of my list.

30
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:09,860
Um, so that's all I had so far.

31
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:15,460
Does anyone have any questions? Good to go.

32
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:22,270
Okay. So today I'm going to talk about food, toxicology, any questions about the material from last time?

33
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:30,910
Last time was neurotoxin, right? Wasn't eco tox?

34
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:39,910
Right. Okay. I'm like, okay. So, yeah, that was a fun topic for me, at least, I think for some of you as well.

35
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:47,889
Anyway, we'll get into food toxicology now. So I just want to start out asking something that maybe we don't think about too

36
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:54,730
often is what type of chemicals or compounds are found in the common apple.

37
00:03:55,510 --> 00:04:03,070
Right. We probably maybe even apples that might start as to how what constitutes what is in the apple

38
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:10,450
does anyone and it doesn't have to be super specific you can just be like as general as you want,

39
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:17,650
what type of stuff makes up an apple? Any thoughts in general?

40
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,080
I know that in the seeds of the apple there is cyanide.

41
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:29,620
Sorry, in the seeds of the apple there is a compound that is Sinai.

42
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:33,549
Oh yes. Yeah, there is actually like a poisonous at very low levels.

43
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:38,650
That was this compound of the seeds of an apple. Anything else?

44
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:42,360
Anything more common place. Sugars. Sugars.

45
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,860
Right. You'll see. Some sugar is in there. Anything else?

46
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:51,120
Water. Water. Water, great fiber.

47
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:56,630
Fiber, fiber. Anything else?

48
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:05,160
We could be naming stuff for a long time. Right. And then things like flavonoids.

49
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:11,809
I don't know if you've heard of flavonoids that are a group of natural substances that have like this phenol ring structure that are found in fruits,

50
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:16,400
vegetables and various other like plants and stuff. So you'll have some flavonoids in there.

51
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:22,040
Antioxidants. Water, as we said.

52
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:25,879
Vitamins, minerals. Calcium.

53
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:31,790
Magnesium stuff. Sugars. Those are the ones that I just came up with off the top, mostly off the top of my head.

54
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:39,530
Did a little bit of digging just to remind myself. But yeah, so pretty much what you guys are thinking, you know, long story short,

55
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:43,790
what the point of this was just to get us to think about how food is actually pretty complex,

56
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:53,460
even without introducing the idea of toxicology and like manmade environmental chemicals into the mix, like the stuff we eat has a lot of stuff in it.

57
00:05:53,480 --> 00:06:01,670
Right. So we can think about like nutrients, substances, carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, vitamins and minerals.

58
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:06,070
And then there are also lots of non-nutritive substances like the stuff that isn't.

59
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,850
So the little green stuff is the stuff that we need to eat to make our bodies work and survive.

60
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:16,819
Right. The non nutrient stuff could have some some kind of benefit or maybe it could be

61
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:20,930
detrimental if it's so poisonous or has some kind of toxicological properties.

62
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:29,360
So the non nutrient substances would be things like say these phytochemicals or pigments that some plants have some of the signaling molecules

63
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:36,590
that depending on the species of like plant that we might be consuming or animal tissue might have like hormones and things like that,

64
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:46,330
fiber naturally occurring pesticides, again, particularly in the case of plants, you know, plants have developed natural pesticides to survive.

65
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:53,300
And then we get into the manmade stuff like food additives, which we'll talk about, and then contaminants.

66
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:59,540
So food additives are things that we purposefully or the manufacturer purposefully puts into the food to

67
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:08,690
impart some kind of properties onto the foods or to make the process of producing the end product easier.

68
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:16,280
Uh, the contaminants, things that end up in the food that the manufacturer like ideally wouldn't want to be there,

69
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:21,590
that sort of get introduced through the process of like manufacturing food products, right?

70
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:26,450
And then other like just various products, byproducts of food processing.

71
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:31,820
And so just to like hit this point home again,

72
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:40,790
this is an example of this table showing the number of non nutrient chemicals in various types of food that again, I don't know about you,

73
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:44,509
but I'm not like thinking about this when I'm eating things like cheese or drinking orange

74
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:51,440
juice that there's like 160 not identified non nutrient chemicals associated with cheese,

75
00:07:51,440 --> 00:08:02,060
250 with orange juice. You can see on down here this coffee has a lot of stuff in it, a lot of different chemicals like 625 these as well.

76
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:07,220
Right. So foods contain like hundreds of thousands of substances.

77
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,879
A lot of them have not been tested or like fully characterized.

78
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:15,560
But we don't really know the full scope of like biological activity they might have.

79
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:27,259
Um, one thing that's important to note is that food is rarely produced in like an entirely like, controlled or definable environment.

80
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:34,690
So you might think of like. Wine grapes that are produced in one region of the world versus another region of the world.

81
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,900
There may be a different soil chemistry between those two places.

82
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:41,470
And indeed, I think I'm not like a wine, a big wine drinker,

83
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:46,840
but I think like people who are really into wine can like talk about where they think certain types of wine,

84
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:54,950
like taste like they're coming from and things like that. You can think about like fish that live in particular regions of the world.

85
00:08:54,970 --> 00:09:00,910
They may be the same species, but there may be different chemistries going on or different chemicals in the,

86
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:04,810
you know, the lakes or oceans that these fish are coming from.

87
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:13,040
Um, if it's, you know, things like cows, they may be grazing on different types of grass that has a different soil composition as well.

88
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:21,310
So the food that we produce like generally is not just like produced in a sterile environment without any kind of outside influences going on.

89
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:31,690
Even production within like a food manufacturing plant, there are chemicals around that can end up migrating into the food.

90
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:42,940
Um. Yeah. You know, things like weather patterns, different weather patterns like year to year could influence the soil composition, for example.

91
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:50,530
Yeah. So. As far as the foods that we consume.

92
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,740
A lot of this is regulated by an act called the Food,

93
00:09:53,830 --> 00:10:04,720
Drug and Cosmetic Act that was passed in 1938 following contamination of this elixir of sulfur sulfate in OLAMIDE,

94
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:15,400
which is a drug used to treat bacterial infections. And at some point, a batch of it essentially was mixed with ethylene glycol or diethylene glycol,

95
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,169
in part, I believe, a raspberry flavor to it, if I remember correctly.

96
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:30,790
Like the it was part of this formulation, of this product, of this like mixture that was given to patients and it was not tested for toxicity.

97
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:39,240
Um, and it ended up poisoning. So diethylene glycol is a renal and neurological toxicant ended up poisoning like

98
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:45,610
over 100 people across the country leading to this like really bad poisoning event.

99
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:49,140
And that spurred the passing of the FDA and see.

100
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:56,680
So this is the idea that we need to evaluate anything that we're going to eat for or anything we're going

101
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:03,970
to add into foods that are going to be like ingested cosmetics or drugs for safety or for toxicity.

102
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:12,610
Right. So generally, the way this act is used is where there is like certain exceptions.

103
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:17,560
Right. Two of the chemicals that are the things that need to be evaluated under the FDA and see.

104
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:24,420
So we're presuming that certain foods that are traditionally consumed are safe, if free from contaminants.

105
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:35,410
So if you think of like your average apple is presumed to be safe, if it hasn't been contaminated with some type of toxin or toxic, it makes sense.

106
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:44,980
And that it permits the addition of substances for life to accomplish a specific technical

107
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:50,440
effect if it's determined to be what's called grass or generally recognized as safe.

108
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,399
So again, this is this idea of food additives.

109
00:11:54,400 --> 00:12:00,639
We're going to be adding something into the food to impart some kind of property onto the food and whatever is put in there.

110
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:07,570
We want to be generally recognized as safe. So again, like Whole Foods are like essentially thought of as grass by default.

111
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:15,129
So an apple not thought to be needing, we don't need to like take an apple through all these toxicity testing experiments.

112
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:18,180
Right. We're talking about like new stuff that we're going to be adding into the food.

113
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:29,730
And this is done, you know, via like scientific expert evaluation of these chemicals, you know, and looking at experimental toxicology data.

114
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:35,750
Um, and a lot of this is actually done by the food manufacturers themselves.

115
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:41,580
Like they can take a, uh, like a particular additive and like, look over their, like, internal toxicology data.

116
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:46,090
Um, and basically send this over to the FDA.

117
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:49,950
FDA can look at it and make their own evaluation.

118
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:54,059
And so there is this sort of like communication between like the manufacturer, right?

119
00:12:54,060 --> 00:13:01,080
The food manufacturers industry and like FDA in terms of evaluating these additives for toxicity, it's.

120
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:10,600
And so you are relying a little bit on sort of this honesty of like we're providing accurate toxicology data to the FDA.

121
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:17,950
So that's just something that kind of bear in mind this there's this kind of communication that occurs between industry and the government.

122
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:27,470
And then one thing that's like really big with this is that we need safety labeling to protect certain susceptible consumers.

123
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,899
Thinking about people with allergies. Right.

124
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:37,160
You'll see on certain types of food products like this was made in a plant that processes peanuts or something to that effect.

125
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:46,820
And this is to protect individuals like 3 to 4% of adults or 6% of young children that suffer from one type of food allergy or another.

126
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:56,640
So this is hopefully ideally addressing that susceptible population and allowing them to avoid things that may be triggering allergies.

127
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:01,490
Making sense so far. Cool.

128
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:06,590
Cool. As far as food additives go.

129
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:15,470
There are some good examples here in this table and like what they do and why we had them in or why the manufacturer will add them.

130
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,740
And so you have things like what are called anti caking agents.

131
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:26,210
It makes it basically makes the food easier to produce, keeps the stuff from like taking out the gumming up the works, so to speak.

132
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:33,110
So you add this to like finely powdered or crystal and food products to prevent them from like sticking together and clumping and stuff.

133
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:37,130
So here's some examples of food additives that are used for that purpose.

134
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:46,400
Antioxidants are introduced to help preserve foods or keep them from breaking down, keeping them more stable on the shelf for a longer period of time.

135
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:52,790
So this is used to preserve food by preventing deterioration or that going the food going rancid,

136
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:57,020
etc. and some examples of chemicals that are used for that process as well.

137
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:03,890
You have enzymes used to improve food processing and then flavor is another big one, right?

138
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:09,680
So we introduced certain chemicals to like either enhance flavor or as just a flavor agent.

139
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:14,450
So it helps to, you know, make the food more tasty or have a good smell.

140
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,640
And there are certain chemicals like thinking of cinnamon. I use cinnamon in my oatmeal a lot.

141
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:25,959
Right. But you know, other stuff as well. Non-nutritive sweeteners.

142
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:31,920
Again, this is in the taste area. So, you know, like aspartame, etc.

143
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:35,490
So these are the types of reasons why we add stuff to the food.

144
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:47,709
Another one is food coloring. Right. We there's occasionally you get like kind of uproar about like dyes that are in food.

145
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:51,970
In particular, you've seen public concern over dyes.

146
00:15:53,710 --> 00:16:02,080
Making children hyperactive is something you'll hear from time to time, like avoid yellow number five or what have you.

147
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:07,120
Um, I don't know if there's a ton of data underlying that.

148
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:15,580
So in any event, you know, the color food does influence the perception of taste.

149
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:23,350
Funnily enough, um, I've heard stories about like, for instance, again, going back to wine, like wine tasters.

150
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:29,020
If you die like a white wine. Like a like the color of a red wine bill.

151
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:33,010
Like taste. It'll be confused. I think it's actually a red wine.

152
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:37,930
Apparently, in some cases, it's not the best wine taster in that case.

153
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:44,590
But. So long story short, the visual perception of color does influence the way we taste food.

154
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:50,230
And this has been going on for a long time. You can trace food colorants back to like ancient Egypt.

155
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:57,520
In during the Industrial Revolution where you had this like huge kind of upheaval

156
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,730
in terms of like how many things were produced and food being one of them.

157
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:07,300
People were no longer as closely tied to the food, food production, the food that they ate.

158
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:18,940
So the this is where you saw the addition of like food, color, adulterants or like toxic chemicals for the use of color and food in some cases.

159
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:25,690
For example, copper arsenide was used to recall the tea leaves that had dried out and turned to brown.

160
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:29,490
And so you want to give them that nice green color for tea.

161
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:36,080
And so apparently some manufacturers like use like copper snake to like make the product look better.

162
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:40,210
And of course, we don't want to be consuming arsenic in our teeth.

163
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:51,140
So that was. A problem. So we have these nine certified colors that are synthetically produced for use in the United States.

164
00:17:52,490 --> 00:18:00,950
Uh, yeah. And so they're listed here like blue, green, red and yellow, and that's the study.

165
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:06,020
And see, so that's the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act that they're like certified under that act.

166
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:15,840
We also have naturally derived pigments from like plants like beet extract and stuff.

167
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:22,290
Certain types of plants have like really kind of rich colors that can be used for dyeing things and adding colors to foods.

168
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:27,909
This is a. In this table.

169
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:35,860
So you have this U.S. population estimated per capita estimated daily intake, so that GDI stands for some milligrams per person per day.

170
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:40,310
So this is of, you know, consuming of these different dyes.

171
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:46,940
And then these have these guys have gone through like this toxicity testing and regulators have developed this API.

172
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:52,310
Um, uh, where was the.

173
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:58,990
Oh, sorry. Yeah. Acceptable daily intake. So the API is the acceptable daily intake.

174
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:03,889
And so you could see like in general, if you recall,

175
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:10,219
the acceptable daily intake is the highest amount of like consumption of a

176
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:14,510
particular chemical that is thought to not produce some type of toxic effects.

177
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,890
Right. And so you want to be under that 80.

178
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:24,850
Anything above that you may be concerned about some kind of toxic damage or adverse health effects.

179
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:30,610
Right. And so you can see the comparison here in terms of the 85 milligrams per person per day.

180
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:41,710
Versus the estimated daily intake. And for the most part, individuals are thought to be consuming, you know, well below this idea.

181
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:49,290
But it's not like, you know, thousands and thousands of like or it's not like orders of magnitude less.

182
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:54,799
So you have like 1.72 versus 720 milligrams per person per day.

183
00:19:54,800 --> 00:20:02,690
So, you know, there's a there's not like a humongous orders of magnitude out there, like you see with certain chemicals where, you know,

184
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:10,219
people are exposed to like people grams of a chemical and the API is like in milligrams or something like we're kind of in that range.

185
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:15,680
So it's something to sort of keep an eye on and just understand it from that standpoint.

186
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:21,339
Okay. I thought I lost the slide, but, um. Okay.

187
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:24,530
So. Yeah.

188
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:31,719
So there's several things that we sort of. The go into the safety evaluation of a food additive.

189
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:38,020
And that's like so one of the things we think about like the purpose of a substance, why is it being put into the food?

190
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,740
What types of food is it going to be added to?

191
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:48,820
What is the concentration level used in these proposed foods and who's going to be expected to consume the substance?

192
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:53,290
Right. So there's going to be certain types of foods that are like, for instance,

193
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:59,470
not going to be consumed by, say, newborn babies or even early in early childhood.

194
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:08,860
And we also want to think about the population for a lot of foods is potentially going to be include people that may be allergic to,

195
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:16,330
say, peanuts, for example. So we just want to take that stuff into account when we're evaluating the when we're doing a safety evaluation.

196
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:25,820
So we're thinking about this like estimated daily intake.

197
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:30,379
We're thinking about the daily intake of the food in which the food additive

198
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:34,550
has been introduced and then the concentration of that chemical in the food.

199
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:41,570
Right. Pretty simple. How much of the food is someone predicted to be eaten and how much of the chemical is in that product?

200
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:48,480
So we want the regulators want evidence that the food additive is safe,

201
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:54,660
that we gleaned from toxicology testing that we've talked about and want to ensure that this EDI,

202
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:58,470
the estimated daily intake is less than the acceptable daily intake.

203
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:07,560
So the acceptable daily intake is kind of your highest threshold of like you want to be exposing or exposed to or in taking less of that chemical.

204
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:11,460
That's kind of like your red flag, that 80. Does that make sense?

205
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:15,480
So anything below that is thought to be safe, right?

206
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:23,860
Ideally, we want to be well below that, but anything below that is thought to be essentially free from toxic effects.

207
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:32,160
I'll just pause there for any questions or comments.

208
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:40,770
Does anyone sort of work in the space or have experience with like food regulation or anything like that?

209
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:55,330
Friends who worked at the FDA, they. And so regulators require evidence of the food, but the idea is less than the area.

210
00:22:55,340 --> 00:23:01,040
Is that saying that the idea in this food product nothing less than the API?

211
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:04,780
Or is there any consideration of like.

212
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:09,260
This product is part of a larger diet.

213
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:15,370
That's a good question of the cumulative risk, I think is kind of what you're getting at.

214
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:19,810
Yeah. Yeah. And that. Um, is not.

215
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:25,300
They're still kind of working on how to deal with that. I think is probably the best answer I can give.

216
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:27,690
I know that's kind of the case at EPA.

217
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:33,219
I'm just talking to my friend who works at EPA, and they're kind of like trying to figure out how do we know that,

218
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:37,990
like multiple chemicals can interfere with similar pathways and things like that.

219
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:41,650
So how do you assess the cumulative risk of exposure of multiple things?

220
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:47,620
I'm going to guess it's probably a very similar FDA, but I can't say that for sure.

221
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:52,959
I would I would want to talk to someone who works at FDA to be completely confident of that.

222
00:23:52,960 --> 00:24:01,810
But yeah, that's generally we're still kind of trying to understand the best ways to like feasibly do

223
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:07,830
like a risk assessment accounting for all of the various the exposures that we're exposed to,

224
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:15,310
right. So yeah, it's a challenge. Okay.

225
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:23,860
So if we're given a new chemical or a new potential food additive in terms of how we do the toxicity testing,

226
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:31,270
a lot of it is sort of based on the structure.

227
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:35,109
So like what the one thing we do is look at the molecular structure of a chemical.

228
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:38,229
And I don't know if I've talked about quantitative structure, activity,

229
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:45,549
relationships in very much depth so far, but the idea of quantitative structure, activity, relationships,

230
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:52,330
as we look at the molecular structure of a chemical and there are certain sort of

231
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:59,020
hallmarks of a lack of a molecule that we know are associated with certain types of toxic,

232
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:03,850
potentially concerning like molecular interactions. Like we know that like the pack size,

233
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:12,250
which is like this oxygen atoms sort of sticking out from a molecule can often be metabolized to a DNA damaging metabolite, for example.

234
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:20,170
So you would essentially do this evaluation and there's multiple like there's multiple

235
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:27,010
sort of hallmarks that we would be looking for in the sort of evaluation of a structure.

236
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:31,989
And so based on that initial screen,

237
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:39,850
we're going to compare to other chemicals that we know are toxic in one way or another and see if this chemical has any similarities to those.

238
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:47,950
And based on that analysis, we can slot a new chemical into one of three structure categories.

239
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:57,910
So we can structure category A, B and C, and these essentially go from like least concerning to most concerning as you move across these columns.

240
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:03,760
And so like if we just start with category A if.

241
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:08,070
So that's like sort of basically the least concerning category.

242
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:15,850
And if it's predicted that the average individual is going to be in taking a relatively low level of this chemical,

243
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:25,030
we're going to call that concern level one. Right. And so that chemical is going to be undergoing, you know, some toxicity tests,

244
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:30,220
but not the full battery of toxicity tests that we give a chemical that is more concerning.

245
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:38,020
So we're talking about like a short term genotoxicity test or sure, short term toxicant toxicity studies using rodents.

246
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:44,980
For example, if a chemical is if this chemical is in Category A,

247
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:50,080
but we predict that people are going to be taking a lot more of it or relatively more of it

248
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:55,630
then that bumps up the concern level for that chemical and puts it in concern level three,

249
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:04,720
where we're going to do a much fuller battery of toxicology studies such as metabolism and pharmacokinetic studies of some chronic studies,

250
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:13,000
some reproduction and like birth defects type of studies as like long term carcinogenicity studies.

251
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:22,419
Right. And then as you move up in the structure categories, essentially these are chemicals that we're more concerned about.

252
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:28,090
And the acceptable or the the sort of trigger amount of intake is going to be lower.

253
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:34,960
So if we think a chemical is has somewhat is somewhat concerning based on its structure,

254
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:43,150
we're going to tolerate like a lower amount of daily intake that would that would allow it to be put into concern level one.

255
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:52,540
Right. So we're basically yeah, basically that amount of intake that causes us concern is going to be lower for something that has a more sort of,

256
00:27:53,080 --> 00:28:01,390
uh, concerning structure as you know. And so something that's slotted in structure, category C, does that make sense?

257
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:10,699
You sort of have these two things, too. So you have your basic sort of structure and like inherent potential toxicity in that

258
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:14,840
chemical and then how much people are realistically going to be exposed to that chemical.

259
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:21,300
Both of those are going to go into deciding what types of toxicology studies are going to be conducted.

260
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:29,030
And then, of course, I was talking about the two extremes, but then you have like structure Category B and cancer level two,

261
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:33,620
which is something, you know, in the middle of the one and three makes sense.

262
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:49,090
All. So in addition to like food additives that we're adding because we want to impart some kind of property on the food,

263
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:54,640
we have these sort of indirect food additives that are not directly added to the food

264
00:28:55,030 --> 00:29:00,880
but arise from contact with like say surfaces during the production of the food.

265
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:08,920
So for example, things that like this, the packaging that the food is packaged in, phthalates is a chemical that's in a lot of plastic products.

266
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:13,239
So anything that's packaged in phthalates or sorry, packaged in plastic,

267
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:18,550
you could potentially get some leaching of phthalates into the food product cans.

268
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:28,030
The paper or paper sometimes are treated with certain chemicals that can bleed off into the food, the surfaces at the plant.

269
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:33,640
Right. So these sometimes you'll have food, it'll be like moving along like a conveyor belt.

270
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:40,990
And so is there something that's coming up from the substance of that's used to make that conveyor belt that may be ending up in the food?

271
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:49,989
So we kind of treat these in the same way as the food additives in that we basically are predicting how much people are

272
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:57,340
going to be exposed to this chemical that we know is going to end up in these foods via a particular food process.

273
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:03,999
Right. Of. And again, we're really kind of relying on and working with the manufacturers,

274
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,319
manufacturers to understand like how many how much phthalates can we expect to

275
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:13,300
be ending up in a particular product when it's packaged in a particular way?

276
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:22,270
Right. And so we want to essentially we're we're treating in a similar way where we think the acceptable daily intake of a family of phthalates,

277
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:29,680
when this product is produced or packaged in this type of material, is under that like acceptable daily intake.

278
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:35,380
This one is compared to the first example with food additives.

279
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:44,740
You know, maybe this is just an intuitive point, but this process is like less well characterized, I would say, than the food additive situation.

280
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:51,309
Because if you think about it like a manufacturer and knows how much they're putting their like purposefully putting it in to the product

281
00:30:51,310 --> 00:31:01,960
where this is sort of not a this is contamination that sort of results from the production process and it's not like a purposeful addition.

282
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:13,990
Does that make sense? So there is a lot of like research done into like how much phthalate does leach off of a particular type of product into food,

283
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:18,130
given a certain preparation process that's done right.

284
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:24,190
Like you'll see lots of things that are packaged in like plastic and then you microwave them at home.

285
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:29,250
There's a lot of, you know, how much of the phthalate from the plastic is coming out into the food.

286
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:34,210
There's a lot of papers that are published looking at the stuff and trying to characterize that stuff in a better way.

287
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:47,590
You also have supplements like dietary supplements you may have heard about, you know, how these are regulated or kind of not regulated in a way.

288
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:56,290
So these like dietary supplements are regarded as like foods are food constituents, not a food additive or like a drug.

289
00:31:57,070 --> 00:32:04,990
So the safety standard here is this concept of reasonable expectation of no harm as opposed to with food additives.

290
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:07,870
We want a reasonable certainty of no harm.

291
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:18,040
And so the idea there is that the supplement consumption is by choice versus like a food, you know, eating an apple or some other type of food stuff.

292
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:23,229
That's kind of in some ways not a choice. Whereas the supplement consumption is.

293
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:29,740
And so there's like a fair amount of issues with this sort of industry with, you know,

294
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:34,719
we've got studies coming out showing that certain things are labeled as one thing,

295
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:42,040
but they actually weren't the thing that was on the label mislabeling issues, just kind of lack of oversight in this industry.

296
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:48,820
So, you know, generally, generally we just seem to be like be very careful when approaching like supplements.

297
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:56,040
Does anyone have any thoughts or comments about that? It's a pretty big like area of commerce.

298
00:32:56,050 --> 00:33:00,550
So I'm curious if anyone has any good or bad experiences with this.

299
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:10,140
Any thoughts? I think it's a really interesting space in terms of regulation, especially like when you look at like workout supplements,

300
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:17,009
stuff where we've had ones like Wild Back and like she's had it for years and know like capping it is, you know, like open label.

301
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:24,870
One time it had a ton of weird random stuff and I remember looking into to her the quality control for the source of ingredients for vitamins.

302
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:32,339
And I mean, you go to like stores like GNC and it's all billed as like health stuff and you think of the old the same standards as medicine,

303
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:44,160
but it really is. And I'm curious if you see any stuff changing in that kind of space or honestly, probably not anytime soon.

304
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:51,840
If I had to make a guess, barring some kind of like really big portion or like really big like event,

305
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:57,330
you know, or something, you know, people get sick. Uh, I honestly don't.

306
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:06,330
Which means there'll be a lot of research to be done on, like, what is the, you know, what, what is the what are these products like?

307
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:11,760
What, how accurately are they labeled other? Is there a lot of contamination from other sources and things?

308
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:17,340
Um, you know, yeah, I think that's a really good point.

309
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:24,809
It's interesting, you know, certainly, um, they seem, they seem to benefit a lot of people.

310
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:30,510
So, you know, no judgment. It's like it is what it is. But that's just kind of the state of things at this point.

311
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:39,240
Yeah, I have to say, I know that, um, I think like Consumer Reports does a lot of testing and evaluation of like supplements and vitamins.

312
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:43,590
And I remember seeing that they found like, yeah, things.

313
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:53,190
Not things that are in the vitamins that are not being reported and also a lot of variation between batches from the same companies.

314
00:34:53,580 --> 00:35:00,780
But yeah, I think it's kind of interesting that it's. Like when it's not regulated, it falls on other organizations to do testing, but.

315
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,740
That's interesting. So you're seeing like.

316
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:10,979
Like it'll be like the same product ostensibly, but like different batches are kind of like different compositions.

317
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:15,570
There's like a lot of variation and variation. Yeah, that, that makes a lot of sense.

318
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:21,840
Yeah. Poor quality control. And the dosage isn't always what's actually reported because of that, right.

319
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:29,489
Yeah. Yeah. Dosage is a huge one. You know the dosage, if like the actual dosage is varying from batch to batch, that's, you know,

320
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:34,290
just because it's like natural doesn't mean it's not active or bioactive in one way or another.

321
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:38,100
So yeah, those are great points. Okay.

322
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:46,020
Question Yeah. Oh yeah. Are the same standards applied for things like herbal supplements and vitamins?

323
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:53,129
Because it seems like doctors prescribe certain vitamins like iron or like prenatal vitamins, like their medicine,

324
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:58,130
and like those things don't seem like they're as much of a choice as like herbal supplements.

325
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:02,219
Or is it the same standard food that's vitamins, too?

326
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:05,820
Or is it like different? That's a really good point.

327
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:10,080
And honestly I don't know if it may be a function of its.

328
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:14,930
That it's just easier to like, say, synthesize vitamin C.

329
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:20,870
And so it's there's kind of no sort of.

330
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:26,850
There's not as much like reason to have variability from batch to batch.

331
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:31,620
If you can just like synthesize a particular vitamin or whatever in the lab and it's just kind of

332
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:37,120
this reliable process where versus maybe some of these herbal supplements are going to be like.

333
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:44,250
And I'm just sort of speculating here, but like going to be driven by some of that variation I talked about in terms of like where it sourced from,

334
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:52,140
where that nervous is, is sort of being taken from it differences that like, say, soil chemistry or what have you or in the production process.

335
00:36:52,440 --> 00:37:00,810
Are there like other other herbs that are like making it into the overall mixture, if you will, that ends up as the final product?

336
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:08,220
So that would be my sort of speculative that there are certain things that are, even though they're maybe not tightly regulated, tightly regulated.

337
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:13,430
I really considered more reliable in a way.

338
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:20,010
I've been, you know, suggested things by my doctor that were not like go to the pharmacy and pick it up,

339
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:27,040
you know, like just go to Myers and pick up like a. Something for your stomach type of thing.

340
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:33,440
So yeah, I think that's a good example. I'd have to kind of go through the vitamins versus herbal supplementation is really interesting.

341
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,310
Yeah. And I'm sorry, I don't have a real direct answer for that.

342
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:41,360
That's a good question. I don't know. This is not really a direct answer to that.

343
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:48,649
But I, I think there are some sort of like third party certification schemes that like I've had doctors

344
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:53,719
recommend supplements and say like look for one that is certified by whatever organization.

345
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:59,090
And I, I think that that tends to be more for like vitamins, like things that would be recommended for doctors,

346
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:04,219
whereas like the herbal supplements might not have that like certain certification,

347
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:08,150
even though it's not government regulation, it's sort of like an industry regulation.

348
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:14,510
Thank you. That's a really good point. Yeah, there are third party, you know, certified products out there.

349
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:22,430
So I don't mean to say it's all just it's not all just the Wild West, although some parts of it feel kind of the Wild West at times.

350
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:24,950
That's a really good point, doctor. Sometimes.

351
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:34,999
Well, I believe for my newborn, they recommended a vitamin D supplement and she recommended like a specific brand of vitamin D supplements.

352
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,280
So those I think they're probably more like generally thought of as well-regarded.

353
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:47,000
So yeah, but yeah, that's a great point. Um, okay.

354
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,959
Another issue that's sort of been emerging for the past, I don't know.

355
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:57,630
It's been quite a while now. I feel like is this issue of genetically modified organisms.

356
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:07,230
So this idea, if you haven't heard of it, you know, you're introducing a gene in this to impart some kind of property to like a food product.

357
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:13,950
So you're adding one or more genes to plants and a lot of food that we consume has been genetically modified in one way or another.

358
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:26,550
And this is an example here of a tobacco plant that where they inserted a protein gene for like this, like fluorescent jellyfish protein.

359
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:31,830
And the plant, you know, you can see, makes this nice like bioluminescence.

360
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:43,080
So that's kind of cool. So the overall goal here for like genetic modification is the idea is that you would improve past in disease management.

361
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:47,010
You could like, you know, we talked for like Roundup Ready Crops, I believe. So you can spray them.

362
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:51,330
It's going to kill the other weeds, but not the crop that you're trying to grow.

363
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:55,230
And that's, you know, good. You can increase your yield of crops that way.

364
00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:02,759
Enhance nutrition. We've inserted genes that help to, like, boost the amount of vitamin A and.

365
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:08,910
Rice. Yeah, all types of things, increase shelf life, etc., etc.

366
00:40:09,330 --> 00:40:13,080
Even GMOs have been proposed to maybe help clean up pollution.

367
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:18,970
Right? I do feel the need to say that these are all really good goals.

368
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:25,810
But another goal for these companies is for a lot of these companies that are doing this is profit, right?

369
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:32,620
So I think it's important to talk about that end of it as well. They are trying to make a product kind of at the end of the day.

370
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:38,290
So they're ideally there's a lot of really nice public health benefit that would come from this.

371
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:45,080
But these are products that are being made and, you know, being the same as any other product in the in the world.

372
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:52,120
So I think that's an important thing to also bear in mind when we are sort of like evaluating these in a public health context.

373
00:40:55,900 --> 00:41:02,230
Yeah. And so with, you know, a new a new it's basically a new type of food that's being generated in some cases.

374
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:08,500
We want to know and we want to ensure that the levels of nutrients or toxicants in this new organism,

375
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:12,580
this genetically modified organism, still make it safe to consume.

376
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:15,879
Right. Kind of a no brainer. It's making a new protein.

377
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:19,660
We want to know that it's still safe. Um.

378
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:28,990
Yeah. And so, you know, we want to do studies and toxicology studies that show that this newly synthesized protein is nontoxic and non allergenic.

379
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:34,090
There was a statement a couple of years ago from the Society of Toxicology that kind of talked

380
00:41:34,090 --> 00:41:38,469
about the use of GMOs in food and kind of addressed because there's a lot of controversy,

381
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:43,420
as you probably are aware, to some degree in the as far as the use of GMOs.

382
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:47,350
And so society toxicology kind of weighed in, weighed in on this.

383
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:53,770
And they kind of dispelled some of the like the rumors about, you know, that, you know,

384
00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:59,800
that genetic modification is somehow inherently bad in and of itself and kind of said that's not really the case.

385
00:42:00,610 --> 00:42:07,300
Um, it's just a change. It can be a good change or it could be a change that could cause some kind of bad health effect, for example.

386
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:13,299
But what they did really kind of key in on in terms of an area of concern and like kind

387
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:19,930
of watch this space is this allergenic idea that if we're modifying plants or food,

388
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:27,640
you know, or foods contain a modified plant that has some kind of new protein that this could and that isn't usually there in that plant,

389
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:35,740
that this could lead to like cases of like causing allergic reactions, which can be really bad because someone's eating this, whatever it is.

390
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:40,569
This apple doesn't realize it's been genetically modified to produce some new protein that, you know,

391
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:45,310
the body just has a reaction to it and it could lead to death or some other really bad health outcome.

392
00:42:45,850 --> 00:42:52,030
So they really cheated on the allergen aspect of the sort of hazards that may be presented by GMOs.

393
00:42:54,400 --> 00:43:01,510
There's certainly other things you can bring into it, such as like we talked about the increasing use of like, say, glyphosate on Roundup Ready crops.

394
00:43:01,510 --> 00:43:05,649
So this is like a big area and there's a lot of, you know, we all build cover it all,

395
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:11,530
but there's certainly a lot of areas of controversy and contestation around tables.

396
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:21,580
Yeah. So these are regulated under the FCC. Another emerging issue is dental.

397
00:43:22,810 --> 00:43:30,370
So if you're not familiar with nanotechnology, it's just this idea of all types of products being made super,

398
00:43:30,370 --> 00:43:37,060
super, super small, like the nanoscale level of, like, carbon fiber nanotubes and things like that and.

399
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:46,660
The use of like nanotechnology in foods has been proposed for a number of different uses related to like improving agriculture yields,

400
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:48,640
processing of the foods,

401
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:57,850
um, you know, just different products and then, you know, maybe adding like nutritional aspects using these like nanotechnology based approaches.

402
00:43:58,330 --> 00:44:08,440
There's a nice review of this around communication related to like nano foods that's shown here that you can look into if you're interested.

403
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:13,690
FDA is not beyond developing specific guidelines for the testing of nano products.

404
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:18,760
This is like a unique space because there's, again, similar to GMOs.

405
00:44:19,330 --> 00:44:27,700
It's sort of like the possibilities are endless, which is like possibilities for benefit and also possibilities for like sort of, you know,

406
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:31,089
people can think of like really like nightmare scenarios of like adding some

407
00:44:31,090 --> 00:44:35,370
kind of technology that disrupts the food supply and has inadvertent effects.

408
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:43,660
So people's imaginations can kind of run wild with GMO or nanotechnology and not for bad reason.

409
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:46,090
It's a very powerful technology for a reason.

410
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:55,239
And so the thing is that these like nanoscale particles kind of behave differently than like a lot of standard things that we're evaluating.

411
00:44:55,240 --> 00:45:04,149
They have like different physicochemical properties. And what we worry about is that we the potential might exist for taking a food that is

412
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:09,729
safe and doing some kind of modification to it that makes it unsafe for whatever reason.

413
00:45:09,730 --> 00:45:15,760
And so that's something we have to keep an eye on. And again, this is an emerging issue that will probably come up in the future.

414
00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:23,590
So if you're more interested if you're interested in this area, I would direct you to this this publication here.

415
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:37,819
So carcinogenicity is always a big one. So there is this Delaney clause in the DNC that the secretary of the FDA shall not approved

416
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:44,180
for use in food any chemical additive found to induce cancer in man or in animals.

417
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:54,160
But as we've talked about, there are these kind of carve outs in some cases for like a lot of a lot of things actually.

418
00:45:54,170 --> 00:45:57,350
So like this does not apply to like unavoidable contaminant stuff.

419
00:45:57,350 --> 00:46:04,339
Like in making this chemical, there's a chemical additive that might be carcinogenic that's kind of seen as like unavoidable.

420
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:10,219
It's kind of an exception to this rule of the grass substances or ingredients

421
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:15,530
that are sanctioned by the FDA before 1958 were kind of like grandfathered in.

422
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:22,520
So there is like areas of like, again, like carve outs for the exception to these carcinogenic compounds.

423
00:46:27,270 --> 00:46:31,380
Is anyone from California or visited California?

424
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:37,080
Visit in California. Did you see those Prop 65 signs everywhere?

425
00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:42,870
Right. I remember going to California and going into like Starbucks and seeing like a Prop 65 or something.

426
00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:54,450
So this Prop 64, Proposition 65 in California requires like the labeling of certain types of products.

427
00:46:54,600 --> 00:47:00,090
Like I said, I saw it in like Starbucks because they're serving coffee. Coffee does have chemicals that are known to be carcinogenic.

428
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:07,530
And so the label says this product may contain a chemical known to the state of California to cause cancer,

429
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:10,380
or they also include birth defects or reproductive harm.

430
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:18,770
And so the state also publishes a list of chemicals known to cause cancer reproductive toxicity.

431
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,920
They sound like they have like a really hard core.

432
00:47:21,930 --> 00:47:25,850
Like basically California has its own EPA, right?

433
00:47:26,570 --> 00:47:34,610
So they do a lot of work. And so they've reviewed a lot of chemicals that are like going on this Prop 65 list that need to be labeled.

434
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:39,870
Um, there's anyone who has seen the Prop 65 signs.

435
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:43,970
Can you talk about maybe some of the drawbacks to this method of.

436
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:49,509
Risk communication, if you will, center on every product and every place.

437
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:56,680
So people just overlook it and ignore it. Yeah, that I wrote here that so they're basically up all over the place.

438
00:47:57,070 --> 00:48:03,639
Like if you're staying in a hotel that's like near a, like a, like a parking structure,

439
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:07,930
they'll put it up because you might be getting some of the exhaust from the parking structure.

440
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:11,590
It's in like a Starbucks. They're just all over the place.

441
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:15,550
And so the criticism is that it kind of dilutes the message a little bit.

442
00:48:15,790 --> 00:48:17,660
It's sort of like if you're labeling everything,

443
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:24,280
you're labeling nothing because it just sort of the idea is that it would just become part of the background because if you really get down to it,

444
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:27,760
there's a lot of stuff that that is carcinogenic.

445
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:32,740
But again, I hope one of the main points you take from this class is the dose makes the poison.

446
00:48:33,930 --> 00:48:40,150
You know, not everything is the same level of level of potency in terms of carcinogenicity.

447
00:48:40,810 --> 00:48:48,400
Um, the dose is really important to consider and I think someone else were raising oh yeah.

448
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:54,400
I was just going to say that it also makes some companies not want to sell their stuff in California.

449
00:48:55,090 --> 00:48:59,640
Like the other day I was at the library and I got a bag of chips and it said Not for sale in California alone.

450
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:04,460
And like I looked into it and I guess it's like because the acrylamide in chips or something like that.

451
00:49:05,290 --> 00:49:09,730
So I just thought that was funny. Yeah. Yeah, it could have economic impacts as well.

452
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:11,920
Yeah, that's a really good point.

453
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:23,760
So this is, I think the problem 65 thing has been met with like sort of mixed reviews in terms of the utility for risk assessment.

454
00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:32,860
Um, yeah. So they kind of like a little bit more stringent in terms of what they consider like a carcinogenic, right?

455
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:37,959
So this is expected to lead to one extra case of cancer in 100,000 people over 70 years of consumption.

456
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:42,880
That's like pretty stringent in terms of like what we're going to call a carcinogen in some ways.

457
00:49:43,550 --> 00:49:47,650
Um, like in terms of like what will label as a carcinogen rather.

458
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:53,560
Like on a product. So then, yeah, the other thing,

459
00:49:53,560 --> 00:50:00,129
the other like final sort of criticism that's talked about is the manufacturers don't need to disclose what chemicals they are.

460
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:04,590
They just put the warning up. So that makes it a little bit harder.

461
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:10,690
You know, when you think about, you know, the amount of information that a consumer has, like, okay, peanut butter it contains.

462
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:14,050
I'm not saying it does, but, you know, if you see like a, you know,

463
00:50:14,530 --> 00:50:17,919
a container of peanut butter, it just says this has a chemical that's known to cause cancer.

464
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:21,909
It's like, well, what is the chemical? What is the concentration of the chemical?

465
00:50:21,910 --> 00:50:25,120
You may have a lot of extra questions to follow that up with.

466
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:32,680
And so another criticism would be that it's not giving consumers enough information or at least enough specific information.

467
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:42,730
So for those of you that may go on to be involved in one way or another, the process of like risk communication in terms of environmental hazards,

468
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:48,040
this is a nice kind of case study to think about in terms of are there ways to improve this?

469
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:51,339
You know, overall, is this a good thing? Do we need more of this kind of stuff?

470
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:54,999
You know, I think it's going to be you know, there's there's a lot to talk about there.

471
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,610
So. Yeah.

472
00:50:58,630 --> 00:51:05,150
So then we have, of course, food allergies. This is the immune mediated response where something is activating someone's innate system.

473
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:10,490
Um, like, sort of apparently we can have, like, um, yeah,

474
00:51:10,490 --> 00:51:17,600
any protein in the food could potentially cause an allergic reaction in a lot of our foods obviously have protein in them.

475
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:24,020
So you can have like skin, like cutaneous dermatitis, you know,

476
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:29,150
exposure that leading to like rashes and things gastrointestinal like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,

477
00:51:29,690 --> 00:51:36,229
respiratory either respiratory issues, asthma, wheezing, and then other types of effects,

478
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:41,389
anaphylactic shock, hypotension, swelling of the tongue, etc.

479
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:51,620
So this is why it's important that we include, you know, these warnings about allergies for for those individuals that are susceptible.

480
00:51:55,150 --> 00:51:59,410
Another thing to think about, we talked about this a little bit is food.

481
00:51:59,410 --> 00:52:04,420
Drug interactions are like basically food. Metabolic enzyme interactions.

482
00:52:04,930 --> 00:52:10,210
We talked about how like certain enzymes are like induced by dietary factors.

483
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:19,930
Specifically, I believe we mentioned that grapefruit juice can induce some of these cytochrome p450, which are the main class of metabolizing enzymes.

484
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:28,660
They can metabolize chemicals too, like toxic metabolite intermediates or detoxifying chemicals depending.

485
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:37,660
And so if you're taking like say a some kind of medication that is metabolized by this chemical, you're going to want to understand how,

486
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:44,500
like your consumption of grapefruit juice, for example, is going to interact with this particular medication that you're using.

487
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:47,379
There's other stuff to include in the diet,

488
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:54,970
like vegetables can like certain types of cruciferous vegetables can induce enzymes expression of these enzymes.

489
00:52:56,440 --> 00:53:05,680
It's like you sip one it two. Here's an example cyp3a4 and then some of our get a AGC is are induced by various like

490
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:12,160
fruits and vegetables and then you have drug examples as well for each of these categories.

491
00:53:13,010 --> 00:53:23,680
Right. So. Both food and drugs have pretty powerful interactions with like our metabolic enzymes system.

492
00:53:27,430 --> 00:53:36,270
Okay. Any questions? We're good people talking about toxicants in food.

493
00:53:37,310 --> 00:53:46,460
Um, this is kind of a global issue with like naturally occurring toxicants can end up in,

494
00:53:47,210 --> 00:53:54,890
in various crops like for example, in areas with like around the globe with like zinc mining, uh, processes,

495
00:53:54,890 --> 00:53:58,490
there could be like contamination that results from the mining operations where

496
00:53:58,730 --> 00:54:04,040
they get a release of cadmium into the environment and like rice crops can uptake

497
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:11,270
cadmium and then accumulate in the rice grain leading to contaminated rice and

498
00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:16,079
the population eating the contaminated rice with contaminated with cadmium.

499
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:24,710
There's a number of toxic health effects that can arise from that related to like bone development and liver and kidney toxicity.

500
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:32,720
Right. So we have these like naturally occurring metals, um, that, you know, in this case with the mining,

501
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:38,900
we're doing something to the environment that's leading to the naturally occurring metal ending up in the food supply.

502
00:54:43,950 --> 00:54:49,499
And then there are byproducts of cooking. So cooking is a, you know, something to think about.

503
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:58,290
We're chemically changing the food and we cook. And so there's these, like heterocyclic amines that arise from like the heat, from cooking changes,

504
00:54:58,290 --> 00:55:04,590
like the proteins in the meat into these like carcinogenic heterocyclic amines.

505
00:55:05,130 --> 00:55:08,220
Right. Which is a real bummer for anyone that likes the taste of grilled meat.

506
00:55:09,030 --> 00:55:13,380
There's a lot of, you know, carcinogens are formed from that process.

507
00:55:14,970 --> 00:55:24,360
Anything else on this slide. This is just some examples of the amount of these various means and like different cooked meat products.

508
00:55:26,550 --> 00:55:30,840
And I believe W.H.O. has even weighed in on this and saying like this is a carcinogen.

509
00:55:31,710 --> 00:55:38,550
You know, again, kind of a bummer for anyone that likes the taste of this, which would be the equivalent.

510
00:55:39,530 --> 00:55:41,240
Uh, yeah.

511
00:55:41,290 --> 00:55:52,099
And these are just some examples of an analysis of, uh, let's see, this is a meat mutagen and colorectal cancer in this like nurses health study.

512
00:55:52,100 --> 00:56:00,770
So they were looking at individuals that were consuming different levels of like meat, looking at this as maybe kind of a hard table to see.

513
00:56:00,770 --> 00:56:04,140
But you can look at the PowerPoint and blow it up if you want,

514
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:09,350
but you can see different like increasing odds ratios or increasing risk for developing

515
00:56:09,350 --> 00:56:14,840
colorectal cancer for individuals that consume different amounts of cooked meat.

516
00:56:15,770 --> 00:56:21,890
And I think they linked it to individual like types of mutagenic compounds that are in each of the meat products.

517
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:30,290
So pretty, pretty cool study. I would, you know, if you're interested in this area, I would definitely suggest checking out this, um, this paper.

518
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:38,870
So we you know, this is a case where we know kind of from the molecular end of things that these are like DNA damaging and like,

519
00:56:39,110 --> 00:56:47,220
you know, activate certain carcinogenic pathways. And then we also see this outcome coming from the epidemiology side of things, too.

520
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:51,010
So we have kind of both components of that, which makes for pretty poor.

521
00:56:52,680 --> 00:57:04,090
Pretty convincing set up evidence, right? We talked about acrylamide talked about how back in the repro developmental toxicology lecture,

522
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:09,430
the rats that were given acrylamide had this malformed sperm.

523
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:18,420
And someone asked where the coal mine comes from. As I think someone mentioned today, acrylamide is also a probable human carcinogen.

524
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:27,600
When you see the list of cancers but it's formed again really big bomber here form during high temperature cooking and vegetables particularly when

525
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:38,650
you fried potatoes is first identified in food in 2002 and you see the chemical reaction that produces acrylamide here from glucose and disparaging.

526
00:57:40,770 --> 00:57:49,530
And yeah, so we seen reproductive as well as carcinogenic toxicity associated with acrylamide exposure.

527
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:55,050
So that's kind of a bummer as well. If again, you like fried potatoes, like I do.

528
00:57:56,110 --> 00:58:00,379
Any thoughts? Questions. I just have a question.

529
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:05,750
I don't know if you can answer it, but is it just just frying or is it any sort of high temp cooking?

530
00:58:06,170 --> 00:58:11,560
That's a good question. I'm pretty sure it's the it's the temperature that's the biggest sort of contributor there.

531
00:58:11,570 --> 00:58:17,720
I don't think you can I sort thought about trust me, I thought about this like it's a way to get out of it by cooking a different way.

532
00:58:17,990 --> 00:58:23,960
I don't I don't think that's the case. I don't think there's like a chemical constituent in the grease per se.

533
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:28,720
So that's the high temperature. I just have to double check for sure.

534
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:34,440
I'm pretty sure it's the temperature issue. Okay.

535
00:58:34,770 --> 00:58:46,010
Any other thoughts? Other byproducts of cooking can come from like the the pans and stuff that we use to cook our foods.

536
00:58:46,030 --> 00:58:51,040
You may have heard of p, phos or polyfluoroalkyl substances.

537
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:58,480
So this is like the basic structure of a people. They have all these like fluorine atoms attached to them with this long backbone.

538
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:03,580
They're used a in a variety of products. They help with like nonstick pans.

539
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:09,490
We detect them in like almost everyone in the US because they're like very bio persistent.

540
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:18,639
They have a high affinity for like fatty tissues, very lipophilic estimated half life is like 30 years in people.

541
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:24,370
So that's not a really fun thing to think about as having a chemical sticking around for that long in our bodies.

542
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:35,440
And exposure is associated with again, just a list of ugly stuff like kidney cancer, thyroid disease, pregnancy induced hypertension.

543
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:43,090
And DuPont apparently knew it was a carcinogen like a long time ago, but it wasn't phased out until 2013.

544
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:50,680
So there's a lot of outrage over previous contamination in multiple parts of the country,

545
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:58,450
including in Michigan, not just centered on DuPont specifically, but it's popped up in a number of places.

546
00:59:58,750 --> 01:00:04,030
And people a lot of people are angry with the regulators that were supposed to be on top of this type of stuff.

547
01:00:04,030 --> 01:00:09,399
And it's just a it's an ongoing issue, to say the least.

548
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:13,459
So any thoughts on that? Comments.

549
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:23,190
Questions. They're trying to come out they're coming out with like alternatives to the P fast that were contaminating different areas now similar

550
01:00:23,190 --> 01:00:30,210
to the phthalates where oh you know we've made a lot of this phthalate that seems to be associated with certain toxicological endpoints.

551
01:00:30,510 --> 01:00:31,740
Let's make a replacement.

552
01:00:32,310 --> 01:00:40,530
Same thing with this bisphenol A, phenol s, it's that same kind of you see the same story play out where they're trying to come up with replacements.

553
01:00:41,190 --> 01:00:48,590
I saw a really good study that tried to quantify the amount of loss in like a glass coated pan and if there was like a crack in it and like,

554
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:54,780
they found that like one tiny, like, like a visible piece would have like a ton of deposited.

555
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:59,190
And so there's a lot of interesting research being done quantifying exposure and other things.

556
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:05,790
I can't imagine how many bottled hands that P foster I was reading about crackpots that have let in it too.

557
01:01:05,790 --> 01:01:09,210
And we'll actually talk about that a little bit here.

558
01:01:09,220 --> 01:01:17,280
A similar thing. But yeah, yeah, it's it's really something I'm just going to mention.

559
01:01:17,430 --> 01:01:19,860
We talked about phthalates in food packaging,

560
01:01:19,860 --> 01:01:26,790
but there's also been a lot of people in food packaging and a lot of laws changing in states to move toward getting rid of it.

561
01:01:26,790 --> 01:01:29,640
And like fast food packaging especially and stuff like that. Oh yeah, yeah.

562
01:01:30,540 --> 01:01:35,730
That's food packaging is is a big I think we'll have an example of that with phthalates, but it probably pitfalls as well.

563
01:01:35,740 --> 01:01:40,290
I feel like I've seen studies like staining gris resistant, water resistant, stuff like that.

564
01:01:40,290 --> 01:01:49,290
What you said, right? Right, right. Yeah. So it imparts this like water resistant, grease resistant type of property to like they use it on boots.

565
01:01:49,290 --> 01:01:52,979
I believe so, yeah.

566
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:56,280
But those same properties are, you know, what makes it very toxic.

567
01:01:56,280 --> 01:02:01,019
So we're sort like better bio accumulative. Yeah.

568
01:02:01,020 --> 01:02:10,370
Yeah. Thank you. So there are groups like the Environmental Working Group that puts out like these lists they go through.

569
01:02:11,630 --> 01:02:14,390
It's pretty cool how they publish some of these studies where they go through and

570
01:02:14,540 --> 01:02:20,839
review the data on certain types of like products that you get at the store,

571
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:29,510
like produce or whatnot, that have levels where people have like measured the level of pesticide residue that's like on a strawberry, for example.

572
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:35,210
And so for those that might be wanting to decrease their overall exposure to pesticides,

573
01:02:35,210 --> 01:02:43,590
you could potentially look across like do it yourself if you want to like dig into the data and sort of come up with your own list of produce.

574
01:02:43,850 --> 01:02:50,749
So I'm here, they have a list of what they call Dirty 12 or produce that generally has a lot of relatively

575
01:02:50,750 --> 01:02:54,830
high levels of pesticide residue versus the types of produce that have relatively low levels.

576
01:02:55,010 --> 01:02:57,829
So you can maybe, you know,

577
01:02:57,830 --> 01:03:05,660
in terms of it empowering yourself to be able to lower your levels of exposure you could you don't have to necessarily rely on

578
01:03:06,170 --> 01:03:14,270
EWG is list you could look into this and see if there's a way that you can change your dietary habits to reduce your exposures.

579
01:03:16,870 --> 01:03:22,690
Yeah. Any thoughts there? I think they update it like every year.

580
01:03:22,850 --> 01:03:27,420
Okay. Or at least somewhat periodically. But yeah, so that's kind of cool.

581
01:03:27,430 --> 01:03:28,540
You know, there are these like, you know,

582
01:03:28,540 --> 01:03:35,980
these groups that like try to help people navigate their way if they want to reduce their exposure, which is that's a good thing, I think.

583
01:03:36,930 --> 01:03:40,600
Um. Let's see.

584
01:03:42,570 --> 01:03:45,210
Yeah. It looks like in this case, they're like relying on USDA data.

585
01:03:45,330 --> 01:03:51,600
So if you want to, you know, double check their list and see if it you know, if they're using the data accurately, you can go ahead and do that.

586
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:54,550
So I think that's a good thing. Um.

587
01:03:55,890 --> 01:04:02,130
Again, you know, this is just kind of going through and disrupting chemicals in like food, contact materials, like cans.

588
01:04:02,550 --> 01:04:13,710
Think about bisphenol A, used in like water bottles. And again, like BPA is associated with, like, reproductive outcomes and like toxicology studies.

589
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:22,559
Um, how translatable that is to like the relevant exposures that we're seeing in humans is maybe something that isn't 100% clear,

590
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:28,140
but it's certainly an alarming sort of this is like hyper plastic ducks.

591
01:04:28,170 --> 01:04:29,850
Not sure exactly what all these are.

592
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:39,120
Yeah, but anyway, these are just like different impacts of, like, the mammary glands of oyster rats that were exposed to this phenol.

593
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:42,800
So obviously, that's a concern in terms of.

594
01:04:44,010 --> 01:04:48,430
BPA leaching out into food and drink materials.

595
01:04:48,450 --> 01:04:52,859
Right. Yeah. And then we have these replacements that are coming out like bisphenol A surplus, you know,

596
01:04:52,860 --> 01:04:58,319
F when they're trying to, you know, replace it with something that's ideally less toxic.

597
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:02,170
But you'll see studies that show that Bisphenol Acid has been okay, at least for some,

598
01:05:02,170 --> 01:05:06,930
and points appear to be about the same potency for a particular end point.

599
01:05:06,940 --> 01:05:10,299
So. Satellites.

600
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:16,430
Again, we were just talking about phthalates, these chemicals that are used as plasticizers a lot.

601
01:05:16,450 --> 01:05:21,729
So anything that might be traveling through a tube or if the food handlers are using like plastic gloves,

602
01:05:21,730 --> 01:05:25,210
you might get some transference of phthalates into the final product.

603
01:05:25,690 --> 01:05:31,050
Some of these conveyor belts might have phthalates in them. Um, yeah.

604
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:36,910
So there's been a lot of work like quantifying solid concentrations, like due to dietary exposures.

605
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:42,180
There's also this is an example of a like. So DHP was a big one.

606
01:05:42,190 --> 01:05:45,910
The DI ethyl hazel phthalate was like causing a lot of concern.

607
01:05:46,270 --> 01:05:56,530
It was found in a lot of products. And so there are there's been an effort to replace DHP with other types of phthalates like DI or DI BP.

608
01:05:56,590 --> 01:06:01,030
BP di iso futile phthalate. Um, yeah.

609
01:06:01,030 --> 01:06:04,900
So again, same stories of bisphenol A, trying to replace it with another chemical.

610
01:06:06,030 --> 01:06:11,360
That may or may not also be toxic. Um.

611
01:06:11,990 --> 01:06:15,910
What do we got here? Oh, yeah.

612
01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:24,709
So. And someone I think someone already hit on this the we see like with individuals eating like higher amounts of

613
01:06:24,710 --> 01:06:34,190
fast food in some cases like higher levels of exposure apparently to like things like phthalates or bisphenol A.

614
01:06:34,220 --> 01:06:42,110
So you have like this is a valid DNP and this is like levels of urine if you believe in blood.

615
01:06:42,590 --> 01:06:50,450
And so the people in the study were broken up by levels of consumption of like fast foods.

616
01:06:50,870 --> 01:06:59,840
And so you see you saw like higher levels of on average of like these phthalates and individuals consuming higher levels of fast food.

617
01:07:00,950 --> 01:07:04,540
And so this is, you know, in terms of exposure to these chemicals, you know,

618
01:07:04,700 --> 01:07:09,889
you may have something of an environmental justice issue here as some people are living in,

619
01:07:09,890 --> 01:07:18,820
say, like food deserts, where they don't have a lot of access to like the cheap calories that are provided by a fast food meal.

620
01:07:18,830 --> 01:07:24,649
Right. And so you may have some issues there in terms of certain parts of the country,

621
01:07:24,650 --> 01:07:31,640
certain populations being exposed to relatively higher levels of some of these chemicals that are contaminants in fast food products.

622
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:38,270
Like this one is listed under Prop 65. So there you go.

623
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:48,900
Lead in pottery is an issue. So in some like in creating parts like lead is used in the glazing.

624
01:07:49,860 --> 01:07:54,630
So you get like heavy metals. Certain types of heavy metals can give pottery this like glazed look.

625
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:58,890
And it's traditionally used in, like Latin American and Asian countries.

626
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:04,120
And then if if you're cooking at high temperatures or cooking highly acidic foods

627
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:08,910
that can lead to like the lead leaching out from these like pottery glazes.

628
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:14,940
So this could be also be an occupational hazard for those that are making the pot or the pots as well.

629
01:08:16,030 --> 01:08:23,989
Um. Yeah. So you have just some examples of some studies like use of blood glazed pottery was the most important of all questionnaire

630
01:08:23,990 --> 01:08:32,000
items that were predictive of blood lead levels and like a three fold increase in odds of like high blood glucose levels.

631
01:08:37,140 --> 01:08:42,180
Dr. Justin Colosimo, who is in our department, did.

632
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:53,680
His Master's study, basically measuring levels of toxicants in various food products, and they saw some kind of surprising results.

633
01:08:54,700 --> 01:08:56,919
Some of this got picked up by like the broader media,

634
01:08:56,920 --> 01:09:02,590
like they published some of those studies like it like Scientific American, CNN and The Huffington Post.

635
01:09:04,450 --> 01:09:08,679
So they just they just went out to like local grocery stores and just essentially,

636
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:13,510
like measured levels of different chemicals in these different products.

637
01:09:14,140 --> 01:09:17,560
And this was really striking. Apparently, they saw one stick of butter there.

638
01:09:17,770 --> 01:09:22,300
I think it was like combined for like several different brands,

639
01:09:22,690 --> 01:09:29,830
but it was like something like 1% of the butter body, I believe goes by volume or materials by probably by mass.

640
01:09:30,190 --> 01:09:34,840
Was this pretty flame retardant chemical that.

641
01:09:35,830 --> 01:09:41,680
Yeah, which is a lot of this contaminant ending up in the butter.

642
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:51,010
PBDEs are chemicals that are associated with similar to like phthalates and multiple other chemicals, endocrine disruptors, among other things.

643
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:54,190
So that was like pretty shocking.

644
01:09:55,550 --> 01:10:03,700
There is a question of like where how this PPD would have like ended up in the butter like was it the cows were contaminated,

645
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:09,909
was it in the production process? Was it during transport that it somehow became contaminated?

646
01:10:09,910 --> 01:10:17,059
So that's a nice detective story that someone, if you're interested in that type of work might be,

647
01:10:17,060 --> 01:10:22,390
you know, assigned to understanding, like, what the heck happened? How did all this contamination get into this food?

648
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:28,749
If you want more details that I don't know, like butcher, Justin's research, technical sales manager research.

649
01:10:28,750 --> 01:10:34,569
But if you want more details, I'm sure be happy to talk about it with you. This is more so.

650
01:10:34,570 --> 01:10:36,640
This is Sam on this paper, just in class.

651
01:10:36,650 --> 01:10:44,500
You know, they're seeing like these PBDEs and other chemicals in like composite food samples from like the local area they were in.

652
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:49,730
And so you could see like different levels. Of these different chemicals.

653
01:10:50,390 --> 01:10:56,000
And like these, they estimated the amount of the chemicals that would be like estimated to be consumed per day, per chemical.

654
01:10:56,120 --> 01:11:01,450
So. Pretty interesting. Similar here.

655
01:11:03,550 --> 01:11:10,240
Just looking at levels of the chemicals in food products. Aflatoxin is a big one.

656
01:11:11,740 --> 01:11:15,040
So now we look to from toxicants to toxins.

657
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:25,720
So toxins are remember are things that are produced by animals or like plants that are poisonous or toxic.

658
01:11:26,110 --> 01:11:35,890
So there's a type of mold that produces aflatoxin and this mold can contaminate crops like corn, nuts, wheat, rice.

659
01:11:36,610 --> 01:11:40,300
Um, and it could get into the food system through like animal feed as well.

660
01:11:41,050 --> 01:11:46,960
This is a super potent carcinogen. It's one of the most potent carcinogens we've identified.

661
01:11:47,590 --> 01:11:53,709
It was first identified in England when a bunch of turkeys were essentially poisoned with alcohol

662
01:11:53,710 --> 01:12:01,300
toxin from like the feed was contaminated with this mold and ended up getting into the turkeys.

663
01:12:04,230 --> 01:12:10,560
And so we have here the so appetites and needs to be metabolized to its carcinogenic metabolite.

664
01:12:10,860 --> 01:12:20,520
It's metabolized in the liver to this like, you know, the compound aflatoxins have one and you kind of can walk through the.

665
01:12:21,650 --> 01:12:34,880
The metabolic pathway here. So this is kind of the global distribution of aflatoxin related liver cancer cases.

666
01:12:35,030 --> 01:12:40,850
So you can see how in some areas of the world, there's a relatively higher burden of this type of disease.

667
01:12:44,290 --> 01:12:51,099
This is an interesting case where these researchers looked at aflatoxin exposure and how it sort

668
01:12:51,100 --> 01:13:00,339
of interacted with hepatitis status like disease of the liver and I believe like like a mutation,

669
01:13:00,340 --> 01:13:08,590
like a polymorphism on the p53 gene, which is an oncogene that can make one more susceptible to cancer.

670
01:13:09,250 --> 01:13:19,240
And so what they did was they estimated aflatoxin exposure by breaking people into their levels of intake of groundnuts.

671
01:13:19,270 --> 01:13:24,489
So you have low, moderate or high. The assumption there is that like a high consumption of groundnuts is going to

672
01:13:24,490 --> 01:13:28,300
lead to like higher levels of aflatoxin because of this contaminant being around.

673
01:13:30,220 --> 01:13:42,640
And they looked at so with like high levels of consumption of the of the groundnuts, they saw like an increased risk for cirrhosis of the liver.

674
01:13:43,090 --> 01:13:47,079
And then with this mutation on this cancer gene, again,

675
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:54,430
they saw like for those that had the mutation in the cancer gene, there was, again, a higher risk.

676
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:59,950
So the odds ratio being like of close to four compared to those without the mutation.

677
01:13:59,950 --> 01:14:03,010
So higher odds of developing cirrhosis than those that didn't.

678
01:14:03,610 --> 01:14:13,840
And then they did a combination and broke people out by having the hepatitis B like antibody and then higher low intake of groundnuts.

679
01:14:14,380 --> 01:14:19,330
It were basically comparing those that had the yeah, I think it was hepatitis B.

680
01:14:19,330 --> 01:14:29,830
So like hepatitis B like high consumption of groundnuts, so or higher exposure to aflatoxin and then also hepatitis B and the P53 mutation.

681
01:14:29,830 --> 01:14:33,310
And you can kind of just walk through where like if you have.

682
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:40,050
HP Hepatitis B present in a high intake of groundnuts.

683
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:50,760
Your odds of developing cirrhosis when went up by like almost 30 fold versus like the and similarly for like hepatitis plus

684
01:14:51,390 --> 01:15:00,150
the gene mutation your odds of developing cirrhosis compared to like the control group was like almost 50 fold higher.

685
01:15:00,330 --> 01:15:08,459
Right. So you can see how these different factors can kind of really impart a lot of risk on certain people that may be

686
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:17,640
consuming these like contaminated foods and have a particular genotype or like underlying health conditions.

687
01:15:18,710 --> 01:15:23,000
Makes sense. Okay.

688
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:26,329
I think we're going to be done there. I'll wrap this up.

689
01:15:26,330 --> 01:15:29,670
We'll have a few more. Yeah.

690
01:15:29,700 --> 01:15:33,660
Just a few more. Well, I'll just wrap this up when we come back.

691
01:15:34,020 --> 01:15:40,140
If that's okay. That makes sense. We're we're about at 1120, so feel like 5 minutes, I guess.

692
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:45,090
Yeah. I'll just wrap this up when we get back and.

693
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:49,340
Leave it there for any questions or comments for the last 5 minutes.

694
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:55,310
Otherwise, you are free to go and just remember to take your exam on Wednesday.

695
01:15:57,230 --> 01:16:01,190
Anything else? And then let me know if there's any. Well, you don't have to take your exam on Wednesday.

696
01:16:01,190 --> 01:16:05,839
The exam opens on Wednesday. Pardon me? Exam opens on Wednesday.

697
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:09,950
Is open for a week. You have 24 hours once you open it to take it.

698
01:16:11,260 --> 01:16:15,670
Does it cover up through this cluster? Yeah, we'll cover up through everything we've covered today.

699
01:16:15,700 --> 01:16:19,750
So any slides I didn't get to today, don't worry about.

700
01:16:21,930 --> 01:16:26,510
Any questions about either the paper or the exam? Yeah.

701
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:30,250
Press on when they raise. Uh, so.

702
01:16:30,540 --> 01:16:35,610
Just. Just as we're not into Thanksgiving. Not Thanksgiving yet, so.

703
01:16:35,790 --> 01:16:41,460
Yeah. Yeah, we'll have. Yeah. So no class Wednesday because of Monday.

704
01:16:44,070 --> 01:16:44,550
Thank you.
