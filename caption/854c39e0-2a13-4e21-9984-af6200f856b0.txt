1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,969
Anything like that. Just make an appointment with me.

2
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:09,640
So. Yeah. Last office hours today and final papers on Wednesday.

3
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:13,840
That's about it. And if you can do the course evaluations, that would be great.

4
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:21,260
Any questions before we jump into today's material?

5
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:30,890
Okay. So today we just double check that we're recording.

6
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:41,320
Today we're going to finish up the risk communication section and then jump into some regulatory toxicology

7
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:48,580
to see how we use some of the data that we generate in toxicology studies in like a regulatory context.

8
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:57,670
And the final sort of topic we cover is going to be you'll notice that over as we're talking about the regulatory portion,

9
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:06,310
there is a there'll be a lot of sort of like gaps and you'll see sort of areas where we can improve and where we're kind of,

10
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:12,129
you know, we have the pace that we're going in terms of the chemicals that we're trying to evaluate from a

11
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:19,000
regulatory standpoint is sort of really kind of outpacing our ability to evaluate all these chemicals.

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,620
And so you'll see some of these gaps.

13
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:27,279
And we're going to talk about ways that we're trying to push the field forward so that we can fill in some of those gaps and address safety issues,

14
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:33,130
whether it be with pesticides or other types of chemicals in a better way and more efficient way.

15
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:41,970
So yeah. So just finishing up, I think this is the slide we landed on with risk communication.

16
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:46,259
So we talked about how media triggers in risk communication,

17
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:54,209
like what's going to trigger like a really big media response and get a lot of attention in the media related to like an environmental health concern.

18
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:58,860
And you can think about what these might be, I think fairly intuitive for the most part.

19
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:06,749
So, you know, if we have someone to blame for like an environmental disaster or environmental contamination,

20
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:11,399
then that tends to sort of construct a nice story for the media in terms of talking,

21
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:17,310
you know, writing an article, you know, if you have heroes and villains, so to speak.

22
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:23,210
Any secrets? An attempted cover ups. Who doesn't like to hear about those?

23
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,450
That could be an issue.

24
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:36,589
Again, like human interest, identifiable heroes, villains, victims, etc. Anything that makes a good like classical type of story is going to get.

25
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,720
It tends to get a lot of media attention.

26
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:49,100
You get high profile people sometimes coming in and talking about whether they be like actors or other celebrities,

27
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:55,340
you know, may come in and comment on something. I'm forgetting the actor's name, but I think he's been pretty big with.

28
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,159
I want to say Pee Fosse. I'm totally blanking on his name.

29
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:05,040
But anyway, you'll sometimes get, like, celebrities that come in and comment on these things, which gets gets them obviously more.

30
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:11,429
And then like politicians, you know, certain politicians have like a higher profile and if they're commenting on it,

31
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:14,490
you might get a higher level of media attention.

32
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:23,730
Conflict. You know, just in general, all of these kind of inherently have some type of conflict in terms of like environmental exposures.

33
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:30,540
The story as a portent of future ills. So this is a big one of P farce, right?

34
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:37,950
Because we talk about because parts of these substances are so lipophilic,

35
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:41,910
we call them forever chemicals because they don't really break down readily in the environment.

36
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:52,500
They stick around in tissues and just kind of stick in the environment for a long period of time, which is why we call them forever chemicals.

37
00:03:52,500 --> 00:04:01,770
And so this idea that like, you know, if we see an exposure or seeing like contamination in one part of the country and we know these chemicals are,

38
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,529
you know, manufactured and released on other places,

39
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:14,729
it could present future ills down the line in other areas of the country or in other generations that we're talking about,

40
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:17,580
like, say, bioaccumulation or bio magnification.

41
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:25,560
Are we going to see effects, you know, in the future in like people that are children now as they grow up?

42
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:35,410
Again. And then kind of similarly when you have a chemical that again like fast like is seems to be like in many,

43
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:40,750
many places exposure can occur to anybody, even at like low levels.

44
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,920
Phthalates are another one.

45
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:49,080
Like we detect phthalates and like basically all human samples, we look at whether it be blood or urine, we see these metabolites popping up.

46
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:52,190
So for good reason, that tends to, you know,

47
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:58,420
create a pretty big level of interest and attention from the media because it affects everybody to some degree.

48
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:06,530
Anything visual is going to, you know. So, you know, all this is like pretty into intuitive, I would say.

49
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:13,440
So we can talk about who the messengers are.

50
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:23,430
So the public sort of is going to kind of weight the opinions of different experts in different fields sort of differently.

51
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,260
So, for example, this is like just a sample poll of.

52
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:39,360
People ranking different. Professions and different parts of the sort of risk assessment framework as most at least trustworthy, right?

53
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,959
So health professionals were ranked pretty high in terms of trustworthiness.

54
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:53,230
Most people rank them as the most trustworthy. And then consumer organizations like the National Consumer Council, you know,

55
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:59,080
27% ranking them as trustworthy, and then scientists specializing in food safety.

56
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:06,200
And then you see, like not as many people are, ranking government departments or the food industry as trustworthy.

57
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:12,010
So it's kind of interesting that you see like this kind of distrust of the government and then also the industry as well.

58
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:19,980
And then in terms of least, that's sort of flipped, right? Not many people are ranking health professionals, as least trustworthy.

59
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:25,350
A lot of people are distrustful of government and industry.

60
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:30,690
It's interesting considering that government should be regulated industry.

61
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:34,590
And so you have this kind of dual distrust, which is not great.

62
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:40,740
And another thing to mention is like this was done back in 1999 and this is in the U.K., I should say.

63
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:45,870
So not sure what it would look like here, but this is also done back in 1999.

64
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:56,250
So I'd be curious, given all the changes we've had or all the sort of disruption we've had based on COVID and risk messaging around COVID,

65
00:06:56,250 --> 00:07:02,910
how that might shake out now term, if you polled the general public in terms of who they trusted the most or not.

66
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:09,810
Maybe it'll look the same, but it'd be interesting to look at that after we had this, like, global health pandemic.

67
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:24,370
Any thoughts? Any questions? Comments. Yeah.

68
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:27,219
But, you know, trust is essential. It's part of this.

69
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:35,950
If we're going to have, like, fruitful communications about risk, you know, we want to generally we're in terms of like in promoting trust.

70
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:42,580
We want a perceived level of confidence, competence, objectivity, fairness, consistency.

71
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:47,859
You know, this is something where we have to kind of work to build up this trust.

72
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:54,459
Based on my good actions in the past, if you have good, you know, memories of working or, you know,

73
00:07:54,460 --> 00:08:00,700
of engaging with a particular institution that's going to engender trust the next time around that you have to deal with.

74
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:08,299
One of these issues needs to be a long term effort. And empathy is pretty essential.

75
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:12,860
And, you know something that maybe scientists sometimes are not the best at communicating.

76
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:20,360
You have to express the concern beyond just delivering the science and understand that these are people's lives that are being affected.

77
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:29,000
Right. Could be quite emotional over your phone if you found out that you've been exposed to a toxic chemical that could be impacting your health.

78
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:35,270
I mean, sort of goes without saying. Right. But in risk communication, that's something we need to take into account.

79
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,830
I you know, in my research it is I,

80
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:46,450
I understand why sometimes it's easy to sort of lose track of that because you're looking at numbers and you're working with cells all day.

81
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:49,940
There's not a human face to some of this work that you're doing, per se.

82
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,969
And so I can see why scientists do lose track of that.

83
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:58,850
But I think we need to like make sure that when it comes time to communicate about risk, that we bear that stuff in mind.

84
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:12,620
So if we've identified a particular risk, we want to mitigate that risk or reduce that risk as much as possible.

85
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:19,369
You know, so the public is usually going to demand government regulation on involuntary

86
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:23,509
exposures so things that end up in the food supply that we really have no control,

87
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:28,610
whether that's ending up in the food supply or not, things that end up in our drinking water or in our air.

88
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,660
It stands to reason that the public are not those things regulated.

89
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:42,440
We also get a lot of people wanting regulation of unfamiliar exposures radiation, electromagnetic fields,

90
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:49,700
asbestos, genetically modified organisms, anything that seems kind of out of the norm of someone's experience.

91
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:55,940
You're going to get a lot of, you know, push for wanting those mitigated or regulated in some way.

92
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:58,639
And of course, again,

93
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:05,840
a lot of this goes without saying to individuals respond negatively when informed that risks were suppressed by government or industry.

94
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:11,750
No one likes to be misled. So any thoughts there?

95
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:25,959
So when we're thinking about risk mitigation, what we want to do is set goals like this might take the form of some type of health indicator.

96
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:30,070
Like we want to bring cases of asthma down below a certain level or something to that effect.

97
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:36,980
We want to take preventative action, ideally in the face of uncertainty if we're not sure if something's going to be risky.

98
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:44,530
It'd be good to just prevent exposure to that particular chemical in lieu of having all the information.

99
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:53,220
You know, this burden of responsibility is a big issue.

100
00:10:53,310 --> 00:11:00,440
Right. So, you know, we want to shift the burden of responsibility to the proponents of inactivity so that, you know,

101
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:06,200
when we think about like who is benefiting from the production of a particular chemical or, you know,

102
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:12,210
who is benefiting from releasing certain air pollutants into the air, um,

103
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:20,790
the shifting the burden of responsibility to the people that might be living near that source of air pollution is not,

104
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,270
you know, sort of ideal if they're the ones benefiting from this process.

105
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:31,050
Right. Does that make sense? Um, you know, or this idea of like.

106
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:39,870
You shifting the burden individually to you to like ride your bike every day to work in order to fight climate change,

107
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:46,590
which is fine in and of itself, but in terms of putting all the burdens on an individual and we talked about this before,

108
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:52,530
the idea that, you know, certain we as individuals have a very low,

109
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:59,890
relatively low level of ability to sort of affect the structures of the society around us in a lot of ways.

110
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:07,680
The certain choices we can make, but one is shifting the burden on to one individual is not really the ideal situation.

111
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:13,589
We want to really think about who is bearing the brunt of the responsibility in terms of

112
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:19,440
mitigating risk to these exposure to the like environmental exposures and other things as well.

113
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:26,130
Does that sort of make sense? Um, let's see.

114
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:32,100
Yeah. And sort of, you know, another way we can mitigate risk is to explore alternatives to possibly harmful actions.

115
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,340
Are there other options that we can take,

116
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:41,250
other options that we could use that would not entail releasing a lot of kind of certain chemicals into the environment?

117
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:49,950
Is it really necessary? You know, and I talked about how sometimes this isn't a very sort of easy question to answer to some degree.

118
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:57,450
You know, like I had mentioned, phthalates and their use in hospital supplies that are really important for people's health.

119
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,290
Um, so what do you do there in terms of regulating phthalates?

120
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:09,750
Uh, just. Yeah. And then ideally, we'd be increasing public participation in the decision making.

121
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:16,110
Um, you know, transparency is always good. And bearing in mind, like, environmental justice issues, again,

122
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:25,500
this idea that some people might be living in areas and facing higher levels of burdens of environmental pollution then,

123
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:30,150
but not benefitting from the processes that are producing that pollution.

124
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:41,050
Yeah. Does anyone? I feel like this is a place where we can really, you know, start some discussions if you would like.

125
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:49,250
But a lot of it's kind of intuitive too, so. Let's see that.

126
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:53,850
I was going to make another point on that last bullet point, but for getting it now.

127
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:02,240
Okay. So we're going to shift over to regulatory toxicology.

128
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:12,890
So you'll see here some of the various acts that regulate certain types of pollution,

129
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:19,340
that stipulate, you know, that mandate EPA regulation of certain parts of the environment.

130
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:23,040
So you have air pollutants regulated by the Clean Air Act.

131
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:26,720
Water pollutants regulated by the Federal Water Pollution Control Act.

132
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:33,260
Drinking water, pesticides. We'll talk about some of these. There's going to be a lot of acronyms as we talk through this.

133
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:40,130
So just try to bear with me. It's just something that happens with EPA and other government agencies that you get a lot of acronyms.

134
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:44,360
We have regulations that regulate ocean dumping.

135
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:49,070
Toxic chemicals. Toxic Substances Control Act or Tosca.

136
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:54,440
Hazardous waste and abandoned hazardous waste sites.

137
00:14:54,980 --> 00:15:00,860
So a lot of acts and you see that this not all of these acts sort of happened right at once.

138
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:05,930
A lot of them happened in the seventies. But you're seeing some of this stuff came up in the late forties.

139
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:10,670
And then we're going to talk about the Frank Lautenberg Act, which came in 2016.

140
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:19,700
So this is like this ongoing process that we're continuously dealing with which.

141
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:32,260
So the Toxic Substances Control Act, this was passed in the wake of multiple incidents of pretty bad environmental chemical exposures and disasters.

142
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:42,849
We had PCBs in the Hudson River. We had PCBs here at Michigan, releases pretty bad chemical exposures going on.

143
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:53,020
And so, again, this followed the the sort of post-World War Two boom of like big industrial scale, like new chemistry coming out,

144
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:58,659
new products, and also a lot of new chemicals being manufactured and released into the environment.

145
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:03,580
And then so you kind of see this coming up and then this these let this pieces of these pieces

146
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:07,990
of legislation coming up to sort of deal with these new problems that we were encountering.

147
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:17,829
So this has spurred this. The task was spurred by the Council on Environmental Quality,

148
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:25,070
a report that urged the government to regulate chemical exposures based on lack of data or oversight on chemicals that were used in commerce.

149
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:32,060
Right. It's recommended that manufacturers should notify officials when they're using new chemicals.

150
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,230
Makes sense. Or using a significant volume of old chemicals.

151
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:41,960
So we're going to start to produce a bunch of trichloroethylene for use in our manufacturing processes.

152
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:52,030
Someone should probably know about that. You know. Producers should report the amounts of chemicals used and test their toxicity to assess the risk.

153
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:59,420
The government should disclose information about health risks due to environmental exposure.

154
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:10,950
So pretty sensible recommendations. And the goal would be we need to move from being reactive to being proactive on chemical safety.

155
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:16,290
So again, you can kind of see the timeline here where we get this really big level of excitement about

156
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:22,260
new stuff we can do with our manufacturing capacity and like this approach to chemistry.

157
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:32,729
But then, you know, we see that the flip side of that with these disasters and exposures happening and kind of societally realizing,

158
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:36,540
we need to be more proactive in terms of how we address these chemicals.

159
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:46,420
So again, Tosca was signed into law by Gerald Ford, former president.

160
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:50,560
Here he is smoking a pipe. Also, former University of Michigan linebacker.

161
00:17:52,870 --> 00:18:00,850
This gave the the Tosca gave the EPA the authority to determine the hazards of products before use in commerce.

162
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:07,300
So so pre manufacturing notification. We'll talk about Pmds a little bit or your future slides here.

163
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,710
So this idea that it's not like the Wild West,

164
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:19,330
you can just like manufacture new stuff and release it into commerce without having to go through a certain process of registering with the EPA,

165
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,830
requiring companies to conduct toxicity tests of chemicals.

166
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:29,020
So this could include things like chemical fate testing, like where's it going to end up in the environment?

167
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:37,330
Environmental effects testing and human health testing. So is it going to be harming wildlife as it could be harming people, etc.?

168
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:47,299
And then regulate chemicals that present an unreasonable risk. If we don't think it's worth it to make these chemicals that we think it's too risky,

169
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:51,140
that we can ban the manufacture of these chemicals to regulate them in some other way.

170
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:58,800
Yeah. So yeah, I'm just going to like say warning labels, for example, to a total ban.

171
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:09,150
Require notification. If a chemical is being used in a new process, this chemical going to be repurposed for something else.

172
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:15,510
And in large amounts. We need to notify someone before these changes take place in manufacturing.

173
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,000
All seems fairly sensible, right?

174
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:32,430
They also produce this task chemical inventory, which is a list of chemicals maintained by the EPA that are used in commerce or manufacturing.

175
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,340
So it's like 85,000 chemicals.

176
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:45,660
You'll often see this 85,000 chemicals cited in publications talking about kind of whatever, whatever someone is wants to discuss,

177
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:53,340
kind of overall, like how we're going to approach like testing a lot of chemicals that are used in commerce or, you know,

178
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:58,590
if they want to propose some kind of new model for toxicity testing,

179
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:04,170
but often cite this 85,000 number to give you a sense of the scale of what we're dealing with,

180
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:07,049
which yeah, I mean, 85,000 chemicals,

181
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:14,480
that's a lot to really completely understand the full range of their toxicities and hazards that they might pose.

182
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:20,760
Right. Interestingly enough, with Tosca,

183
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:28,500
the first 62,000 of these chemicals were grandfathered in so they could remain on the market without assessing the toxic impacts.

184
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:33,160
We were like. These have been out there. We're not seeing huge problems.

185
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:39,390
We'll just let those kind of come in. So now you're starting to see some of the gaps here in the legislation.

186
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:50,530
This also doesn't include pesticides, foods and food additives, drugs, cosmetics, tobacco, nuclear materials and munitions.

187
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:58,020
All of these are covered by other legislation, right? So again, this kind of gives you the sense of the scale.

188
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:03,180
Right. So we're talking about 85,000 chemicals. And this does not include these guys even.

189
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:10,890
Any questions? Any comments? Okay.

190
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:24,300
Of only 250 or around 250 chemicals have been tested, and chemical manufacturers provided little toxicity data to the EPA for the remaining chemicals.

191
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:29,880
Approximately 60 chemicals have been tested by chemical manufacturers.

192
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:37,430
And then 3000 of these are of the chemicals on this list are what we call high production volume,

193
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:44,050
meaning more than £1 billion of them are produced per year. So that's another one.

194
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:51,800
I mean, that's a lot of a substance to be produced and manufactured and released into the air and released into the environment.

195
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:56,700
So, again, just you're seeing the gaps here even with, you know, with Tosca.

196
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:59,729
And this was criticized for many years.

197
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:04,380
Tosca was for these types of sort of gaps in the regulation.

198
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:14,160
This is like a nice cartoon that kind of sums up what I just talked about from the Environmental Working Group.

199
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:23,100
So again, thousands of chemicals and commerce when toxic was passed in 1976.

200
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:30,470
And I just talked about how many, you know. 60,000 of those or more were presumed safe and grandfathered in.

201
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:37,940
EPA does not have mandate to assess the safety of those chemicals and so that those chemicals can remain on the market without restrictions.

202
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:43,760
So then, in a smaller number of cases, EPA has identified a reason to conduct some kind of risk assessment,

203
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:46,970
and that was done on a very small percentage of the chemicals.

204
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:53,840
And then there's a couple of things in here in terms of what EPA is sort of allowed to do or expected to do.

205
00:22:54,440 --> 00:23:04,670
So if a chemical is, EPA must find that a chemical is both a significant risk and that the benefits of restricting the chemical outweigh the cost.

206
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:12,330
Of restricting the chemical. And so if they decide that, yes, this chemical that fits both those criteria.

207
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:18,210
EPA then can impose restrictions, but only the least burdensome restriction.

208
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:21,300
So you can't put a lot of burden on the manufacturers.

209
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:27,830
And they also must document the inadequacy of the other options, essentially, of like the less burdensome.

210
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:32,520
So, like, we can't do it this way because it's not going to fully mitigate the risk.

211
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:44,970
And so you have to so there's a lot of sort of like criteria and like direction that EPA has had to follow under Tosca to meet these criteria.

212
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:52,500
Yeah. So the end result is like only five chemicals regulated under task is authority to protect against unreasonable risk.

213
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:59,280
And like even asbestos, which we like, you know, we are probably all familiar with asbestos and lung cancer.

214
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:07,500
How toxic it is did not stand up to the court challenge of like, hey, this is too burdensome on us, etc. So.

215
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:12,050
Getting some idea of the gaps here when Tosca.

216
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:24,840
So with new chemicals, companies had to notify EPA of new chemical production via what's called a pre manufacturing notice or PMD.

217
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:34,710
This was 90 days before manufacturing begins. So if you think about that, EPA only has 90 days to act on some new chemical.

218
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:38,130
So the company could be like, we can produce new chemical.

219
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:43,860
And then EPA is 90 days. It's not a ton of time in terms of evaluating the chemical.

220
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:55,460
Right. Especially given how underfunded and understaffed is the EPA is for accomplishing these tasks.

221
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:01,090
No toxicity testing is required to submit one of these plans.

222
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:08,979
So once EPA does know that they have to do this, they conducted what's called a structure activity relationship.

223
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:12,910
Remember where we're looking at the structures of the chemicals and comparing those to other chemicals,

224
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:21,190
doing this type of modeling to assess whether a chemical might present an unreasonable risk based on some structure in the molecule of the chemical.

225
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:33,719
Yeah. And then to regulate these new chemicals, EPA has to show that the new chemical presents an unreasonable risk to human or

226
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:38,910
environmental health and could have substantial exposure in the environment or to humans.

227
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:47,250
So they have have a little bit more leeway in terms of like these new chemicals that are coming out compared to,

228
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:51,750
you know, these thousands that sort of got grandfathered in. And so it's you know, a lot of the times,

229
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:59,910
like Tosca would be like catching new chemicals that are coming out as opposed to evaluating one of those other 60,000.

230
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:07,630
And I'll just stop there real quick and see if anyone has any questions or comments.

231
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:15,350
So since no toxicity testing is required to submit the pre manufacturing notices,

232
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:20,030
if a chemical say had chronic effects like long term but not short term effects.

233
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:25,120
EPA essentially couldn't know that before manufacturing of the chemicals started.

234
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:30,010
If no testing had been done, there's not like time to do like a long term.

235
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:34,450
Yeah, that's yeah. I mean, that's my understanding of it.

236
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:38,610
Have to look a little bit deeper into that to make sure. Yeah.

237
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:43,059
I mean they can certainly be if they're not restricted, they can manufacture the chemical.

238
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:50,170
I'm not sure if they would be allowed to like put it into products and sell and might be that might there might have been a stopgap in that way.

239
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:55,780
But yeah, I mean, that's just there's again one of these gaps.

240
00:26:55,780 --> 00:27:07,530
But that's a great point like. And, you know, I mean, there's sort of arguments that you could have in terms of like industry saying, well,

241
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:15,959
what we have to do like aa2 year chronic bio assay for cancer effects before we release this chemical, which might seem like a long time.

242
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:19,980
But then we're going to get into things like pesticide development or drug

243
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:25,680
development where you're looking at like ten years to bring a new pesticide product.

244
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:32,700
So it does work, you know, in some of these industries, or at least that's the current kind of state of how we're how we're making these things.

245
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:35,850
So, yeah, it's, you know,

246
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:43,559
is are you going to find are you designing your regulations like in a way that you're going to catch all the possible endpoints,

247
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:48,510
especially for these like chronic effects is a great, great thing to consider there.

248
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:53,640
Um. Any other thoughts or questions?

249
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:08,730
So around the 20 tens or so, you started to see researchers talking and regulators talking about these different gaps was like a data gap.

250
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:15,420
Producers are not required to investigate, disclose sufficient information on the hazard traits of chemicals or products to the government.

251
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:20,790
Downstream businesses that use chemicals or the public. The Safety Gap.

252
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:24,420
Government lacks the legal tools it needs to efficiently identify,

253
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:30,870
prioritize and take action to mitigate the potential health and environmental effects of hazardous chemicals.

254
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:38,430
And then the technology gap. Industry and government have invested only minimal, minimally in green chemistry, research, development and education.

255
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:42,630
And so a lot of people were noting like, there is this huge opportunity.

256
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:51,160
In this case, they're talking more about promoting green chemistry, which is certainly one area that we could probably use more of.

257
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:59,910
But, you know, there's also a big gap because of these these multiple gaps add up to a really big opportunity

258
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:05,220
for revisiting the legislation and revisiting how we regulate chemicals kind of overall.

259
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:16,390
And so in 2016, you had the passing of the Frank Lautenberg chemical safety for the 21st Century Act.

260
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:23,140
And this has some pretty significant improvements.

261
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:31,590
I'm not going to necessarily go through all of these. But for one, you know, EPA has to now evaluate has to evaluate new chemicals.

262
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:38,020
It wasn't it's not just a case of, oh, this chemical might present a risk.

263
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:43,629
Like, they have to evaluate new chemicals and they can also gives them more power to request additional data.

264
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:48,880
If they don't have all the data they feel like they need, they can request more data from chemicals.

265
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:57,490
We can kind of walk through this like just this is kind of a nice figure that compares Tosca to the Frank Lautenberg Act.

266
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:01,840
Again, discretionary versus mandatory testing of new chemicals.

267
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:09,100
And just to give you a sense of the scale, EPA receives a thousand notices around around 1000 notices per year of new chemicals.

268
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:15,910
Um, let's see if there's anything else I want to call out here.

269
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:25,130
Oh, there's kind of a difference in terms of with Tasca in order to like prohibit or propose restrictions for a chemical you needed,

270
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:33,230
like insofar insufficient information about toxicity and the chemical must be deemed to present an unreasonable risk.

271
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:43,250
Or is the chemical it has to be produced in large amounts with potential for significant release and exposure under the Frank Lautenberg Act.

272
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:50,059
Thus, the criteria is insufficient information or may present an unreasonable risk.

273
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:54,260
So it kind of loosens up the criteria there or is produced in large amounts.

274
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:57,800
So you have these kind of tweaks that like. In.

275
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:07,340
In some sense, they're almost like just like a tweak to the language, but can have some pretty big ramifications for how this regulation takes place.

276
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:17,800
The EPA can require additional data. Right. So this is like giving them giving the EPA a little bit more like teeth, if you will,

277
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:21,710
a little bit more ability to, like, exert some influence over this process.

278
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:30,020
See? See if there's anything else I want to call out in terms of differences here.

279
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:40,459
Oh, yeah. So you have like, you know, language like may the EPA may propose in order to prohibit or impose restrictions versus the EPA must by order,

280
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:47,270
prohibit or impose restrictions necessary to protect against any risk, including pending receipt or additional information.

281
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:51,680
So difference between May and must in this language here.

282
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:03,170
Let's see. Again, this is maybe something you can look at.

283
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:08,420
I'm not going to go through all the details. What I want to call out here.

284
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:17,120
Should. Yeah. I think this is basically reiterating some of the same stuff I said before.

285
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:22,820
But you can, you know, look at this, uh, this paper, if you want to, you know,

286
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:28,100
look into this a little bit deeper in terms of what this new act stipulates.

287
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:32,350
But, yeah, it's a it's a step forward. Um.

288
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:40,770
Again, probably there's probably still gaps that we could talk about within this new legislation,

289
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:47,940
but it's kind of shows how we can improve things along a kind of a long timeline, to be honest.

290
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:56,130
But I think we can kind of make them a little bit more give give the rules a little bit more teeth, if you will.

291
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:03,540
Any thoughts, questions, comments? Is this process actually being implemented?

292
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:14,250
Is EPA testing a thousand new chemicals? So they're receiving a thousand notices per year.

293
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,910
Yeah. I'm not sure how much that translates into them like.

294
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:26,850
They're probably I'm assuming if they're getting a thousand notices, they're at least doing the structure activity analysis.

295
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:33,659
Yeah, that's that's a good question. But yeah, to my knowledge, this is how it's being done currently.

296
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:37,920
There's, you know, there's always kind of like it's been a few years now.

297
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:44,790
So I think a lot of this is in place, but there's probably maybe some areas that someone who like works at EPA could maybe highlight and say,

298
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:48,269
we're not doing this part quite as well as I would prefer.

299
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:52,559
But, you know, does that make sense? Yeah, I know. Like under the Clean Air Act,

300
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:58,860
there are like determinations that they're supposed to make every five years that just don't get made until someone sues.

301
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:03,990
Like environmental organizations have to sue to get like because EPA is so understaffed.

302
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:11,010
So that's like my impression is that they rarely meet deadlines under existing regulations.

303
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:12,480
That's a good point. Yeah.

304
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:18,750
Like when you especially when you get into like full risk assessments of kind of like a particular chemical, like if you're doing like,

305
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:25,260
like trichloroethylene was one that was just like took years to get like a full and they just put it out like 2020.

306
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:29,309
I think so yeah. You're, you know, you're probably right.

307
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:36,720
I don't want to say like, you know, because I'd have to really kind of dig into it to, to give you like actual numbers there.

308
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:45,960
But uh, yeah, that's, there's things never really go as neatly as they look like a diagram or on paper for sure.

309
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:52,890
That's a, that's a good, good point to make. I just want to be like unfair to EPA and say like, oh, they're not doing any of this.

310
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:57,770
Um. Yeah. That's a great point, though.

311
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:06,380
I'm just curious. I think for Tosca, we said there were like five chemicals that were had some kind of restriction or something based on that.

312
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:11,960
I was just curious if you have any idea the number of chemicals that have gone through this and they've restricted in some way or not?

313
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:17,000
Yeah, that's a good. I don't.

314
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:24,569
I'd have to look in. I don't know if Chlorpyrifos was one of the ones that they went back and was specifically I know it was they

315
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:31,440
they they did like another risk evaluation for pure frost and so they can't be used for certain purposes.

316
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:36,510
I don't know if that was like specifically due to like the triggers that were in the Frank Lautenberg act per se,

317
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:45,060
or if that would have happened anyway. Um, but yeah, I'd have to, I'd have to kind of research that a little bit plane or sorry.

318
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,450
Okay. Let's see. Yeah.

319
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:55,810
This is really great. Any. Any other thoughts? Questions?

320
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:58,840
I think we're going to get through all the material by, like, next time.

321
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:06,130
So I think we got a little bit of leeway in terms of discussing some of this, if you want to discuss more.

322
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:15,630
Okay. So this is the first batch of chemicals that were reviewed under the Lautenberg.

323
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:22,650
Uh, the new Lautenberg actually have some of the ones like dioxin as relevant to this area.

324
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:28,970
If you're aware of the dioxin plume that's here in Ann Arbor that's moving migrating towards, like the groundwater.

325
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:33,730
Asbestos. Let's see.

326
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:38,410
Yeah. Trichloroethylene said a recent big risk evaluation done.

327
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:44,010
And it suggested that for certain exactly what it language was.

328
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:53,380
But it's basically like presented kind of the determination what trichloroethylene was like for most purposes, it presented like an undue risk.

329
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:02,290
It's used a lot in different occupations related to like decreasing of machine parts and things like that.

330
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:08,969
See. Yeah. So you can click on this link if you want to look more into to some of the

331
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:15,060
specifics of chemicals that are undergoing risk evaluation under this new act.

332
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:23,880
Okay. So we can talk about specifically about pesticide toxicology regulation.

333
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:36,550
So in. So if we have like a new proposed component of a pesticide or like a new pesticide product that we want to bring to market,

334
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:46,030
there's we're going to have to look over kind of a lot of the different end points and aspects of environmental safety,

335
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:48,470
toxicology that we've talked about so far.

336
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:54,910
So we're going to want to understand the physicochemical properties of the chemical, how it's going to move through the environment.

337
00:37:56,260 --> 00:38:02,110
We're going to want to want to do the acute oral toxicity like mutagenesis studies as a damaging DNA.

338
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:09,580
We want to understand how it's absorbed is it absorbed in the skin because it can be inhaled?

339
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:17,320
We want to do our battery of subacute and some chronic toxicity tests reproductive and develop developmental toxicity,

340
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:22,540
chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity. So this is where, as I would say,

341
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:30,669
we're getting into really doing all of this is going to be done on a very long timeline and you're going to start out kind of early in the

342
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:40,690
process with a high number of potential chemicals to potential compounds that you might want to bring forward as a potential pesticide product.

343
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:47,020
And essentially, that's going to get weaned down because a lot of these chemicals are not going to meet one of these, like, safety standards.

344
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:52,420
And so you're going to end up with like a low number of compounds relatively later in the process.

345
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,980
Yeah. So you just kind of see this here.

346
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:04,960
Like you might start out with a hundred, thousands, hundreds of thousands of potential compounds and do like really like broad screens across like,

347
00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:09,460
you know, just like a little plant model here going on and seeing what types of,

348
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:17,800
you know, what might be promising out of that set of like a hundreds of thousands of chemicals and then marching forward in time,

349
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:23,919
you might get to like say 5000 chemicals that look really promising and do further characterization.

350
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:32,170
And you might be getting into like understanding more about the specific toxicity of that chemical like mechanism of action of toxicity.

351
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:39,819
Again, marching forward in time, you know, you may from those 5000 have another 30.

352
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,650
They're like even more promising.

353
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:48,370
And maybe you're getting to the point of testing those in like experimental fields to see how they perform as intended.

354
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:56,650
And then at the end, you're kind of further refining and you've kind of narrowed it down to like 1 to 2 chemicals that, like,

355
00:39:56,930 --> 00:40:01,190
meet all the safety criteria and are efficacious in terms of what they're supposed to do,

356
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:08,810
in terms of killing the specific test that you're designing, this experiment, this chemical to get rid of.

357
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:13,400
And they're taking a long period of time to do all of this.

358
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:28,680
Yeah. So we're looking at something like ten years to bring one chemical to market, starting with like research optimization.

359
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:33,660
You know, a lot of chemistry, heavy chemistry is involved in this stuff, like synthesizing and formulating the product.

360
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:41,070
You also obviously you're going to want to understand the biology and conduct trials of, again, is it doing what it's intended to do?

361
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:47,489
And the toxicology is going to play a role here in environmental safety.

362
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:54,360
So you're going to see like toxicology is kind of part of the process throughout like most of this developmental process.

363
00:40:54,840 --> 00:41:01,469
And the idea being here that you don't want to pick up on a toxicology signal like in year nine

364
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:06,750
of development of after you sunk all this time and all this money into developing this product,

365
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:10,470
then we find out it's a developmental toxicant and you can't sell it.

366
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:17,040
Right? So the toxicologists are involved relatively early on and throughout.

367
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:24,600
It's so early for like environmental safety. And so you're looking at like ten years to go from.

368
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:33,640
Straining a bunch of chemicals, potential chemicals that could be used to, you know, a product that you could finally bring to market.

369
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:41,150
And the cost is also really high. Something like close to $300 million.

370
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:45,710
So ten years and $300 million. So that should give you a sense of the.

371
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:50,530
Vital role, you know, in terms of if since we want like I said,

372
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:56,110
we want to be catching any safety concerns relatively quickly before we sink a bunch of time and money into a product.

373
00:41:56,410 --> 00:42:01,090
So an important role for toxicologists in this process.

374
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:09,350
And a lot of people that have toxicology degrees go on and work for one of these chemical companies that's doing this.

375
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:17,490
Any questions? Thoughts? Yeah.

376
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:25,490
Like I said, toxicologists kind of integrated throughout the process. We do not want to discover unexpected toxicity seven years into development.

377
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:34,909
The W.H.O. classifies pesticides based on the NLD 50.

378
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:42,680
So like a pretty crude measurement but the LG 54 a rat and you can see like a really extremely hazardous.

379
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:49,610
So this is like milligrams per kilogram of body weight and we have different types of exposures here, oral or dermal.

380
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:58,770
And, you know, an extremely potent chemical that's basically killing a lot of rats at relatively low doses.

381
00:42:59,130 --> 00:43:04,350
It's going to be classified as extremely hazardous. And then, you know, potency kind of decreases.

382
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:13,380
He's talking about moderately hazardous or slightly hazardous. Four pesticide chemicals, which.

383
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:16,870
Okay.

384
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:27,370
So EPA is given the authority to regulate pesticides by two acts, one of those being the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act, or Defra.

385
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:32,080
The other one is the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, FTC.

386
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:44,530
That one is because. Zero one to. Just take a guess or if you if you know, like, why this particular one would be.

387
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:49,910
An act by which EPA is able to regulate pesticides.

388
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:57,399
Because food and pesticide residues. Exactly.

389
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,490
Because pesticide residues can end up in food.

390
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:08,500
So people are exposed to like low levels of pesticide residues oftentimes if they're eating something that was grown using a pesticide.

391
00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:15,770
So FIFA gives the EPA the authority to regulate sale use and distribution of pesticides,

392
00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:23,390
and FTC gives EPA the authority to set limits on the amounts of pesticide residues allowable in human food or livestock feed.

393
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:26,690
So how much of this residue can carryover? Kind of.

394
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:33,439
You know, we talked a little bit about this in the food safety lecture where, you know, we're getting this stuff,

395
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:38,540
these like additives and also contaminants that end up in the food and that we're exposed to.

396
00:44:41,090 --> 00:44:49,340
Yes. There's also a little bit of the authority coming from the Endangered Species Act.

397
00:44:50,210 --> 00:44:58,640
So EPA is required to specifically address the risk of pesticide exposure on endangered species through the Endangered Species Act.

398
00:44:58,650 --> 00:45:05,420
So again, harkening back to earlier lectures where we talked about what like Rachel Carson and Silent Spring,

399
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:13,219
where we're observing with pesticides this this impacts on wildlife of there's like issues with like impacts on like bald eagles,

400
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:21,530
for example, and like thinning of eggshells. And, you know, so we want to understand that and we don't want to be harming endangered wildlife.

401
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:35,780
So you had some of the authority derives from that. Um, so starting in 1996, all pesticides in the US had to be registered with the EPA.

402
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:44,930
Again, this is coming from DEFRA. There's another act, so there's going to be a lot of acronyms Askew, EPA, the Food Quality Protection Act.

403
00:45:45,950 --> 00:45:49,730
So pesticides have to be registered with the EPA.

404
00:45:53,240 --> 00:46:00,980
So this is like a scientific, legal and administrative procedure where you're examining the pesticide ingredients for safety.

405
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:09,419
You know, we need to define basically the site or the crop where the pesticide is going to be used.

406
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:12,600
So like, you know, what what types of crops is it going to be sprayed on?

407
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:18,360
Where is it going to be used? The amount, frequency and timing of the use.

408
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:26,740
And then storage and disposal practices. So there's a lot of like characterization that has to happen here.

409
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:34,790
You kind of get the sense of, again, the scale of what EPA has to do to understand, you know,

410
00:46:34,790 --> 00:46:40,430
you want to understand, you know, because you're going back to the first lecture dose makes the poison.

411
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:45,409
So is are like many tons of this pesticide being made or like, you know,

412
00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:52,760
how many pounds of this pesticide are being sprayed on a particular area or is it just like this very like niche use of

413
00:46:52,760 --> 00:47:01,220
the pesticide that's only going to be sprayed on one specific type of crop that's only grown for a very small amount.

414
00:47:01,970 --> 00:47:06,860
So just fully characterizing the use of these pesticides is not a trivial task.

415
00:47:07,130 --> 00:47:12,590
And even down to things like storage and disposal, improper storage and proper disposal,

416
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:18,590
these can be dangerous warning labels that need to go on these products.

417
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:22,070
So it's a lot that has to go into this.

418
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:30,430
And then so the companies must provide data that aligns with the EPA's testing guidelines.

419
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:37,050
And then EPA will rereview pesticides after 15 years.

420
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:48,580
So. So as you might imagine, risk assessment for pesticides focuses two harms on humans,

421
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:54,250
wildlife, fish plants and then again, including these endangered species.

422
00:47:54,550 --> 00:48:03,460
So what you're including in this risk assessment is both human toxicology and eco toxicology, which talked a lot about human.

423
00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:09,430
We had our lecture on eco toxicology. So both of those play a role in assessing the risk of a pesticide.

424
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:15,639
We want to understand how contamination of surface water and groundwater from leaching

425
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:19,750
runoff or spray drift so these pesticides that might be sprayed in one location,

426
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:26,710
but they can drift into other parts of like the local community, for example, or into like on other crops.

427
00:48:26,950 --> 00:48:30,520
So understanding all of this is part of the risk assessment.

428
00:48:34,150 --> 00:48:42,720
And you know, we need to understand the harm to humans could range from like acute toxicity, like, you know, impacting like, you know,

429
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:49,750
breathing on when someone inhales this chemical to like reproductive system disorders and cancer,

430
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:52,960
which are you're generally going to see those on a longer time scale.

431
00:48:52,990 --> 00:48:57,490
So again, going to your point about, you know, do we understand for these chemicals like,

432
00:48:57,730 --> 00:49:03,790
you know, the the long term consequences of exposure, not just like early acute effects.

433
00:49:07,950 --> 00:49:12,510
Yeah. Then also evaluating the language on each pesticide label to ensure safe usage.

434
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:19,550
So sometimes we have situations where people are working with pesticides and the label,

435
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:21,930
I'm not sure if I talked about this already in this class or not,

436
00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:30,870
but the label is printed in a different language than what they're, you know, they're comfortable reading or, you know, their native language.

437
00:49:31,290 --> 00:49:37,110
So there's a real problem with, in some cases with risk assessment or sorry, risk communication there,

438
00:49:37,230 --> 00:49:43,980
where if someone cannot read the warning label, obviously it's going to be hard for them to follow the safety protocols.

439
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:56,070
So that's been an issue with particularly with certain like farm work that sectors of are we are individuals able to read the warning labels?

440
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:04,670
So I'm going to walk through the pesticide evaluation process.

441
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:11,450
I'm not going to spend a ton of time on all of this. You can click on some of these links if you want to find out more information.

442
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:16,850
But we'll just walk through some of the to hit the main points here.

443
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:19,550
So we want to understand the product chemistry.

444
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:28,130
And so the data requirements and testing rationale include things like measuring various characteristics.

445
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:32,900
Does it have an odor? Is it flammable? Does it have does it contain impurities?

446
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:37,910
We've had issues with certain pesticides containing impurities that could be highly toxic.

447
00:50:39,850 --> 00:50:46,660
Product performance. Does the product control the pests listed on the label in an effective way?

448
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:51,100
Right. What do you two have a pesticide that doesn't do what it says on the label?

449
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:57,640
Certainly performance standards for different types of pesticides and the like.

450
00:50:58,450 --> 00:51:04,870
Yeah. Disinfectants, etc. Vertebrate and invertebrate pest control.

451
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:13,180
And then we'll get into our acute toxicity like these safety profile, end of things, acute toxicity to humans and domestic animals.

452
00:51:14,890 --> 00:51:25,090
We often talk about this sometimes as a six pack test, which includes acute oral, acute dermal, acute inhalation, primary eye irritation.

453
00:51:25,090 --> 00:51:28,150
Primary dermal irritation and dermal sensitization.

454
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:32,880
So this these acute oral dermal and inhalation toxicity.

455
00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:40,830
Again, is this like first step in evaluating the risk of the chemical and will serve as the basis for like some of the labels.

456
00:51:40,830 --> 00:51:51,120
You might see that working in terms of like how often or how much someone can be exposed to before they can reenter a job safely.

457
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:58,990
So, you know, you'll see this isn't just for pesticides, but oftentimes you'll see like these labels on products that say like.

458
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:08,220
What to do if you get it in your eyes. So these are the types of labels that would these types of tests would inform those types of warnings.

459
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:15,910
And then so we have this acute stuff, like stuff that you'd expect to see again like relatively quickly after exposure.

460
00:52:16,390 --> 00:52:21,040
So then we're going to move on to some chronic studies.

461
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:26,020
What we're looking at like a longer time line up to like 90 days.

462
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:30,010
So we're talking about like repeated exposures over a limited amount of time.

463
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:34,930
This is going to tell you information about what target organs might be impacted.

464
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:45,580
Does it accumulate in the body? You're going to use these to help select your doses for the chronic studies and safety criteria for human exposure.

465
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:54,310
And then we'll move on to finally the chronic studies, which are like the big pie, like the most difficult to do here.

466
00:52:54,910 --> 00:53:01,300
This is going to be oral exposure, looking at effects of pesticide following like prolonged repeated exposures.

467
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:11,010
And this is where we're going to see does this chemical have carcinogen and carcinogenic properties, neurons in it,

468
00:53:11,050 --> 00:53:20,740
neurotoxic and other physical, physiological, biochemical or like opposite is a toxic to the blood over a period of chronic exposure.

469
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:27,340
So this is what you're getting into these like two year chronic bio assay cancer studies.

470
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:34,670
And then we're going to assess hazard to non-target organisms.

471
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:39,559
Right. So we want to think about it in an ecological context.

472
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:44,390
Do any of these effects affect like birds, mammals, fish, invertebrates and plants?

473
00:53:45,590 --> 00:53:52,490
You know, we might be including some field tests to understand how the eco toxicological impacts of this pesticide.

474
00:53:57,510 --> 00:54:02,460
And then we're going to look at post application exposure studies. So understanding like residue.

475
00:54:02,550 --> 00:54:06,330
Again, like where does this chemical go after it's sprayed and doing its job?

476
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:12,629
Does it have like off target effects monitoring human exposure data monitoring

477
00:54:12,630 --> 00:54:16,170
data from exposure studies to estimate residues that workers may be exposed to?

478
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:22,170
And then we might be looking at applicator or user exposed studies.

479
00:54:23,130 --> 00:54:27,690
You know, again, after it's after people are using it, we want to know, you know,

480
00:54:27,930 --> 00:54:33,809
what risk it might pose in terms of exposure required for workers who would be

481
00:54:33,810 --> 00:54:37,770
exposed to like higher levels of the pesticide doing different jobs like mixing.

482
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:43,410
If it requires like mixing before use, applying or otherwise, like handling the pesticide.

483
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:52,330
Spray drift evaluation, quantify the range of droplet sizes and spray drift field evaluations.

484
00:54:53,290 --> 00:55:01,420
Again, this is going to play this is going to go into like how we assess how much of a risk this presents in an ecological context.

485
00:55:02,110 --> 00:55:07,360
And then this will go into like determining the labeling to minimize harm for non-target organisms.

486
00:55:07,630 --> 00:55:09,850
So a lot goes into this.

487
00:55:11,830 --> 00:55:20,430
So the last one and then viral environmental fake residue follow up and assess the presence of pesticide residues in the environment,

488
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:28,120
exposure of non-target organisms, concentrations in habitats of endangered species, and amount of residues that get out of food.

489
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:32,220
So it's really like. It's really comprehensive.

490
00:55:32,610 --> 00:55:39,650
The the number of things that are considered here. Any questions?

491
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:49,050
Comments. So you can see why it takes so long and why, like all they want, like on average,

492
00:55:49,050 --> 00:55:53,520
like one new chemicals per one day, pesticides like random to the market, like every ten years or so.

493
00:55:57,980 --> 00:56:04,760
Okay. So now we can go to regulatory toxicology and risk and drug discovery.

494
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:14,840
So there's going to be a lot of similarities here in terms of like the bottleneck for developing a new drug chemical compound,

495
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:20,120
as with the as we saw with like the pesticides situation.

496
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:25,649
Right. So again, we're talking about a long time period.

497
00:56:25,650 --> 00:56:28,860
That includes a lot of steps along the way.

498
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:33,500
So we're going to be evaluating a lot of potential compounds for target selection.

499
00:56:33,510 --> 00:56:41,640
So are we trying to design a drug that is affecting a particular receptor in the body?

500
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:47,510
And from that. Target selection process.

501
00:56:47,510 --> 00:56:51,650
You know, again, you might be evaluating like thousands or hundreds of thousands of chemicals.

502
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:56,420
You're going to generate some that look like a strong lead, that look promising.

503
00:56:56,990 --> 00:57:02,480
And you may want to optimize some of those. Oh, I'm sorry.

504
00:57:03,110 --> 00:57:05,300
Yeah. And so eventually you'll get, like, a drug candidate,

505
00:57:05,690 --> 00:57:12,679
and then you going to do further toxicology tests with that drug candidate using a process called good laboratory practice,

506
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:23,390
which is like really high, has like a lot of criteria in terms of like standardizing how a chemical is tested in a laboratory environment.

507
00:57:23,430 --> 00:57:30,550
There's like really strict procedures you have to follow to adhere to given good laboratory practices are GLP.

508
00:57:31,190 --> 00:57:36,829
And so you're going to do like the safety testing and toxicology phase using these JLP approaches.

509
00:57:36,830 --> 00:57:39,559
And then you're going to enter into the clinical trial phases,

510
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:46,040
which is where you're actually testing the chemical of the drug candidate in humans, human volunteers.

511
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:51,050
So you're going to have your phase one, phase two and phase three clinical trials.

512
00:57:53,750 --> 00:57:57,470
So phase one is again going to be in healthy volunteers.

513
00:57:57,620 --> 00:58:05,449
These are usually male. And we'll talk about a little bit what's behind that looking at like tolerance,

514
00:58:05,450 --> 00:58:09,019
the kinetics of the chemical, like how does the body process the chemical?

515
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:17,929
Where does it go in the body? Understanding the mechanism, the proof of the mechanism, is it actually causing the changes,

516
00:58:17,930 --> 00:58:26,389
the biological changes that we would expect to see based on the way we've developed this drug and designed this drug in some cases with phase one,

517
00:58:26,390 --> 00:58:33,830
you might be looking at like for a chemotherapeutic like late stage cancer patients, again, just understanding like tolerance, kinetics,

518
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:42,320
scheduling, like how often do we have to deliver this drug to have the intended effect and then understanding again the pharmacology.

519
00:58:47,510 --> 00:58:51,889
Yeah. And so then after phase one, we're going to go to I think we'll actually talk about that in a minute.

520
00:58:51,890 --> 00:58:55,010
But one point here in terms of the mail thing,

521
00:58:55,340 --> 00:59:02,149
so the idea here is that kind of historically there's been a lot of concern that with female volunteers

522
00:59:02,150 --> 00:59:09,950
that we would might be adversely impacting female reproductive health in women of reproductive age,

523
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:14,720
which I think that's being reconsidered a lot.

524
00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:22,250
You know, I think that it's also kind of a little bit silly because there could be male reproductive toxicology as well.

525
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:27,349
So but just historically, it's usually been male volunteers, which again,

526
00:59:27,350 --> 00:59:32,959
it's like we're getting all the data from male volunteers, which leaves a big gap in terms of our understanding.

527
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:39,920
So I think that's really been like reconsidered and I think things will probably change in that regard going forward.

528
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:42,980
But that is kind of historically been the case.

529
00:59:45,130 --> 00:59:53,650
So then in phase two, we're moving from paying for like tens of patients to like hundreds of patients in phase two.

530
00:59:54,400 --> 01:00:00,460
So these are like these early patient studies. Again, we're going to be monitoring kinetics, pharmacology, efficacy.

531
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:05,260
Is this chemical doing what it's supposed to be doing in an efficacious way?

532
01:00:05,620 --> 01:00:12,129
Understanding the dose range, potential drug interactions and and trying to understand if there are special patient

533
01:00:12,130 --> 01:00:17,590
populations that may need to be sort of modified in terms of who and how they're.

534
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:24,850
Who is taking the drug and how they're taking it. Phase three is when we're looking at thousands of patients.

535
01:00:25,750 --> 01:00:30,370
Uh, this is going to help us develop data for registration of the drug.

536
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:37,240
And then we're going to be getting into double blind trials where both the person administering the drug,

537
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:41,740
they're going to be administering the drug oral placebo and the person that's taking it.

538
01:00:42,250 --> 01:00:49,810
Neither of them are going to know whether they're administering, slash, receiving a placebo or the actual drug compound.

539
01:00:50,900 --> 01:01:00,650
And so we're going to be also comparing the efficacy of that drug to the competitor.

540
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:07,570
So is there already something out there that addresses this health condition better than the one you're proposing to put on the market?

541
01:01:08,380 --> 01:01:10,600
And then also monitoring safety, of course.

542
01:01:14,430 --> 01:01:22,410
There's also something that's called considered phase four, which is after that, basically people have started taking the drug.

543
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:27,360
And this is like after it's been marketed and put out onto the market,

544
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:35,399
we're going to be monitoring whether we're getting reports back of adverse health events that might pop up once we

545
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:41,100
kind of release this to like tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people that might be taking this drug.

546
01:01:41,850 --> 01:01:45,600
And so there is this fake, quote unquote, phase four as well.

547
01:01:48,110 --> 01:01:51,110
And if we notice some like really bad outcomes,

548
01:01:51,110 --> 01:01:56,930
the drug could potentially be pulled from the market if there is some kind of safety issue that's determined to be taking place.

549
01:01:58,820 --> 01:02:02,180
So any thoughts there?

550
01:02:04,430 --> 01:02:15,990
Again, a lot going into this process. Yeah.

551
01:02:16,170 --> 01:02:19,390
So, again, this looks similar to what we have with the pesticides, right?

552
01:02:19,410 --> 01:02:24,479
So like early on, we got like a lot of drug candidates could be like a billion different, you know,

553
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:32,549
molecular candidates that we're hoping are going to hit some kind of target in the body to fight off some adverse, you know,

554
01:02:32,550 --> 01:02:39,840
like a disease, end point or something, that that number is going to go down as we go through each step of the process and kind of

555
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:45,600
optimize for certain chemicals that we think are promising and that have good safety profiles.

556
01:02:45,990 --> 01:02:54,719
So you're going for like potentially like a million possible drug candidates down to like by the time you're in development,

557
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:59,470
you're looking at like 1 to 2. Let's see.

558
01:03:00,690 --> 01:03:06,810
So traditionally we're toxicology is kind of played a role has been kind of in this space

559
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:16,229
providing safety information on one compound to allow it to proceed forward into clinical trials,

560
01:03:16,230 --> 01:03:24,600
registration and prescription. And we're going to be looking at things like the mechanism of action for that drug in terms of toxicity.

561
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:30,210
Is that is that mechanism of action we're picking up in like animal studies relevant for humans?

562
01:03:34,550 --> 01:03:38,030
But there are other areas and a lot of people have been talking about kind of how

563
01:03:38,030 --> 01:03:44,090
toxicology could be informing earlier steps kind of were kind of earlier in the process,

564
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:47,970
like identifying early safety risks associated with a target.

565
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:53,629
So like if we know something about a molecular pathway, can we inform drug developers like,

566
01:03:53,630 --> 01:03:57,520
hey, you might want to like consider what like if there's two pathways,

567
01:03:57,620 --> 01:04:05,420
one is like really that are like activated by a drug candidate and one seems like really concerning to a toxicologist and the other not so much.

568
01:04:05,750 --> 01:04:14,300
Maybe we can inform that way and maybe help to influence chemical design and selection to avoid issues again earlier on,

569
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:19,910
before we've sunk all this time and money into the drug development process.

570
01:04:21,050 --> 01:04:34,020
And so given all of this. Again, the cost to bring like a single new product onto the market is, in this case, like almost $3 billion.

571
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:40,440
So a lot of time, a lot of money goes into this process and toxicologists can.

572
01:04:42,030 --> 01:04:46,470
Conceivably like inform this process throughout.

573
01:04:47,740 --> 01:05:03,240
Any questions? And here's an example of where we might be seeing certain types of toxicology studies conducted for a drug candidate.

574
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:09,660
See here. So, again, this is our drug development timeline.

575
01:05:10,530 --> 01:05:17,490
And so we're going to we're going to see you're going to want to do testing in one rodent species and one non rodent species.

576
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:25,189
Um. You're going to conduct MTD, which is maximum tolerated dose.

577
01:05:25,190 --> 01:05:31,460
So how high of an exposure can we give an animal before we see some type of adverse health effects?

578
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:36,499
The dress here is dose range finding.

579
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:38,370
So again, just optimizing that dose.

580
01:05:38,370 --> 01:05:45,770
So we we really want to understand and we talked about this again in like the second lecture that the idea of like the therapeutic index,

581
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:56,000
the margin of safety, these types of numbers that give us a sense of where is the safe region of dosing

582
01:05:56,060 --> 01:05:59,570
compared to when we're going to start to see toxic toxicological effects.

583
01:05:59,570 --> 01:06:06,080
Right. So every medication basically has like a safe or a safe level of dosing.

584
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:09,170
And then if you take too much, it's going to present health problems.

585
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:15,320
And so that's what these studies are going to help us understand. And then we might have some, you know,

586
01:06:15,340 --> 01:06:21,639
one month of like chronic exposure or some chronic exposure followed by like a recovery period of types of studies.

587
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:26,050
And then looking at like what we consider like chronic toxicology studies.

588
01:06:28,110 --> 01:06:31,270
Let's see. Yeah.

589
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:37,340
And then kind of earlier on we can start doing in the in the overall process we can start doing some of these.

590
01:06:40,980 --> 01:06:44,760
And so these like in vitro and other not animal models,

591
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:49,950
but some of like our battery of tests that we've talked about at various points throughout the course,

592
01:06:49,950 --> 01:06:52,349
such as like the structure activity analysis, remember,

593
01:06:52,350 --> 01:06:58,620
so we can just look at the molecular structure and compare it to other chemicals that have similar structures.

594
01:06:58,620 --> 01:07:08,910
We could do the AIMS test to see if it's carcinogenic or has a certain.

595
01:07:10,700 --> 01:07:15,590
Potential to cause mutations, which kind of, I guess by definition is going to make it carcinogenic.

596
01:07:18,170 --> 01:07:23,040
Yeah. We also have like this M.O. Ella Wise is the mouse lymphoma.

597
01:07:23,060 --> 01:07:28,360
So are we seeing blood carcinogenicity? Yeah.

598
01:07:28,390 --> 01:07:31,870
Micro nucleus, that's another one. Basically measuring DNA damage.

599
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:36,580
So some of these we can do kind of earlier on because if you see a hit in one of these,

600
01:07:36,580 --> 01:07:40,090
like, that's going to be a really bad indicator for that chemical.

601
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:48,520
Right. And then, you know, we might be looking at like reproductive toxicology endpoints, points on like a longer timescale.

602
01:07:50,460 --> 01:07:58,510
Any questions there? Sure.

603
01:07:59,570 --> 01:08:10,930
Okay. So again. Kind of the reason for including toxicologists in this process throughout is a lot of chemicals,

604
01:08:10,930 --> 01:08:19,150
a lot of drug candidates fail in the development developmental developmental pipeline due to toxicity or due to safety reasons.

605
01:08:19,270 --> 01:08:29,110
So this is some these are some graphs taken out of this article from AstraZeneca drug about AstraZeneca drug development pipeline.

606
01:08:30,310 --> 01:08:37,080
So you're seeing here the both for AstraZeneca specifically and then the industry median the percentage of.

607
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:43,520
Project. Let's see. So this is success rates.

608
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:44,209
And then over here,

609
01:08:44,210 --> 01:08:52,720
I think this is more what I want to point out here is the high percentage of drug candidates that are pulled out due to safety reasons.

610
01:08:52,730 --> 01:09:01,280
You see, that makes up like the majority of the candidates that are pulled out of different parts of the drug development timeline.

611
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:07,399
Efficacy is also a big one, especially like later on.

612
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:12,880
You're not seeing like that the drug components efficacious as maybe its competitors are.

613
01:09:12,890 --> 01:09:18,470
There's something else that's already working better than that one. But yeah, certainly safety is the other big one here.

614
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:27,390
So. That might be a good place for us to stop now?

615
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:35,260
I think so. Next time we're going to talk about I think we've done a pretty good job of like laying out the scope

616
01:09:35,260 --> 01:09:43,420
of the issue in terms of like both EPA looking at chemicals used in commerce and in manufacturing.

617
01:09:43,660 --> 01:09:49,540
We've talked about pesticides and I've talked about drug development and how that's a huge undertaking to

618
01:09:49,540 --> 01:09:55,120
understand the safety of these chemicals and the risks posed by these chemicals in each of these domains.

619
01:09:55,660 --> 01:10:00,840
And so next time we're going to get more into and this will be the last lecture, kind of the future,

620
01:10:00,860 --> 01:10:07,689
where we're going of like trying to address these like huge undertakings in terms of risk

621
01:10:07,690 --> 01:10:15,580
assessment and as that identification for these vast array of chemicals that are being designed,

622
01:10:15,700 --> 01:10:18,660
manufactured, used for various purposes.

623
01:10:18,700 --> 01:10:25,450
So it's probably a good place to stop off, and I think we'll have no problem getting through the rest of the slides for next time.

624
01:10:26,630 --> 01:10:31,030
So thanks for. Showing up. I'll get you out of here.

625
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:34,390
I think I went a little over last time, so we'll get you out a little earlier this time.

626
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:41,300
And if you have any questions, go ahead and stop by.

627
01:10:41,330 --> 01:10:46,729
Office. Our last office hours today and then. I'm still available by appointment.

628
01:10:46,730 --> 01:10:51,230
So if there's. If I can't make it to office hours today, just shoot me an email.

629
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:54,770
Thanks, everyone.
