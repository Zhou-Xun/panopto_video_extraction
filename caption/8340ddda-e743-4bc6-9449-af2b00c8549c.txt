1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:14,420
So we had debated whether to start with more duty like before the exam, but we decided not to because this is kind of a standalone module.

2
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:22,580
It's really about the purity of hypothesis testing in multiple linear regression.

3
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:31,360
And it's, it's, it's kind of a dense module, but all alone,

4
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:37,520
like why we were talking about like a linear regression while you were talking about the T test.

5
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:49,010
And then I was at several points I told you like, this is coming, we prove this, that SSR and that guy squared distribution.

6
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:56,270
SC his advice for this to be finished and the reason you could construct that F test is because it's this are, you know,

7
00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:04,190
skewed by the predominance of this capability is empty handed independent and so you get to that issue and construct that.

8
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:12,260
So I kept on telling people we've been proven that. So this module is basically the proof of all.

9
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:22,610
So as you can imagine that we are not going to go back to the sort of application bar and we will prove those results.

10
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:32,400
And that really kind of fills the loop on and on on hypothesis testing for of the beginning.

11
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:55,040
Yes. So lots of matrix algebra in this module, but these are kind of fundamental to all the hypothesis testing that we have developed in module E.

12
00:01:55,580 --> 00:02:07,160
So here's an outline. So we will write the same some software that we have been talking about in the context of MLR,

13
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:20,450
but now we are going to write the sums of squares as in matrix innovation and write them as what are called quadratic forms.

14
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:32,450
So I'll define quadratic formula in a minute and sort of work with those quadratic forms to establish the distributional properties of these.

15
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:35,900
Some of this is just want to make sure I am recording.

16
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:47,000
Yes. Okay. So so we will talk about the sum of squares and then we talk about the construction of the F,

17
00:02:47,000 --> 00:03:01,850
this based on the distributions of the sum of squares of SSR and SSP as reference.

18
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:07,790
This is section 3.2 and 3.3 of your text.

19
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:16,969
So the first thing that we are going to talk about are these sense of stress in matrix notation and their distribution.

20
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:30,920
So they said lots of matrix algebra coming up and if at certain points it seems like I'm going too fast, please stop me and please ask questions.

21
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:38,719
I'll try to go through this slowly because as I said, this is kind of a bit of a dense module.

22
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:49,990
But again, at any point in time, if you think that there are questions that you are kind of losing me, please, please do stop me.

23
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:54,650
So here are.

24
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:17,560
Some distributional theory and some results on that in some matrix algebra and rank and threes that we are going to use.

25
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:27,670
So this is from appendix of your textbook, appendix S.C 2.4.

26
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:41,320
And these are fundamental results that these are theorems from section C .2.4 in the in the appendix of your textbook.

27
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:47,020
And you will see that the theorems are stated as points one and two in the section.

28
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:57,880
So they are combining those students. Here are the three results are the three theorems that we are going to use

29
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:05,500
in in establishing the distribution of as this are assessed by an associate.

30
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:21,340
So let me go to this. Let it be in cross and matrix of constants and y is a vector of dimension and cross one.

31
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:35,650
And why has a multivariate normal distribution the mean equal to the vector mu which is again in

32
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:44,380
growth one dimensional and variance covariance matrix sigma squared times the identity matrix.

33
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:57,760
Okay. So basically we are talking about y to be in cross one vector that is normally distributed between new and variance

34
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:07,850
coubertin's matrix sigma squared studies the identity matrix meaning that the y you are is are uncorrelated right.

35
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:20,290
So simply we can write this in matrix notation as y has a multivariate normal distribution, the still design refers to like you know,

36
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:28,479
why takes this distribution and it's multiplicative normal we mean vector mehl and

37
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:39,270
variance organismic sigma squared so we call y prime e y transpose e y a quadratic form.

38
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:44,199
So what is the dimension of this? What is y y is in plus one.

39
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:52,179
So y transpose is one plus a n e is n cross n and then y is in plus one.

40
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:56,880
So y transpose z y is a scalar, it's one plus one.

41
00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:09,160
So it's a single number. It's called a quadratic form in Y because it looks like, you know, The Matrix, it's sandwiched between y principles and y.

42
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:16,059
It's a quadratic form. It's like a, you know, e it's a square type of thing.

43
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:23,139
But in the scalar domain it's a quadratic form and it is the dimension is one plus one.

44
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:30,490
So in other words, it's a scalar. So here are the three theorems from your appendix section.

45
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,530
c214.

46
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:51,970
So if e is symmetric and it's important, meaning, you know, a squared is equal to E and E has the rank B so it has to be linearly independent columns.

47
00:07:52,690 --> 00:08:03,130
Then y transpose e y divided by sigma squared has a chi square distribution with degrees of freedom.

48
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:10,750
B And now you like in the substitution, there's an extra like a new barometer.

49
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:14,640
Lambda I will come to this in a minute.

50
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:24,910
This parameter Lambda is known as the non centrally d parameter of the Chi Square distribution and

51
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:33,610
it is defined as lambda is defined as the quadratic form in the mean divided by Sigma Square.

52
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:37,720
So it's new transpose e new divided by Sigma Square.

53
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:45,450
And if you can please, this meal is a vector, so you can please use boldface for this.

54
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:51,610
This is born again. This is a vector. Somehow we lost that for space.

55
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:57,370
Okay, so. So this quadratic.

56
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:01,290
On why drums will divide divided by sigma squared has not.

57
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:08,880
We will come to the non central parameter. But you know, the theorem says that due to the non central distribution,

58
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:15,810
a non central chi square distribution with degrees of freedom B and non centrally debatable to lambda.

59
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:32,310
The second theorem is like the B, A, B, cross and matrix, then y transpose abi, which is a quadratic form.

60
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:39,670
In Y and b y.

61
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:46,870
B-Boy is not a linear combination of the Ys, so I can write it as a linear combination.

62
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,790
So linear function of y.

63
00:09:54,030 --> 00:10:07,890
Y transposes y and v by an independent eve, the product being dimes e the matrix Prada became say is equal to the zero made its.

64
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:16,020
So that's Theorem two. So it's Putin.

65
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:22,700
Putin one is talking about the distributional property of the quadratic form.

66
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:32,470
Theorem two, he's talking about the independence of a quadratic forming Y with the linear function of y and theorem three.

67
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:38,940
He's talking about the independence of quadratic forms involving Y.

68
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:49,739
And what is that? So now let me be another interesting matrix like E, and if I construct two quadratic forms Y,

69
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:54,990
transpose a, y and y, transpose b y water, quadratic forms.

70
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:04,850
Then this theorem says that y grounds for the y and y transpose B while you are independent.

71
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:11,160
If the matrix brought up eight times B is equal to the zero matrix.

72
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:33,360
Okay. So these are three parents in your appendix section, see 2.4 and we are going to use these to establish the distribution of SS.

73
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:38,120
Why use Assad and SS in multiple depression?

74
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:42,210
Okay. Any questions so far?

75
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:58,440
Okay. So let's talk about before we go to the next slide, let's talk about the the non central guys.

76
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,740
Like let me give you like a visual for.

77
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:13,260
Okay. So what is what is it like? We we have seen the Central Chi Square.

78
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:26,830
And basically, I mean, do this draw some like an example like visually for you and simplify things.

79
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:41,170
So we know that if Z is if Z is normal zero one can you see is it.

80
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,930
Why is it doing this box and what not? Okay.

81
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:59,969
Okay. So Ibs-C is normal zero one and the normal 3 to 1 standard.

82
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:03,630
Normal. Really? It looks like this right here is zero.

83
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:20,900
So this is the. Then if you be rid of this normal random variable, so define you equal to the square.

84
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:26,550
That gives us some nice square. Correct.

85
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:35,250
And the chi squared is a positively like only takes on positive values.

86
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:41,720
It's a positively distributed random variable. And the shape of the chi square looks like this.

87
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:46,200
Not doing a great job. But here is a nice square.

88
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:50,550
Okay. And square of first and a normal body.

89
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:55,860
You would be a chi square with one degree of freedom.

90
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,570
So we know that. Okay.

91
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:03,800
So now suppose I have a Z.

92
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,139
I shouldn't call it a z.

93
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:21,740
Let's like we call it an x which has a normal distribution we mean equal to mew, non-zero meaningful to mew and standard deviation equals to one.

94
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:29,510
And here is sort of the graphical representation of the.

95
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:39,890
I actually saw it when it was the.

96
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:51,849
Okay. So here is my zero day fitness goal and here is my zero and let's IMU is greater than zero.

97
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:54,760
MEU is positive. So suppose NU is here.

98
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:16,190
So what I'm saying is that X is an normally distributed random variable that is centered around that meal with the standard deviation of one.

99
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:23,540
So here is how it looks like.

100
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:37,110
Okay. Yes. Now, let's take the spread of this random variable.

101
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:40,950
Now let's define you to be x squared.

102
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:49,049
So note the difference between the x z is centered around zero sustained abnormal

103
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:58,050
body weight variant mean for the middle and Xs has a mean of new greater than zero.

104
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:06,780
So X is centered around. We would have standard deviations equal to one, but it has a non-zero mean.

105
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:24,390
Then if I take the square off for a random normal random variable, we mean greater than zero or less than zero, basically different from zero.

106
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:29,190
The square of there will also be a chi square,

107
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:38,670
but it will be like a shifted chi squared distribution and that distribution is called a non central square,

108
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:44,580
meaning that the non centrality parameter is non zero.

109
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:55,319
So if the mean of the beta normal distribution is zero, that gives rise to a central chi square because the non central perimeter then becomes zero.

110
00:16:55,320 --> 00:17:07,350
But now I still get a chi square, but it's a shifted chi square distribution and here is how it would do so depending on what the u is.

111
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:18,660
Basically my lambda now would be so it would still be a chi square with degree of freedom equal to one,

112
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:33,120
but the non centrality parameter lambda would be equal to mean square, a square of the mean of the field and normal distribution.

113
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:40,680
And basically it would be shifted, it would be a shifted chi square.

114
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:51,080
It would still only take positive values, but it would look something like maybe.

115
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:01,530
I did not draw a very nice picture, but. But you know what I'm talking about?

116
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:14,250
It's shifted. And the degree of shift depends on the value of new saw, in other words.

117
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:29,790
And one other thing that I should point out for a non central chi square with a degree of freedom beef and non centrally d parameter lambda.

118
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:41,370
The mean of this chi square is the mean of this guy squared is equal to the degree of freedom.

119
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:46,680
Last lambda lambda is the non central indicator meter.

120
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:59,370
Okay so it's, it's, it's shifted and basically that's what gives the non centrality barometer.

121
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:14,819
So in other words and when the non centrally key parameter is zero, meaning when new is zero, the mean of the parent normal random variable is zero.

122
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:22,260
Then you get a central chi square. So you we have been simply writing it as chi square with the degrees of freedom.

123
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:27,180
Okay. Questions here.

124
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:31,230
I mean, this is a distributional sort of. Yes.

125
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:40,350
Is the second group identical to the first one? So pushing the second curve like on the on the bottom, right.

126
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:45,240
Yeah. Identical in the sense in the views of freedom. Yes, but not this Xi.

127
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:52,650
Yeah, but it's shifted. It's a translation on the X-axis, but the shape will be the same.

128
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:56,760
So the first if shifted to the right.

129
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:00,490
And to make it or.

130
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:11,170
I. You should just talk to the way you go to.

131
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:19,910
No, no, no, no. It's not an exact strong statement like that because we did a few.

132
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:33,690
Yeah. So but but the bottom line is like if the paid in normal distribution has been zero, then that non central expansion comes through.

133
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:38,900
And that's why you have only one packet of the nice things. Okay.

134
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:53,580
So now back to our. So we have we are going to prove this tree we are funny we are going to use

135
00:20:53,580 --> 00:21:01,440
this three theorem and prove the distributions of the three sums of squares.

136
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:06,560
So here are the distributions of the sum of squares.

137
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:09,360
We can prove them. But let me first read the results.

138
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:20,670
So we will apply these distributions here and we will show that is this y you will see my square has the chi square distribution

139
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:33,959
with degrees of freedom in minus one and non centrally the parameter lambda y where lambda y at this point be ignored.

140
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:38,820
We will we will kind of be these. Basically the bottom line is,

141
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:47,579
is this valuable sigma squared has a non central chi square distribution with degrees of freedom and minus one in a non central experiment.

142
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:53,520
And that is a function of the mean of y. Okay, what about is this odd?

143
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,509
Is this out of sigma squared? We will sure.

144
00:21:57,510 --> 00:22:10,290
Has a chi square will be minus one degrees of freedom and non central experimental lambda r where once again Lambda R is a function of the mean of y.

145
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,640
So note the degrees of freedom for each of these.

146
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:29,550
And then ss e over sigma square has a chi square with degrees of freedom in minus p and non central independent of lambda e.

147
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:39,610
Very once again, lambda e is a function of the mean of y and it's a quadratic form.

148
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:48,059
I mean like all these non centrally de parametres are have a quadratic form in the mean of y and the quadratic

149
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:56,550
forms are defined by these different sort of matrices that are sandwiched in between the mean vector.

150
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:11,730
One other thing, if you recall that for constructing the F test, the I had to use the argument that,

151
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:19,440
you know, the the top and the bottom are distributional, so a distribution will be independent.

152
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:35,370
So. Right. So to establish that, what I need to show because the top of the F was it is are divided by two degrees of freedom,

153
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:40,079
the bottom of the F plus 16 divided by two degrees of freedom.

154
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,610
So I need to show that s it's not an especially independent.

155
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:49,170
So that's another thing we have to establish.

156
00:23:50,790 --> 00:24:03,959
So this I need for F and when we were talking about the B test for like a linear regression

157
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:10,530
symbol in any version to construct the theory here because we had divided by standard,

158
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:17,130
a lot of people had standard in a big I have used an estimate there for sigma squared.

159
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:29,220
So what did I need I need needed the independence of beta fat and sigma had square to establish the distribution of the T statistic.

160
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:37,200
So Beta Huck and Sigma Square had squared are independent this we needed.

161
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:44,910
I kept on saying that you know like these do have to be independent for this they should be big on a distribution.

162
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:47,700
So we are going to prove that result.

163
00:24:48,720 --> 00:25:00,300
And here we know that we needed these two results for constructing the F and the T and we kind of stated that and went along,

164
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:03,420
but now we are kind of coming back and proving difficult.

165
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:17,430
So so these are all the things that we will prove now to show the distribution of the sum of squares, it says, why is this on an SS e?

166
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:26,190
We will need to carry on or perform these steps first.

167
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:37,300
Then we will write each of these sums of squares using matrix notation to show that this sums up squares are kind of a quadratic form.

168
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:46,350
In Y. Each of those quadratic forms will involve like a certain matrix.

169
00:25:46,740 --> 00:26:02,400
Like, I will write this y as something like y y transpose e by the matrix y i would it write ssr as y transpose

170
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:16,800
a matrix like e are y and for c I will show that you can write it as y transpose a matrix e times y.

171
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:23,490
So I need to show that you can write those as quadratic forms involving these different matrices.

172
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,980
So that's the first step I will have to do.

173
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:35,580
Then the next step that I have to do is that for each of those matrices E by ERP, I will show that they are symmetric and identical.

174
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:47,370
And that step two, step three is I will have to find the rank of each of those matrices to apply the theorem in the previous slide.

175
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:53,129
And then finally, once I have done those three steps,

176
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:59,220
then I can apply the theorem on the previous slide to obtain the distribution of the sum upstairs.

177
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:05,550
If you go to be kind of clear with the logic, the flow.

178
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:12,809
Yes. I mean, why am I doing what am I doing that that part?

179
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:15,810
I want everybody to be clear on the steps.

180
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:22,150
Okay. So let's now do the first one.

181
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:29,219
So I will write each of these sums of squares as in, you know, kind of as a quadratic form.

182
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:32,940
So let's give it this y for what is this slide?

183
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:46,920
This is why is the total sum of squares or in other words, the square, the sum of the three deviations of y from the overall mean?

184
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:52,320
So summation y minus y bar square in summation notation.

185
00:27:55,230 --> 00:28:06,600
And I can sort of, you know, kind of do the algebra and write it as summation y squared minus nines, y bar square.

186
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:15,870
Right. So just write that square damas y1y squared minus two times y y bar plus y bar squared.

187
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:21,270
And then once I take the summation and simplify it, I can get from here to here.

188
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:26,250
Okay, everybody with me.

189
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:34,200
So now let's now write in matrix notation.

190
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:40,499
So what is summation y squared? Remember, what is why the vector y in growth?

191
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:45,330
One vector is like y1yym.

192
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:52,799
Yes. So I can write summation y square as y.

193
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:57,660
Transpose y. Okay.

194
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:09,720
And what about why bar? Why bar is the sum of all these wise divided by m so I can divide y bar as y

195
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:19,980
transpose times the quantum vector of one's y transpose becomes a row vector.

196
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:26,550
It's one crossing vector and multiplied by a one cross and vector of ones.

197
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:32,670
So I get summation y and divide that by m would be y bar.

198
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:43,920
So I basically replace that matrix of Asia in this expression.

199
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:54,670
So I have y transpose y minus in times one over n y transpose one square of this whole thing.

200
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:05,590
So now I write this y transpose y as y transpose the identity matrix of dimension and

201
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:11,739
crossing times y because if you d multiply outputs multiply by the identity matrix,

202
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:16,340
you basically retain the same vector of same matrix.

203
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:26,830
And then what, what happens to the second term here? So I have a n, I have a N outside and I have a one over n squared from that square.

204
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:38,500
So it cancels out. And then I have a n left in the denominator and I have a quantity like y transpose one squared of that.

205
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:45,720
What is the dimension of Y transpose one? It's a 1% tension plus one.

206
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:52,809
So it's a one plus one. It's a scalar. Okay, so squared of that scalar, I can write it.

207
00:30:52,810 --> 00:31:04,270
Does y transpose one and transpose of that whole thing which gives me one n transpose times.

208
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:09,430
Why everybody with me.

209
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:18,030
So from here to here because y transpose one n is a scalar.

210
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:28,909
This is like the number. So he play because if I take square of that in Victor notation,

211
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:44,270
I can just write y transpose from here to here and t y transpose one n and the transpose all this whole thing.

212
00:31:50,780 --> 00:32:00,710
Yes. And I know a B transpose of the whole thing, I can be transported from forth.

213
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:10,080
So I can simply write the second part as one in transports.

214
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:19,010
Diane Swan. Yes.

215
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:20,630
So that's what I did.

216
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:38,630
So now I have y drones cause y from the first part minus y transpose one in dimes, one in transpose times y divided by in Evelyn.

217
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:49,610
Okay. So now let's look at this part.

218
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:55,100
What is one in this is a column vector one, one, one.

219
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:03,090
And what is one in France? Cause it's a little bit of one one, one one.

220
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:10,820
So in close one with the one person, what do I get?

221
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:16,339
I get. But in person we treat all of those elements.

222
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:21,090
Or one. Yes.

223
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:29,010
So that this matrix this matrix of ones with dimension in crossing.

224
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:41,250
So now can you see that I am I can from here to here, I can write it as a quadratic form so I can write it as y transpose.

225
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:52,470
And I have a matrix that is sandwiched in between y transpose and why.

226
00:33:52,770 --> 00:34:02,730
And that matrix is given by the identity matrix of dimensional crossing minus the matrix of ones interesting matrix of ones divided by you to them.

227
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:24,070
So it's this y is a quadratic form we the send it to matrix A by defined as the identity matrix minus the inverse and matrix of one divided by m.

228
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:31,580
Everybody. Still with me.

229
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:38,900
Yes, actually, I. Which one?

230
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:49,630
I can hear it in. From the fourth to the second.

231
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:55,540
Like the algebra. Oh yeah. Yeah. So the a the from the summation part.

232
00:34:55,550 --> 00:35:01,450
Right. Not the matrix five. Okay. So yeah, for the for for the summation part.

233
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:09,550
So if I go back to the basic principles. So I have some I from one to M.

234
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:18,550
Okay. So I just expand this by square minus two times y times y bar plus y by square.

235
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:26,950
Yes. So I get from here summation y squared minus.

236
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:31,330
What is y by? Y is a number. It does not depend or not.

237
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:38,320
So I can take it out of the summation sign I have two times y bar times summation y.

238
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:44,139
Yes. Which says. And then what about the y?

239
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:48,030
But square once again, it's a number doesn't involve I.

240
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:53,800
So. But I am adding it in times. So I am in Times Square.

241
00:35:56,470 --> 00:36:04,570
Okay. Okay. So then now I have summation y squared minus the y bar.

242
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:11,440
And what is summation y on its end times y bar?

243
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:15,400
Because the mean is the sum of the y is divided by n.

244
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:23,680
Yes. So I can write it in time fiber.

245
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:31,129
But it was with me last night.

246
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:39,500
Bath Square. So this is minus two NY Bar Square and I have a glass in White Bar Square.

247
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:49,970
The one in wide bar square gets canceled and I'm left with summation y squared minus nine flavor square.

248
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:56,190
Okay. Any any other questions?

249
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:06,110
Okay. So I'm going to use the divider in this.

250
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:18,900
Because from the third step, I think a switch for the matrix notation.

251
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:28,020
Okay. Okay. So I have established the s this slide that I can write this this way is a quadratic form.

252
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:43,950
What about s this are. So is this are by definition is this is the variation accounted for by the regression model or the relations of square?

253
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:52,889
So it's basically y you had the deviation of Y you had from the overall mean and sum of squared of those deviations.

254
00:37:52,890 --> 00:38:02,040
So summation y I have minus y squared. And once again, using the same sort of algebraic steps as I did on the previous slide,

255
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:09,480
you can show that this reduces to summation Y you had squared minus in Times Square.

256
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:16,980
Okay. So here to here is kind of algebra.

257
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:29,340
Skyler. She's like, No, I'm going to write this s in matrix notation.

258
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:33,360
So what is some reason why you had Square?

259
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:39,659
So now I write it as a Y. You had transpose white hack.

260
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:45,690
So the inner product of Y had with the with itself.

261
00:38:46,650 --> 00:39:00,450
And what about in Y above square? So I'm going to use sort of what I derived in the previous slide and write this second term as y,

262
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:08,100
transpose y on and one in transpose Y divided by n because it's the same quantity.

263
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:23,880
Right. So I'm just using kind of from here to here, I'm using basically or writing in using a derivation in previous slide.

264
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:39,410
Okay. So now let's walk on that fourth story.

265
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:51,050
What is why hacked? Why have we know i can write y pad is equal to eight times y that it is the prediction matrix.

266
00:39:53,060 --> 00:40:06,890
Okay. So eight project Y on to the space of the on the on the prediction space.

267
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:16,549
So I can write simply the fourth term as h y.

268
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:29,560
Transpose h. Y. And the second term kind of remains as it is the way we had it in the previous slide.

269
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:34,700
I also know that the Matrix eight is symmetric and it's important.

270
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:43,780
So in other words, eight square is equal to eight and each transpose is equal to eight.

271
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:55,180
So what happens to this product? H y transpose s life so I can write it as y transpose.

272
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:18,910
Y transpose each transpose 81 each transpose is the same as e so have y transpose e where y it is also i the important.

273
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:22,239
So each square is equal to e. So I can write it as y.

274
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:32,170
Transpose h. Y. And that's what I did in the second term kind of stays alone.

275
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:36,340
So now can you see that I can write again?

276
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:44,409
SSR as a quadratic form and the matrix that is sandwiched in between white transpose.

277
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:59,739
And why is this matrix here? H minus this matrix of ones in growth, one in growth in matrix of one divided by end.

278
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:09,610
So this is my E matrix that builds up the quadratic form for SSR.

279
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:17,450
So I have established that society is a quadratic form with the imagery.

280
00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:18,009
I mean,

281
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:33,700
I'm denoting it as they are to be known that it's the matrix corresponding to SSR and it's given by H minus this matrix of one divided by little then.

282
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,910
So I want to establish that as this art is a quadratic form.

283
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:49,590
Okay. The last one actually is the easiest.

284
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:58,110
It's this E. So sc is what is the C is the residual variation not explained by the model?

285
00:42:58,230 --> 00:43:02,760
So it's the inner product of the residual with itself.

286
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:09,630
So the variety is it's epsilon hat transpose epsilon hat.

287
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:15,790
But Epsilon hat, remember, is the residual factor.

288
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:25,440
Once again, it's in growth. One vector. So what is Epsilon hat?

289
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:32,070
Epsilon hat is one minus white hat.

290
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:36,790
All of these are vectors in growth. One.

291
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:40,499
And what is why hat? I just thought in the previous slide.

292
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:50,450
It's each time flying. So I can write it as I minus eight times y.

293
00:43:54,340 --> 00:44:07,149
Yes. So now I write Epsilon Hack as the identity matrix minus a dime y transpose of that

294
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:14,500
whole thing and then multiplied once again by identity groups minus eight times y.

295
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:35,670
Okay. So I have, like, transports. I minus eight times y I'm minus 8yyy per day, right?

296
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:49,990
I minus h done four, then I minus eight because I think in homework two we ask you to show that e I know eight is symmetric eight important.

297
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:58,960
So it turns out that I mean a C is also symmetric eight improvement.

298
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:18,600
So by using the cemetery, an island port, then property of the identity minus each matrix,

299
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:25,020
I can write this C and Y transpose identity minus two times y.

300
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:37,680
So basically s e is also a quadratic form with the E matrix that is sandwiched in between white transpose and y.

301
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:45,000
Taking this form identity minus H. Yes.

302
00:45:47,050 --> 00:45:52,900
Okay. So basically I have.

303
00:45:56,630 --> 00:46:03,290
I have established these three and I'm going to write this by the end of this slide.

304
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:18,550
I have established that step one, I have established that is this why is this R and s e r for one?

305
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:41,610
With the respective matrices as A, Y, B, R and E respectively.

306
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:52,530
Okay. So I will stop here and we will take a break.

307
00:46:52,610 --> 00:46:55,980
So I have established point one.

308
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:59,790
What is the next thing that I'm going to show when we come back from break?

309
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:07,940
I'm going to show that e y e r and d e are symmetric and I them.

310
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:15,290
Then I'm going to show find the address of the matrix.

311
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:23,790
Then only I can apply them. Pyramid. Okay, so let's pause.

312
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:27,040
Let's take a break and then we'll come.

313
00:47:27,090 --> 00:48:05,310
Please come back at nine or six. Yes.

314
00:48:09,446 --> 00:48:24,396
So. So let's.

315
00:48:25,776 --> 00:48:31,796
So we have established. The first step.

316
00:48:34,316 --> 00:48:48,666
So now. We will have to show this second step.

317
00:48:50,316 --> 00:48:54,816
So we will have to show that each of these he made faces.

318
00:48:58,266 --> 00:49:05,476
Is symmetric and it important. So we have to prove that e y symmetric and i important.

319
00:49:05,476 --> 00:49:11,205
We have to prove that we are is symmetric in item 14 and we have to prove that the e is symmetric.

320
00:49:11,206 --> 00:49:14,656
And I didn't open. So so this step is done.

321
00:49:15,526 --> 00:49:18,976
Now we are on to step two.

322
00:49:20,326 --> 00:49:25,756
So let's let's look at step two.

323
00:49:26,056 --> 00:49:41,916
No. So first, let's make sure that e y is symmetric and identical.

324
00:49:43,686 --> 00:50:06,226
So let me just first, you know, y is we established in Slide six that e y is the identity matrix minus the a matrix of one divided by little M.

325
00:50:06,256 --> 00:50:15,186
So in other words, it's in graph one interest and make sure that all the entries are one of our and one over in one of them and so on.

326
00:50:16,956 --> 00:50:20,676
So here is the matrix. E y.

327
00:50:20,886 --> 00:50:29,886
So what is e y transpose? What is evi transpose?

328
00:50:32,526 --> 00:50:43,926
EVI transpose is the identity matrix transposed minus the matrix of one transpose of the.

329
00:50:47,266 --> 00:50:57,406
The identity matrix is symmetric and the matrix of ones all rows are one, all columns and one.

330
00:50:57,796 --> 00:51:04,516
It's by definition symmetric. So I did this.

331
00:51:06,316 --> 00:51:10,336
So it's equal to EVA. For EVA is symmetric.

332
00:51:11,566 --> 00:51:17,766
If the died important. Let's see. So what is e y square?

333
00:51:18,766 --> 00:51:25,575
So it is identity minus the matrix of one divided by little n times.

334
00:51:25,576 --> 00:51:29,286
The gain identity minus matrix of ones divided by little n.

335
00:51:31,456 --> 00:51:35,356
Now I just expand.

336
00:51:35,746 --> 00:51:41,686
So here is the first term and minus I have.

337
00:51:41,686 --> 00:51:52,366
Here is my second term. This kind of expanding and writing the expression.

338
00:51:52,756 --> 00:51:56,926
So now note couple things.

339
00:51:57,496 --> 00:52:03,076
So proposed multiplying this matrix by the identity matrix just retains this.

340
00:52:03,586 --> 00:52:11,056
So the first term is the norm. No brainer that it's the E by matrix.

341
00:52:11,866 --> 00:52:22,816
What about the second term? The second term? So the identity matrix multiplied by the matrix of once gives the matrix at once.

342
00:52:22,996 --> 00:52:27,596
So this first term is fine. What about the second term?

343
00:52:27,616 --> 00:52:31,996
The second term is I have a n square in the denominator.

344
00:52:32,446 --> 00:52:43,306
But the matrix part is like I have a engrossing matrix of ones multiplied by interest in matrix of one.

345
00:52:46,426 --> 00:52:48,706
Now again,

346
00:52:48,706 --> 00:53:04,756
I invite the interesting matrix of ones as a big bird of wands of dimension and Grossman multiplied by Rubik below plants of dimension one Procyon.

347
00:53:05,386 --> 00:53:15,495
Right. I just showed that a couple of slides down to the one across one enclosing matrix.

348
00:53:15,496 --> 00:53:24,456
I can write it as a product of the vector of one fourth dimension in plus one.

349
00:53:24,466 --> 00:53:31,366
So it's a column vector multiplied by a rule vector of one.

350
00:53:34,976 --> 00:53:40,466
And then repeat again for the second term.

351
00:53:46,706 --> 00:54:20,836
Yes. Tell me if anybody has a question, if you would be sort of with me.

352
00:54:30,126 --> 00:54:43,346
He is going to write a little. I see one not, but I want to see more than that.

353
00:54:45,896 --> 00:54:53,596
I mean, this is like I said, it's kind of a big event, but it shouldn't be difficult.

354
00:54:54,596 --> 00:55:01,226
Maybe sometimes what happens is this dissolve. You just have to go back home and write this.

355
00:55:04,226 --> 00:55:19,366
Okay. So, so that's what I did from, um, going, from going from here to here.

356
00:55:22,346 --> 00:55:29,486
So I wrote out the in person reports of ones as the product of football and weight bearing and all that other ones.

357
00:55:29,936 --> 00:55:34,046
Hmm. So now what do I have?

358
00:55:34,676 --> 00:55:41,936
So once again, from here to here, the fostering stays in its place, comfortable place.

359
00:55:42,506 --> 00:55:51,086
And then the second term, I can break it up as the matrix of ones divided by N and what happens to this bar?

360
00:55:51,686 --> 00:55:59,636
So what is. Now let's look at this part of the product.

361
00:56:01,256 --> 00:56:09,876
So a row of wants multiplied by a column vector of one sort of dimension, like 1% and plus one.

362
00:56:09,916 --> 00:56:13,526
So what do I have? What is that product?

363
00:56:14,366 --> 00:56:23,516
Okay. Right. So I can simply get rid of this and replace it by little n.

364
00:56:27,416 --> 00:56:32,546
And that's what I did. Okay.

365
00:56:32,936 --> 00:56:41,366
So now I have one in like a column vector of them into name growth, one multiplied by little n.

366
00:56:47,926 --> 00:56:57,616
Multiplied by the new vector of ones, and then I have divided by and square from the previous step.

367
00:56:58,666 --> 00:57:04,096
So I get back. What do I have?

368
00:57:04,186 --> 00:57:12,616
I have a one column vector multiplied by a rule vector of ones.

369
00:57:12,796 --> 00:57:24,585
So I get back this matrix of one that has dimension and cross n and this in from the numerator cancels out with one n from the denominator.

370
00:57:24,586 --> 00:57:28,666
So I'm left with one end in the denominator.

371
00:57:28,966 --> 00:57:32,956
And so these two terms are the same and they cancel all.

372
00:57:35,986 --> 00:57:42,976
So I am left with this third star, which is equal to the e y matrix.

373
00:57:45,476 --> 00:57:58,166
So I have established that e y is symmetry and important because these y squared is equal to e.

374
00:57:58,426 --> 00:58:04,546
I just proved it. Okay.

375
00:58:07,646 --> 00:58:19,016
What about the e r so e r again, I show that it's symmetric and I don't know what is Air France cause.

376
00:58:25,726 --> 00:58:38,356
Air transport is eight transports minus one when it starts because of that.

377
00:58:43,816 --> 00:58:48,136
Okay. What is wrong with the firm?

378
00:58:49,056 --> 00:58:54,076
H. H h is the production of bits and pieces.

379
00:58:55,486 --> 00:59:04,956
One and. Symmetry.

380
00:59:08,236 --> 00:59:12,526
Okay. What about the square display piece?

381
00:59:15,786 --> 00:59:26,796
So let's write earthquake are is h minus the matrix of ones divided by n and then multiplied by itself.

382
00:59:29,526 --> 00:59:35,556
So let's write this out. So once again, I'm kind of expanding.

383
00:59:35,976 --> 00:59:46,026
So the first term is H minus one divided by N dimes H in the second term is H minus

384
00:59:46,476 --> 00:59:52,386
the matrix of ones divided by N multiplied by again the matrix of ones divided by M.

385
00:59:55,326 --> 00:59:59,046
And so once again, sort of just write it out, expand.

386
00:59:59,496 --> 01:00:02,646
So I have eight squared minus.

387
01:00:04,476 --> 01:00:10,715
I will write the matrix of ones as the product of a column vector of one with

388
01:00:10,716 --> 01:00:20,706
the rule vector of one each of dimension and and multiplied by h from here.

389
01:00:21,126 --> 01:00:24,216
And then I'm just expanding and collecting terms.

390
01:00:25,416 --> 01:00:31,716
Okay, so now let's stare at this step or this expression for a y.

391
01:00:32,616 --> 01:00:40,746
So I know it is a projection matrix. So eight squared is equal to C, so I just replace a square is equal to each from here.

392
01:00:42,126 --> 01:00:57,036
What about the product of each product of the row vector of one with each?

393
01:01:02,586 --> 01:01:17,366
What is that? What is this?

394
01:01:17,396 --> 01:01:31,495
But we did kind of we sort of talked about an idea about if it is a prediction, we think that each time, say X and we prove that.

395
01:01:31,496 --> 01:01:36,276
And then in review we said that remember one, the following of one,

396
01:01:36,356 --> 01:01:43,826
this is part of the design matrix x and we actually gave you that topic in the exam.

397
01:01:44,696 --> 01:01:47,976
So, so you should know what this is.

398
01:01:48,096 --> 01:01:53,236
This is basically you remember the column of ones is part of the design matrix.

399
01:01:53,246 --> 01:02:00,566
So if each time say it is a projection matrix, it projects X on to its own space.

400
01:02:01,256 --> 01:02:10,196
Then since one is is the column of one is part of the design matrix of each project then vector on itself.

401
01:02:11,216 --> 01:02:25,376
Right. So basically what, what I have is from here to here, I basically get back that vector this so.

402
01:02:30,086 --> 01:02:35,396
Because one is a column of X in the design matrix.

403
01:02:35,396 --> 01:02:38,546
So that's the second part.

404
01:02:39,596 --> 01:02:42,716
What happens to the card term?

405
01:02:43,316 --> 01:02:45,166
The same reasoning.

406
01:02:45,196 --> 01:03:05,516
So this part here, each time one actually gets to the column vector one and then I have multiplied by the wall vector one dimension one crossing.

407
01:03:06,026 --> 01:03:15,776
And then finally this last turn here, applying the same kind of argument as in the previous slide.

408
01:03:16,496 --> 01:03:21,146
This is the product of the row vector of fans with the column of fans.

409
01:03:21,416 --> 01:03:40,106
So you get like the small N and what you have is basically this term here is like the n cross matrix of once times with

410
01:03:40,106 --> 01:03:47,876
length divided by square so one and cancels out from the top and bottom and you have little N in the denominator.

411
01:03:48,086 --> 01:03:52,766
So this is we just showed this in the previous slide.

412
01:03:55,756 --> 01:04:07,126
Okay. So what do I have? From here to here, I have H minus the matrix of ones divided by N,

413
01:04:07,966 --> 01:04:17,445
and then the second term I have the matrix of ones divided by N minus once again, the same matrix divided by.

414
01:04:17,446 --> 01:04:22,665
And so the second term basically cancels all that.

415
01:04:22,666 --> 01:04:27,666
Like the second one becomes zero because the two blocks in the second don't cancel.

416
01:04:29,476 --> 01:04:36,526
So I'm left with H minus the matrix of once divided by N, which is my air.

417
01:04:37,636 --> 01:04:45,806
So I have shown that e r is symmetric and identical.

418
01:04:56,226 --> 01:05:07,976
Everybody with me questions. No.

419
01:05:14,166 --> 01:05:17,616
Well, hopefully I'm not hurting, things like that.

420
01:05:17,766 --> 01:05:30,816
It's very early in the morning, but. It's and like like I said, take it from me.

421
01:05:30,816 --> 01:05:37,926
Some of these things like you kind of have to sit down in a quiet place and quiet into acceptance that.

422
01:05:41,176 --> 01:05:49,826
That. It's true, the steps are not difficult, but it's like, you know, if you keep track.

423
01:05:50,906 --> 01:06:03,416
So especially important after today's lecture and for this module is to go back home and like I said, take a cup of tea, sit in a quiet corner and.

424
01:06:05,966 --> 01:06:09,716
Maybe put a note on your door algebra and drop.

425
01:06:09,816 --> 01:06:13,136
This is turpentine. Just one of these.

426
01:06:13,316 --> 01:06:20,876
So once you do that, you'll be fine. Okay, so.

427
01:06:21,086 --> 01:06:33,116
So we have shown that the air is symmetric and I can put and then the last bar, which is again the easiest E was what identity matrix minus H.

428
01:06:34,316 --> 01:06:45,266
You already showed in homework that since it is a prediction matrix that the symmetric item for and that I minus H is also symmetric item four.

429
01:06:45,276 --> 01:06:52,196
And so we have shown that E is also symmetric I think.

430
01:07:08,556 --> 01:07:12,546
So this completes a step two of our proof.

431
01:07:13,176 --> 01:07:19,856
Let's go back and see what the steps were. We mind you so.

432
01:07:20,366 --> 01:07:31,256
So now we have this step to where we were showing that we the matrix for each of those quadratic terms is symmetric and important.

433
01:07:31,286 --> 01:07:37,796
Now we've established that, so I'm going to wipe this off and say that we are done with this block.

434
01:07:41,606 --> 01:07:43,526
So we are done with the second step.

435
01:07:43,556 --> 01:07:58,676
So now we have to find the rank of each of these matrices, the rank of E why he are and that we are on the third step of the proof.

436
01:07:59,516 --> 01:08:03,956
So let's now go and find the length of these matrices.

437
01:08:05,816 --> 01:08:14,216
So once again, this remind you, this is the the the theorem that we are going to use.

438
01:08:15,506 --> 01:08:21,986
So I kind of brought back that slide and we have proved the first two steps.

439
01:08:24,026 --> 01:08:28,286
Now we have to establish the ranks of these matrices.

440
01:08:29,276 --> 01:08:35,626
So basically these are just repeats of the same slide.

441
01:08:35,636 --> 01:08:41,066
So nothing like new here. I'm going to bring them back to refresh your memory.

442
01:08:41,456 --> 01:08:44,696
So we are now in this step. Okay.

443
01:08:45,716 --> 01:08:56,186
So now an important result from matrix algebra that we are going to use to establish the length.

444
01:08:56,906 --> 01:09:03,966
So if E is an ideal for the matrix, then the rank of easy street.

445
01:09:05,366 --> 01:09:09,685
So rank of E is equal to the three.

446
01:09:09,686 --> 01:09:15,806
So p e son is an important thing.

447
01:09:16,186 --> 01:09:20,816
Then I'm not kind of doing the proof of this time.

448
01:09:20,816 --> 01:09:24,075
This is basically a matrix algebra resolved.

449
01:09:24,076 --> 01:09:34,446
Then you can either argue from eigenvalues or you can use the rank factorization to prove this result.

450
01:09:34,496 --> 01:09:38,336
But this is a key result that we are going to use here.

451
01:09:39,416 --> 01:09:51,176
Another sort of review is remember that very simple matrix from module D like is the sum of the elements and of the mean diagonal.

452
01:09:51,776 --> 01:09:55,316
And here are other key results on trace.

453
01:09:56,516 --> 01:10:06,836
So a trace of it is equal to the sum of e i i from one to and then e I did, you know,

454
01:10:06,926 --> 01:10:20,306
the element of the I had to energy column trace of matrix e multiplied by a scalar c is c dynes trace of E trace of

455
01:10:20,306 --> 01:10:31,175
the sum of two matrices is the sum of the pieces and press of the product of a b is equal to the trace of B times.

456
01:10:31,176 --> 01:10:44,786
C matrix product and address of a b c is equal to three, see CAA, B or b, c, you can write it in this order.

457
01:10:45,056 --> 01:10:57,916
So we are going to use these results to now derive the ranks of e r e e and e y.

458
01:10:59,426 --> 01:11:06,356
Okay, let's first tackle e y.

459
01:11:07,976 --> 01:11:19,036
So what is eva e y is we have established already that eva is symmetric and I've been working so I can write the rank of E by as equal to the three.

460
01:11:19,086 --> 01:11:25,976
Something you write by applying the matrix algebra result from the previous slide.

461
01:11:26,906 --> 01:11:30,086
Okay. So now see sophie.

462
01:11:30,086 --> 01:11:43,926
Why I know what is able e why i defined it as let me go back and for you e why is the identity matrix minus the matrix of ones divided by n?

463
01:11:44,876 --> 01:11:55,616
So here is, I feel the stress of the identity matrix minus the matrix of ones divided by N.

464
01:11:56,396 --> 01:12:06,486
Now I apply a piece of E minus b is equal to DC minus three P so it's streets of the identity matrix minus three.

465
01:12:06,526 --> 01:12:10,316
So the matrix of ones divide it by.

466
01:12:10,316 --> 01:12:17,126
M What is the identity matrix of dimension in person?

467
01:12:18,076 --> 01:12:21,786
One's in the diagonals and zero everywhere else.

468
01:12:21,946 --> 01:12:28,546
So what is the truth of this may be since the sum of the diagonal elements?

469
01:12:28,906 --> 01:12:32,956
It's an interesting metrics. It's equal to any good.

470
01:12:33,946 --> 01:12:44,666
What about the matrix of ones? It's won everywhere.

471
01:12:48,026 --> 01:12:52,656
So once again, the trees of this great place.

472
01:12:54,956 --> 01:13:00,716
And growth n is n, but divided by little n.

473
01:13:01,496 --> 01:13:05,246
So I have the second term as in divided by little n.

474
01:13:06,476 --> 01:13:15,326
So I get one. So the rank of e y is equal to n minus one.

475
01:13:19,356 --> 01:13:28,196
Okay? Yes. No, not.

476
01:13:31,736 --> 01:13:35,846
Okay. So that's the rank of the wine.

477
01:13:35,876 --> 01:13:40,945
What is the rank of e r once again, rank of the r?

478
01:13:40,946 --> 01:13:47,976
I have ruled that the yard is Semitic and I didn't put in so I can write the rank of E as three of they air.

479
01:13:49,976 --> 01:14:01,646
Now I write down what areas e r is the matrix involved in the quadratic form for SSR.

480
01:14:03,236 --> 01:14:11,306
So e r just to remind you, is this matrix here?

481
01:14:12,056 --> 01:14:22,406
H minus the matrix of ones divided by M So I write it as h minus.

482
01:14:24,766 --> 01:14:30,046
The matrix of ones divided by in the once again apply the freeze formula.

483
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:37,336
You can write the best space of each minus piece of the matrix of ones divided by n.

484
01:14:37,456 --> 01:14:45,016
Just in the previous slide I showed that this is in divided by N, so I get the minus one from here.

485
01:14:46,366 --> 01:14:49,666
Now let's work with the trace of H. What is H?

486
01:14:50,896 --> 01:14:57,706
E is it's ex-prime x inverse x prime.

487
01:15:01,476 --> 01:15:06,726
So what is true of each piece of it is three.

488
01:15:06,736 --> 01:15:12,486
So it's it's primates in birds.

489
01:15:12,816 --> 01:15:18,256
It's right. Okay.

490
01:15:18,266 --> 01:15:29,546
Now I just reviewed a couple of slides back the pre so a, B, C, you can write this piece c, a, b.

491
01:15:35,496 --> 01:15:47,226
Okay. So now I'm going to apply that and write this as I bring that x rhyme on the x transpose in the front.

492
01:15:47,226 --> 01:15:54,666
So I have x transpose x, this is my C, this is my B and this is my E.

493
01:15:55,416 --> 01:16:03,426
So I did a c, a b, so x transpose x x transpose x inverse.

494
01:16:12,106 --> 01:16:17,246
Questions. In the first.

495
01:16:21,676 --> 01:16:29,896
In my efforts in your personal life. Oh, thank you.

496
01:16:29,896 --> 01:16:37,596
Thank you. Yeah. Okay.

497
01:16:42,576 --> 01:16:48,646
Hear. Okay.

498
01:16:49,186 --> 01:16:52,636
But. Okay. So.

499
01:16:53,806 --> 01:16:59,546
So now what do I have? It starts with the expenses, with the example that's in verse one.

500
01:16:59,656 --> 01:17:03,226
But it doesn't cancel. I mean, basically, I didn't. I didn't make things back.

501
01:17:04,216 --> 01:17:08,776
So I have the identity matrix here. What is the dimension of this?

502
01:17:08,796 --> 01:17:16,066
Conflicts. It sees the design matrix is in cross B.

503
01:17:19,436 --> 01:17:31,526
So it stands for this big crossing. So it stands for the axis B cross b a philosophy matrix multiplied by the inverse of that.

504
01:17:32,246 --> 01:17:35,816
Give me the identity matrix of dimension P. Growth p.

505
01:17:41,586 --> 01:17:46,356
So what is the trace of the identity matrix of Diamonds biography?

506
01:17:48,126 --> 01:17:53,726
I add up the key elements like once in the diamond of the.

507
01:18:02,726 --> 01:18:07,856
Okay. So the rank of E od is B minus one.

508
01:18:14,036 --> 01:18:18,716
This. Okay.

509
01:18:20,756 --> 01:18:24,336
Last one. E.

510
01:18:25,316 --> 01:18:29,876
So these the matrix associated with the quadratic form.

511
01:18:33,866 --> 01:18:40,826
It says E and E is identical matrix minus the had matrix.

512
01:18:41,666 --> 01:18:45,596
Be sure that that is this.

513
01:18:45,596 --> 01:18:51,086
EA can be written as a quadratic form.

514
01:18:57,296 --> 01:19:02,666
Involving this matrix. I might see this one.

515
01:19:02,976 --> 01:19:09,325
Okay, so now I'm going through the rank of this matrix.

516
01:19:09,326 --> 01:19:20,936
So then go for E3, Sophie then, because I assume that the is symmetric, the importance of the rent is equal to the trees.

517
01:19:21,476 --> 01:19:30,325
And I did a streak of I minus H and again applying the result of E plus people disappeared.

518
01:19:30,326 --> 01:19:34,226
The streets of B I did the streets of the identity matrix minus three.

519
01:19:34,226 --> 01:19:43,946
So for each matrix. So what is the truth of identity matrix of dimension and process on its end?

520
01:19:44,396 --> 01:19:49,176
And we just showed in the previous slide that trace of h is equal to be.

521
01:19:49,196 --> 01:19:55,616
So I get in minus three. So rank of 80 is and minus B.

522
01:19:58,286 --> 01:20:02,876
Okay. So I am cool with the third step also.

523
01:20:03,206 --> 01:20:12,626
I also also the third step. Establish.

524
01:20:17,146 --> 01:20:24,616
Rand Paul. Yvonne We are.

525
01:20:29,826 --> 01:20:38,196
Okay. So let's go back to our set of steps.

526
01:20:43,696 --> 01:20:48,436
So we have now also established the vans.

527
01:20:50,926 --> 01:21:06,226
So now I am I'm done with showing all the steps that are required for me to apply this first period.

528
01:21:08,386 --> 01:21:15,886
So I have shown and this is the the period that I want to apply, I have shown that for each.

529
01:21:15,886 --> 01:21:25,276
Is this why the facade is Jesse? I can write those as quadratic forms involving e y air and e respectively.

530
01:21:25,576 --> 01:21:32,806
I have shown that e.r. E volume we are symmetric and is important with their respective ranks.

531
01:21:33,196 --> 01:21:47,296
So now I am going to apply this theorem and show that the distributions of ss y over sigma squared ss are c musgrave and ss eu boston the square.

532
01:21:49,066 --> 01:21:53,196
Yes, that's what I am going to do.

533
01:21:53,206 --> 01:21:59,656
And now when I apply this force theorem,

534
01:22:00,496 --> 01:22:10,216
then basically this is what I get my applying that that first theorem I get this is why you are Sigma Square has a nice square with degrees of

535
01:22:10,216 --> 01:22:23,326
freedom in minus one because the rank of e y was in minus one and the non centrality barometer lambda y is remember what is the mean of why?

536
01:22:23,356 --> 01:22:30,166
The mean of y is it's better or you can write it as expected value of y.

537
01:22:30,196 --> 01:22:43,456
So the non centrality parameter as defined in the theorem is basically like new prime e y.

538
01:22:44,686 --> 01:22:46,006
New prime e.

539
01:22:46,036 --> 01:22:59,866
So you prime a new divided by Sigma Square but ease the matrix that is defined in the in the sum up squares or that defines the quadratic form.

540
01:23:00,286 --> 01:23:09,826
So then I know that new is expected to or new ways you can write it expected value applied.

541
01:23:09,856 --> 01:23:19,876
So basically by applying that Cureton I can write the non central little barometer lambda y and expected value of y,

542
01:23:20,446 --> 01:23:29,416
transport of the whole thing multiplied by the e y matrix and.

543
01:23:34,996 --> 01:23:38,746
And then expected them to apply for this.

544
01:23:38,746 --> 01:23:45,136
This looks like new prime, a move over Sigma Square.

545
01:23:52,126 --> 01:24:01,066
Okay. What about basis our lawsuit must but it's a are it must perhaps a non central chi

546
01:24:01,066 --> 01:24:11,145
square with degrees of freedom B minus one because the rank of E are we just show this

547
01:24:11,146 --> 01:24:18,255
T minus one and the non central parameter Lambda R here is defined by once again

548
01:24:18,256 --> 01:24:25,426
expected value of y transpose e r time expected value of five divided by sigma squared.

549
01:24:26,956 --> 01:24:35,746
So each of these matrices e by e, r and e define the non centrally D parameter as well.

550
01:24:36,406 --> 01:24:40,186
And lastly, what about is this E of Sigma Square?

551
01:24:42,616 --> 01:24:47,325
It has a Chi Square distribution with degrees of freedom and minus P,

552
01:24:47,326 --> 01:24:56,896
then minus P comes from the rank of the E matrix and the non centrally d parameter.

553
01:24:56,896 --> 01:25:06,166
Lambda E now is defined as expected value of y transpose i minus c,

554
01:25:06,496 --> 01:25:11,655
i minus eight is the E it creates multiplied by expected value of five divided by seven.

555
01:25:11,656 --> 01:25:16,236
The Square. Okay.

556
01:25:16,816 --> 01:25:17,596
So that's the.

557
01:25:18,646 --> 01:25:36,256
So these are the distributional results for is this why is this is the feedback we get by applying that theorem one in section C 1.4 in appendix.

558
01:25:42,826 --> 01:26:03,386
Okay. Any questions here? So let's if so, let's kind of make sure we're picking up.

559
01:26:09,956 --> 01:26:19,966
Steps. So now we have obtained this distribution of the sum of five.

560
01:26:25,596 --> 01:26:30,336
Okay. So I'm done with this far.

561
01:26:34,486 --> 01:26:41,745
But I'm still not fully ready to pass from the test and the display because I need to show the

562
01:26:41,746 --> 01:26:47,626
independence of SSRI efficacy and I need to show that independence of beta happens in my head.

563
01:26:48,796 --> 01:26:57,856
But everybody convinced that I have sort of proved the sort of the results in the line blue box.

564
01:27:00,066 --> 01:27:03,986
Okay. So I have I have through the distribution.

565
01:27:03,996 --> 01:27:14,796
So it's this y is the same as the C, but I still have a few more steps to go before I can.

566
01:27:14,796 --> 01:27:23,705
I'm ready to construct the F first and the deepest because I have to establish the independence of SSR and SC so that

567
01:27:23,706 --> 01:27:31,986
I can take the re huge scale ratio of both to quantities to construct manifest and also to construct the T test.

568
01:27:31,986 --> 01:27:36,906
I have to show the independence of a hat with sigma hat squared.

569
01:27:38,886 --> 01:27:41,946
So so that's what I'm going to do next.

570
01:27:43,746 --> 01:27:53,946
So let's go. And now oh, before I do that, so let's talk a little bit about the non centrally g perimeter.

571
01:27:55,266 --> 01:28:07,266
So what is lambda e? Lambda E from here is lambda is is this quantity, remember?

572
01:28:08,046 --> 01:28:23,195
So I argue that lambda is zero. If the linearity of the line assumption holds, the model is correctly specified with the expected value.

573
01:28:23,196 --> 01:28:28,656
If y is equal to x beta then lambda is zero.

574
01:28:30,516 --> 01:28:36,006
So under current specification of the model, lambda is zero.

575
01:28:36,036 --> 01:28:43,266
Y can you tell me why? I mean, look at what this expression I'm will still keep that.

576
01:28:46,236 --> 01:28:53,866
What is the top part of this expression? So. So it's it's me that runs both.

577
01:28:54,076 --> 01:28:58,546
Right. So data from schools external schools.

578
01:28:58,996 --> 01:29:06,476
I have. I have.

579
01:29:06,696 --> 01:29:11,226
I am minus eight and then expecting better replies.

580
01:29:11,226 --> 01:29:15,576
It's better, right? It's a zero.

581
01:29:19,446 --> 01:29:28,496
Yes. Because ex-prime aid tax is equal to ex-prime x.

582
01:29:29,796 --> 01:29:48,756
Right. So I have. This is a prime experiment with my nose pickup prime its prime a beta and it takes I know is equal to x.

583
01:29:51,026 --> 01:30:00,006
So. This can so, so and so.

584
01:30:00,436 --> 01:30:05,776
Lo and behold, I'm not using anything about the null hypothesis.

585
01:30:07,486 --> 01:30:14,056
All I need or all I'm assuming, is that the model is correctly specified.

586
01:30:16,126 --> 01:30:27,646
So under the L linearity of the line assumption, the non centrality parameter lambda e associated with SSI is zero.

587
01:30:28,306 --> 01:30:35,086
So in other words, if this e has a central chi square distribution.

588
01:30:42,426 --> 01:30:54,516
So this lambda e is actually zero under nine under the N in nine.

589
01:31:00,886 --> 01:31:07,846
In other words, it says you've got sigma squared, has a central chi square distribution.

590
01:31:09,676 --> 01:31:14,745
What does it mean to say that since you were Chi Square, the Central Chi Square distribution.

591
01:31:14,746 --> 01:31:23,386
So is this C or was it my square has a chi square distribution with degrees of freedom n minus P.

592
01:31:24,706 --> 01:31:32,566
So the expected value of SSP over C life square is an minus P.

593
01:31:35,196 --> 01:31:41,936
Yes. Everybody we need to.

594
01:31:42,646 --> 01:31:49,556
To the to. Okay.

595
01:31:50,966 --> 01:31:56,696
So now do you see why we use Sigma Hat Square?

596
01:31:58,586 --> 01:32:01,165
Like to compute an unbiased estimate.

597
01:32:01,166 --> 01:32:14,636
Therefore see must where we use s this e over in minus B because if you take the expected value of SC over n minus B, you get sigma squared.

598
01:32:14,636 --> 01:32:19,916
So it's a C over a minus PS an unbiased estimate for sigma squared.

599
01:32:24,226 --> 01:32:34,276
Okay. And that holds irrespective of whether you were in the non or in the alternative hypothesis space.

600
01:32:35,506 --> 01:32:40,906
All it depends on with the model is very. Specify the functional form.

601
01:32:44,456 --> 01:32:52,346
Okay. So. So that's for a Lambda EADS.

602
01:32:53,426 --> 01:32:58,436
And what about Lambda R?

603
01:32:59,876 --> 01:33:03,776
Lambda R is zero.

604
01:33:04,676 --> 01:33:09,596
Under the null. This is key.

605
01:33:11,396 --> 01:33:15,026
So under the null hypothesis, what happens?

606
01:33:15,056 --> 01:33:23,965
So what is lambda? Ah, remember lambda r is expected value of y transport.

607
01:33:23,966 --> 01:33:32,906
Expected value y is it's beta. So it's beta transpose h minus the matrix of one divided by little n times.

608
01:33:33,206 --> 01:33:46,376
Again, it's beta. And it turns out that under the null hypothesis, what happens to a expected value of one expected value of y is expected.

609
01:33:46,856 --> 01:33:51,325
Right. And under the null I have become an equal to beta.

610
01:33:51,326 --> 01:34:07,196
Do equal to p minus one. All are zeros. So under the null expected value of y is simply this column vector one multiplied by big unknown.

611
01:34:13,436 --> 01:34:16,846
All the other bidders drop off under the null then zero.

612
01:34:17,776 --> 01:34:25,995
And we have also Sean that one the column that the one transposed that so it becomes

613
01:34:25,996 --> 01:34:34,906
a rule vector times H1 is one transpose one because one is in the design space of X,

614
01:34:35,656 --> 01:34:46,216
so eight times one is equal to one. So you get one transpose, each one is equal to one, transpose one and then you know the all two for this result.

615
01:34:46,216 --> 01:34:59,386
So applying these to the expression for lambda are I get lambda equal to zero under the null hypothesis.

616
01:35:00,976 --> 01:35:07,966
So under the non SSR has a central chi square distribution.

617
01:35:10,156 --> 01:35:13,576
Okay, so what do I have?

618
01:35:14,356 --> 01:35:22,276
So now I think I'm going to stop here because I will come back and show the independence later.

619
01:35:22,876 --> 01:35:36,796
But what I have established is under the non SSR has a central chi square distribution and under the assumption of the of the line,

620
01:35:38,026 --> 01:35:50,636
it says he has a central square distribution. So I know SSR, A.S. have Chi Square now and well before that independence is one stop.

621
01:35:51,166 --> 01:36:03,136
And so I'll stop here and we will come back to this on post.

622
01:36:03,646 --> 01:36:06,286
Okay. Thank you.
