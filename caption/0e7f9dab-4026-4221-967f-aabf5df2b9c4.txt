1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,404
This is the PFK1 enzymatic step, so this is the step here.

2
00:00:02,404 --> 00:00:07,363
So this is the important step where we're getting a second phosphate

3
00:00:07,363 --> 00:00:12,151
onto fructose, that makes it a very high energy intermediate that

4
00:00:12,151 --> 00:00:16,500
can then be broken down by aldolase into these two parts.

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,354
This is that really energetically unfavorable breaking of the carbon

6
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:23,510
carbon bond that I talk about it last week, okay?.

7
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:26,362
And the way you get that is you push to make a lot of this, so

8
00:00:26,362 --> 00:00:30,299
you really wanna make a lot of this, this is a really important control point.

9
00:00:30,299 --> 00:00:33,312
This sorry, I realize I don't have a pointer I keep pointing at stuff,

10
00:00:33,312 --> 00:00:36,592
this is the step that's really important that we're talking about, okay?

11
00:00:36,592 --> 00:00:40,823
So there's several regulators that are important in increasing the activity of

12
00:00:40,823 --> 00:00:42,760
PFK1, okay?

13
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:46,300
AMP and ATP are sort of the first two that make sense.

14
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:51,570
So when you have loss of energy, you maybe don't wanna keep undergoing glycolysis.

15
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:53,480
So ATP will slow it down.

16
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,880
The converse is when you have ANP, that's gonna speed things up, right?

17
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,480
So those two AMP and ATP are sensors of the energy status of the cell and

18
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,470
it makes sense that you'd want that to integrate with glycolysis, right?

19
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:07,776
If you have low energy more glycolysis, high energy maybe not so much.

20
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:11,485
Citrate, does anybody have any ideas why Citrate might be an important regulator?

21
00:01:11,485 --> 00:01:16,478
>> [INAUDIBLE] >> Yeah, it's

22
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:19,950
part of the citric acid cycle, actually why they call it the citric acid cycle.

23
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:23,270
And yeah, so that basically means there's enough intermediate already flowing

24
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:26,960
through the citric acid cycle, so we don't need to keep replenishing that cycle.

25
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,940
That's something called anaplerosis, which we'll talk about on Monday.

26
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:32,097
So that's a second set of nodes, but

27
00:01:32,097 --> 00:01:36,840
the most powerful regulator is a thing called fructose 2,6-bisphosphate.

28
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,915
And that's where we're gonna spend the next couple of slides talking about, okay,

29
00:01:40,915 --> 00:01:43,750
and we'll get to where that comes from in a moment.

30
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,499
But just to kind of go back a little bit,

31
00:01:45,499 --> 00:01:49,160
I thought this was a good example when I was talking about allosteric activators.

32
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,110
This is an example from a paper in like

33
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:56,680
1963 of how you can have allosteric activation.

34
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:00,371
So this is looking at as you increase the amount of fructose 6-phosphate,

35
00:02:00,371 --> 00:02:04,351
not fructose 2,6 phosphate, this is the substrate fructose 6-phosphate,

36
00:02:04,351 --> 00:02:06,440
you get more enzymatic activity, right?

37
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:11,044
So that's just more substrate more activity just like pretty much every

38
00:02:11,044 --> 00:02:16,104
enzyme at some point that just reaches some sort of level of saturation up here.

39
00:02:16,104 --> 00:02:18,545
If you add AMP which is the allosteric activator,

40
00:02:18,545 --> 00:02:20,531
it shifts the curve to the left, right?

41
00:02:20,531 --> 00:02:25,299
So now it can phosphorylate fructose fructose 6-phosphate at a much higher

42
00:02:25,299 --> 00:02:28,100
rate at a much lower concentration, right?

43
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:31,066
So it makes it a higher affinity enzyme, okay,

44
00:02:31,066 --> 00:02:35,506
which means it's effectively also lowering the [INAUDIBLE] yeah?

45
00:02:35,506 --> 00:02:39,139
Viewer distraction, all right, [INAUDIBLE] okay, so that's

46
00:02:39,139 --> 00:02:44,480
an example of allosteric activation, and then an example of inactivation is ATP.

47
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,071
So if you look here, as this is now at one constant dose of fructose 6-phosphate,

48
00:02:49,071 --> 00:02:51,710
which again is the substrate.

49
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:55,730
As you increase the amount of ATP, the enzyme activity decreases.

50
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:58,645
You can then compete with that by adding AMP and

51
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:01,470
ATP and then the activity will come back up.

52
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:05,672
So this is now inhibited with ATP but when you keep adding more AMP,

53
00:03:05,672 --> 00:03:08,140
the activity comes back up, right?

54
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,376
So that's how it's sort of regulated.

55
00:03:09,376 --> 00:03:13,687
This is invitro by AMP and ATP, okay?

56
00:03:13,687 --> 00:03:14,956
Does that make sense?

57
00:03:14,956 --> 00:03:18,272
Yeah, the key part to remember if you ever get lost is, think about when

58
00:03:18,272 --> 00:03:22,080
the cell needs energy and when you wanna have more, glucose that's happening.

59
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,336
Okay, all right, so the next regulator, so

60
00:03:25,336 --> 00:03:29,440
is a thing called fructose 2,6-bisphosphate.

61
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,440
So the substrate, I'm gonna go to this side now, was fructose 6-phosphate.

62
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,241
When you get a buildup of too much fructose 6-phosphate or

63
00:03:37,241 --> 00:03:41,650
you have a lot of it what can happen here is it can get phosphorylated by

64
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:46,150
a different enzyme which is now called PFK-2, PFK-1, PFK-2.

65
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:49,830
It now makes PFK-2 makes 2,6-bisphosphate.

66
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:53,080
So 2,6-bisphosphate is not a glycolytic intermediate.

67
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,909
So this isn't gonna go down and react with aldolase to become [INAUDIBLE] and

68
00:03:56,909 --> 00:03:57,860
DP3, okay?

69
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:02,004
It's something else, and it builds up when two things happen when you have lots of

70
00:04:02,004 --> 00:04:04,170
this and when this is active, all right?

71
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:05,550
Does that make sense?

72
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:09,650
This is an extremely potent activator of this, okay?

73
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:13,130
So it's a secondary step, it's actually much more potent activator,

74
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:14,660
even in ATP or ANP.

75
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:17,580
So this is the way that you're getting what's called feed forward activation.

76
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:19,881
So you've got a substrate that's coming in,

77
00:04:19,881 --> 00:04:23,480
it's coming in faster than the cell can metabolize it and it's saying,

78
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:27,260
all right, guy at the end of the road who stops at the red light, get moving.

79
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,060
We need to all get moving along here.

80
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:33,552
So, it's feeding forward to tell the process to speed up.

81
00:04:33,552 --> 00:04:34,599
Yes?

82
00:04:34,599 --> 00:04:37,263
>> You said post potent activator of what?

83
00:04:37,263 --> 00:04:38,152
>> PFK1.

84
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:38,724
>> PFK1?

85
00:04:38,724 --> 00:04:41,409
>> Yeah.

86
00:04:41,409 --> 00:04:46,270
>> And you said if it builds up when we have too much PFK2 and what else?

87
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:51,895
>> So, you get this when you have lots of this, which is the substrate of PFK1 and

88
00:04:51,895 --> 00:04:58,660
when this enzyme is active, PFK2, we'll get to what that means in a minute, okay?

89
00:04:58,660 --> 00:04:59,768
And the key thing, remember,

90
00:04:59,768 --> 00:05:02,195
it's a positive feedback loop, so it's a signal that's coming,

91
00:05:02,195 --> 00:05:05,060
things are coming quickly we need more of it we wanna speed up the whole process.

92
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:08,041
So it's telling a step that's a little farther

93
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,731
down along to speed up the process, okay?

94
00:05:10,731 --> 00:05:12,972
So does anybody have any questions about that?

95
00:05:12,972 --> 00:05:15,965
All right, so that's regulating the regulator, and

96
00:05:15,965 --> 00:05:19,933
now we're gonna talk about regulating the regulator of the regulator,

97
00:05:19,933 --> 00:05:23,570
because [LAUGH] all of this is now under hormonal control.

98
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:27,841
So PFK-2, so forget about it for now the thing where it says FBPase.

99
00:05:27,841 --> 00:05:31,366
But if you just look at PFK-2, what I said what you do is

100
00:05:31,366 --> 00:05:35,867
got a lot of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate is when this is active, and

101
00:05:35,867 --> 00:05:39,331
when you have lots of fructose 6-phosphate, okay?

102
00:05:39,331 --> 00:05:43,042
But that is not always active, so PFK-2 itself, so

103
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:47,568
again remember that's the red thing on the Right,

104
00:05:47,568 --> 00:05:53,334
your right my left, that can be turned off by phosphorylation by PK, okay?

105
00:05:53,334 --> 00:05:58,131
So even though this is all under one whole level of control, and this positive feed

106
00:05:58,131 --> 00:06:03,152
forward loop can be turned off if, say PK or glucagon signaling is activated, okay?

107
00:06:03,152 --> 00:06:05,447
We'll get to why that matters in a minute, okay?

108
00:06:05,447 --> 00:06:08,969
So I realized this is several loops of regulation, it's complicated, but

109
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:11,840
this is a really important metabolic control point, right?

110
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,400
So that's why it's under regulation of a variety of things.

111
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,368
Okay, so to summarize all of that it can be regulated in order by

112
00:06:17,368 --> 00:06:18,900
all of these things.

113
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,750
So one is that you have a buildup of the TCA intermediate.

114
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:27,280
So that's the buildup of things that are gonna become part of aerobic glycolysis,

115
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,710
that can turn off glycolysis.

116
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:33,262
You can that citrate, which is a sort of weak regulator,

117
00:06:33,262 --> 00:06:36,080
can be overwritten by energy needs, right?

118
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,265
So even if you have enough TCA cycle stuff, but

119
00:06:38,265 --> 00:06:42,147
you really need energy in the cell, you can crank up glycol system, make energy.

120
00:06:42,147 --> 00:06:44,860
So that's the second level of regulation.

121
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:48,711
But the energy thing can be overridden by having too much fructose

122
00:06:48,711 --> 00:06:50,750
2,6-bisphosphate, right?

123
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:53,313
So if you've built up a lot of that activator,

124
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:55,890
you could override the previous two, right?

125
00:06:55,890 --> 00:07:01,230
So that makes it the most potent allosteric activator right here.

126
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:04,612
And all of that can be stopped by having a hormone, okay, so

127
00:07:04,612 --> 00:07:08,370
all of that can be stopped if you turn off PFK-2 activity.

128
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:11,492
Now you don't get any fructose 2,6-bisphosphate and

129
00:07:11,492 --> 00:07:14,300
this part down here doesn't matter anymore, yes?

130
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:22,597
>> [INAUDIBLE] >> No, it means flow through the pathway.

131
00:07:22,597 --> 00:07:24,215
>> [INAUDIBLE] >> Yeah, when we talk about flux,

132
00:07:24,215 --> 00:07:27,650
usually we mean some sort of directionality.

133
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:30,630
Okay, so I realize this is pretty complicated, this may be one of the most

134
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:33,640
complicated enzymes that we're gonna talk about in the entire course.

135
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,212
So it's good that it's first cuz there's lots of examples,

136
00:07:36,212 --> 00:07:37,452
lots of time to let it sink in.

137
00:07:37,452 --> 00:07:40,376
So how do we feel about this?

138
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:43,958
You see some thumbs up some not so thumbs ups.

139
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:48,907
>> [INAUDIBLE] >> Yep, so PFK-1,

140
00:07:48,907 --> 00:07:53,758
important enzyme glycolysis, so ignore this stuff over here.

141
00:07:53,758 --> 00:07:57,160
Exist, to get glycolysis you gotta go that way.

142
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:01,954
This is glycolysis down here, okay, so it is important in every step in glycolysis

143
00:08:01,954 --> 00:08:05,520
under, five different levels of regulations.

144
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,770
One of those levels of regulation is to PFK-2, so PFK-2, this thing,

145
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:13,190
not part of glycolysis, it's a regulator of glycolysis.

146
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:16,980
But this is not gonna get metabolized down until eventually become part of it, okay?

147
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:19,207
This thing can switch back and forth but

148
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:23,256
when you get the build up of this, once you have that, all that's gonna

149
00:08:23,256 --> 00:08:27,396
do is increase the flow of everything else through this pathway, okay?

150
00:08:27,396 --> 00:08:31,754
>> So is this depended on [INAUDIBLE]- >> Yep,

151
00:08:31,754 --> 00:08:35,417
yep it is, I will get in to that next slide.

152
00:08:35,417 --> 00:08:38,766
>> And you said PFK-2 is not always accurate, then what was it turn off by?

153
00:08:38,766 --> 00:08:42,780
