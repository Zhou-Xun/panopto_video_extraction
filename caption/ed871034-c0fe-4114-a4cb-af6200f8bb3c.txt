1
00:02:10,327 --> 00:03:16,597
Recording in progress. Okay.

2
00:03:17,617 --> 00:03:30,727
Morning, everyone. So last time we started our last topic, which is M and Z estimation.

3
00:03:34,087 --> 00:03:46,367
And Tom. So basically the framework was about.

4
00:03:46,867 --> 00:03:50,287
So first, it's just a reminder of what we had.

5
00:03:51,737 --> 00:04:01,067
So we had some framework and the level of the true model and this was either my estimation,

6
00:04:01,937 --> 00:04:14,837
meaning that our true value of the model parameter theta was a maximum in some parametric space of those parameters, of some function and of theta.

7
00:04:16,447 --> 00:04:24,847
And kind of a very similar uh, uh, framework was there for some function CI.

8
00:04:25,567 --> 00:04:37,267
So this was called the Z estimation because size I usually, uh, if we're talking about an elite, so that would be the score for the family.

9
00:04:37,447 --> 00:04:42,187
Uh, that is often denoted by Z and also in estimation the equations.

10
00:04:43,587 --> 00:04:55,947
This is sometimes denoted by Z. So we had a function size such that say the true parameter is a solution to the equation.

11
00:04:59,787 --> 00:05:04,047
PSI theta equals zero.

12
00:05:06,387 --> 00:05:12,027
Right. So. So then we talked about, uh, converting it to.

13
00:05:13,617 --> 00:05:21,747
From a true problem to an approximate problem that is built using simple values.

14
00:05:22,797 --> 00:05:29,777
And the most straightforward way to do that, as we said, was to assume that there exists some.

15
00:05:30,727 --> 00:05:35,137
Uh, functions, say, to the Phi Theta.

16
00:05:36,697 --> 00:05:53,197
Such that the function is an expected value of theta and the function CI is an expected value of Phi Theta.

17
00:05:53,527 --> 00:05:57,756
So both taken at the true model.

18
00:05:57,757 --> 00:06:02,166
So so far it was all of the true model things, right?

19
00:06:02,167 --> 00:06:13,627
But having exposed an expectation, it is clear how to convert it to an estimation problem based on simple values.

20
00:06:20,157 --> 00:06:28,227
And that is when the true expectations are replaced by empirical expectations based on the observed sample.

21
00:06:28,587 --> 00:06:31,917
So we have one other notation for the expectation.

22
00:06:32,547 --> 00:06:40,767
That's the probability distribution that characterizes all of the random stuff in the true model.

23
00:06:42,187 --> 00:06:55,437
Uh. Acting on. And say to us this was the empirical process, notation and probability distribution of the true model acting on Feith et al.

24
00:06:55,467 --> 00:06:59,627
So let's just. Notation saying by definition.

25
00:07:01,117 --> 00:07:04,236
Right. And in the estimation problem.

26
00:07:04,237 --> 00:07:09,787
So we still have the seeds and the faith aid, but we replace them.

27
00:07:09,787 --> 00:07:14,647
And by its approximation, by the empirical expectation.

28
00:07:16,867 --> 00:07:30,937
I'd say that and that is some of I am saying to some generically writing it as an exile where it's our simple values.

29
00:07:35,707 --> 00:07:41,377
Now, of course, exile could be very complicated and could be a structure of just a number.

30
00:07:42,517 --> 00:07:49,077
And we do the same thing with the function. And so that's an empirical expectation of the function cited.

31
00:07:53,077 --> 00:07:59,257
She's against some of I so one of and it's the sample size.

32
00:08:04,347 --> 00:08:07,367
The UN's atomic size rate.

33
00:08:09,627 --> 00:08:12,567
Okay. And then so we define estimates.

34
00:08:12,807 --> 00:08:28,877
Um, is uh, uh, in the one hand maximizing, uh, um, and so that gives you as the estimate of theta and that's called an m estimate and uh,

35
00:08:28,887 --> 00:08:37,617
solving say any call zero gives us the head and that's called the Z estimate.

36
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:51,557
Okay. And then we just started talking about, uh, uh, a theory that establishes in general terms the consistency of what leads to consistency.

37
00:08:51,587 --> 00:08:59,177
Right. Uh, so the framework makes sense because, uh, well, we defined the true problem.

38
00:08:59,777 --> 00:09:11,837
Uh, we know that empirical expectation asymptotically approximates, well, the, uh, true expectation that's, uh, various laws of large numbers.

39
00:09:12,787 --> 00:09:21,487
And such. There is hope that something that is a solution to the true problem, the true parameter value.

40
00:09:22,267 --> 00:09:32,047
Now, if we approximate the functions that give us the true parameter value by the functions that go to the true ones,

41
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:41,197
then the solution to the approximate equations will also give us an estimate that will go to the tool itself.

42
00:09:41,617 --> 00:09:44,437
Right. But there are certain conditions that make that happen.

43
00:09:44,767 --> 00:09:53,807
So that in general is not true, even though the framework is, of course, entirely clear or intuitively appealing.

44
00:09:53,887 --> 00:09:58,807
Right. And so the theory with started formulating.

45
00:10:00,177 --> 00:10:09,897
Now, of course, we need to say something about the functions of our man and them.

46
00:10:10,137 --> 00:10:25,197
So what we want to accomplish. This is, again, somewhat sloppy language at this point.

47
00:10:25,737 --> 00:10:29,547
But it does give the intuition right to make.

48
00:10:32,937 --> 00:10:38,247
To make the above argument work. So what do we need to do?

49
00:10:38,267 --> 00:10:43,187
So we need to ensure that AMD goes to em.

50
00:10:43,667 --> 00:10:52,377
Sales sounds and theoretically. And same thing for the rights of the site and should go to the true function.

51
00:10:53,437 --> 00:11:00,337
Asymptotically. And the first two conditions that we start formulating, they are the ones that make this happen.

52
00:11:00,937 --> 00:11:08,317
Right. And then there's a third condition that this is one to.

53
00:11:11,197 --> 00:11:18,486
There's a third condition that basically from the fact that a man goes to and makes

54
00:11:18,487 --> 00:11:26,377
sure that the theta in hand goes to theta to the trooper and it's a value theta star.

55
00:11:26,827 --> 00:11:30,217
And that's the third condition in the theory.

56
00:11:32,497 --> 00:11:40,297
Okay. So. Now let's state those conditions.

57
00:11:41,887 --> 00:11:48,857
So the first one is. The uniform law of large numbers.

58
00:11:52,127 --> 00:11:57,767
For M. For a man who goes to.

59
00:12:00,377 --> 00:12:03,857
Okay. So and that's looks like.

60
00:12:04,637 --> 00:12:08,777
So the norm the because we're talking about convergence of functions.

61
00:12:09,527 --> 00:12:13,727
So we need a functional convergence.

62
00:12:13,727 --> 00:12:21,027
So that's. Measured by norm going in probability to zero.

63
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:32,727
And then, uh, so unless uh, specified otherwise we will look at norms from now on as a supernova.

64
00:12:39,047 --> 00:12:42,657
All right. So Norm of a function is.

65
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:49,627
Function F. For an ETF. It is going to be super.

66
00:12:51,997 --> 00:12:56,707
In the space of that half of the to.

67
00:12:58,847 --> 00:13:03,857
That's how it's defined. Now, of course, when we talk about vectors and so on.

68
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:15,337
So the model could be Euclidean and so on. But in the context of the symbolic theorems, on the Z estimation, we're talking about the supernormal.

69
00:13:16,307 --> 00:13:26,307
Okay then. So the second condition is making sure that, uh, uh.

70
00:13:26,627 --> 00:13:34,756
So a function of the estimate, uh. He is converging to the function of the true parameter value.

71
00:13:34,757 --> 00:13:39,496
In some sense that's still not about the estimate itself.

72
00:13:39,497 --> 00:13:43,897
It's about the function. So it's an.

73
00:13:47,157 --> 00:13:54,737
And say to him had. So again, the.

74
00:13:56,027 --> 00:14:01,367
Is larger. Well, uh. So say damn hard by definition maximizes them.

75
00:14:01,367 --> 00:14:05,077
And so that's the largest. Well, then we get, uh.

76
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:09,197
So if I substitute the true parameter value into the.

77
00:14:09,317 --> 00:14:18,587
And I'm getting something worse, uh, something short of a maximum, but that short of a maximum disappears a symptomatically.

78
00:14:18,587 --> 00:14:23,997
So I have a random variable that goes in probability to zero.

79
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:29,047
The notation for it is o the small o p of one.

80
00:14:30,207 --> 00:14:36,357
So this is random variable that deals in probability to zero.

81
00:14:38,467 --> 00:14:48,727
Okay. So these two conditions are about the functions and, and, uh, and like the, uh, kind of amputees.

82
00:14:48,907 --> 00:15:01,237
Sad. So they are to ensure that in both of estimates and in general for any theta goes to the function them in some way.

83
00:15:01,327 --> 00:15:09,757
Right. But we need additional condition to ensure that uh, uh, from the convergence of a function of an estimate,

84
00:15:09,757 --> 00:15:21,277
we can deduce the convergence of the estimate itself, which is the consistency that we want to prove and that needs to serve conditions.

85
00:15:23,107 --> 00:15:40,467
That's called the separated maximum. And that's basically says that if I take the maximum excluding over the area that excludes.

86
00:15:42,647 --> 00:15:53,417
The true barometer, the absolute neighborhood of the true parade itself, right outside of the absolute neighborhood, the Theta Star.

87
00:15:54,107 --> 00:16:06,287
So if I maximize my function of theta, then I'm getting something strictly worse than the true maximum.

88
00:16:15,887 --> 00:16:23,697
The. The true mix of the star.

89
00:16:26,767 --> 00:16:32,977
Right. Or the equivalent would be that this is less than.

90
00:16:33,857 --> 00:16:43,507
Am. Of the staff, minus some 8 to 8, is generally a function of absolute and greater than zero.

91
00:16:49,757 --> 00:16:57,187
Right. Because if some numbers less than another number, I can squeeze a number greater between them.

92
00:16:57,647 --> 00:17:10,727
This is what they. Yes. Okay, so let's do the proof and we'll just go.

93
00:17:10,737 --> 00:17:27,417
One, two, three. So we'll start with the and this condition condition two is called approximate maximize or approximate maximum.

94
00:17:33,527 --> 00:17:37,607
So the law of large numbers is clear and the separate max.

95
00:17:38,087 --> 00:17:46,187
Uh. Uh. So it means that if I have some kind of a function, right, I have the true parameter theta.

96
00:17:47,327 --> 00:18:01,467
So if I step away from it and do an epsilon, uh, neighborhood of that true parameter theta, then I can always cut.

97
00:18:03,037 --> 00:18:08,837
Uh, uh, the the top of that thing that will contain my maximum.

98
00:18:10,977 --> 00:18:26,697
And this this is going to be and say to staff minus eight line rates and the overall maximum point is an oscillator star.

99
00:18:26,877 --> 00:18:32,097
Right. So it's separated in the sense that for any epsilon greater than zero I can.

100
00:18:34,657 --> 00:18:38,797
At the top of that scene will be within the.

101
00:18:38,797 --> 00:18:50,767
Absolutely. Neighborhoods of to star rates and anything outside the maximum will be lower than that.

102
00:18:52,087 --> 00:18:57,007
So I'll start with the approximate maximize as a condition to.

103
00:19:00,237 --> 00:19:05,327
And so that means my yeah man of the the star.

104
00:19:05,867 --> 00:19:13,396
So I'm rearranging terms and writing it in terms of Yeah, man, we'll see this time instead of this one.

105
00:19:13,397 --> 00:19:21,837
Right? So I'm bringing it to the left. Or so precisely.

106
00:19:21,837 --> 00:19:27,267
I'm bringing the the smaller end, the variable that goes to zero to the left right and.

107
00:19:29,637 --> 00:19:34,137
So that's less equal and.

108
00:19:35,357 --> 00:19:40,397
Theta and. So now. Plus or p of one.

109
00:19:41,787 --> 00:19:44,937
So that's just rearrange the terms in the.

110
00:19:46,367 --> 00:19:49,667
Approximate max condition then.

111
00:19:50,177 --> 00:20:01,157
So with these, I'm, uh, I'm going to subtract m of theta and star from both sides of the equation.

112
00:20:02,907 --> 00:20:10,787
Of the inequality rate. So then I'm heavy.

113
00:20:10,817 --> 00:20:21,077
And then. Of the true parameter value minus m of the estimate was equal.

114
00:20:22,727 --> 00:20:27,227
Yeah. And what's the estimate, Miles?

115
00:20:27,257 --> 00:20:32,997
Um, and. Minus some of the estimates.

116
00:20:42,847 --> 00:20:47,227
And I have a little bit of one still there.

117
00:20:47,857 --> 00:20:51,367
Okay. So they, um. Um.

118
00:20:52,267 --> 00:20:56,797
So the amount of, uh, theta star.

119
00:20:59,417 --> 00:21:03,587
That's equal to amnesty to.

120
00:21:05,137 --> 00:21:08,677
Star plus appeal for one.

121
00:21:15,177 --> 00:21:18,567
That's from the uniform convergence.

122
00:21:23,987 --> 00:21:30,417
So the uniforms of large numbers. Right.

123
00:21:30,427 --> 00:21:39,447
So by that law. So when I take the difference between a man and uh, uh, about the same value of the argument.

124
00:21:40,197 --> 00:21:43,347
So that thing is supposed to go to zero asymptotically.

125
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:57,827
Uh, so I have two, uh, variables to go to zero asymptotically, so I'll merge them into one and then I can rearrange.

126
00:22:00,437 --> 00:22:07,147
The inequalities I have. And I'll say just STARR miners and.

127
00:22:08,757 --> 00:22:14,877
The estimates. This is less an equal.

128
00:22:15,957 --> 00:22:21,117
Yeah. And they talk and have minds and.

129
00:22:22,947 --> 00:22:28,077
And at last this marriage will be a form.

130
00:22:28,977 --> 00:22:36,807
Now, of course, op of one, it doesn't matter which side of the inequality I write this term and whether it's a plus or a minus.

131
00:22:38,067 --> 00:22:48,387
So it's it's written in such a way that you can think of it as being a non-negative random variable, but it's essentially inconsequential.

132
00:22:48,387 --> 00:22:55,117
Right. And this is, of course, less equal.

133
00:22:55,417 --> 00:23:00,037
So what? Um, so at this point,

134
00:23:00,037 --> 00:23:07,517
I can use against the law the uniform law of large numbers between the function and man and am

135
00:23:07,537 --> 00:23:12,577
because they are both on the right side of the inequality I've taken of the same arguments.

136
00:23:13,357 --> 00:23:18,547
So if I take soup of that argument, I'm getting something that's bigger.

137
00:23:21,947 --> 00:23:31,606
Or at least not smaller. Right. And this is a man of the system of states.

138
00:23:31,607 --> 00:23:34,697
And so taking over theta. Right.

139
00:23:34,697 --> 00:23:40,037
And we still have all. But this thing by the uniform.

140
00:23:40,037 --> 00:23:50,037
The law of large numbers. So condition one that puts these going to zero in probability.

141
00:23:51,507 --> 00:24:01,127
And that would mean since I met your eyes, the left part and found the right part is 001.

142
00:24:01,347 --> 00:24:06,337
Then the left part is also. B of one.

143
00:24:06,357 --> 00:24:11,567
So I have. Of say in ads.

144
00:24:13,757 --> 00:24:18,747
And. They starve. So that goes to zero.

145
00:24:20,187 --> 00:24:25,287
Probability. Okay.

146
00:24:26,267 --> 00:24:30,037
So that's that's what was promised.

147
00:24:30,557 --> 00:24:33,587
Right. So we show that.

148
00:24:35,497 --> 00:24:39,477
It's sort of the consistency that we want to prove.

149
00:24:39,487 --> 00:24:46,957
But we did show that some function of an estimate goes to some function of the true parameter value.

150
00:24:48,657 --> 00:24:56,847
Right. And that is in terms of the true function. And it's so it's clear that the additional conditions on that function,

151
00:24:57,627 --> 00:25:05,847
I will be able to deduce that the estimates, the arguments themselves follow the same law.

152
00:25:06,297 --> 00:25:14,877
Right. And so I need the third condition to do that addition three, which is separated maximum.

153
00:25:17,427 --> 00:25:20,857
So let's let's look at it again. Right.

154
00:25:20,937 --> 00:25:24,347
It's a condition on the true function.

155
00:25:24,367 --> 00:25:29,907
And in terms of an estimate, that's the three tests.

156
00:25:29,997 --> 00:25:32,067
Where is it? Oh, there it is. Right.

157
00:25:34,277 --> 00:25:44,896
So it says that if I take the maximum over outside of the area around the true absolute the area around the true parameter value,

158
00:25:44,897 --> 00:25:50,687
then I'm getting something smaller, right? Both are in terms of the function and right.

159
00:25:50,837 --> 00:25:56,537
So I'm almost there as far as my last expression is concerned.

160
00:25:57,027 --> 00:26:06,077
Uh, what? I'm going to look at it this way. Uh, so what it means is that for any epsilon, uh, greater than zero.

161
00:26:07,487 --> 00:26:13,117
So let's say. Let's make sure it's not lost.

162
00:26:14,557 --> 00:26:23,167
So for any epsilon greater than zero from this inequality, I have, uh, uh.

163
00:26:23,647 --> 00:26:33,797
This inequality. So that means that.

164
00:26:33,947 --> 00:26:38,897
So if I take something. So for any epsilon greater than zero.

165
00:26:40,087 --> 00:26:50,767
And if I take, say to my status the greater equal Absalom, then the consequence will be that.

166
00:26:53,067 --> 00:26:59,147
I am. The star, minus the estimate.

167
00:27:01,807 --> 00:27:09,577
Would be great. Etta Right. So that's this condition set in somewhat different words.

168
00:27:09,907 --> 00:27:14,797
And what that means is that for any element of the event on the left,

169
00:27:15,067 --> 00:27:20,767
it is also an element of the event on the right, that means the event on the left.

170
00:27:22,067 --> 00:27:50,017
He's a subset of the event on the right. Writing for such events where one is a subset of another, then the probability of these events.

171
00:27:52,687 --> 00:27:57,667
Getting be equal probability of this event.

172
00:28:02,317 --> 00:28:13,927
Right. And if I look more carefully of what this thing is, so this is what we proved was probability to zero, right?

173
00:28:14,317 --> 00:28:19,337
So that's the star. That would prove using the first two conditions.

174
00:28:20,537 --> 00:28:25,727
Now, the star would mean that the probability of this event goes to zero.

175
00:28:26,997 --> 00:28:30,927
And it was to infinity. And this is by the staff.

176
00:28:32,697 --> 00:28:36,297
Now, of course, we have Madura is the left part.

177
00:28:37,197 --> 00:28:42,147
So that means that the probability that.

178
00:28:45,237 --> 00:28:51,617
State by state to star. It's a collapse.

179
00:28:52,677 --> 00:28:57,227
So they have to do this to zero. It goes to infinity.

180
00:28:57,227 --> 00:29:01,257
And that in turn, means, by definition, the.

181
00:29:06,417 --> 00:29:11,317
Okay. So. And here this is not just the seat.

182
00:29:16,907 --> 00:29:21,707
So then theta and have goals and probability to say to stop.

183
00:29:37,037 --> 00:29:42,557
So we basically take specific data to express this condition.

184
00:29:48,147 --> 00:29:54,287
Separate the black smoke. Because it's valid for anything to.

185
00:29:57,957 --> 00:30:01,647
Okay. And that's the end of the proof, because that means consistency.

186
00:30:11,667 --> 00:30:15,177
Now, what about the Z estimate of.

187
00:30:21,047 --> 00:30:24,287
Consistency of the estimate of.

188
00:30:26,577 --> 00:30:33,747
We already did the main leg work that. It's required to show that.

189
00:30:36,287 --> 00:30:51,777
This was consistency of the amnesty to. Now the idea is to cast the.

190
00:30:54,137 --> 00:30:58,097
Zestimate the estimate and refer to the previous year.

191
00:30:59,847 --> 00:31:03,597
But the conditions then would be so.

192
00:31:03,597 --> 00:31:16,527
We still have uniform law of large numbers that says that the norm of PSI in minus PSI, the soup norm, again, it goes from ability to zero.

193
00:31:19,407 --> 00:31:29,277
This is so long. Now the second condition is they separated.

194
00:31:30,797 --> 00:31:39,977
So which way was that? The approximate growth rate.

195
00:31:39,987 --> 00:31:43,187
So let's preserve the same order of conditions.

196
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:53,187
Approximate mode. So here we require that I am.

197
00:31:54,697 --> 00:31:58,267
Fate and hence he is in general.

198
00:32:00,087 --> 00:32:04,107
Something that goes to zero asymptotically.

199
00:32:05,337 --> 00:32:09,566
Now, of course, most of the time you solve the equation.

200
00:32:09,567 --> 00:32:14,577
Exactly. So then this I am afraid down here there's exactly zero.

201
00:32:14,577 --> 00:32:16,197
Right. And I'll just assume theoretically.

202
00:32:16,617 --> 00:32:25,167
But this allows some wiggle room in generality in case you have an algorithm that can only approximate the solution.

203
00:32:26,247 --> 00:32:32,277
Not to give you the exact once and then. So the third condition is this separated route.

204
00:32:37,137 --> 00:32:41,667
Yeah. This means that. So for any epsilon greater than zero.

205
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:46,557
So if I look for the root.

206
00:32:49,407 --> 00:32:53,887
Of the. So I.

207
00:32:54,887 --> 00:32:59,027
I'll stay to. Over.

208
00:32:59,747 --> 00:33:13,597
Say it. It's. That is outside of the absolute neighborhood of the true parameter value.

209
00:33:16,567 --> 00:33:20,827
Uh, then this is going to be greater than zero.

210
00:33:32,387 --> 00:33:39,977
And like I said in the statement of the theorem, so then the estimate is consistent.

211
00:33:42,157 --> 00:33:55,667
The estimate. So that's their statement of the fear.

212
00:33:57,047 --> 00:34:05,777
Okay. So in the proof, like I said, is about verifying the conditions and casting the Z estimate as an estimate.

213
00:34:06,527 --> 00:34:12,047
So we already gave, uh, the simplest way to do that.

214
00:34:12,057 --> 00:34:17,837
So we'll say that the function now is going to be minus.

215
00:34:21,537 --> 00:34:25,257
Normal the function. Sorry. And same with the M and.

216
00:34:39,887 --> 00:34:46,547
So here we passed. See?

217
00:34:47,077 --> 00:35:05,107
Yes, to me too, as an estimate. They and so I have uniform law of large numbers the tells me that.

218
00:35:07,637 --> 00:35:12,107
So I'm trying to see if it works right. So I'm writing it as a soap.

219
00:35:12,797 --> 00:35:19,247
Or I'll say to a man, I am with a man defined as above.

220
00:35:20,927 --> 00:35:28,337
So that's going to be simple the seed. Of the norm.

221
00:35:30,257 --> 00:35:34,397
CI and so the absolute value right in this case minus.

222
00:35:38,607 --> 00:35:45,747
So I can say to you, I suppose I'll say it as a norm. I suppose that's what I wanted spelled out.

223
00:35:46,797 --> 00:35:52,947
Uh, and at this point, I need what's called reverse trend or.

224
00:35:58,577 --> 00:36:11,447
Quality. So I have the usual triangle inequality.

225
00:36:11,447 --> 00:36:15,197
That means it's best to visualize the vectors.

226
00:36:15,977 --> 00:36:22,637
So let's say I have two ways to reach from A to B, I have the straight one.

227
00:36:24,967 --> 00:36:33,937
And then I have the way through the third buoyancy and triangles and qualities as dance.

228
00:36:34,387 --> 00:36:38,017
So a way. So the sea is longer than the direct one.

229
00:36:39,217 --> 00:36:45,996
And so the length of the path is, let's say this is x vector.

230
00:36:45,997 --> 00:36:52,797
This is why vector. And this is x plus y vector.

231
00:36:54,067 --> 00:37:01,937
Right. So that means that. So my path X plus y.

232
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:12,567
So that's the one. So the C. It's a greater equal than the past.

233
00:37:13,917 --> 00:37:19,287
Do X, which is X plus Y, right? So that's the triangle inequality.

234
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:31,167
Now the reverse triangle we get by substituting by taking new x equal to x minus y.

235
00:37:32,807 --> 00:37:39,167
Right and substituting leads into the triangle, and then the quality gives me that.

236
00:37:40,037 --> 00:37:43,247
So the x plus Y is going to be just x.

237
00:37:46,797 --> 00:37:49,927
And that's less equal.

238
00:37:50,797 --> 00:37:54,127
So my X will become X minus Y.

239
00:37:55,117 --> 00:37:59,227
And then my wife will stay away. Right. So I have this.

240
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:05,497
And then rearranging the terms. I have that normal of X minus normal for Y.

241
00:38:06,717 --> 00:38:09,777
Is less of the norm, minus one.

242
00:38:11,447 --> 00:38:18,997
Okay. Yeah. And I'm having the difference between the two.

243
00:38:20,907 --> 00:38:24,747
Of them, right? Here.

244
00:38:24,757 --> 00:38:30,517
So I'm getting something larger according to the reverse triangle quality.

245
00:38:31,357 --> 00:38:38,197
So I'm getting that this is less of equal supply, theta of the norm.

246
00:38:40,217 --> 00:38:55,537
So that's a minus sign, right? And this one, by the uniform law of large numbers goes to zero is and goes to infinity which.

247
00:39:01,957 --> 00:39:10,607
By the condition of the serum. Well, that was what condition one for.

248
00:39:12,397 --> 00:39:26,477
Condition one of the serum. And from there it implies that the uniform law of large numbers in the previous.

249
00:39:31,997 --> 00:39:35,157
For. Yeah, man. Them.

250
00:39:38,657 --> 00:39:49,577
All right. So we checked the this one. So then let's take the separated.

251
00:39:49,597 --> 00:39:55,277
Let's verify. Now verify.

252
00:39:57,117 --> 00:40:07,107
The. So for me, it's maximum for the M that we define as, uh, minus normal, say.

253
00:40:08,307 --> 00:40:17,967
So that condition. So I need to look at, uh, Thetas outside the Epsilon neighborhood.

254
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:28,767
Maximized my function over that area outside of the true parameter value.

255
00:40:30,037 --> 00:40:34,676
So that's. The soba so far.

256
00:40:34,677 --> 00:40:40,707
I recalls. How. That was defined so that the soup of the.

257
00:40:44,397 --> 00:40:55,647
Absolute value of that site. And that is the same as minus the symbol of absolute value of the CI.

258
00:40:57,007 --> 00:41:03,737
And by the separated, not so separated root condition of this theorem.

259
00:41:04,807 --> 00:41:09,367
So my in seven was greater than zero for eight over such the neighborhood.

260
00:41:14,727 --> 00:41:17,937
And because there's a minus. So that would be less than zero.

261
00:41:20,827 --> 00:41:25,197
And so by the by construction.

262
00:41:32,427 --> 00:41:38,947
So the. Sigh of the true parameter value is zero.

263
00:41:41,737 --> 00:41:48,997
That's what the estimation was about. Right? So I can write that the zero is by definition.

264
00:41:53,807 --> 00:41:56,877
Mine was. So I.

265
00:41:58,307 --> 00:42:01,937
The star. Now?

266
00:42:02,627 --> 00:42:06,887
It depends. I'm somewhat sloppy about the norm and the absolute value here.

267
00:42:09,077 --> 00:42:12,647
So they have some valuable work if my function is.

268
00:42:13,827 --> 00:42:21,957
Just scalar. So if we're talking about the vector valued function, then I would have to put the norm and then the standard as Euclidean are great.

269
00:42:22,857 --> 00:42:25,947
But that's not the essence of the theorem.

270
00:42:25,947 --> 00:42:32,397
So I'm somewhat sloppy of this notation. Perhaps I just need a note.

271
00:42:34,347 --> 00:42:40,117
Use. These for scale are.

272
00:42:42,737 --> 00:42:48,847
So I use. I would normally see a comedian.

273
00:42:55,037 --> 00:43:00,057
For the next hour. Right.

274
00:43:00,707 --> 00:43:07,507
And then you lose some function or normal.

275
00:43:16,197 --> 00:43:22,007
Sorry. These. Infinity dimension.

276
00:43:27,597 --> 00:43:34,107
That third thing. Even though it's sometimes needed.

277
00:43:34,377 --> 00:43:38,857
But it's outside of this course. I'm not going. Avoid.

278
00:43:44,567 --> 00:43:57,257
Okay. So this tells us that the separated Max is satisfied for its separated routes.

279
00:44:01,177 --> 00:44:06,007
So from the separated roots we see that separated max conditions satisfied.

280
00:44:19,837 --> 00:44:25,627
Okay. So it remains to use the to verify the approximate maximizer.

281
00:44:43,927 --> 00:44:48,697
And we'll start with, uh, a man of, uh, theta m hat.

282
00:44:50,137 --> 00:44:55,567
So that's by definition minus. So I am.

283
00:45:01,157 --> 00:45:05,657
So again, according to the note above. So that's written for a scalar.

284
00:45:05,747 --> 00:45:09,407
And, uh, if it's a vector, then it's a Euclidean norm.

285
00:45:12,517 --> 00:45:15,577
And so that is by the.

286
00:45:16,557 --> 00:45:27,477
Approximate road condition minus oh, once again, it doesn't matter whether it's a minus or plus.

287
00:45:29,277 --> 00:45:37,177
Then from there, just arranging terms, I will have that amount of data in.

288
00:45:38,137 --> 00:45:44,257
And plus something that is a synthetic and a zero that is equal to zero.

289
00:45:46,587 --> 00:45:54,437
Then. So also. I have an image of a star.

290
00:45:56,237 --> 00:46:03,847
That's again, by definition. So I must say to start with the sort of value.

291
00:46:05,677 --> 00:46:17,437
There is of course, lesser equals zero and zero is equal from the previous equation to and.

292
00:46:18,787 --> 00:46:22,597
Well, state in hand. Plus a group of one.

293
00:46:27,387 --> 00:46:35,847
Now looking at the left and the right part and combine it into a single inequality so that.

294
00:46:38,227 --> 00:46:47,367
He's a man of faith, the star of the day, and had his greater equal amount of faith to star minus all of what?

295
00:46:47,377 --> 00:46:54,937
It's just rearranging terms in the previous line, dropping the needle except for the lesser equals sign.

296
00:46:55,897 --> 00:47:00,097
And that means this is the approximate Mike's condition.

297
00:47:06,247 --> 00:47:22,827
Conditions satisfied? So for the way of representing the Z estimates is an estimate with M defined as minus PSI.

298
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:29,557
So we basically showed that all the estimation consistency theorem conditional says is valid.

299
00:47:31,917 --> 00:47:35,277
So that means by the.

300
00:47:36,427 --> 00:47:39,757
And estimate a consistency here and.

301
00:47:44,957 --> 00:47:51,377
I have the data and here is a consistent estimate of the true parameter value.

302
00:47:52,647 --> 00:47:55,657
And. This is.

303
00:48:00,587 --> 00:48:04,877
And that's just the first step of our typical procedure, right?

304
00:48:05,837 --> 00:48:10,697
So when we have a new estimate us so the first step is proving consistency.

305
00:48:12,467 --> 00:48:18,477
So we have given the essentially a general theorem about that.

306
00:48:18,497 --> 00:48:23,687
There are many specific ones and in particular.

307
00:48:23,867 --> 00:48:30,387
So the thing that is not. Very efficient.

308
00:48:31,207 --> 00:48:35,017
In terms of conditions. Right.

309
00:48:35,227 --> 00:48:44,436
So the. The condition of the uniform law of large numbers is too strong and hard to verify.

310
00:48:44,437 --> 00:48:50,727
Right. The approximate maximizes another condition that's not easy to verify.

311
00:48:52,777 --> 00:48:58,477
So we have the classic lunch numbers, right?

312
00:48:59,047 --> 00:49:04,626
So the fact that so between the two functions go to zero in probability,

313
00:49:04,627 --> 00:49:10,987
it's actually stronger than to say that for any fixed theta from the parameter space capital theta.

314
00:49:11,407 --> 00:49:19,347
So a man of faith will go to m of, uh, theta in probability, right?

315
00:49:19,357 --> 00:49:29,656
Because that statement is just requiring the classical law of large numbers to work for m for every argument in the parameter space.

316
00:49:29,657 --> 00:49:36,597
But that argument is fixed, right? So the norm thing is, is, uh, a stronger condition than that.

317
00:49:36,607 --> 00:49:39,907
And we did use the norm condition in the proofs.

318
00:49:41,277 --> 00:49:51,567
So those two are actually. Pretty strong versions of the serums and it would be nice to relax.

319
00:49:53,787 --> 00:50:00,747
So. Relaxing. The.

320
00:50:02,157 --> 00:50:12,727
Uniform was a large number. And for the interest of time, we're not going to prove it.

321
00:50:12,997 --> 00:50:21,337
We'll just state an alternative version of the theorem that does not use the function of convergence.

322
00:50:21,337 --> 00:50:29,157
SILVERMAN To help. So this is going to be a feeling without proof.

323
00:50:33,327 --> 00:50:37,707
So the conditions will be point wise.

324
00:50:41,577 --> 00:50:51,487
Convergence. So saw in the theater.

325
00:50:52,747 --> 00:50:58,067
He's. Required to go to Science Theater.

326
00:50:59,487 --> 00:51:03,447
For any theater in this space.

327
00:51:10,217 --> 00:51:14,207
So that's not so clear, right? Then?

328
00:51:15,147 --> 00:51:22,077
Well, there's a payment always for being more than one condition, then other conditions become more complicated.

329
00:51:23,277 --> 00:51:31,587
And we have two versions of it. So either. That would be a.

330
00:51:33,127 --> 00:51:37,777
Sigh and is uh, a continuous function.

331
00:51:47,177 --> 00:51:56,037
With you need zero. It's the.

332
00:52:04,927 --> 00:52:13,957
Right. So there are two stronger versions because in the previous theorem, so the uniform law of large numbers was a very strong condition.

333
00:52:14,737 --> 00:52:17,447
But then having reflects that, uh,

334
00:52:17,617 --> 00:52:25,897
so this condition is stronger because we didn't talk about continuity of the outside and we were able to say and so now we are requiring it.

335
00:52:26,407 --> 00:52:34,117
We also required the syntactic, uh, root of the pie and now there's this unique growth.

336
00:52:35,487 --> 00:52:42,607
And they estimate also that the estimate is the exact root of equals zero equation.

337
00:52:43,357 --> 00:52:50,017
Right? So it's, uh, stronger than the previous condition in two ways or.

338
00:52:52,127 --> 00:53:01,367
So instead of the E so we can use D which says that CI and is monotonic.

339
00:53:06,327 --> 00:53:19,207
In the non strict sense. So now does not require continuity, but it does require honesty and stamp and.

340
00:53:22,737 --> 00:53:28,617
And it relaxes the park in the way that says that they they have is the exact zero.

341
00:53:28,647 --> 00:53:32,277
So now it says that this is in this Antarctic zero.

342
00:53:40,237 --> 00:53:43,877
Zero. Sorry. And.

343
00:53:45,997 --> 00:53:52,057
That means that in our state, in health is all of one.

344
00:53:52,447 --> 00:53:55,627
Right. So in a sense, we are back to the.

345
00:53:56,787 --> 00:54:00,917
It's entirely possible that we had in the previous theory.

346
00:54:02,007 --> 00:54:15,027
And then there's a third condition that says that the of a two star is sandwiched.

347
00:54:20,537 --> 00:54:26,357
Between. So I.

348
00:54:27,297 --> 00:54:37,767
Of 32 star plus minus. And this is for any epsilon greater than zero.

349
00:54:41,817 --> 00:54:46,707
Now. It could be sandwich. Uh. Uh, it's either these.

350
00:54:48,487 --> 00:55:00,887
Or. I like these. So say if Theta Star plus Epsilon could be smaller or greater than.

351
00:55:03,297 --> 00:55:07,857
See the star minus epsilon. Okay.

352
00:55:07,947 --> 00:55:20,257
And so then. Faith in hearts goes from reality to the true parameter value, meaning that the estimate is consistent.

353
00:55:22,667 --> 00:55:27,137
So that's the end of the theorem in the relaxed condition.

354
00:55:27,797 --> 00:55:32,027
Now, in the sets of problems that I posted, I don't remember which one.

355
00:55:32,417 --> 00:55:43,667
There's one about the medium. And that medium actually uses this version of the theorem because the previous one is the harder to pursue.

356
00:55:44,987 --> 00:55:51,137
These conditions are actually easier to verify and they work for the medium as an estimate of.

357
00:55:52,217 --> 00:55:55,617
Okay. Let's have a break and continue after the break.

358
00:57:25,677 --> 00:57:32,867
That's that's how the condition is formulated. There wasn't that right.

359
00:57:32,867 --> 00:57:36,007
So. That's a double check.

360
00:57:40,837 --> 00:57:47,657
Before relaxing. Yeah. Let's just double check.

361
00:57:48,817 --> 00:57:53,797
Yeah, I agree. There should be an end. Yeah.

362
00:57:55,187 --> 00:58:23,297
It's the two here, right? You know, there's in the previous inequality as well.

363
01:01:42,637 --> 01:01:50,137
Okay. Shall we continue? So now we are done with the first step.

364
01:01:52,117 --> 01:02:02,107
We're shown consistency. And so the next step is about West Antarctic normality, for example, or sort of distribution.

365
01:02:02,617 --> 01:02:10,477
It's about convergence rather than convergence and probability, and there's got to be a normalization and so on.

366
01:02:11,437 --> 01:02:16,357
So we presume that consistency is already established.

367
01:02:17,227 --> 01:02:25,747
So we have theta and have. As a consistent.

368
01:02:29,687 --> 01:02:34,097
Estimate the true parameter value of, say, the star.

369
01:02:36,027 --> 01:02:45,387
Right. And that essentially means that sci fi construction so so sorry if Theta Star is zero.

370
01:02:45,777 --> 01:02:50,007
So we are in the Z estimation framework.

371
01:02:50,907 --> 01:02:57,707
And so we assume that theta and head is an exact.

372
01:03:04,757 --> 01:03:13,767
Side of the table. Zero. So it's more in the spirit of the second consistency serum and the first two ones.

373
01:03:16,267 --> 01:03:19,717
Okay. And so the regular some.

374
01:03:28,247 --> 01:03:32,117
Means that there is a square the Venn rate of convergence.

375
01:03:38,657 --> 01:03:45,327
Most of the time this is true and we are looking at square of the and.

376
01:03:46,217 --> 01:03:49,487
Theta in the hand minus theta.

377
01:03:50,627 --> 01:03:53,777
And we want it to be a weekly somewhere.

378
01:03:56,297 --> 01:04:11,576
So that's the argument we're trying to build. And so, again, in the spirit of the Second Theorem, so remember, it required continuity for the site.

379
01:04:11,577 --> 01:04:20,066
And so we require here not only continuity but uh, um, differential ability.

380
01:04:20,067 --> 01:04:23,127
So that's a stronger one. So we assume.

381
01:04:26,147 --> 01:04:29,907
The. Yeah.

382
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:43,517
Essentially a three term Taylor expansion. What's.

383
01:04:47,127 --> 01:04:51,307
For the. Right.

384
01:04:51,377 --> 01:04:54,677
So for the function that we use for estimation.

385
01:04:55,097 --> 01:05:01,037
So what does that mean. So our site and of the estimates.

386
01:05:02,467 --> 01:05:07,387
So we assumed it's an exact code. So that's equal to zero.

387
01:05:08,397 --> 01:05:11,587
And I am using Taylor.

388
01:05:14,287 --> 01:05:18,847
Around Statista around the true parameter value.

389
01:05:20,457 --> 01:05:31,437
So that gives me. So you may have seen this argument for the year, but here it's a bit more general because I'm not saying what functions say.

390
01:05:33,087 --> 01:05:39,737
Functions are. Plus, I'm writing it as if.

391
01:05:41,177 --> 01:05:48,017
Both the function and the arguments are just numbers, scalar parameters.

392
01:05:48,017 --> 01:05:57,497
I'll then make a note how it looks in the vector parameter case and even perhaps in the functional parameter estimation.

393
01:05:59,137 --> 01:06:05,797
But the main thing is to get the information in the simplest case right where everything is just scalar.

394
01:06:07,117 --> 01:06:11,197
So that's a derivative of times, the difference between the two.

395
01:06:14,967 --> 01:06:23,027
Right. And there are a number of ways to write the Taylor series, and one of them is to use an average value.

396
01:06:23,957 --> 01:06:31,157
So that would be the second derivative of some theta and with the tilde.

397
01:06:33,377 --> 01:06:43,397
Times. At, uh, minus.

398
01:06:44,457 --> 01:06:53,697
You need to have square, right? And this guy is between.

399
01:06:57,647 --> 01:07:02,267
They say to end hard and see to start in some sense.

400
01:07:07,457 --> 01:07:12,977
Now for the case when everything is scalar and this is how I am writing it.

401
01:07:12,977 --> 01:07:17,116
It's actually it's literally between the two, right?

402
01:07:17,117 --> 01:07:20,357
So one number that's sandwiched between these two.

403
01:07:22,247 --> 01:07:29,117
We just don't know where it is. And it's a function of these two and one note.

404
01:07:30,677 --> 01:07:35,657
So the fact that it's a function, say the staff, is not limiting us in any sense,

405
01:07:36,227 --> 01:07:43,637
but the fact that it is a function of data and half of an estimate makes it the random variable based on the sample.

406
01:07:45,387 --> 01:07:52,207
Probably with independent components, if it is. In the vector case.

407
01:07:53,987 --> 01:07:58,247
That's why between. So you could put it in quotes.

408
01:08:01,697 --> 01:08:04,817
Okay. So that's the Taylor expansion.

409
01:08:05,587 --> 01:08:12,827
They. Then suppose.

410
01:08:17,637 --> 01:08:21,327
We need to flag those conditions. Right. So this is one of them.

411
01:08:24,077 --> 01:08:30,137
This is another one. This is the third one.

412
01:08:32,107 --> 01:08:37,177
They had Cy and Prime at the start.

413
01:08:37,207 --> 01:08:41,227
So that's the second term of my Taylor expansion.

414
01:08:41,977 --> 01:08:52,227
So I want it to be non zero. So in the vector case, this is going to be a matrix.

415
01:08:53,537 --> 01:08:57,727
Uh. So this is going to be a matrix.

416
01:09:00,267 --> 01:09:10,277
In the. Victor. KS And it's got to be a differential operator.

417
01:09:18,887 --> 01:09:22,457
In the functional case. Right. So functional means.

418
01:09:23,417 --> 01:09:26,927
So I have a vector with infinitely many components.

419
01:09:26,927 --> 01:09:45,257
And those components are continuous. By this condition.

420
01:09:45,527 --> 01:09:52,176
The functional case would be so in the matrix case.

421
01:09:52,177 --> 01:09:57,027
So matrix. These convertibles.

422
01:09:59,437 --> 01:10:08,157
Has an inverse rate. And then the functional keys.

423
01:10:09,107 --> 01:10:15,457
So there was a condition that's called inevitability of the differential operating.

424
01:10:31,197 --> 01:10:41,097
And all of these conditions, they have the meaning that we can express this difference out of the equation that we have in this life.

425
01:10:41,457 --> 01:10:44,457
Right. So this guy is zero. We can't do that.

426
01:10:52,547 --> 01:10:56,227
These. He's needed.

427
01:10:58,297 --> 01:11:10,557
So we can express. They have the state to star.

428
01:11:11,717 --> 01:11:19,767
From. So let's call this equation somehow say it's going to be the whole story.

429
01:11:26,157 --> 01:11:31,707
Okay. So assuming we can do that, um, so where does it lead us?

430
01:11:33,687 --> 01:11:39,237
So far express theta and heads of state or star.

431
01:11:39,687 --> 01:11:46,197
They are also multiplying both sides of this equation by the square of the van and.

432
01:11:51,007 --> 01:12:01,667
So express. They had to start in Times Square with events on.

433
01:12:03,977 --> 01:12:10,667
Two stars. So that leads us to a relationship like this square with the van.

434
01:12:12,137 --> 01:12:22,697
The difference between theater and theater star is equal to and in the numerator have minus square of the fan and.

435
01:12:23,927 --> 01:12:28,097
Theta Star and denominator.

436
01:12:28,097 --> 01:12:31,267
I have the derivative.

437
01:12:33,257 --> 01:12:39,487
The just star plus one half. So am double star.

438
01:12:39,997 --> 01:12:43,497
Double prime. Of the midpoint.

439
01:12:49,707 --> 01:12:53,057
Um. Do. With my status.

440
01:12:53,057 --> 01:12:58,687
The house was a square and we took away one of the feet.

441
01:12:58,697 --> 01:13:03,997
I am half minus three to start terms. Now I have a linear term in the denominator.

442
01:13:06,097 --> 01:13:10,387
Okay. So then the typical argument is that.

443
01:13:12,417 --> 01:13:18,717
So they saw. I am. Crime of status star.

444
01:13:20,377 --> 01:13:24,397
That's an empirical average.

445
01:13:25,807 --> 01:13:31,277
Side of the star, a five star frame rate.

446
01:13:32,687 --> 01:13:36,587
Then it's supposed to go in probability.

447
01:13:37,607 --> 01:13:43,486
So when the empirical expectation gives to the true one, that's five primacy.

448
01:13:43,487 --> 01:13:52,897
The star. You know, this is by the law of large numbers.

449
01:13:56,607 --> 01:14:03,777
Now this is going to be a zero because the expectation of a fire of Theta Star,

450
01:14:04,377 --> 01:14:10,736
Theta Star by construction is such that P of Phi Theta Star is uniformly zero.

451
01:14:10,737 --> 01:14:17,727
Then if I differentiate something that's uniform to zero, it stays zero then.

452
01:14:18,117 --> 01:14:28,586
So with the double prime, we have a similar argument, except that it's not going to be going to zero.

453
01:14:28,587 --> 01:14:32,817
So that's key. And for a double prime.

454
01:14:35,187 --> 01:14:42,176
See the shield. So because it's sand, which then the estimate is consistent.

455
01:14:42,177 --> 01:14:45,897
So that's going to go to some expectation of the.

456
01:14:47,077 --> 01:15:02,347
Second. And this is also by something classical because of the dependance that I mentioned earlier.

457
01:15:08,607 --> 01:15:20,557
Basically it takes the patterns into account or sometimes this is probably what you have done in six or one,

458
01:15:20,557 --> 01:15:24,907
what you talked about or six or two when you talked about them, really.

459
01:15:25,477 --> 01:15:32,197
So you said something like assuming that the double prime is bounded.

460
01:15:38,297 --> 01:15:48,407
And so either way, so this guy is bound, but then the consistency of the estimate will make the second term and the denominator go to zero.

461
01:15:49,937 --> 01:15:55,017
So this term will go asymptotically to some constants.

462
01:15:55,067 --> 01:16:04,867
So we're going to use Slutsky. Right, but the top term will actually have a meaningful, uh, we convergence limit, uh, uh,

463
01:16:05,027 --> 01:16:12,137
because this high end is a sum of independent random variables based on a sample, right.

464
01:16:14,217 --> 01:16:22,767
But perhaps not identically distributed. Uh, if you have not identical distribution of the members of the sample.

465
01:16:24,887 --> 01:16:32,147
So buy one version of classical and, um, classical, uh, t.

466
01:16:33,637 --> 01:16:42,927
Um. So you buy some seal t.

467
01:16:46,117 --> 01:16:50,517
We will have the square, the van. So I am.

468
01:16:52,187 --> 01:17:02,557
They just the weekly let's say to a normal distribution with mean P of.

469
01:17:03,937 --> 01:17:08,137
He's a star. That's a construction zero. And.

470
01:17:17,497 --> 01:17:24,097
The variance that's given to the expectation of the square.

471
01:17:25,107 --> 01:17:28,647
So that's the variance of the score if you're talking about we.

472
01:17:31,477 --> 01:17:36,856
So expected value of the square. Of the square. That's what it is for the family.

473
01:17:36,857 --> 01:17:41,477
But in this case, it's just some variance that's given by that.

474
01:17:42,907 --> 01:17:57,787
Expectation. Uh, and so that allows me to finally, when I bring these into, uh, this expression, uh, here in the form of a limit.

475
01:17:57,967 --> 01:18:13,837
So I will have that the square with the van theta and half minus theta star will go uh, quickly to a normal with zero mean and variance.

476
01:18:15,957 --> 01:18:33,867
Yeah. It looks like this. Let's fight crime.

477
01:18:34,537 --> 01:18:38,627
Just. A square.

478
01:18:40,287 --> 01:18:43,827
And of course, you Slutsky here.

479
01:18:49,167 --> 01:18:59,117
When I replaced. Quantities that converge on probability by their limits.

480
01:19:07,667 --> 01:19:10,917
In the convention statement. Okay.

481
01:19:11,357 --> 01:19:16,167
So that's it for today. So we have the last lecture. On Wednesday.
