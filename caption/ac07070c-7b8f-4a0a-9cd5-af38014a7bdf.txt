1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:10,080
Okay. Today, we're going to talk a little bit about how to do, Ali, that you search for UTC for any other research work that you need to do.

2
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:17,340
But before that, how you doing? Your class and your semester, everything going well?

3
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,600
We finished midterm grade, six day. All of them.

4
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:26,670
Yep. Okay. It's done.

5
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,290
Good. Good. Oh, good. I'm glad to hear that.

6
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:37,540
Okay, then we have work today to have to talk a little bit how to use our how to do, Ali,

7
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:53,650
that you search now the the website that we will use or I think most likely you are going to use for your researchers is that NCBA you from the NIH?

8
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,830
Then they say this is the address. Had you used it before that.

9
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:07,890
Yeah. Oh. Okay. Then I'm trying to log into my account, but I don't know what is happening.

10
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:13,280
But I would. You haven't done it yet.

11
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:19,800
I would recommend gopi are logging on just to set up an account.

12
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:24,450
We free the bank just to have an account.

13
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:34,090
Either. You can say if you search, for example, you are looking for article four, then you can save it and you can retrieve it later.

14
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:41,790
And also you can share that the result of yourself with anyone, for example, your mentor.

15
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:48,390
If I went to do the homework that you will need to to send me some articles that you will need to find.

16
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:58,050
Okay. Then continue with that. Then once you have created your account, you will need to logging.

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,100
And then you will get to this page.

18
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:12,930
Here you'll see the page when you are going to look for articles, reviews, meta analysis, publications about our topic of interest.

19
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:21,060
Then let's say, for example, an interested in look for coffee, drinking and risk of diabetes.

20
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:28,170
I want to see what we know about these, what people have published, what is the evidence,

21
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:35,250
whether coffee drinking is protective or harmful against diabetes or whatever, that is not evidence at all.

22
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:47,340
Then we are to do an example to them. Also, we are going to to do some filters for ourselves, for article type publication.

23
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,790
They are also what we discuss about other filters.

24
00:02:51,720 --> 00:03:02,370
We will see how safe our results. Now the first step is just to right here inform it what you want to look for.

25
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,480
Then let's say today I want to look for coffee and diabetes.

26
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:14,170
Okay, let me go to Bob. I don't know why I didn't get this treatment.

27
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,360
Okay, I'm going to.

28
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:26,870
To do it without my account. Okay.

29
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,570
Then let's see. I'm going to write here. Coffee and diabetes.

30
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:42,890
Okay. I got a lot of result song.

31
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:52,830
So that feature that we get here where you see that range publication that you are getting from 1966 up to the year 2022,

32
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:57,780
we have in total more than a thousand articles on here.

33
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:04,860
Here you'll see that if in an article you can sort your your results,

34
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:11,639
for example from our list say the most recent the ones that have been published more recently,

35
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,510
then we will start from this one that was just published in September.

36
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:20,610
All the articles talking about coffee and diabetes.

37
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:25,560
Now, most of these articles are you will see, for example, this one,

38
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:34,170
the second one that is more related to do some mental analysis here that we have some about.

39
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,760
So metabolic pathway.

40
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:48,420
Then the first what I suggest I always advise to my is to to start with some filters because this is our too much articles to read.

41
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:54,240
I you want to read that more than a thousand articles that it's up to you.

42
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:05,400
Okay, then here we have the result of 1153 articles from 1966 to 2022 when you start.

43
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:10,740
I have anyone doing that that you've test before yet.

44
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:16,560
Have you done anyone needed your search? Yeah.

45
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:20,040
Okay then. This is not new to you. Okay.

46
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:24,630
That what what kind of. How did you start this and you get all these results.

47
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:31,620
How do you start? You have to select a few articles and start with using a few.

48
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:35,040
So if you are reading, for example, I want to work on a topic.

49
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:41,699
I start using a recent review review because like it has many studies and usually it reviews.

50
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:49,350
Everything was done before. So then from the review, I know how I should like search on what and what action I should continue.

51
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:58,760
Okay. Yeah, exactly. That's it's in fact, what I what I usually I do because you have to look into reviews because the reviews they

52
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:03,149
are going to give us like the most recent evidence as to worry that will what we know,

53
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:10,350
what we don't know. Then you go to Bob Met and you said a key that in fact I'm going to select further mental analysis.

54
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:19,410
Let's say I am interested to know what are the effects of coffee intake on diabetes, but again, you can also select reviews.

55
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:30,390
Then let's go back to Bob and you'll see here that the different filters we are review, society review this is treatment analysis.

56
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:36,210
Now you'll see that now from more than 1000 articles.

57
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:40,350
I have three results. Now I have just three.

58
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:49,089
That are the results they have here. Now, that could be new one.

59
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:57,820
That will be enough to start your review, look into the analysis and see why the what we know about it.

60
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:01,310
But I'm going to make another filter, too.

61
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:06,909
In addition to a mental analysis, I'm going to include not only the meta analysis,

62
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:14,650
but also the systematic reviews to maybe to have a little more number of articles to read.

63
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:24,630
Then let's go to the permit and click systematically review.

64
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:36,480
Now I have 53 sites from 2000 to up to 2000, 22 result that I have.

65
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:43,200
Again, that is up to you or if we stop here on this day reading all these articles.

66
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:51,840
But sometimes I find it a good idea to restrict also the use of publication of these results.

67
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:58,810
Then I know they're filtered and want to use it to select.

68
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:05,160
He had blessed the last ten years of publication from 2012 to 2022.

69
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:20,069
Oh, okay. Then let's go to permit and you can select here that you read that you want to use.

70
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:35,280
I'm going to use 20, 22. So ten years from 2012 up to 2022, now we have 44 results that are the number of papers that I have here.

71
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:44,849
44 Now see here that I used three different filters, meta-analysis, systematic reviews and publication the last ten years.

72
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:53,940
And I think that is a good number 42, 40, 44 result that I feel more comfortable too managing to start reading those.

73
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:01,410
Now after you have done these, do you read all the papers or what did you do?

74
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:04,200
Why did you use one approach?

75
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:14,820
Even if it took the doctors the title and check the title check if they are observational studies, randomized controlled trials.

76
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:19,200
I try to have them more information.

77
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:23,510
Yep, exactly. That's how the title gave us some useful information.

78
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:28,470
What I'm going to do now is to to say the results.

79
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:35,010
But before that, also, I want to show you here that we have the type of features you want to use.

80
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:43,080
For example, you click here article type, different articles type of article that we can use.

81
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:52,440
If you are interactive, for example, using any particular language, usually these articles are mostly in English, but they are all.

82
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:58,530
There are few articles that are in all the language you are interested on, but most of them are in English.

83
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:08,820
Let's continue. Okay, now let's save the result, because the idea of these is that you do a search.

84
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:16,590
You should be able to save that search and to agree to review the results later on in time.

85
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:21,810
Then it is important for them to do so.

86
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:28,030
Go here to save. Click here.

87
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:33,050
All the results and you got different options here.

88
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:40,300
You can see the summary. Um, usually what I, what I, what I select is the asteroid.

89
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:48,130
Now, once you have done that, you are click create file.

90
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,360
And then you are going to get the text file.

91
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:08,240
In the tech file, you are going to have all the 44 articles that we found with the filter that we choose last the abstract.

92
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,620
Then I think that's a good start for when you are doing your search.

93
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:21,580
You start with the summit analysis, form reviews, limited use of publication, and then you can have the abstracts and you can read.

94
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:26,510
And then after that you can select whether you want to read the whole article or not.

95
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:34,580
Question So far. Okay.

96
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:47,400
Then we are not does this or that part. I think I'm not going to be able to do it because I'm having a problem logging into my account.

97
00:11:49,500 --> 00:12:02,940
But also, you can when you create you in CBS.com and you haven't done it yet, you can go here to say and you you can save your session.

98
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:07,320
You open your account. Yeah, I put all that resources.

99
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,040
Create a new collection, choose a name for your collection.

100
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:14,820
For example, this coffee library, 2000 to 22.

101
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:20,790
I'm not I think I'm not going to be able to do that.

102
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:38,800
Because yes, I am broken into my account to see if I can walk with my Google 1/2.

103
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:54,220
Let's see if I can do it. Goodnight. You mean second? Okay.

104
00:12:54,260 --> 00:13:00,800
Things working. But then again, you want to say these.

105
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:06,070
You are safe. All the results. Great.

106
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:11,900
And your collection. And I am going to call this coffee and diabetes.

107
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:22,690
I got ready credit 2022. Then I'm going to put 20, 22 eight because I already have a collection with the previous name.

108
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:25,820
I don't want to do overwriting on the.

109
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:36,000
Yeah. Split up. Not usually half that collection in your user account.

110
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:42,670
You got to add to your account. And Dashboard.

111
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,790
You see here all the different collection that you have created.

112
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:53,320
You can create different collections of article differences and then you can have four or four related.

113
00:13:54,040 --> 00:14:02,379
But I think and you see a useful feature of this is that you can share the collection with, let's say with a colleague,

114
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:11,350
with your mentor or with any other person that you want to share it to, to, to share the results that what you need to do.

115
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:17,650
This is the one that we just created, you see, that is private, meaning that no one can see this collection.

116
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:27,550
However, a public hearing in private, you can say that sentence to public and just click save it.

117
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:39,060
Now, once you have it public, you will get a link and you can share that with anyone.

118
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:44,970
For example, you can send the offering by email to anyone that anyone will have access to these activities.

119
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:51,060
Then, for example, if I click there, I will have all that is the particle that we just created.

120
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:58,770
Not that I would have usually put featured of this because then you can share the paper that you found with anyone.

121
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,810
And I'll tell you what, you will have it again in your account.

122
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:12,750
What feel so far. Okay.

123
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:16,620
What I did is we created the collection.

124
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:27,840
We change the setting from private to public. We create this link that you can share with anyone to get access to your search.

125
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:37,610
Now also this is very useful because now when you are so Meditech around to

126
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:44,660
the NIH that ask for your publications or the paper that you have published,

127
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:53,690
then rather that to beat the whole list of all your publications, even in pages, you can create a collection of all publications.

128
00:15:54,110 --> 00:16:01,730
Then you're just building your case, and then anyone can can predict their answer or your publications.

129
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:13,979
Okay. Now, if we want to get to full article, then we just need to clip that title here.

130
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:17,730
In this example, I only say this one looks interesting.

131
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:21,300
Consumption of coffee and recall the gestational diabetes.

132
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:35,320
They just click there and usually you are going to have different options for students of the University of Michigan.

133
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:45,850
You can get access to this link to that and get get it. But also now, many, many, many journals had this open access option,

134
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,490
meaning that until you are free for anyone because usually the author they pay

135
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:57,430
for the for the paper to be open access to the whole scientific community.

136
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:04,720
Now also added author pays for the journal the article to be open.

137
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:09,280
Yes that is very messed up. Yes.

138
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:16,480
Now is that this is a huge story because these.

139
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:22,380
Let me give you a little history and background.

140
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:33,660
Okay. That that that thing is down because most of this work is funded by through taxes, through the NIH public fund.

141
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:44,230
Then that has a policy that any article that we publish using nice money has to be available one year, only one year.

142
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:48,210
All that is changing, I think, right now is one year after publication.

143
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:56,420
You know, they're reading something about it that that it's going to change to having open access without exacting time.

144
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:03,300
Exactly. That that my next point thing how this work is doing is you see this other document here.

145
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:12,120
I'm going to to go to that to that to my previous base.

146
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,150
Okay. This one where number seven.

147
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,070
Okay. Okay.

148
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:22,120
The Mafia, the Y. Why?

149
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:25,310
If I start forgetting my. Give me 1/2.

150
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:51,860
He has 1/2 serving. Okay, this one.

151
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:58,580
Okay. We'll kick up the Arctic here to that negative site that you have access to that student.

152
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:04,549
Now, these are the link. These are according to energy policy.

153
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:13,340
And I think also there are funding bodies like the Well-controlled from the UK after six or a year that the publication,

154
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:21,110
the paper has to be publicly available to anyone. Now then this link that you see here, but it's only after one year of publication.

155
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:26,239
And also what I don't like about that is that the format is a little bit okay.

156
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:31,310
In this case, it's important that the same paper from that forum for the Journal because it's open access,

157
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:36,320
but sometimes the format of the article said it will be down because it's not.

158
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:44,240
The version that was published by the Journal then looks a little bit messier.

159
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:50,819
Messier. Exactly. Now, there are now many Arctic journals.

160
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:55,190
They are open access that what they say. Okay, you are the author.

161
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:59,830
They pay 2000, $2,000 depending on the journal.

162
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:04,970
When the paper is as active, then that paper is publicly available.

163
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:13,129
At the very moment when the paper is published to anyone would like an institution paying that price or not.

164
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:16,160
Because like if you're working but you get then you could use that again.

165
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:24,290
Yes. No. Okay. You are. If you want to get that paper to read it, then you can use and get it.

166
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:32,270
I'm not like but you are the one publishing the paper. Usually that money or from analysis that from your grant.

167
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:35,300
Now in your grant you have budget for publications.

168
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:39,710
You say I'm going to need, for example, $10,000 per year for publications.

169
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:48,200
I go to the New England Journal of Medicine has a different policy for the US or Europe in that

170
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:55,430
I believe here it becomes free after like six months while in Europe it's available right away.

171
00:20:56,330 --> 00:21:01,520
Yeah. Could be different policies according to our differing funding institutions.

172
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:11,120
Now the problem now you have to be careful with these because now there is a lot of predatory Germans.

173
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:15,350
I don't know if you get emails now that will start to publish you.

174
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:19,340
I want to get an email from the Evening Journal published in the Journal of Body in the Journal.

175
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:26,910
And they are just predatory journals that they just one morning they are not well,

176
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:35,930
well-regarded maybe they don't have a history of being published in scientific articles at one time.

177
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:40,010
Then you have to be careful about that. Where are you going to send your papers?

178
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:48,740
Because there are some discussions going on and then I think they are some databases in that web down.

179
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:59,690
You can look in to the reputation of these new journals, but just be careful about that in mind from now.

180
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:08,690
Deep reading, if you don't have money from grants then now getting public to get published, you in fact you need money just to pay for these.

181
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:22,340
But because many of the Germans now they are moving to the open access system, I think for a student for postdoc, they may have some waivers.

182
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:31,640
But what I feel that yeah, I think that's what is going now the, the, the application has to be open access.

183
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:41,549
Okay. Question so far. Okay.

184
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:45,060
Now they are here. You can look into more information if you are interested.

185
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:51,450
How to use PubMed. Also what I have found from time to time useful.

186
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:54,930
I just start using google in.

187
00:22:55,140 --> 00:23:00,180
I found I have finally moved out of scholar years.

188
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:06,000
Well, yes, exactly. But just put in Google search for example, any keywords that you want.

189
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:10,480
And sometimes you get articles that you don't that you don't get easily through.

190
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:14,460
But maybe you get article because you're looking for articles.

191
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:19,200
So I would say if you're not used to looking for articles, it may not pop up right away.

192
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:25,860
Mm hmm. So I would say because you're a professor of articles, it would be the algorithm.

193
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:29,850
Yes. A Google scholar will immediately take you there.

194
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:38,430
I like Google Scholar here. Also, you can choose the year or choose what you want in a certain extent.

195
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:45,030
I'll let you know. Okay. Yeah. That's another tool Google scholar to look for, for articles.

196
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:51,270
Okay. Any questions now?

197
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:57,120
Okay. Before the homework, I want to talk about these.

198
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:01,560
Okay. We are now October 24th.

199
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:11,610
Um, then I was planning the last three weeks of class to give you the opportunity

200
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,620
to give us actually a brief talk about what you want to do for good research.

201
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,100
You don't have a stellar thesis topic. That's okay.

202
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:29,459
You can just talk. Okay. This is what I would like to now, because we are here.

203
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:38,850
We have 11 students. Then I was thinking for four and three students that will does it.

204
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:42,570
It doesn't have to be a big talk lot.

205
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:51,020
I was thinking, what about like a ten minute talk and maybe allowing for five minute of questions of discussion,

206
00:24:54,660 --> 00:25:03,160
then that will be the last three weeks of class. Now, to be fair to anyone, I was planning to do this randomly,

207
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:11,750
randomly assigned me how how that sounds, although you're prepared to see that at the random sounds.

208
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:15,479
But I think if somebody has a topic random sounds fair,

209
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:19,860
but anybody that doesn't know what they're researching, you have to do presents PowerPoint presentation.

210
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:26,260
I would prefer. But this is this is I mean, it's not necessarily about you.

211
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:34,079
Yeah. You don't need to do a PowerPoint. You can you can just come back to that to to different than say one to work on the I because

212
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:40,770
these ideas all for the objective of that will be maybe to get feedback from the group,

213
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:48,770
maybe to clarify more what you want to do just feels really close.

214
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:57,920
Also is number three is about these are the idea this has to be like more like a conversation.

215
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:04,320
Like you'll say, okay, well I don't it it'll be because I would like to work in the does my hypothesis this model isn't what

216
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:10,229
I want to do that kind of not necessarily presentation you could make some slides if you want it,

217
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:14,380
but mostly an informal discussion where you can exchange ideas.

218
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:18,000
Yes. Yes. Okay. And that's less stressful.

219
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:23,310
Sorry. I come from a peak. Time to come down.

220
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:29,370
Yeah. No, in fact, I don't want to do it to give you more history that you won't really have in this semester.

221
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:36,450
It has more tools to help you with your also to practice presentation.

222
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:40,680
You have to do a lot of presentation and it has to.

223
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:48,150
I was thinking 10 minutes per student, maybe five for discussion for the exchange of ideas.

224
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:57,130
Okay, then what I'm going to do, I'm going to randomly select the dates I will send today data to date the.

225
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:03,850
And don't worry if you don't have a laptop. Great topic.

226
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:07,670
Just exchange of ideas. Okay.

227
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:13,550
This is regarding the presentations now for next Monday.

228
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:21,140
Okay. First class for next Monday. We are going to discuss about data management.

229
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,040
Then please read the this paper. I'm going to say an announcement.

230
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,979
Is that really encompassing the model for next week? Research idea and outcome.

231
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:33,110
Please read it and be ready to discuss.

232
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:41,870
Also, you have experience with data management and I will I will also like to know what what is your experience with the management of data?

233
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:47,780
And also we have our homework for next Monday.

234
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:57,950
I will be glad basically to do added that users follow these are these guidelines and interesting for you to do essays about data longevity.

235
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:02,090
Then first do dancers. How many paper do you get?

236
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:06,370
Then please register your shares to meta-analysis and systematic reviews.

237
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:16,220
How many paper to get? You see exactly what we do here about the value terminology, the referee tool less than usual publications.

238
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:20,270
How many big bet you get and think I want you for you to create a thick file.

239
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:26,740
Upload the abstract to canvas for him.

240
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:37,060
He is a week from today. AutoZone seems very eager to have a little bit of practice.

241
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:42,580
Okay. Also, I won this Wednesday.

242
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:45,220
Okay. You attended an interagency CDA seminars.

243
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:58,060
I've got a couple of interesting that talks about first I want you to help, but maybe you want to do a nutrition spartan treatment for malnutrition.

244
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:04,060
I think that would be beautiful for you to attend those seminars before you back to them.

245
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:09,010
But don't don't meet them. They're going to be interested.

246
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:14,020
Also, you are still looking for a research project.

247
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:20,590
Yes, please. Yeah. Getting in touch with me or you are just talking with potential mentor.

248
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:26,319
Please give me updated about your talks because by the end of the semester, still we have time.

249
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:31,629
We have a little more than two months, but by the end of the semester you shall have.

250
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:34,750
I really am in total discipline in my students.

251
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:38,700
The idea is to in the world ready to meet with.

252
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:46,120
Okay. Then I will post this home work later to date.

253
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:55,209
Also, I will vote. I will send an announcement about the reason for next Monday.

254
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:59,380
And also I will assign your thoughts for the last three days of class.

255
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:04,060
Okay, then we do the homework with you and we will I will see you next Monday.

256
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:07,300
Yes, I have lots more questions.

257
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:15,069
When I read the paper, I those were introduction first and you may see some interesting points in there due to the review.

258
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:28,360
And I will goes to the reference to finding B they may pay for your interesting but one nine use have that or do this for something else.

259
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:34,450
Sometimes you just find you cannot find that article yet and you don't have access to read out.

260
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:42,650
So in there I made the recommendation of upside we can look for.

261
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:48,160
Yes. Yes.

262
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:54,640
First of all, check if you are in the university network.

263
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:57,670
Sometimes it kicks you out and you lose access.

264
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,980
So make sure you are already in so you have the university access to the articles.

265
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:13,090
Second is you can actually email the authors or one of the authors and say, Hey, I need this for paper and so on.

266
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:20,290
Typically you can find their contact information and that they think you can also get it from the school.

267
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:25,990
If you don't have access, you can email the librarian like the one that came to our community class.

268
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:32,420
From? I don't know. But the one for nutrition. Are they good for you, too?

269
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:37,190
Oh. Okay. Thank you. Yep. Exactly. Yes. I remember reading that all times.

270
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:43,280
When, um. Now. When I published my very first paper.

271
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:52,280
Long time ago. You've got your study that the journal sent to you like that?

272
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:59,620
50 copies of your publication. Then you've got this hard copy thing to do with two other people.

273
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:05,150
Then usually you get that everyone who's going to have a copy of the paper that was in the paper,

274
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:10,320
but now you can just access electronic access usually as to them from.

275
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:16,940
I get our requests, for example, to them from other countries that they don't have access to that for the article.

276
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:20,520
