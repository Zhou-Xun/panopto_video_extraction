1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:06,270
This is HP 26 Legend Pro Models, an example of a linear probability model.

2
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:09,150
This is taken straight from the notes.

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:20,940
So what we do is we're going to read in a stated dataset on low birth weight, and this has 189 observations and 11 variables.

4
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:26,770
And the key variable here is called low meaning low birth weight.

5
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:31,560
If the birth weight is less than 2500 grams, that's the standard medical definition.

6
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,400
And it has several other covariates here.

7
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:45,749
We're going to use two of them. One is the continuous variable of last weight prior to pregnancy, and the other is hypertension,

8
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:51,360
because hypertension turns out to be a strong predictor of birth weight.

9
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:59,339
So here's a histogram of the birth weight variable, the continuous birth weight.

10
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:07,620
And the line here is the the marker indicating whether someone is above or below 2500 grams.

11
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:13,230
You see there's a fair fraction of the data in this dataset that has low birth weight.

12
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:30,060
And if we summarize the data, we see that the probability of low birth weight is 31%, and that's 6% of the sample has hypertension.

13
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:38,739
So first of all, if we run a regression to predict birth weight, continuous birth weight is not a binary variable,

14
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:44,080
but just birth weight as a function of last weight pre-pregnancy and hypertension.

15
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:58,059
We see that hypertension is negatively associated with birth weight, whereas so that the hypertension say binary variables.

16
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:06,340
So a mother who is hypertensive on average, their babies are about 600 grams lighter.

17
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:17,520
And pre-pregnancy weight of the mother is positively correlated with birth weight of the baby.

18
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:22,020
So that's oh alas on the continuous variable.

19
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:25,380
We see this as an R squared off point of seven, which is.

20
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,160
Not that high. There's a lot of unexplained variation in the data.

21
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:45,290
Okay. Now, if instead we run a regression of the binary outcome of low birth weight on the same two variables the outcome.

22
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,660
Shows the following.

23
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:58,910
Now the signs here are going to be reversed because the outcome one refers to low birth weight and the outcome zero refers to not low birth weight.

24
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:14,090
So mothers who are hypertensive have a almost 40%, 40 percentage point increase in the probability of having a baby that is low birth weight.

25
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,880
That's a very large marginal effect.

26
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:26,120
And for every parent, this is a little odd because there are two weight measures here, once in pounds, ones in grams.

27
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,240
But for every additional pound of pre-pregnancy weight of the mother,

28
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:37,200
the probability of a low birth weight baby goes down by less than one percentage points.

29
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:41,810
You need an increase of about £3 for a decrease of one percentage points.

30
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:47,870
We can graph this on on this table.

31
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:59,030
What this shows is the actual outcome of zero or one and the mother's pre-pregnancy weight in pounds on the x axis.

32
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:06,770
And then the two descending lines here show the predicted probabilities.

33
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:14,660
The lower line is for mothers who are not hypertensive, and the upper line is for mothers who are hypertensive.

34
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:19,640
So those lines are parallel and they're about 40 percentage points apart.

35
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:30,660
So clearly being hypertensive. Greatly raises the probability of having a low birth weight baby in this way to simple model.

36
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:35,760
There are probably other many other factors that affect birth weight.

37
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,920
But we're just doing this simple model for now.

38
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:48,710
And we see there's a downward slope, which is we've talked about higher the higher the weight of the mother pre-pregnancy,

39
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:58,460
the higher the predicted weight of the baby and therefore the lower probability of having a low birth weight baby.

40
00:04:58,490 --> 00:04:58,610
Now,

41
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:14,210
you can see here that this model predicts goes negative out here for someone who is who has a weight about well above £200 and is non hypertensive.

42
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:22,220
You see the probability, a predicted probability of low birth weight baby goes negative here, which cannot happen.

43
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:26,300
So that is just one example of what can happen.

44
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:31,660
With a with a linear probability model.

45
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:36,730
And there's something we're going to try and fix with logit and probit models.

46
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:44,260
Here is a graph showing. Haters could still see.

47
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:50,530
These are the squared residuals, which is a very simple way of looking at the outcomes.

48
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:56,290
And and you can see here that there are very strong patterns here in the data.

49
00:05:56,290 --> 00:06:00,130
You don't want to see patterns in the residuals or in the squared residuals.

50
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:06,850
And that's just a simple example of showing how the data are headers.

51
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:14,470
Scholastic The variation in the residuals is related to the X variables.

52
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:25,560
Okay. Now to a third part to this Panopto series, and that will be about logit and profit models.
