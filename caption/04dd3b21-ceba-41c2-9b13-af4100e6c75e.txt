1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:05,160
16 times.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:10,610
And like this?

3
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:32,910
Yeah, I think it's okay. Welcome back. I think we'll just go ahead and jump into it, but a couple announcements up at the top.

4
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:36,540
So the next exam is going to be in two weeks.

5
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:43,350
It's going to be the same deal as the first time. So it shouldn't be any big surprises as far as format goes.

6
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:52,440
You'll have a week. We'll. How will. I'll give you that one class period around when the exam opens for you to if you want to take

7
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,090
that time to like just kind of focus on studying up or even just take the exam at that time,

8
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:01,300
then you'll have that time to instead of coming to class.

9
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:08,040
So and then in a week your, your paper topics are due.

10
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:15,540
So I don't know how much thought you've been able to put into what your paper topics, topics are going to be.

11
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:16,889
But again,

12
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:26,850
if you have any questions or concerns about selecting an appropriate paper talk topic is just coming to office hours or email me to let me know.

13
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:32,470
Have you all chosen your paper topic yet by hand?

14
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:35,220
They would want to be one person,

15
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,150
so let me know if you're having trouble coming up with something and we can work on something together for you to do your paper on.

16
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:50,850
Um, final thing is next Monday, we'll have a guest lecturer,

17
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:57,450
Dr. Kelly Mikulski from the Department of Epidemiology that's going to talk about neuro toxicology and metals.

18
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:01,500
So if you can, you guys are all here.

19
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,579
So but for the folks that might be watching the lectures at home more often,

20
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:10,680
if you could maybe make an effort to try to come to that just because we have a guest lecture, I would really appreciate that.

21
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:17,760
It's like it's nice to get a good audience for the guest lectures. I know it can be kind of tricky to make it to every single lecture in person,

22
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:24,180
but if we can try to come out for Dr. Mikulski's lecture, I think that'll be the last guest lecture we have in this class.

23
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:31,110
So it's just going to be from here on out. So if you can come up, come out and show up in person for her lecture, that would be awesome.

24
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,069
I think that's it. Before we get back into pesticides.

25
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:42,770
Does anyone have any questions? Yes.

26
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:48,650
So you would have already mentioned this, but can you just review like how much do you want us to write for the paper topic?

27
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:54,560
Oh, the paper topic really just what your your topic is going to be chemical and then disease.

28
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:58,400
Okay. So just like a sentence or two. Yeah. Yeah. Does it have to be long at all?

29
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:02,830
Okay. Just want to get a sense of what everyone's working on so that I can, you know,

30
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:06,770
kind of prepare myself for what we're going to be going over when we're creating stuff like that.

31
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:12,020
So. Okay. Any other questions?

32
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:20,579
Well. Okay. So last time we started talking about pesticides and kind of had to leave off.

33
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:27,239
So his next few lectures, I don't know if things are going to even out where we get back to one topic per lecture at some point here,

34
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:33,000
but we might have to be kind of double dipping into a couple of different lectures for the next couple of ones because things are going to get,

35
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:41,249
you know, we're just going to kind of run over on time and things like that. But I don't think it'll be too confusing or anything.

36
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:45,840
But, you know, we'll just do our best. We might it might even out within the next few lectures or so.

37
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:49,829
So in any event we talked about, we started talking about pesticides.

38
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:54,840
I'm just going to kind of run through the slides that we went over last time real quick.

39
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:01,469
So we just talked about general pesticide usage. We talked about this sort of issue with like DDT, how, you know,

40
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:11,160
historically we had recognized that DDT was doing certain environmental damage to wildlife and so that was their use of DDT was restricted.

41
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:16,920
But then what we saw this like bounceback in malaria, this mosquito borne illness, you know,

42
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:24,030
we use this case of South Africa as an example and that kind of illustrated the tension that we have in terms of how we use pesticides,

43
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,309
what are the best use of these chemicals.

44
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:35,340
And given that they have these off target effects, if you will, in terms of impacting like wildlife, uh, and things like that.

45
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:40,770
So there's this kind of cost benefit issue that we have to think about in pesticide usage.

46
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:46,889
Um, talked about different types of pesticides.

47
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:52,650
They have insecticides, herbicides and fungicides. And then I think this is where we left off,

48
00:04:52,650 --> 00:05:01,590
where we just went through the different ways that people can be exposed to pesticides via kind of our standard exposure routes,

49
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:11,580
either inhalation through ingesting, you know, like soil or food that is contaminated with pesticides and pesticides were to end up.

50
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:15,090
Oh yeah. And in the case of like probably more so,

51
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:20,970
this would be an issue with those that are actually applying the pesticides like workers where you could get dermal absorption.

52
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:30,180
Right. Um, so kind of all the main ways that exposure that occurs that we've talked about are ways that pesticides could end up in the body.

53
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:35,890
Right. So now we're going to jump into insecticides.

54
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:44,320
That's one of the types of pesticides we talked about. So insecticides, as the name implies, are used to kill insects.

55
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:54,160
Almost all of these are neurotoxic, and so they act by impacting like neuronal signaling within insects in order to kill.

56
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:58,300
And you can see the different mechanisms here.

57
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:02,610
So some of them in which we'll talk about this one, acetylcholine escalates.

58
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:09,670
They target acetylcholinesterase, which is this important enzyme involved in neuron biology and neurotransmission.

59
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:15,759
Another one that we'll talk about in a little bit more detail are chemicals that impact sodium channels,

60
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:22,690
which are another important part of neurobiology, which Dr. Mikulski will probably talk about in much more detail.

61
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:30,190
So I won't really belabor that point too much, and she'll talk about that biology in quite a bit more depth.

62
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,520
But you have some other examples here of different mechanisms that we're not going to go through all these,

63
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:44,470
and I don't want you to necessarily memorize all these, but these are just to give you an idea of the flavor of different types of neurons,

64
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:50,650
neuro toxicants or neuro neuro biological mechanisms that pesticides can target.

65
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:57,910
So we're going to kind of just talk about these top two for the most part, for the purposes of this lecture.

66
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:10,160
So just real quick. I wanted to just mention that I might use the term CNS or penis.

67
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,739
So CNS is referring to the central nervous system,

68
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:18,709
that being the brain and the spinal cord then champions the peripheral nervous system, which is basically everywhere else.

69
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:20,410
The nerves go in the body.

70
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:27,710
So this is just like a cartoon of the few like nervous systems within the body too, so that we know what I'm referring to there.

71
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:36,440
Okay. So I talked about oh, I guess I should go back real quick, so.

72
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,540
Oh, right. Okay.

73
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:47,660
So the chemicals that act out, the pseudo cholinesterase, that cholinesterase, that enzyme, the two main types are what are called organophosphates.

74
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:54,559
One of the real big ones you hear about a lot in the news, if you follow this type of stuff,

75
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,450
is chlorpyrifos, which was like within the last few years, it was banned for use on food crops.

76
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:04,040
I think we talked about that last time. Another class is called Kava Baits.

77
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:10,430
And so these both sort of act on the same mechanism by inhibiting this enzyme called acetylcholinesterase.

78
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:15,660
And so that's illustrated right here.

79
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:23,549
So again, that you're probably going to get you're going to get in a lot more of neuro toxicology and neurobiology in the next lecture.

80
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:30,120
But for the purposes of this talk, I just want to focus on this sort of communication that occurs.

81
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,149
And this is critical to neuronal function.

82
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:39,120
Is this communication between neurons, right? So you have neuron one here and neuron two here.

83
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:45,690
And these guys need to talk to each other, right? You need to send nerve impulses from one nerve nerve cell to the other.

84
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:51,060
And there's a gap between these two nerves called the sign ups. Right.

85
00:08:52,620 --> 00:09:00,270
So one of the main ways that neurons will talk to each other is by releasing a chemical called acetylcholine.

86
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:05,100
This is a little bit of review. We talked about this on a in a previous lecture.

87
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:11,280
But so acetylcholine is released across this synapse, a synapse.

88
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:20,170
And this acetylcholine acts on the acetylcholine receptor which carries that chemical signal to the next neuron.

89
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:30,270
Right. So again, talking one to the other. Now, you don't want this process feels like a lot of the other body like bodily systems we've talked about.

90
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:34,140
This needs to be regulated, right? You don't want it turned on all the time.

91
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:40,739
You don't want a buildup of acetylcholine in those synapses because that can lead to a number of health

92
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:45,780
outcomes or bad health effects and neurotoxicity that we'll talk about in a little bit more detail.

93
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:53,370
But these are things like, say, you know, at low levels, you might get excessive drooling at a higher level.

94
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:57,629
You're talking about things like heart failure or like limbs seizing up these types of things.

95
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:03,360
So this is basically dysregulated, this neuronal communication system.

96
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,439
Does that make sense? If sorry, let me go back.

97
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,910
So this acetylcholine is integral to this neuron communication system.

98
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:18,159
And again, yeah, we need this system to be regulated.

99
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:23,530
And one of the ways it is regulated is through this enzyme called acetylcholinesterase,

100
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:27,849
which breaks down the acetylcholine basically to its constituent parts.

101
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:31,500
And then it's these constituent parts can be recycled.

102
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:38,680
Right. So you have acetylcholine binding here. Acetylcholine esterase acts on this bound acetylcholine basically chops it up.

103
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:44,050
And so then you get this choline in the societal group and it's, you know,

104
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:50,320
you basically can re reuse these constituent parts to kind of start the cycle over again.

105
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:55,870
So what this acetylcholinesterase does is basically turns off that a signal calling, signaling.

106
00:10:56,650 --> 00:11:02,290
And so what these pesticides do is to inhibit this acetylcholine esterase activity

107
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:07,360
so the acetylcholinesterase is not able to break down this acetylcholine.

108
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,680
So I've got a little ahead of myself. So if you're inhibiting this acetylcholinesterase,

109
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:18,430
you can get this buildup of acetylcholine leading to the type of health effects that I talked about, like excessive drooling.

110
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:26,380
That's like a low. Like, if you're exposed to a low level of inorganic phosphate, for example, you might see that type of symptom.

111
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:32,200
If this becomes really severe, like really severe cases of like organophosphate pesticide poisoning,

112
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:36,820
you're going to see more dramatic health effects that make sense so far.

113
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:44,440
So the other type of the other class of chemicals that we'll talk about,

114
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:50,350
such as prairie asteroids and DDT, those acts on a different part of the neuronal signaling system,

115
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:53,440
which are these voltage gated sodium channels,

116
00:11:54,100 --> 00:12:04,750
which essentially these act by carrying this nerve impulse via these opening and closing of these channels along the axon part of the neuron.

117
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:09,850
It carries the nerve impulse that way. And again, we'll get a lot more detail on that next time.

118
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:17,320
But for now, you just I just want you to know that these pyrethroid chemicals act by blocking up those channels so they're not functioning well.

119
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:24,130
So you're basically just regulating neuronal signaling in that way, acting directly on those channels.

120
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:38,050
So this excess acetylcholine at these cholinergic sinuses in the CNS and the penis causes hyperstimulation.

121
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:42,430
You know, you're getting this hyperstimulation. You're getting this buildup of this neurotransmitter within the sign ups.

122
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:51,070
And this can cause things like fatigue of the receptors and the gland glands associated with this type of neuronal function in the muscles.

123
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:58,990
Um, let's see. This is basically what I just described as just another cartoon kind of showing the same thing.

124
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:02,720
Um, yeah.

125
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:08,470
So you can get, you know, morbidity and mortality related to this excess neurotransmitter buildup within the sign ups.

126
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:22,390
So in addition to, like, organophosphate pesticides, there's a chemical warfare agent called sarin gas.

127
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:29,020
You may have heard of this one during, what, like World War Two is used in as a chemical warfare agent.

128
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:37,210
That's a basically a super toxic form of these like organophosphate pesticides that we use as insecticides.

129
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:43,419
It's much more and we'll talk about why it's more toxic compared to the original phosphate pesticides,

130
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:48,460
but that's an example of an organophosphate compound that acts via this mechanism.

131
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:57,790
So what they do is they have the sort of like molecular level is they're blocking the active site of the acetylcholine esterase enzyme.

132
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:03,540
So like where the work gets done in terms of chewing up this acetylcholine, it phosphorylated this active site.

133
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:08,590
So the acetylcholine doesn't bind and you don't get the reaction where the acetylcholine gets broken down.

134
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:13,930
Eventually the enzyme can be reactivated, but this is usually slow.

135
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:19,930
Basically, the the phosphate group will get take it back off and the enzyme will start working again.

136
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:22,780
But that's usually slow.

137
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:30,100
And in the meantime, a lot of bad health outcomes can occur if someone is poisoned with one of these pesticides, you know, including death, right?

138
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:35,380
If someone's poisoned with one of these pesticides.

139
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:49,360
SEAN Yes. QUESTION What what what are the symptoms for a person that has been that has been being in contact with the organophosphate?

140
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:53,920
Right. So there's a lot of them like anything that really related to like muscle activity.

141
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,490
You can have trouble breathing if it's and it'll depend on the severity.

142
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:04,959
Right. So like I said, kind of like the early one I just use I like uses an example of like if I hate to even say mild but

143
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:10,180
like sort of lower exposure or lower level poisoning would be something like excessive drooling,

144
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:15,219
you know, because some of that is controlled by the nervous system within within the body.

145
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:22,510
Right. And then at more severe cases, you're talking about things like limb seizing up or, like I said,

146
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:29,260
difficulty breathing heart issues, the heart's not working or heart stops beating these types of things.

147
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:36,720
So it can be very severe. I think if you think of like sarin gas, it's like pretty acutely poisonous, you know, within a pretty short timeframe.

148
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:42,940
So it does that. It's and so yeah, I would I could look up like a whole list of all of the symptoms,

149
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:51,280
but it's it's kind of a varied list because these acetylcholine, the system sort of regulates so many processes within the body.

150
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:55,720
Right. So that's some examples, though. Thank you.

151
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:04,600
So as a treatment, if someone were to be poisoned with one of these pesticides, there's a chemical.

152
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,460
There's like this two pronged approach. Right?

153
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:16,750
So one prong is this this chemical called atropine, which will actually compete with the acetylcholine and bind to the receptor.

154
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,630
So that acetylcholine does not bind to that receptor.

155
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:25,120
So instead of be still calling signaling, you're getting atropine binding up those receptors, right?

156
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:33,430
So this acetylcholine that's building up in the sign is not able to signal in the same way, uh, with this atropine competing with it.

157
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:37,510
Um, and then there's another chemical called toxin.

158
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:41,980
There's a group of chemicals called oxidants that can reactivate this little choline esterase.

159
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,120
And we'll kind of show what that works, how that works. But it's basically, again,

160
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:50,760
like kind of like chopping off that molecular blockage that is occurring at this particular

161
00:16:50,890 --> 00:17:00,280
esterase active site and then carbonates like car viral is an example these again they

162
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:04,419
block the acetylcholinesterase active site in a very similar manner but it's just a different

163
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:08,380
molecular group that gets attached to the active site instead of this phosphate group.

164
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:14,680
In this case, the reactivation can actually be pretty rapid. So the enzyme is able to recover.

165
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:19,210
Um, so it's not as severe as the original phosphate situation.

166
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:25,300
And so the treatment with that is typically to treat with atropine alone to compete with this buildup of acetylcholine.

167
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:41,400
So I just want to check. So I talked about how this, uh, this atropine chemical, it's a treatment for, uh,

168
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:46,660
you know, phosphate poisoning by blocking the acetylcholine esterase receptors.

169
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:54,070
Right. And we talked about back to the, I think in a couple of different lectures, we talked about agonism and antagonism.

170
00:17:54,820 --> 00:18:02,330
Does anyone remember what agonism and antagonism are? Because I want us to understand I want us to think about whether atropine,

171
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:09,470
if it's going to be used as a treatment for acetylcholine of organophosphate toxicity.

172
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:18,980
I want to think about whether we would predict that atropine is a competitive agonist or antagonist of the acetylcholine receptor.

173
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:29,890
So what's an agonist? Anyone remember activating receptor binds and activates the receptor?

174
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:35,350
Right. So we think about like those endocrine active compounds, those like estrogen active compounds.

175
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:40,960
They'll bind to like D.S. What's this really potent estrogen receptor agonist?

176
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:46,420
Like, turn them on almost to a much higher degree than the endogenous estrogens do.

177
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:54,670
Right. So that's an agonist. An antagonist is some not similarly, but alternatively.

178
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:03,620
They on it binds, but yet deactivates or blocks?

179
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:08,690
Yes, it binds the receptor, but it blocks the activation of that receptor.

180
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:12,560
It basically takes up space in that receptor so that it doesn't get turned on.

181
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:21,120
So would you predict that atropine, given that it's used to treat OPI or organophosphate toxicity?

182
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:28,250
Is that going to be would you want that to be an agonist or an antagonist of the acetylcholine receptor agonist?

183
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:34,620
Do you want to turn those receptors on or do you want them to be off or suppressed?

184
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:39,360
Agonist. Sorry. Agonist. You want it to turn it on.

185
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:47,010
Since the o-P is blocking the active side of the receptor and turning it off, the o-P is blocking the.

186
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:55,620
Let's go back to the o-P is blocking with the enzyme that breaks acetylcholine down.

187
00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:05,100
Right. So that's acetylcholine esterase the receptor because we don't have this enzyme around the receptor is

188
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:10,180
getting activated like crazy because there's a bunch of acetylcholine building up in that sign ups,

189
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:16,800
like just triggering these receptors. So in that case, would you want an agonist of that receptor or an antagonist?

190
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:28,480
I heard a couple of someone over here. So with the masses our is it real out antagonist?

191
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:33,910
Antagonist, right. We want something that is going to bind that receptor and block it up so they're not.

192
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:43,450
So that access acetylcholine that's building up is not accurately like triggering these these neurons basically causing these bad health effects.

193
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:51,060
Does that make sense? Okay.

194
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:56,880
So. So this is an example here.

195
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:02,670
So here you have your acetylcholinesterase. This is this enzyme.

196
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:10,260
And this is like the active part of the enzyme, right? It's not the most detailed cartoon or pictures you can see, but for our purposes, it will do.

197
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:13,890
This is the acetylcholinesterase. This is the AP pesticide.

198
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,930
Again, it's not the entire molecule of the pesticide, but kind of the important part of it.

199
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:25,590
So what happens is this okay? Pesticide reacts with the societal killing esterase and binds up this active site.

200
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:33,510
Right. Basically attaches this like phosphate containing group into the active site and that inhibits acetylcholinesterase.

201
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:40,690
So it's not able to do its job of breaking down acetylcholine. What can happen.

202
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:44,850
So you can actually reverse this process, I think. Yeah. So like the oxygen, remember?

203
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:48,959
So atropine is blocking the acetylcholine, signaling the oxygen.

204
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:56,070
This will remove that pesticide molecule from the acetylcholinesterase active site and basically reverse this reaction.

205
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:59,460
So you're like regenerating your acetylcholinesterase enzyme,

206
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:10,590
you're just like cutting this guy off and you can get the activity of the acetylcholinesterase again unless a process called aging occurs.

207
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:14,310
So it can happen is you can get CS but have a.

208
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:22,790
Yeah. So basically this other group, this is this would be like a long molecular group here that's represented by this.

209
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:26,689
Ah if you're not familiar with the way the molecular structures are drawn,

210
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:30,829
when you see an R that's basically talking about like a long chain of additional atoms

211
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:35,510
that are not really important to the reaction that you're trying to demonstrate in a,

212
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:44,090
in a figure. So in any event, if you like chop off, basically this gets hydrolyzed and this gets this group gets chopped off.

213
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:47,930
And what this is, is what this is called is aging.

214
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:56,570
And this means that the this aged acetylcholinesterase is no longer can no longer be reactivated by the oxy.

215
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:01,069
So it's gone through this process of like another chemical reaction that's kind

216
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:06,620
of like put made this like inhibition of this little cholinesterase permanent.

217
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:15,660
Okay. So if that occurs, that that means you have permanent blockage of that seal, of that enzyme.

218
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:24,110
See if there's anything else I wanted to talk. And then so it's an example of the carbonate.

219
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:32,479
This is just a carbonate molecule, like a different type of pesticide that acts on the same, the same molecule.

220
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:39,770
So instead of this phosphate group, it's this like carbon heart carbon meal group that's attached here.

221
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:42,800
And again, you're just blocking the acetylcholinesterase activity.

222
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:50,089
In this case, it doesn't undergo aging, but you're still going to get neurotoxicity because that escalates.

223
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:54,440
The acetylcholinesterase is inhibited. But you could treat that with atropine.

224
00:23:54,440 --> 00:24:03,770
And then through the sort of like normal reactivation processes of this guy being just like cut off this grouping,

225
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:08,750
sorry, because this group being cut off, you'll get reactivation of the enzymes.

226
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:15,480
So you don't need to use the oxygen in that case to reactivate the enzymes.

227
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:27,770
So sure. Do you remember years ago was a terrorist attempt in Japan in metro with gas, sarin gas.

228
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:33,920
So the people there, I suppose they were treated the way we there.

229
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:42,720
We went to school with atropine to reverse the effects of the sarin gas as much as possible.

230
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:54,740
Yeah, and probably the accent too, I would imagine, because if we go back here, it's a soap pesticide or the soap compound.

231
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,760
You're going to want to use both of these to like reactivate some of those enzymes.

232
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:10,080
Okay. And that's maybe a good lead in to.

233
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:20,040
A nice distinction that we can make between why sarin gas is so much more toxic compared to the pesticides that are used.

234
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:23,690
Right. So these are the commercially available pesticides.

235
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:29,990
Methyl parathyroid is one chlorpyrifos, kind of probably the most prominent one that we talk about a lot.

236
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:37,370
And Melissa. And then here you have sarin gas, the sarin gas molecule, this warfare agent.

237
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:44,240
And so one sort of common structure in the commercially available pesticides is

238
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:49,100
this phosphate bonded to a sulfur group that you see in all three of these.

239
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:58,959
You see this here, right? So in order to be active and do this like binding this activity of like inhibiting acetylcholine,

240
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:04,690
esterase, these pesticides actually need to be activated by our friends.

241
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:08,230
The p450 is the cytochrome p450 is to an active form.

242
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:15,250
So this chlorpyrifos gets metabolized where this s group or this atom gets replaced by an oxygen.

243
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:21,340
This is the active form of chlorpyrifos. This is the guy to inhibit acetylcholine.

244
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:25,600
Esterase. Not the this the initial chemical.

245
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:29,950
So you need to metabolize these guys to the active form.

246
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:37,049
And yeah, so this is what we call a toxic fixation going back to our ME lectures.

247
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:42,700
This is a toxic fixation reaction where we're metabolizing a chemical and making it more toxic.

248
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:49,150
Ideally, we'd always have detoxification reactions and that happens quite a bit, but it doesn't happen for every chemical.

249
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:52,690
There's a lot of chemicals where when we start to metabolize them,

250
00:26:52,690 --> 00:27:00,910
the initial metabolic step is a toxic fixation where we metabolize it to a toxic a more toxic chemical.

251
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:05,180
Right. Contrast that with sarin.

252
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:10,850
It's already got this pea bonded to oxygen structure here.

253
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:14,590
So it's already on its own. It doesn't need to be metabolized.

254
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,950
It's immediately toxic.

255
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:23,940
So it's going to start doing its work and doing its damage right away as opposed to these other guys that need to be metabolized.

256
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:31,060
Does that make sense? Okay.

257
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:43,319
So I can talk a little bit about how our bodies deal with these chemicals when we're exposed of both chlorpyrifos,

258
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:53,430
the initial chemical that's not the active form and the active form chlorpyrifos oxon are metabolized by enzymes called para oxidase or Pan one.

259
00:27:54,630 --> 00:28:02,820
And essentially what you're doing is to use a technical term, you're basically or you're hybridizing or basically chopping off the script here.

260
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:07,020
So you see how this goes from this molecule to this molecule.

261
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:11,790
In both cases, both for chlorpyrifos and chlorpyrifos oxide.

262
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:20,880
And these guys are what we use in a lot of exposure studies if you're interested in exposure science.

263
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:29,130
These are metabolites that are often used to show give us an idea of how much chlorpyrifos someone might have been exposed to.

264
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:38,730
So we'll look at those in the urine, like these are called what we call urinary biomarkers of chlorpyrifos exposure.

265
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:44,940
These are the guys you'd be looking at make sense. Okay.

266
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:49,710
I'll stop right there and just see if there's any questions or comments.

267
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,290
Good. Okay.

268
00:28:56,420 --> 00:29:05,930
So this part one enzyme is a really gives us a chance to have a really nice illustration of what we would call a gene environment interaction,

269
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:12,410
where our genetic background can influence how our bodies respond to toxicants in the environment.

270
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:20,570
And I'll show that on this next slide here. There is a polymorphism, so there's like different versions of the Pan one gene.

271
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:26,020
And so we can see this here. So people can inherit different versions.

272
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:37,070
There's just for the sake of. You know, brevity one is called upon one hour 192 or the pan 12192 version of the gene.

273
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:41,340
These are slightly different versions of the gene we'll call a bar and Q.

274
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:48,879
So in this experiment demonstrating the differences in this one so this is an experimental rats were genetically

275
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:54,550
modified to express either the the what we call the wild type or the more most common version of pond one,

276
00:29:54,550 --> 00:30:04,540
which is this R version or a common polymorphic version, which is this Q version or a set of animals that had had one completely knocked out.

277
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:10,369
They didn't have any pond, one activity at all. And so they took these animals, these three groups of animals,

278
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:17,390
and treated them with chlorpyrifos at increasing doses and then measured the

279
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:21,770
acetylcholinesterase activity in their brains after exposure to the chlorpyrifos.

280
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:25,170
And so you can see the curve here.

281
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:34,600
So in all of the cases of prior fossils inhibiting this brain acetylcholine esterase activity, but the current is are pretty obviously different here.

282
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:40,309
Right. So if you have this pattern one, uh, polymorphism,

283
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:48,140
the rats had a much more severe suppression of the acetylcholinesterase activity compared to the wildtype.

284
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,210
Does that make sense when you're comparing the curves?

285
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:59,520
And then if you were to knock out PON one completely, you get an even more severe case of suppression of a similar cholinesterase activity.

286
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:09,630
So essentially this this part one Q polymorphism is not as good or not as efficient and metabolizing chlorpyrifos.

287
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:16,950
And so that's leading to more severe phenotypic outcomes, like the suppression of acetylcholinesterase.

288
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:24,190
And this is just basically of the same a similar graph, but just showing it over time.

289
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:33,120
Right. So we see this suppression of acetylcholinesterase over time with some of the animals,

290
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:38,850
with the wild type, the AR version were able were kind of able to bounce back over time,

291
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:48,270
whereas the animals with this Q polymorphism, they didn't really bounce back after 24 hours nearly as much as the wild type animals did.

292
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:54,870
So this is a case where certain individuals will have this pon one polymorphism

293
00:31:55,410 --> 00:32:00,600
and are essentially more susceptible to the toxic effects of chlorpyrifos.

294
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:11,890
The sense. And you can think about it sort of intuitively like your body's not as good as getting rid or like metabolizing this chemical.

295
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,730
And so all of the associated health effects, you know,

296
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:22,120
would make sense are going to be more severe in someone who's not metabolizing that chemical as well as someone who who is,

297
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:31,910
you know, metabolizing it more efficiently. And so, yeah, in this case, we're talking about a detoxification.

298
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:38,239
Right? So this part one is doing a detoxification stuff as opposed to that initial tox ification stuff.

299
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:46,250
So you have both you have the pre four fifties metabolizing the initial chemical to the active form that's causing the toxicity.

300
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:52,400
And then you get another reaction catalyzed by part one that's detoxifying that chemical.

301
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:58,070
We have a nice illustration of both versions of how metabolism can work in terms of toxicology.

302
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:06,650
Show. Yes. And the atropine, that's it works in the first phase.

303
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:12,500
Phase of the metabolism or in the second one for the detoxified.

304
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:16,670
And what part of that does it work?

305
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:22,510
I guess it's going to be more useful.

306
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:30,930
To use it after the first phase because you have your toxic active form of chlorpyrifos.

307
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:40,139
Chlorpyrifos Oxon is going to be suppressing acetylcholinesterase activity during that second phase of metabolism.

308
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:43,049
I mean, you'd probably you probably have multiple things going on at once.

309
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:46,260
You probably have both reactions kind of happening at different rates, right?

310
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:48,180
So it's not like one thing happens,

311
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:56,669
but you what you want to do and what you want to do is during that period of acetylcholine build up in that sign ups,

312
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:59,780
that's when you want to have that atropine around, right?

313
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:07,170
So then, yeah, so I'm going to say, you know, I think it's the earlier the first reaction where atropine is going to be more relevant.

314
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:15,160
And in the last slide that you showed, there were markers in the urine.

315
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:27,100
Yes. Urinary levels. So it means that the expression of the toxic is going to be by the urine.

316
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:40,660
So it would helps that we the atropine is is with the water and then going to the urine and we are eliminating the toxic.

317
00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:45,640
So do you think that. Well, I don't know how it works.

318
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:54,520
Maybe we the atropine plus more water that the body would need we've eliminate faster toxic in your body.

319
00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:59,300
Yeah, that might. I need to.

320
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:02,599
I need to think about it. I don't know if I don't know if you're going to excrete it.

321
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:10,010
It's going to be the reactions in terms of like the detoxification that's going to be dependent on the activity of this enzyme.

322
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:17,180
Right. Not necessarily how much you're and you're excreting, you know, you're going to get certain, you know,

323
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:22,909
just an overall process through the kidneys and everything going, you know, at a different rate.

324
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:25,850
If you're drinking more water, you're going to have different composition to the urine.

325
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:32,600
But I think it's really going to be dependent on this enzyme activity, which may or may not be impacted by how much water one is drinking.

326
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:38,260
Does that make sense? Okay.

327
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:41,450
So, and we can also see this in people.

328
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:46,920
Um, my alma mater, University of Washington, does a lot of work.

329
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:54,140
Go huskies. They do a lot of work with farmworkers in Washington state.

330
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:58,100
My my advisor was really involved in, like,

331
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:05,420
certain cohorts of farmworkers in some of these rural areas of Washington and understanding their exposure to pesticides.

332
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:13,820
Um, so there is a paper that came out from some of the researchers at University of Washington and others to probably other institutions.

333
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:18,520
But you can kind of just see what's going on here if we walk through it a little bit.

334
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:21,740
So this is. Let's see, what were they doing here?

335
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:28,280
So this is sirup calling yesterday, so that measuring it directly in the brain, but they're measuring cholinesterase in the blood.

336
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:33,169
So this is what's considered a biomarker of pesticide toxicity that we can obtain.

337
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:38,120
We apply blood. You know, it's not as invasive as looking into someone's brain and measuring an enzyme activity there.

338
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:46,280
So these were Washington state farmers that were enrolled in this agricultural worker health study, and some of them have this.

339
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:50,360
Q genotype, you know, that we're talking about.

340
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:56,030
And the workers that had this Q genotype had a significantly increased odds

341
00:36:56,030 --> 00:37:01,460
of what what they sort of defined as significant cholinesterase inhibition.

342
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:09,649
Right. So they I don't know. Some of you may be familiar with this idea of like you have like a sort of a continuous

343
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:15,020
type of variable that being in this case are still cholinesterase inhibition.

344
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:24,240
And what they said was that if inhibition was greater than 20%, then that would be called like significant or high inhibition of acetylcholine.

345
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:32,390
And so you're decarbonizing the responses that way. So the risk of 20% cholinesterase inhibition by.

346
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:39,799
Yeah. And then compare that to the genotypes, right. So you have your reference group, which is like the the standard.

347
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:46,040
RR So someone who has both copies of the RR gene upon one and they use that as the reference.

348
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:55,340
And then for those that inherited one copy of the Q polymorphism, their odds ratio of having a significant inhibition went up, you know, to four.

349
00:37:55,340 --> 00:38:04,310
So it's like a pretty big effect rate. And then individuals that had both versions of that gene so Kuku genotype, they,

350
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:10,220
they had like ten fold increase at odds of having this acetylcholinesterase inhibition.

351
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:19,190
And they also looked at like levels of pon one activity and they could just, they could see that they're kind of broke out with like high,

352
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:22,280
moderate and low levels of part one activity,

353
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:32,780
as we would expect from like three different genotypes where we have either one or two copies of this like a Q polymorphism.

354
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:41,700
So this is a pretty cool situation where we could look at like gain really important insights from like the animal model

355
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:51,750
and then take this knowledge and see it sort of replicated in a human situation with workers working with this chemical,

356
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:58,710
allowing us to understand that there may be individuals that are more susceptible to the toxicities of this chemical.

357
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:07,650
So I think this is a really nice illustration of how the field, the toxicology could work hand in hand with like exposure studies,

358
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:15,420
like molecular epidemiology studies to really give us a better picture of what's actually happening for some of these individuals that say,

359
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:25,110
like, we work in these these fields or these industries that are facing a lot of cases like higher levels of exposure to these toxicants.

360
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:28,500
Questions and comments.

361
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:35,610
Do they ever include treatments like for people who are exposed regularly or is it like an overexposure is the only time they give treatment?

362
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:42,870
I think generally you're only going to be talking about overexposure. I don't think it's like a matter of like just daily taking because, you know,

363
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:49,180
atropine and a lot of these things that you would use as like an antidote are going to have like side effects potentially, too.

364
00:39:49,200 --> 00:40:01,440
So you don't want to just be administering something pro prophylactically or what have you before something, you know, something bad is happening.

365
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:06,830
But you can imagine the types of things that you could potentially implement in terms of if someone knows their genotype,

366
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:07,950
that they're more susceptible.

367
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:17,280
Maybe they're, you know, using different kinds of PPE or maybe they should look into if they can have a different tasks,

368
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:24,210
you know, in their job or what have you. It's just it's important information to know, like who might be more susceptible to these.

369
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:40,129
Okay. And this is just again because my advisor worked closely with in some of these studies, I didn't work on these studies,

370
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:47,960
but she was involved the way and I get to like give her a little shout out for some of her work that she's done at UW.

371
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:51,470
So one thing that she's helped to characterize in her,

372
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:58,100
her and her colleagues research is this what's called the pesticide take home pathway of exposure.

373
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:05,030
And so what you see here is some examples as they were looking within the community of those that worked on farms and those that were non farm

374
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:15,710
workers and essentially like quantifying the amounts of these pesticide residues that were showing up in the house dust and in the vehicle dust.

375
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:24,469
So like the trucks that they're driving to the worksite, for example, like the pesticides ending up in these trucks or cars that they're driving in.

376
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:30,920
And then the family, including children, may be getting into that truck or car and exposed in that way.

377
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:40,010
And then, of course, house dust. Again, we know that children are playing more on the floor compared to adults exposed to more house dust.

378
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:46,100
And then the adults that may not even be working on the farm are also going to be exposed potentially via that house dust.

379
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:51,250
And this is just looking across several different types of pesticides.

380
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:56,749
They looked at different seasons. So there's what's called the standing season where they are spraying the pesticide.

381
00:41:56,750 --> 00:42:03,320
And then another part of the season called the bounce that they refer to as the non spray season where they're not using the pesticide.

382
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:11,510
And for a lot of them, you can see a decrease in the amount that was ending up in like vehicle dust or in the house dust.

383
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:13,610
And then you could see, as you would expect,

384
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:23,570
like the farm workers are seeing higher levels of this pesticide ending up either in house or vehicle dust compared to farm workers.

385
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:28,780
But certainly the non-farm workers appear to have, you know, because they're living in the same, you know,

386
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:34,700
the same or like a close, close by community, maybe getting some of the drift of this pesticide as well.

387
00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:41,360
So yeah, that's some cool words that I just wanted to highlight. Um.

388
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:49,180
And yeah, that's a nice lead into, you know, part of what led to chlorpyrifos, you know,

389
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:54,339
being banned for like a lot of uses in the U.S. was some of the these data that were

390
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:59,800
coming out suggesting that it could have neurodevelopmental impacts like on children.

391
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:04,450
Right. And so this is kind of the striking example of a study.

392
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:09,459
And this is from Mexico, where children were asked to draw a person.

393
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:16,780
And so they kind of geographically looked at two different areas, one being the foothills,

394
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:23,650
which was thought to be kind of like low exposure to pesticides or no exposure to pesticides versus the

395
00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:28,810
valley where there was like in this particular region where there was like a lot of pesticide use.

396
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:34,810
And and I guess this was they were characterizing this as exposure in utero.

397
00:43:35,830 --> 00:43:43,510
So at, you know, around 55 months of age, they basically asked them to draw a person.

398
00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:50,800
And they did this interesting quantification where they quantified the number of body parts per drawing in the children and then compared that,

399
00:43:50,830 --> 00:43:57,860
you know, between the Foothills children and the Valley children. And they saw that the Valley children, you know,

400
00:43:57,910 --> 00:44:04,479
essentially were like drawing pictures that didn't resemble people as much and had less body parts overall.

401
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:10,060
So this may, you know, may indicate some kind of impact on neurodevelopment.

402
00:44:10,210 --> 00:44:16,150
Um, you obviously would, probably wouldn't take this piece of evidence in isolation of everything else,

403
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:19,990
but it is sort of this striking visual comparison that we can make.

404
00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:27,820
And there's you know, this is another example of like chlorpyrifos.

405
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:34,300
So this is associations between in utero exposure to chlorpyrifos and cognitive outcomes at seven years old.

406
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:39,820
This is in a cohort of, you know, 265 children in New York City.

407
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:47,889
And they saw chlorpyrifos exposure was linked with a significant decrease in IQ and

408
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:51,250
some of these other like neurodevelopmental outcomes that they were looking at.

409
00:44:52,210 --> 00:44:54,100
So the text can be kind of hard to see here,

410
00:44:54,100 --> 00:45:04,360
but you could see the trend line of like decreasing performance on some of these tests with increasing levels of exposure to chlorpyrifos.

411
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:12,390
And so like a here is like working memory in that verbal comprehension and that perceptual reasoning, you know,

412
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:19,780
that like full scale IQ, you know, so you're seeing these apparent impacts of chlorpyrifos exposure on neurodevelopmental outcomes.

413
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:25,450
And there was like multiple studies showing this, you know, which is, again,

414
00:45:25,450 --> 00:45:33,129
this is sort of a nice situation, not a nice situation in terms obviously in terms of the toxicity,

415
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:41,140
but it illustrates that like the work we're doing, like in the School of Public Health can be used as an evidence to influence policy.

416
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,899
Right. These are the types of studies that they were looking at to make them say, okay,

417
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:49,390
we should probably not be using this for certain purposes or for a lot of purposes in the US.

418
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:57,880
So this is a it can be very frustrating working in this field where policy is very, very slow to change.

419
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:04,470
But I like to like really highlight some of these cases where there was, you know,

420
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:09,890
we did look at a lot of the evidence and it did lead to some kind of change in the policy.

421
00:46:09,910 --> 00:46:16,850
So and also, again, we're pulling like different types, you know,

422
00:46:16,870 --> 00:46:22,749
from like different departments like represented like at the School of Public Health, like the toxicology department.

423
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:29,830
But the toxicology field, you know, we're understanding the molecular kind of basis and susceptible individuals.

424
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:32,739
We're using these like toxicology studies we could use,

425
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:38,370
like molecular epidemiology and then some of these like behavioral and exposure types of studies.

426
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:43,900
So it's a nice way of like these various public health fields can like interact with each other and inform each other.

427
00:46:44,050 --> 00:46:50,230
So I just think that's a it's a good example. Any questions or comments?

428
00:46:55,770 --> 00:46:58,979
Coach. Okay.

429
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:03,410
So that's chlorpyrifos and or organophosphates.

430
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:07,290
There's another class of insecticides called pyrethroids.

431
00:47:08,310 --> 00:47:11,550
These were historically actually derived from chrysanthemum flowers.

432
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:16,870
I guess they make a prior resort compound to help combat insects.

433
00:47:19,230 --> 00:47:24,390
So this has, like, high insecticidal properties, not as much mammalian toxicity.

434
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:31,440
So for all of these, like pesticides you're talking about, I don't know if I've mentioned this yet,

435
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:37,469
but like the one of the main sort of desirable characteristics of these guys is that we want them to be

436
00:47:37,470 --> 00:47:43,920
targeted to the particular organism that they're that we're that we're considering a pest in some case.

437
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:49,229
Right. So we want to limit like off target effects. So something with high insecticidal properties,

438
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:53,580
but low mammalian toxicity just kind of like that's a little bit more beneficial for us because we're

439
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:57,850
not going to be seeing as many off target effects in humans like we've seen with chlorpyrifos.

440
00:47:57,870 --> 00:48:02,180
Right. Yeah.

441
00:48:02,190 --> 00:48:07,979
So we do have this issue where insects over time will start to become resistant to certain pesticides,

442
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:11,940
which we really haven't gone into that so much right now and so far.

443
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:16,560
But these guys with low tendency to produce this insect resistance,

444
00:48:17,490 --> 00:48:21,390
they don't persist as well as they have, like a low persistence in the environment.

445
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,730
Pretty big chunk of the global insecticide market.

446
00:48:25,810 --> 00:48:31,810
And we can you know, you can see it use symbols like house, household like, you know, plant cultivation and agriculture.

447
00:48:32,470 --> 00:48:36,520
There's different types of pyrethroids.

448
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:45,520
And again, these guys act on instead of this acetylcholine mechanism, these are acting on these voltage gated sodium channels.

449
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:55,149
And I don't want you to memorize this or get too hung up on this figure here because again, neurotoxins next week.

450
00:48:55,150 --> 00:49:04,840
So we'll get a lot of discussion there. But essentially the nerve impulses are sent along neurons via these.

451
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:15,390
What are the main mechanisms that these sodium pumps and transporters that kind of open and close through this like cycle closed,

452
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:20,140
resting and they open, then they're not active, then they're closed.

453
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:25,270
So then they're closed and resting. And that's the kind of the cycle that these these.

454
00:49:27,450 --> 00:49:33,090
Channels like gophers. So these are like protein sitting in like the membrane along the axon of the neuron.

455
00:49:33,210 --> 00:49:36,630
Right. And so these guys essentially act in a coordinated way.

456
00:49:36,990 --> 00:49:45,000
So to transmit this impulse along the neuron, which is basically driven by it, like the charge inside or outside of the axon.

457
00:49:46,110 --> 00:49:50,069
And what these parties are trying to do is basically block up these parts.

458
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:55,710
So they're not they just basically stop working or work in a very, like, erratic way.

459
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:00,420
Right. So you're basically knocking them off their normal sort of cycle of function.

460
00:50:02,490 --> 00:50:08,970
And it's similar to like a pseudo calling where you're getting just kind of like this aberrant neuronal impulses happening.

461
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:12,000
But again, just at a different kind of spot, another the neuron.

462
00:50:12,990 --> 00:50:18,000
I might come back to this after a neurotoxic lecture to kind of firm up a couple of the details.

463
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,590
But for now, I just wanted to mention that instead of acting on the acetylcholine receptor,

464
00:50:22,590 --> 00:50:32,010
they act on these pumps that are part or channel, sorry to call them pumps, but these like so voltage gated sodium channels on the axon.

465
00:50:34,810 --> 00:50:39,190
Okay. So let's jump into herbicides. So we've gone through.

466
00:50:39,730 --> 00:50:41,920
Yeah, insecticides and our herbicides.

467
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:51,850
So as opposed to insecticides, herbicides as their name kind of implies are mostly are used to kill plants like weeds.

468
00:50:51,910 --> 00:50:59,120
Right. So these guys, as opposed to the insecticides, which are mostly neurotoxic,

469
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:05,090
hence the herbicides act through a variety of mechanisms and modes of action.

470
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:13,299
And these guys can be applied at different times. So you can have pre things.

471
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:19,300
So this is applied to the soil before seeding. You can have what's called pre emergent application.

472
00:51:19,310 --> 00:51:26,460
So this is applied to the soil before the time of appearance of unwanted vegetation and then you have

473
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:32,460
post emergent which is applied to the soil or to the plants after the germination of the crops or weeds.

474
00:51:32,470 --> 00:51:37,420
So it's like just basically where is the lifecycle? Are you applying this herbicide?

475
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:50,740
Right? So again, this goes into what we desire in like a pesticide versus what is not as what we don't want.

476
00:51:51,070 --> 00:51:58,240
So there are herbicides that are more selective that target like specific weeds or, you know, not the plants.

477
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:02,020
You obviously not want to kill the crops that you are wanting to cultivate.

478
00:52:02,530 --> 00:52:12,519
There are also nonselective herbicides that just kill anything, including mammals, humans, animals that is obviously generally less desirable.

479
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:18,640
We want to be more targeted in what we're killing with pesticides when we see herbicides that kind of act in both ways.

480
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:27,400
Yeah. So this is like a rapidly growing component of the pesticide, U.S. pesticide market.

481
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:34,300
And this is probably you know, this is related to like our ability to do like monoculture,

482
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:39,460
like just like raising like one specific type of crop, like soy is become like a really big one.

483
00:52:39,730 --> 00:52:44,830
It's able to use these herbicides to like really manage weeds and things like that.

484
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:52,020
So here are some examples of the mechanism of action of herbicides.

485
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:59,250
Not all of them, but this is kind of gives you a sense of the flavor of different mechanisms that these herbicides use.

486
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:03,870
So some of them act by inhibiting photosynthesis in plants.

487
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:08,370
Chemicals like atrazine, which she talked a little bit about last time, do that.

488
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:15,330
Inhibition of like plant respiration, growth, regulators, inhibition of protein synthesis.

489
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:21,390
And then what we what we really like to you know, what's a really good mechanism,

490
00:53:22,350 --> 00:53:26,820
so to speak, is inhibition of specific enzymes that might be specific to plants.

491
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:37,259
So if you're if the mechanism of action is targeting an enzyme that only plants express and not humans or other wildlife, mammals,

492
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:43,590
birds, what have you, that's going to be a nice target to have because it's going to not have as many off target effects.

493
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:49,410
And so these include things like glyphosate, which inhibits this enzyme with a really long,

494
00:53:49,950 --> 00:53:53,430
complicated name that I'm not going to expect you to, like, know how to pronounce or anything.

495
00:53:54,390 --> 00:53:59,790
So that's just an example of a nice specific mechanism of action in that case.

496
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:02,740
And then.

497
00:54:04,190 --> 00:54:13,910
And alternatively, we have a case of something like Paraquat, which is an herbicide that is not very specific and basically disrupts cell membranes.

498
00:54:14,330 --> 00:54:19,399
And so we have cell membranes, plants have cell membranes, all types of things have cell membranes.

499
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:28,520
And so they act by really parabolic acts by really. I'll show you a slide, but really causing a lot of disruption and damage to organisms in that way.

500
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:36,640
Yeah. And so like in general herbicides because of some of this like.

501
00:54:39,410 --> 00:54:44,660
Specificity, you're going to see a lot lower acute toxicity compared to insecticides.

502
00:54:45,590 --> 00:54:50,639
However, paraquat would be a pretty big exception that it's pretty acutely toxic.

503
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:55,210
And we'll talk about that in a second. Right here.

504
00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:59,230
So Paraquat has been used as an herbicide since the sixties.

505
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:05,050
It's like this nonselective herbicide, like I said, very toxic to all kinds of things.

506
00:55:06,070 --> 00:55:12,220
It's used to control weeds, as you know. Herbicides tend to be in like fruit orchards and things.

507
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:20,680
We've seen with paraquat exposure, things like lung, kidney and neurotoxicity, not in plants.

508
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:31,320
Right. So that's not good. So here's an example of rats exposed to Paraquat over time.

509
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:41,010
So this is lung tissue. And one thing to sort of notice here is this white space is like areas where air could be in the lung.

510
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:49,530
And we want that. We want air to be able to exist in the lung over a period of up to 21 days.

511
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:53,820
We're seeing increasing amounts of like scar tissue in the lungs. So lots of injury is occurring.

512
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:59,060
That white space is going away very bad. So that is why.

513
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:04,810
Paraquat is considered, you know, pretty toxic, not just to plants at all.

514
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:11,219
So. Yeah. You see all this red coming, and that's all, like, scar tissue.

515
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:20,200
Just, like, infiltrating the lungs. And this is the main mechanism a lot of.

516
00:56:22,270 --> 00:56:29,350
It's basically this like causes a huge degree of like oxidative stress and oxidative damage, which we've talked about.

517
00:56:30,910 --> 00:56:41,980
This Paraquat is I'll take it into cells and it gets into this like vicious cycle where this molecule gets rid of reacts with like.

518
00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:49,480
But other molecules like within the cell leading to the formation of this paraquat free radical,

519
00:56:50,050 --> 00:56:56,590
which is a very reactive chemical that reacts with like oxygen gas in the cell or this O2 molecules in the cell,

520
00:56:57,370 --> 00:57:02,870
which leads to the formation of like the superoxide anion, which is like highly reactive.

521
00:57:02,870 --> 00:57:10,830
It causes lots of damage. You see a few other like pretty reactive molecules popping up here too.

522
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:16,030
Anytime you see like this dot here indicating like a free electron, that's something that's going to be reactive.

523
00:57:16,030 --> 00:57:22,240
And looking to pair with another electron can cause a lot of damage in things like so it's going to cause

524
00:57:22,270 --> 00:57:27,339
oxidative stress and cause damage to like cell membranes and cellular organelles and proteins and things,

525
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:34,240
just like taking electrons, just messing up the structure of the membranes, proteins, what have you.

526
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:38,890
Right. So, yeah, very, very damaging.

527
00:57:39,190 --> 00:57:46,009
Um. And you know, and again, you have this like cycle where it could happen like multiple times,

528
00:57:46,010 --> 00:57:51,499
where it'll be turned into this paraquat free radical and then back into this paraquat iron and then

529
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:57,340
react again and become a free radical again and then have this other reaction with this oh two molecule.

530
00:57:57,350 --> 00:58:04,129
So that's two oxygens bonded together, forming this like, yeah, react superoxide anion,

531
00:58:04,130 --> 00:58:09,180
which is like notorious for causing oxidative stress and oxidative damage.

532
00:58:09,710 --> 00:58:13,220
So yeah, it's like really bad vicious cycle here going on.

533
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:21,510
Any questions? Comments. Hello.

534
00:58:24,450 --> 00:58:28,889
Yeah. I don't know if I said this. Looks like this. The cytoplasm. So this would represent the cell membrane.

535
00:58:28,890 --> 00:58:32,880
So this is the cartoon showing the parabolic uptake into the cell.

536
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:37,629
I don't think I mentioned that beginning. Okay.

537
00:58:37,630 --> 00:58:44,170
So now we have glyphosate, which you may have been talked about a good amount in the news for various things.

538
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:52,210
So this was brought to market in the seventies. You'll see it by the trade name roundup, which you can go by it like Home Depot.

539
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:59,920
So this targets this amino acid metabolic pathway that is in plants but not in mammals.

540
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:06,960
So that's. A benefit over the Paraquat, at least it's targeting like a more specific pathway.

541
00:59:09,450 --> 00:59:16,469
So so Monsanto has released these like Roundup Ready crops that are resistant to the roundup toxicity.

542
00:59:16,470 --> 00:59:18,930
So you can spray them on these, you know,

543
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:27,630
these areas until like the non resistant weeds and things and while your crop that you want to remain thriving is untouched.

544
00:59:28,730 --> 00:59:32,240
It's the most widely used herbicide in the world by volume.

545
00:59:35,330 --> 00:59:47,540
Interestingly, although glyphosate is widely used, CDC does monitor a lot of different chemicals in like nationally in people's blood and urine.

546
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:53,930
And you'll see the stuff like public of glyphosate is not currently actively being monitored,

547
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:58,910
which is kind of odd in my opinion, since it's so widely used.

548
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:09,020
So and although glyphosate targets, the specific pathway in plants, there are there is some like AP,

549
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:12,710
there are some AP studies out there that show associations between.

550
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:20,420
I'm forgetting the specific I want to say preterm birth, but I'd have to go back and look at what the specific outcomes there are.

551
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:29,090
But there are there is ongoing research and some data to suggest that there's some toxicity associated with glyphosate,

552
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:31,460
higher levels of glyphosate exposure.

553
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:41,840
So, you know, we do have these like sort of off target effects that occur even though it's like there's chemicals made to target one specific pathway.

554
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:50,240
So that's something to maybe keep an eye on if you're interested in like pesticide toxicity, pesticide exposure, people using these chemicals.

555
01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:54,620
I think glyphosate is something we'll see in the literature.

556
01:00:54,620 --> 01:00:59,960
And then that is quite, you know, more and more the next few years or so.

557
01:01:01,650 --> 01:01:05,110
This is the molecule of it, just so you know. Um.

558
01:01:08,150 --> 01:01:15,860
And so one problem with this is we can see some plants becoming resistant to glyphosate, right?

559
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:22,230
So certain like weeds, the things that we want the glyphosate to be killing develop a resistance to glycosides.

560
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:30,050
So this is a graph showing the percentage of acres in the US that have been sprayed with glyphosate over time,

561
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:40,020
starting in 1990 and marching through time this way and you're seeing an increase in percentage of U.S. acres sprayed with,

562
01:01:40,020 --> 01:01:49,520
I like to say, for these different crops right along with that along that same more or less that same time frame.

563
01:01:50,610 --> 01:01:56,669
You can see an increase in glyphosate resistant species of plants kind of spreading.

564
01:01:56,670 --> 01:02:02,490
This is like a geographical map here showing like glyphosate resistant species of plants.

565
01:02:03,030 --> 01:02:10,840
The number of states that have found would like to see resistant species, as well as the total number of species within each state.

566
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:14,070
Right. And so you can see this is increasing over time.

567
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:21,900
So back in 2012, you know, we were seeing like looks like Arkansas was like six glyphosate resistant species.

568
01:02:22,620 --> 01:02:26,520
That's kind of like spread to other states. So that may be an issue.

569
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:35,380
And something to point out is this is from 2012, ten years ago now.

570
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:44,100
So if we looked back at the data again, I would imagine that it would be that trend probably because continued.

571
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:55,330
So what does this herbicide resistance mean in terms of like environmental health?

572
01:02:56,740 --> 01:03:00,069
Well, you know, it leads to spraying of more roundup, right.

573
01:03:00,070 --> 01:03:01,560
Because it's not working as effectively.

574
01:03:01,570 --> 01:03:10,719
So you got to spray more of it or switching to other chemicals that may be more toxic than Roundup itself because these guys are resistant.

575
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:19,900
Let's switch to this other chemical. Hopefully not paraquat, but some other chemical too, to cause the to kill the ones that you want to kill.

576
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:26,760
So this is something, again, to sort of keep an eye on. It's like this ongoing issue that I don't think, you know,

577
01:03:26,770 --> 01:03:35,410
the the book hasn't been closed on the sort of like chapter in the use of life, the say at this point in the U.S. or worldwide.

578
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:41,209
Right. Yeah.

579
01:03:41,210 --> 01:03:46,050
So what benefit of Roundup is farmers didn't have to tell.

580
01:03:46,070 --> 01:03:49,790
So tilling, it's like where you take, like, the old crops, like mix it back into the,

581
01:03:50,210 --> 01:03:53,810
into the earth and it kind of like kills the weeds so farmers didn't have to kill.

582
01:03:55,670 --> 01:03:59,520
So that one benefit of it was that you weren't getting as much soil runoff of

583
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:07,250
related to the tilling from like these you get more runoff with like tilled fields.

584
01:04:07,790 --> 01:04:12,100
So like pesticides and things running off when those rains. Um.

585
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:22,070
Yeah. So this is this is the what I was getting at with some of these studies showing like high levels of glyphosate exposure.

586
01:04:22,370 --> 01:04:27,950
We're seeing some studies showing like associations with liver and kidney damage and even congenital malformations.

587
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:32,630
Right. I thought preterm birth is in there, but I think I was misremembering.

588
01:04:34,070 --> 01:04:45,980
So, yeah. In summary, pesticide exposures are widespread.

589
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:52,790
I think I've probably convinced you of that if you weren't already. They are linked to both acute and chronic health effects.

590
01:04:56,650 --> 01:05:04,270
Many pesticides, notably the insecticides are designed as neuro toxicants, so they target neuro neurological function.

591
01:05:05,050 --> 01:05:10,360
Genetic variation is like pollen. One can influence the effects of pesticide exposure.

592
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:14,890
And that really goes for potentially almost any toxicant type of exposure.

593
01:05:14,890 --> 01:05:20,470
You can think of where genetics can influence the susceptibility of someone to exposure.

594
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:26,980
To these chemicals. But we have a really nice case to illustrate this point with the pine one situation.

595
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:37,480
Herbicides tend to be less toxic because plants have some of these specific pathways that we can target that aren't going to hurt mammals.

596
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:42,820
In a lot of cases. Yeah. Because they target these plant specific mechanisms.

597
01:05:45,020 --> 01:05:49,760
So with that, I will say we got like 10 minutes.

598
01:05:51,550 --> 01:05:57,700
I'll just jump in the ego toxicology and we'll probably just kind of get it started and come back to it.

599
01:05:59,180 --> 01:06:03,829
In a week. That's okay. I'll refresh us when we come back.

600
01:06:03,830 --> 01:06:12,799
But so with equal time, pesticides kind of lead into eco toxicology pretty nicely because, you know,

601
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:17,810
when we're thinking about pesticides, we're thinking about applications of this stuff like this huge scale.

602
01:06:17,810 --> 01:06:22,730
And I showed that map of like how many tons of pesticide are applied in different countries.

603
01:06:23,270 --> 01:06:27,860
And eco toxicology is really, you know, the same thing.

604
01:06:27,860 --> 01:06:34,010
We're going like really big in our scale or we're thinking about we're not talking about the animal experiment with the chemical in the lab.

605
01:06:34,370 --> 01:06:41,209
We're not thinking about although animal experiments could be, you know, something that's used in eco toxicology.

606
01:06:41,210 --> 01:06:54,620
But the scale of our questions is really expanding out to try to encompass how toxicants can impact like populations of birds, of frogs, of any,

607
01:06:54,620 --> 01:07:03,379
you know, of of plants, you know, not necessarily crop plants, but other types of crops as well or other other plants, you know, that aren't crops.

608
01:07:03,380 --> 01:07:11,680
But, you know, just in the wild in nature. So this is the science of contaminants in the biosphere.

609
01:07:11,710 --> 01:07:15,130
So when we say the biosphere, we're talking about all life on earth.

610
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:21,740
Bacteria, you know, animals, plants, all of it.

611
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:32,900
So it's a study of pollutants or toxic impacts on the biosphere and the constituents of the biosphere in eco toxicology.

612
01:07:32,910 --> 01:07:37,460
We're going to use a lot of the same principles that we've already talked about dose response,

613
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:42,110
molecular mechanisms of toxicity, etc. A lot of the same principles are going to apply,

614
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:46,790
but we're going to sort of apply our findings and the questions that we ask

615
01:07:46,790 --> 01:07:50,270
are going to be looking at like different levels of biological organization.

616
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:56,660
We're not going to be looking at like what? We're not going to strictly be looking at how a chemical impacts one part of the body.

617
01:07:56,660 --> 01:08:03,650
We're going to want to be thinking about what this means for a whole population of fish or a whole population of birds.

618
01:08:04,430 --> 01:08:11,060
So again, we're kind of expanding out what sort of levels of biological organization we're thinking about.

619
01:08:12,910 --> 01:08:19,450
And again, this could go from a small molecular effect to like big global effects.

620
01:08:19,450 --> 01:08:27,670
Like what's the global effect of PCB, PCBs in the environment on like the polar bear population?

621
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:40,540
Like globally, right. Something like how well a fish species is able to repair DNA damage caused by arsenic

622
01:08:40,540 --> 01:08:48,890
contamination might have implications for the global stock of that particular fish species.

623
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,600
Right. So the small molecular stuff is still going to be really important.

624
01:08:53,020 --> 01:09:00,130
But the questions and the sort of things that we're going to be looking into are going to kind of be at a different scale.

625
01:09:02,290 --> 01:09:05,229
And again, this like is everywhere, right?

626
01:09:05,230 --> 01:09:11,770
In this day and age, we see these like industrial contaminant contamination events happening across the globe, basically.

627
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:17,320
Right. You know, this is just some examples of like a river in India that's contaminated.

628
01:09:17,330 --> 01:09:23,890
It looks like there might be some p fast compounds which have this like foaming sort of look to them in this river.

629
01:09:24,220 --> 01:09:30,730
This you may have heard of the Pacific Garbage Patch where there's just tons of plastic and stuff that's accruing microplastics.

630
01:09:30,730 --> 01:09:38,850
We had a speaker last year that was talking about when these plastic compounds break down into these like micro particles of plastics and the like,

631
01:09:38,860 --> 01:09:48,190
the toxicity that might be associated with that. So, you know, Pacific Garbage Patch and then again, Keystone Pipeline, oil spill.

632
01:09:48,220 --> 01:09:53,530
Right? So this is just a few examples. But again, we're taking into account the entire globe here.

633
01:09:58,420 --> 01:10:04,690
Any good toxicology, something that sort of distinguishes it from like typical toxic, you know,

634
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:11,330
other types of toxicology is we're going to be thinking about abiotic processes as well as biotic processes.

635
01:10:11,350 --> 01:10:18,820
So what you have here on this axis is like a hierarchical scale, hierarchical scale of like Oregon.

636
01:10:19,090 --> 01:10:30,010
Oregon is a biological organization. So we're going from, you know, biomolecules to cells or systems, a whole organism, population, community.

637
01:10:32,230 --> 01:10:33,800
And then, you know,

638
01:10:33,850 --> 01:10:42,460
that can tie into the entire ecosystem of continents like North America is going to have multiple ecosystems and all of those together.

639
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:47,050
Like when you put all of those continents and ecosystems together, that makes up the biosphere, right?

640
01:10:48,190 --> 01:10:56,380
So far, we've mostly been talking about this space of the of this diagram here.

641
01:10:56,620 --> 01:11:02,340
Right. So we're going to expand out both in terms of the biological systems we're looking at.

642
01:11:02,970 --> 01:11:08,100
And then in addition, the abiotic components are going to play more of a role here, like things like.

643
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:15,690
We're going to ask questions like what chemical form is a particular chemical

644
01:11:16,020 --> 01:11:20,339
in and how is it going to be transport transmitted throughout the environment?

645
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:25,350
Is it going to be found mostly in the river, in the water, in a river or in the riverbed?

646
01:11:25,350 --> 01:11:29,129
In the soil? Is it going to be vaporizing into the air?

647
01:11:29,130 --> 01:11:32,610
So what phase is the chemical going to be in the vapor phase?

648
01:11:33,270 --> 01:11:36,120
Is it going to be dissolved in a lake, etc.?

649
01:11:36,810 --> 01:11:41,790
And that's going to lead up to like bigger and bigger scales of like how this stuff is going to be moving through the environment.

650
01:11:42,210 --> 01:11:47,550
And this is where like environmental chemistry plays an important role like big scale.

651
01:11:47,550 --> 01:11:51,600
How so we can talk a little bit about like micro scale, but where does the chemical go?

652
01:11:51,990 --> 01:11:57,210
Not necessarily micro-scale, but a smaller scale with our AP lectures of where a chemical goes in the body.

653
01:11:57,750 --> 01:12:01,140
This is kind of taking that principle to like a whole other level.

654
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:16,990
So. Yeah. So this idea here is that there's this sort of like feedback loop of humans.

655
01:12:18,230 --> 01:12:25,370
Change the environment and then those changes we make to the environment can come back and impact us in various ways, right?

656
01:12:25,370 --> 01:12:26,929
So things like industrialization,

657
01:12:26,930 --> 01:12:37,040
population growth or other geopolitical problems like war and these types of conflicts are all going to change the globe in a variety of ways.

658
01:12:38,930 --> 01:12:43,969
And this can you know, we can also think about like global trade, carbon emissions, of course.

659
01:12:43,970 --> 01:12:50,610
Right. We have this issue of like biodiversity, like are we destroying habitats and disrupting biodiversity?

660
01:12:50,610 --> 01:12:59,570
It is a big concern right now and, you know, for good reason in terms of the impact on the overall biodiversity of the planet.

661
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:05,600
Migratory movements, ecosystem degradation, what have you. So we're just no question about it.

662
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:08,809
We're just changing the environment just by living here.

663
01:13:08,810 --> 01:13:19,820
Right. And so the part of eco toxicology is understanding how this how these changes contribute to the emergence or reemergence of,

664
01:13:19,820 --> 01:13:23,030
say, infectious or not infectious diseases.

665
01:13:23,930 --> 01:13:30,580
For example, there is this concern to some degree about the thawing of ancient ice related to climate change,

666
01:13:30,590 --> 01:13:34,400
leading to the release of ancient pathogens that are frozen within the ice.

667
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:40,330
We've talked a little bit about the global impacts of like chemicals on male fertility,

668
01:13:40,340 --> 01:13:46,729
like overall, is there like this crisis in male fertility linked to environmental exposure?

669
01:13:46,730 --> 01:13:56,360
So these are all the types of things that are of not equal toxicology per say, but they illustrate what you could toxicology is helping to address,

670
01:13:56,360 --> 01:14:03,950
which is this feedback loop of how we change the environment of the environment comes back to affect us in some way, one way or the other.

671
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:10,850
Right. Well, that's overstating.

672
01:14:13,340 --> 01:14:17,030
So yeah, so there's this connection between ecosystem health and human health.

673
01:14:17,270 --> 01:14:25,250
And so you could toxicology is going to incorporate this like holistic understanding of ecosystems and their impacts on human health.

674
01:14:27,170 --> 01:14:32,810
So we're going to model interconnections between the natural and human health and think about these feedback loops.

675
01:14:35,460 --> 01:14:41,170
So we have both. Positive outputs that come from the natural system.

676
01:14:41,470 --> 01:14:46,600
You know, kind of the what we call nature right now,

677
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:52,930
the natural system has these outputs that we use to live the modern life, natural resources and raw materials.

678
01:14:53,590 --> 01:15:04,450
There's also associated with that negative what we consider in most cases, negative outputs that can lead to bad outcomes like a public health sense.

679
01:15:04,450 --> 01:15:07,810
Things like hurricanes, earthquakes or infectious diseases.

680
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:21,500
Humans. We do precious little of it, in my opinion, but we do do positive things for the environment, such as conservation efforts.

681
01:15:22,340 --> 01:15:30,400
We can have a positive impact on the environment and I know some of this is like loaded with a certain type of perspective and we can,

682
01:15:30,410 --> 01:15:35,629
you know, we can talk about that. But I think we kind of have a general understanding of what I mean when I say like a positive impact

683
01:15:35,630 --> 01:15:41,150
on the environment through like conserving certain species that may be in danger of dying out,

684
01:15:41,150 --> 01:15:48,170
for example. Right. And then we can also have, I think, the scales kind of tilted one way right now,

685
01:15:48,650 --> 01:15:53,390
negative effects of the environment, pollution and deforestation, for example.

686
01:15:56,080 --> 01:16:02,110
So there's all of this, the natural effects, both what we consider positive and negative, and the human effects,

687
01:16:02,110 --> 01:16:08,320
positive and negative interact to alter the quality of life for humans and non-human organisms.

688
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:14,530
You know, it just you can think of so many different examples, right?

689
01:16:15,010 --> 01:16:23,610
Pollutant, contamination of seafood, climate change, increasing disease vectors, Zika, COVID.

690
01:16:23,620 --> 01:16:29,230
You know, some of this is related to how we interact with the environment where these diseases come from.

691
01:16:30,130 --> 01:16:42,910
Um, you know, I think kind of a, again, like a tragic example is the Minamata Bay situation of dumping inorganic mercury into the bay.

692
01:16:43,180 --> 01:16:45,999
It gets changed by organisms in the environment.

693
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:54,070
This bacteria to the methylmercury form that's much more lipophilic and uptake in by people eating seafood.

694
01:16:54,610 --> 01:17:00,700
And so this is like the dynamics that are at play, you know, and there's multiple factors to take into account here.

695
01:17:03,250 --> 01:17:09,280
I don't know if, as anyone heard of the concept of one health, the someone want to tell me what it is, I'll take this away.

696
01:17:10,270 --> 01:17:11,830
So, um, describe what health is.

697
01:17:14,510 --> 01:17:21,200
Just like the interaction between like humans, animals and the environment and all kind of impacting the health of each other.

698
01:17:21,710 --> 01:17:25,820
Yeah, kind of, you know, sort of the stuff that we've been talking about so far, right?

699
01:17:25,860 --> 01:17:30,410
Yeah, that's that's pretty much it. This is how CDC defines it.

700
01:17:30,710 --> 01:17:38,840
A collaborative, multi-sector, sectoral and trans transdisciplinary approach working at the local, regional,

701
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:42,740
national and global levels with the goal of achieving optimal health outcomes,

702
01:17:43,100 --> 01:17:47,060
recognizing the interconnection between people, animals, plants and their shared environment.

703
01:17:47,420 --> 01:17:53,710
So I think you nailed it right. So this is this idea of one health that's kind of I mean,

704
01:17:53,730 --> 01:17:59,660
using a lot of words to kind of describe this one health concept, which is outlined here with a CDC.

705
01:18:03,110 --> 01:18:07,520
And, you know, you might be kind of this might be a good place to stop.

706
01:18:10,550 --> 01:18:14,450
Uh, I'll just real quick and we'll end here.

707
01:18:14,450 --> 01:18:17,940
But anyway, this is kind of, again, just like illustrating this idea.

708
01:18:18,620 --> 01:18:25,459
Human health intersects with animal health and that intersects with environmental health, or they all intersect with each other more or less.

709
01:18:25,460 --> 01:18:32,690
Right. And this sort of goes back to this idea of the expose on what we're trying to account for, more things that may be influencing health.

710
01:18:33,350 --> 01:18:42,710
Um, there's all these different factors we want to think about, like the cumulative, cumulative effect of stressors in the environment on health.

711
01:18:43,130 --> 01:18:50,330
And these can come from different places that can come from pathogenic infection or exposure to toxic chemicals in the environment.

712
01:18:51,770 --> 01:18:56,209
And you can see how this sort of intersects with multiple other fields.

713
01:18:56,210 --> 01:19:00,660
You know, this relates to how we do, you know, policy or, you know,

714
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:06,230
legal frameworks of how we're setting like certain restrictions on the release of pollutants into the environment.

715
01:19:06,890 --> 01:19:16,420
Um, yeah. So I think I'll stop there and we will pick this up next Monday, right?

716
01:19:16,490 --> 01:19:19,250
It's Wednesday, Monday we're going to have a guest lecture.

717
01:19:19,250 --> 01:19:23,870
So everyone to those that are watching this at home, if you wouldn't mind showing up in person,

718
01:19:23,870 --> 01:19:29,960
it'd be great to have people here for Dr. Mikulski on Monday and then we'll pick this back up after we have her lecture.

719
01:19:30,650 --> 01:19:34,040
So thanks. Have a good day. Thank you.
