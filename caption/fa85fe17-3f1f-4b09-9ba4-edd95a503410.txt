1
00:00:03,032 --> 00:00:07,567
I want to spend just a few moments talking
about the relationship between stress,

2
00:00:07,567 --> 00:00:11,840
health, and health behaviors.

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,990
Stress affects our bodies
via two different pathways.

4
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,370
The first pathway is directly.

5
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:20,020
They're biological or

6
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:24,126
physical effects to our bodies,
due to the stress we experience.

7
00:00:24,126 --> 00:00:27,260
These effects are moods,
our blood pressure,

8
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:31,260
our ability to fend off illnesses, etc.

9
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:36,100
But stress also affects our health and
our health behaviors indirectly.

10
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,850
Reducing our ability or

11
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:41,780
willingness to engage in behaviors
that promote good health.

12
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:43,490
And in some instances,

13
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:48,890
making people more likely to behave in
ways that is harmful to their health.

14
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:53,480
As I mentioned earlier, dealing with
psychological burdens like stress

15
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:58,420
is one reason some people
engage in unhealthy behaviors.

16
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:02,630
Another point I want to make is that
we know that stress induced illnesses

17
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:08,490
vary greatly by race and
by socio-economic status or SES.

18
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:13,480
While everyone regardless of race and
SES experiences stress,

19
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:17,000
we know that the nature of those
stresses varies by race and

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,800
depending on the economic resources
available to an individual.

21
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,430
Over the next two slides,
I want to talk a little bit more

22
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:30,360
about how these relationships, the
relationship between stress and SES, and

23
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:35,090
the relationship between stress and race,
and how these relationships shape health

24
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:41,700
outcomes above and
beyond the influence of health behaviors.

25
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,470
People who have fewer financial
resources available to them

26
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:49,460
worry about keeping up with
the daily costs of living.

27
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:55,340
Having to worry about how to put food on
the table, how to pay rent, how to pay for

28
00:01:55,340 --> 00:02:00,350
your medications or how to pay for
your child's daycare or education

29
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:06,980
is a significant often intractable source
of stress for millions of Americans.

30
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:10,530
Fewer economic resources
means more stress, and

31
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:15,270
often people with less money are working
in jobs where they have less control over

32
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:20,890
their time, their work responsibilities
in routine, and their schedule.

33
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:24,470
Individuals living with
fewer economic resources

34
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:29,730
often have less objective
control over their stressors.

35
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:34,170
A famous study by Michael Marmot
known as the Whitehall Study examine

36
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:39,270
the relationship between health, and
one aspect of socio-economic status.

37
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:43,820
Employment type,
conducted in England in the late 1970s.

38
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,460
This study looked at
British civil servants or

39
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:52,430
public servants and examined differences
immortality by employment type.

40
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:56,536
What the study found was that on average,
senior civil servants,

41
00:02:56,536 --> 00:02:59,910
those the top or most prestigious jobs

42
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:04,670
had only six tenths the mortality
rate of the average civil servant.

43
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:07,420
So those in the best jobs at the senior or

44
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:12,600
professional grade were less likely to
die early than the average civil servant.

45
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,860
On the other hand,

46
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:19,900
those individuals in less prestigious jobs
serving in clerical or support staff roles

47
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:26,190
were 1.4 to 2 times the average
mortality of the civil service staff.

48
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:30,000
So what this study showed was
that individuals in better paid,

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,260
more prestigious jobs with more autonomy

50
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:37,810
had less all cause mortality
than the average civil servant.

51
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:41,250
And those in jobs with less pay,
less prestige and

52
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:45,090
less status had higher mortality rates.

53
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:49,500
Interestingly, these findings
held even after controlling for

54
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,290
behavioral risk factors.

55
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:57,360
Even after factoring in things like
smoking, less physical activity,

56
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,280
having less leisure time.

57
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,090
Those individuals in lower status jobs

58
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:07,310
had higher death rates than
those in more prestigious jobs.

59
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,040
Individuals who are racial or

60
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,100
ethnic minorities also often
experience unique sources of stress.

61
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:19,330
Experiences of prejudice, racism and
discrimination are significant,

62
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:24,940
and in some cases daily stressors that
millions of Americans experience.

63
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,140
And we're learning more and

64
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:30,920
more about how these types of
stressors negatively affect health.

65
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:35,630
One theory for examining how these
rationalized stressful experiences

66
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:39,040
influence health is John Henryism.

67
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,600
Named after John Henry,
an American folk hero,

68
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,960
John Henryism captures the idea that
some black men develop a series of

69
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:54,260
coping mechanisms to deal with prolonged
exposure to racialized stressors.

70
00:04:54,260 --> 00:05:00,340
These high effort coping mechanisms
then have physiological costs,

71
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:04,100
and according to the author
of the theory may explain

72
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:09,600
elevated hypertension levels
in some African-American men.

73
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,870
So in sum, stress influences
health directly through biological

74
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:16,130
physiological effects to the body.

75
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:19,000
And indirectly by reducing our ability, or

76
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,750
willingness to engage in health
behaviors that promote good health.

77
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:26,400
And in some instances,
making people more likely

78
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,590
to engage in behaviors that
are harmful to their health.

79
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:33,990
While the effects of stress on health
are still not well understood,

80
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:38,460
we know that due to the amount and nature
of various stressors, minorities and

81
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:44,160
those with fewer economic resources
may be acutely affected by stress.

82
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,495
Improving health at the population level
will take addressing people's health

83
00:05:48,495 --> 00:05:57,400
behaviors as well as addressing the amount
and nature of stress in people's lives.
