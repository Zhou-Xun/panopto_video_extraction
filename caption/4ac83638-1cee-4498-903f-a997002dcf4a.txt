1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:02,761
Hey everyone.

2
00:00:02,761 --> 00:00:11,409
This is the quick review video for the lipid catabolism lecture over here.

3
00:00:11,409 --> 00:00:15,338
So, why do we have triacylglycerol breakdown, to begin with,

4
00:00:15,338 --> 00:00:16,661
which is lipolysis?

5
00:00:16,661 --> 00:00:20,239
So, it's because we need to provide energy for

6
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:25,259
cells that cannot utilize triglycerols, triglycerides I mean.

7
00:00:25,259 --> 00:00:27,561
And this happens through this pathway.

8
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:30,870
So, you have ATGL activity and HSL activity.

9
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:34,713
And if those two are activated, then you are promoting lipolysis,

10
00:00:34,713 --> 00:00:39,320
which is the breakdown of triglycerides into cholesterol and free fatty acids.

11
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:44,399
So, ATGL will break down the triacylglycerol into a diacylglycerol, and

12
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,260
then HSL will break down the diacylglycerol into a monoacylglycerol.

13
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:54,181
And then the last step by which monoacylglycerol becomes cleaved

14
00:00:54,181 --> 00:00:57,330
is not thought to be regulated over here.

15
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:59,445
So, regulation of lipolysis.

16
00:00:59,445 --> 00:01:05,464
It's thought to be inactivated by phosphorylation.

17
00:01:05,464 --> 00:01:10,990
Sorry, it's inactivated through dephosphorylation.

18
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:12,331
So, let's walk through this.

19
00:01:12,331 --> 00:01:17,366
So, corticoids would promote lipolysis through transcription mechanisms,

20
00:01:17,366 --> 00:01:20,981
adrenaline would promote it through phosphorylation.

21
00:01:20,981 --> 00:01:25,840
So, if HSL and ATGL are phosphorylated, then that means they're active.

22
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,101
And you're promoting this pathway by which you're breaking down triglycerides.

23
00:01:30,101 --> 00:01:35,241
And not glucagon because we do not have glucagon receptors in adipose sites,

24
00:01:35,241 --> 00:01:37,541
and it's restricted by insulin.

25
00:01:37,541 --> 00:01:41,324
So, if insulin dephosphorylates ATGL and HSL,

26
00:01:41,324 --> 00:01:46,700
then they will become inactive and you are not promoting lipolysis.

27
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:49,771
So, under what conditions do we have to know full of lipogenesis?

28
00:01:49,771 --> 00:01:52,931
It's if you have high glucose and high energy levels,

29
00:01:52,931 --> 00:01:56,985
because synthesizing lipids as mentioned in the synthesis lecture,

30
00:01:56,985 --> 00:02:01,740
requires a lot of ATP and ADPH and acetyl-CoA.

31
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:07,129
So, we covered in over a carb overheating lecture, study I mean.

32
00:02:07,129 --> 00:02:13,955
So, when participants were given a lot of carb, they were being overfed.

33
00:02:13,955 --> 00:02:17,571
They did not have any lipolysis over here.

34
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:20,640
So, their fat stores were absolutely intact.

35
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,715
And what they had was minimal de novo lipogenesis,

36
00:02:24,715 --> 00:02:31,000
that was being contributed by the excess carbohydrates they were consuming.

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,315
So, this is the fats bearing mechanism by which a carbohydrate-rich

38
00:02:36,315 --> 00:02:40,640
diet will allow your fat storage that is already there.

39
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,752
So, the fat stores that are already there to be spared.

40
00:02:43,752 --> 00:02:49,347
And your body will preferentially prefer to use carbohydrates,

41
00:02:49,347 --> 00:02:54,231
hence decreasing any potential lipolysis because you do

42
00:02:54,231 --> 00:02:58,830
not need to break down triglycerides to make energy.

43
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:01,939
You are just preferentially using carbohydrates,

44
00:03:01,939 --> 00:03:04,841
and minimally increasing de novo lipogenesis.

45
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:09,810
So, only the hatched bars over here represent how much the contribution

46
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:14,390
of carbohydrates to de novo lipogenesis, which is very minimal.

47
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:16,621
So, this is thought to be the theory.

48
00:03:16,621 --> 00:03:20,215
Some mechanisms at play is that if you're eating a lot of carbs,

49
00:03:20,215 --> 00:03:21,830
then you have high insulin.

50
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:25,745
If you have high insulin, and as we mentioned over here,

51
00:03:25,745 --> 00:03:31,631
insulin dephosphorylates ATGL and HSL which will prevent triglyceride breakdown.

52
00:03:31,631 --> 00:03:35,689
So, this could be a mechanism by which you are sparing your fat,

53
00:03:35,689 --> 00:03:40,600
because the excess insulin is always not allowing your fat to be broken down.

54
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,140
Fair lipolysis.

55
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:48,938
And this can eventually contribute to obesity, because if you keep on

56
00:03:48,938 --> 00:03:54,062
incrementally and very minimally adding more fat to your already existing

57
00:03:54,062 --> 00:03:59,840
fat stores, then eventually you'll end up having a lot of fat stores.

58
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,041
So, fatty acid activation.

59
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:04,869
This is the first initial step, which is the same for

60
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:08,970
fatty acid synthesis and fatty acid breakdown as well.

61
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:12,080
So, this is the initial oxidation, I mean.

62
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,568
So, this is the initial step that's moderated by Acyl-CoA.

63
00:04:16,568 --> 00:04:25,740
The Acyl requires 2 ATP, and the cytoplasm over here.

64
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:30,171
So, fatty acid transport into the mitochondria requires a CPT system.

65
00:04:30,171 --> 00:04:33,060
So, think of it as like a bus, basically.

66
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:38,381
So, if you're in the cytosol, and you have fatty acids over here.

67
00:04:38,381 --> 00:04:42,490
So, this system is only specific to long chain fatty acids, keep that in mind.

68
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:46,440
Only long chain fatty acids will require the CPT system.

69
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:50,051
Very long chain fatty acids do not go into the mitochondria.

70
00:04:50,051 --> 00:04:52,440
They go into peroxisomes which we'll talk about.

71
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:57,226
And medium and small chain fatty acids can just passively go through because

72
00:04:57,226 --> 00:05:01,640
they do not need a transporter, they're small particles.

73
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,891
So, CPT over here.

74
00:05:02,891 --> 00:05:07,262
What it will do is that it will swap the CoA from Acyl-CoA with

75
00:05:07,262 --> 00:05:10,110
a carnitine to yield a Acylcarnitine.

76
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:14,321
And now, Acylcarnitine kind of will have a ticket to go through

77
00:05:14,321 --> 00:05:18,540
the first membrane of the mitochondria, as Acylcarnitine.

78
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:23,838
And then it will go out as an Acylcarnitine through the translocase

79
00:05:23,838 --> 00:05:28,283
over here, and CPT II, which is also under CPT system,

80
00:05:28,283 --> 00:05:31,513
will swap back the carnitine with a CoA.

81
00:05:31,513 --> 00:05:35,288
So, you will end up having an Acyl-CoA and the carnitine just the same way that you

82
00:05:35,288 --> 00:05:38,270
started with an Acyl-CoA and the carnitine and the cytoplasm.

83
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:42,860
But now they are in the mitochondria.

84
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:45,961
So, carnitine deficiency.

85
00:05:45,961 --> 00:05:49,791
As you can imagine, if you do not have carnitine, then you will not be

86
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:54,020
as efficient as swapping the CoA with a carnitine to yield Acylcarnitine and

87
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,370
allow for the passage.

88
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:59,003
So, if you have a carnitine deficiency then your CPT I and

89
00:05:59,003 --> 00:06:01,971
II systems will not be functioning properly.

90
00:06:01,971 --> 00:06:06,967
And you will be less able to transport long chain fatty acids from

91
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:11,964
the cytoplasm to the mitochondria, which will cause less lipid

92
00:06:11,964 --> 00:06:17,540
oxidation because lipid oxidation has to happen in the mitochondria.

93
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:21,516
And if you can't get the long chain fatty acids from the cytoplasm to

94
00:06:21,516 --> 00:06:27,603
the mitochondria, then your oxidation levels will go down.

95
00:06:27,603 --> 00:06:32,051
So, it can cause cardiomyopathy because the heart relies on fatty acid oxidation.

96
00:06:32,051 --> 00:06:37,990
And if it can get long chain fatty acids and oxidize them,

97
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:42,459
then the muscle of the heart will get weak.

98
00:06:42,459 --> 00:06:47,045
And also hypoketotic hypoglycemia which we've discussed in class.

99
00:06:47,045 --> 00:06:53,881
So, hypoglycemia you'll end up having lower glucose and then also hypoketosis.

100
00:06:53,881 --> 00:06:58,657
So, less ketone bodies are being produced because you do not have as much

101
00:06:58,657 --> 00:07:00,710
Acyl-CoA and mitochondria.

102
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:04,261
And coordination of lipogenesis and beta oxidation.

103
00:07:04,261 --> 00:07:07,169
So, as you look away that's in the cytoplasm,

104
00:07:07,169 --> 00:07:10,610
will become malonyl-CoA through the activity of ACC.

105
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:15,125
Keep in mind that ACC is activated by high levels of acetyl-CoA,

106
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:18,350
high levels of citrate, and also by insulin.

107
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:21,884
So, think of it as if you have a lot of insulin,

108
00:07:21,884 --> 00:07:25,900
you ate a meal then you'd want to start storing fat.

109
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:30,437
If you have a lot of acetyl-CoA which is upstream of malonyl-CoA or

110
00:07:30,437 --> 00:07:32,108
a lot of citrate as well,

111
00:07:32,108 --> 00:07:37,140
then you also want to promote downstream pathways and start storing fat.

112
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:40,243
So, a build up of malonyl-CoA would inhibit CPT I, and

113
00:07:40,243 --> 00:07:44,204
CPT I as the system we just talked about the transporter that allows long

114
00:07:44,204 --> 00:07:47,930
chain fatty acids to go from the cytoplasm into the mitochondria.

115
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:50,081
Then that also will be inhibited.

116
00:07:50,081 --> 00:07:53,768
So, you will not be undergoing oxidation, but instead,

117
00:07:53,768 --> 00:08:01,440
you will be promoting fatty acid synthesis and triglyceride synthesis over here.

118
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,930
So, on another note, this system can also be downregulated.

119
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:11,982
So, if you have adrenaline or energy needs, so if you need energy to

120
00:08:11,982 --> 00:08:17,124
run from a bear that would be for adrenaline, or if in general you're

121
00:08:17,124 --> 00:08:21,931
low on energy then intuitively you do not want to be storing fat.

122
00:08:21,931 --> 00:08:26,550
If anything, you want to be oxidizing fat to yield ATP.

123
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:29,910
So, how those two systems work is by inhibiting ACC.

124
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:32,929
And so you do not get a build-up of malonyl-CoA.

125
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:38,571
If there is no build-up of malonyl-CoA, then there is no inhibition on CPT I.

126
00:08:38,571 --> 00:08:41,885
So, CPT I will now be free and active.

127
00:08:41,885 --> 00:08:45,345
And if it's active it's promoting oxidation, and

128
00:08:45,345 --> 00:08:50,790
there we import a long chain fatty acid from the cytoplasm into the mitochondria.

129
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:55,731
Another way to think about this is that, if the system is blocking

130
00:08:55,731 --> 00:09:00,502
malonyl-CoA formation, then it's also kind of blocking fatty

131
00:09:00,502 --> 00:09:05,560
acids from coming from exiting the mitochondria in the first place.

132
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:11,240
Because now they can't really go anywhere if they're in the mitochondria.

133
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:16,443
So, basically, if you do not have a build-up in malonyl-CoA,

134
00:09:16,443 --> 00:09:18,920
then you cannot inhibit CPT I.

135
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:23,491
And any long chain fatty acids available in the cytoplasm will be

136
00:09:23,491 --> 00:09:27,840
reimported into the mitochondria to undergo oxidation.

137
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:33,840
And this is moderated by adrenaline and energy needs over here.

138
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,861
So, there is chronic regulation as well.

139
00:09:35,861 --> 00:09:40,872
So, this is transcriptional by PPAR alpha and gamma, and it's thought that PUFA.

140
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:45,019
So, polyunsaturated fatty acids will promote PPAR activity.

141
00:09:45,019 --> 00:09:50,200
And what people does is that it promotes the expression of genes responsible for

142
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,140
oxidation.

143
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:54,767
So, it will promote generating ATP, and

144
00:09:54,767 --> 00:10:00,540
it will inhibit synthesizing triglycerides over here.

145
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,698
So, if we look at this figure,

146
00:10:02,698 --> 00:10:08,191
you can think of PUFAs as promoting oxidation and inhibiting triglycerides.

147
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:12,936
So, it's very similar to what adrenaline and energy needs are doing, but

148
00:10:12,936 --> 00:10:17,140
the mechanism is still unknown for PUFAs.

149
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,844
So, think of this as being very important for

150
00:10:19,844 --> 00:10:23,411
someone who's trying to alleviate some liver steatosis.

151
00:10:23,411 --> 00:10:28,644
So, if you have some build-up a fat and deliver, then promoting people activity in

152
00:10:28,644 --> 00:10:33,657
the liver which is PPAR alpha, would be a great idea to start breaking down fat and

153
00:10:33,657 --> 00:10:39,340
oxidizing them instead of synthesizing more fat.

154
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,301
So, oxidation.

155
00:10:40,301 --> 00:10:47,840
Those are the steps, I'm gonna use my many drawing over here.

156
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:51,351
Okay, so the first step would be to insert a desaturate.

157
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:55,167
So, now that we're in the mitochondria Acyl-CoA has,

158
00:10:55,167 --> 00:11:00,255
I mean acetyl-CoA has come from the or Acyl-CoA has come from the cytoplasm

159
00:11:00,255 --> 00:11:04,891
to the mitochondria through the CPT system, which we talked about.

160
00:11:04,891 --> 00:11:07,940
So, this would be only for a long chain fatty acids.

161
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,240
This transport system.

162
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:14,530
Initial step is to insert a double bond which releases an FADH2, and then you move

163
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:19,526
the double bond around generating an NADH which is equivalent to 2.5 ATP.

164
00:11:19,526 --> 00:11:26,160
And then you cleave every two carbon at a time generating an acetyl-CoA,

165
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,121
and now the chain is shorter by two carbons.

166
00:11:30,121 --> 00:11:35,010
And you keep repeating the step until you're left with the last four

167
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:38,783
carbons by which you cleave them once over here, and

168
00:11:38,783 --> 00:11:42,250
get 2 acetyl-CoAs with an FADH2 and an NADH.

169
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,740
How to calculate energy.

170
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:48,081
There is a rule for this, and always follow the rules.

171
00:11:48,081 --> 00:11:51,772
So, it's always going to be, and it's not really written here, so,

172
00:11:51,772 --> 00:11:53,012
I'm just gonna say it.

173
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:56,402
It's always going to be the number of carbons and

174
00:11:56,402 --> 00:12:00,890
that fatty acid minus 2, between parenthesis divided by two.

175
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:04,840
So, it's always going to be that which is somehow over here.

176
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:08,540
And then whatever number you get that would be the number of cycles.

177
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:11,940
The number of cycles, you need to multiply it by 14.

178
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:15,160
14 is the ATP generated per cycle.

179
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,151
Where is that ATP coming from?

180
00:12:17,151 --> 00:12:20,940
It's from every NADH, FADH, and acetyl-CoA you produce.

181
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:25,180
So, if you add those up, 2.5 plus 1.5 plus 10, you get the 14.

182
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:28,840
So, per cycle you are generating 14 ATP.

183
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:34,300
And then you need to also add 10 ATP for the last acetyl-CoA that

184
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:42,040
you automatically get once you cleave the last four carbons and fatty acid chain.

185
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,434
And then you always need to subtract 2 ATP,

186
00:12:45,434 --> 00:12:51,610
because the activation step using ACS acetyl-CoA synthesis requires 2 ATP.

187
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:54,040
So, you always subtract 2 ATP.

188
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:59,331
Now, your calculation can end here if this is a saturated fat.

189
00:12:59,331 --> 00:13:03,890
If you have a double bond, you always need to take into account that those

190
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:07,880
double bonds will make you forego the generation of an FADH2.

191
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:12,338
Because remember FADH2 is the first step that we talked about over here, and

192
00:13:12,338 --> 00:13:14,760
it's necessary to insert a double bond.

193
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:19,505
So, if your body sees that there is already a double bond on this fatty acids,

194
00:13:19,505 --> 00:13:24,251
because it's a mono unsaturated fatty acid or polyunsaturated fatty acid,

195
00:13:24,251 --> 00:13:28,266
then it will forego the first step and go immediately to step two,

196
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:32,600
which means you are losing an FADH2 because you are not producing it.

197
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,277
So, if you have a few double bonds,

198
00:13:35,277 --> 00:13:40,725
then whatever energy you got from the previous calculation we just did,

199
00:13:40,725 --> 00:13:45,385
you need to subtract the number of double bonds times 1.5.

200
00:13:45,385 --> 00:13:49,340
And 1.5 is because FADH generates 1.5 ATP.

201
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:53,341
So, you need to always subtract the number of double bonds.

202
00:13:53,341 --> 00:13:54,773
So, whatever energy you got.

203
00:13:54,773 --> 00:14:05,540
So, ATP total minus number of double bonds times 1.5 ATP to get your net ATP.

204
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:09,159
So, peroxisomal oxidation is only for a very long chain fatty acids.

205
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:12,001
So, it's not a coupled to ETC.

206
00:14:12,001 --> 00:14:16,603
So, you do not generate energy in the peroxisome, but

207
00:14:16,603 --> 00:14:21,504
you also lose 2 ATP because you have the activation step,

208
00:14:21,504 --> 00:14:26,520
which is still the same as what we previously talked about.

209
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:30,831
You have activation by ACS for a very long chain fatty acids.

210
00:14:30,831 --> 00:14:34,885
The only thing is that those long chain fatty acids, very long chain fatty acids,

211
00:14:34,885 --> 00:14:37,081
cannot go directly into the mitochondria.

212
00:14:37,081 --> 00:14:38,684
So, they need to go to the peroxisome.

213
00:14:38,684 --> 00:14:43,174
The peroxisome will break them down by cleaving them from

214
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:47,663
the side gradually to make shorter chain fatty acid, and

215
00:14:47,663 --> 00:14:51,683
then that fatty acid can now exit the peroxisome and

216
00:14:51,683 --> 00:15:01,940
go back into the mitochondria to yield ATP through oxidation.

217
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:06,644
So, PUFAs and MUFAs will yield less energy because you forego

218
00:15:06,644 --> 00:15:10,536
making FADH2 from the initial step of oxidation,

219
00:15:10,536 --> 00:15:14,789
because if your body sees that there's a double bond and

220
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:21,140
it doesn't have to generate it itself and so it doesn't make an FADH2 molecule.

221
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:25,164
And short and medium chain fatty acids are oxidized faster by default.

222
00:15:25,164 --> 00:15:27,137
They do not need the CPT system.

223
00:15:27,137 --> 00:15:31,211
So, they do not wait for the bus kind of.

224
00:15:31,211 --> 00:15:38,050
So, think of CPT I as being the bus, who's transporting and moving things around.

225
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:42,341
So, if they do not need the bus, then they can immediately go wherever they want.

226
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:47,274
And also they're smaller, so, they will yield less energy by default,

227
00:15:47,274 --> 00:15:49,515
just because they're shorter.

228
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:54,133
And very long chain fatty acids go to the peroxisome initially where there's

229
00:15:54,133 --> 00:15:54,711
no ETCs.

230
00:15:54,711 --> 00:15:58,967
So, no ATP is producing the peroxisome, but

231
00:15:58,967 --> 00:16:03,111
then when they become shorter fatty acids,

232
00:16:03,111 --> 00:16:09,240
they go to the mitochondria to be oxidized normally.

233
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,812
So, odd-chained fatty acids.

234
00:16:10,812 --> 00:16:14,214
They will, you cleave them to at the time, but

235
00:16:14,214 --> 00:16:18,751
then eventually you will end up with a five carbon fatty acid,

236
00:16:18,751 --> 00:16:22,591
which you will cleave once to make an acetyl-CoA and

237
00:16:22,591 --> 00:16:27,674
you end up with a three carbon molecule which is the propionyl-CoA.

238
00:16:27,674 --> 00:16:34,389
Propionyl-CoA will eventually become Succinyl-CoA and feed into the TCA cycle.

239
00:16:34,389 --> 00:16:39,072
And to be converted from propionyl-CoA to Succinyl-CoA you need

240
00:16:39,072 --> 00:16:41,010
coenzyme B12 over here.

241
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:46,710
So, think of B12 as being necessary to be able to deal with our chain fatty acids.

242
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:50,731
This isn't a major issue because our chain fatty acids

243
00:16:50,731 --> 00:16:55,040
are found in very low quantities in some ruminant milk.

244
00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:00,481
So, it's really not found in high quantities and concentrations.

245
00:17:00,481 --> 00:17:02,209
So, it doesn't pose a threat.

246
00:17:02,209 --> 00:17:04,951
Ketone bodies as we also previously mentioned.

247
00:17:04,951 --> 00:17:08,411
So, the liver can make ketone bodies in the absence of Oxaloacetate.

248
00:17:08,411 --> 00:17:12,676
So, if it has its two CoA but no Oxaloacetate, it will make ketone bodies.

249
00:17:12,676 --> 00:17:17,301
And then it cannot utilize them for energy itself because it doesn't have

250
00:17:17,301 --> 00:17:20,446
the OXCT1 enzyme, but it sends them to the body.

251
00:17:20,446 --> 00:17:23,366
So, the peripheral tissues that can

252
00:17:23,366 --> 00:17:28,069
definitely use them because they have the OXCT1 enzyme.

253
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:29,681
This is energy costly.

254
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:36,028
So, for the liver, the liver will be using I believe 6.5 ATP.

255
00:17:36,028 --> 00:17:42,601
Sorry, it will be spending 3.5 ATP or something of that sort.

256
00:17:42,601 --> 00:17:46,741
So, the liver really spends energy to make the ketone bodies,

257
00:17:46,741 --> 00:17:51,360
and then the muscles will only be making around 6.5 ATPs from them.

258
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:57,921
So, you're at a net gain of 3 ATP every single time you use ketone bodies.

259
00:17:57,921 --> 00:17:59,340
So, it's not very efficient.

260
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,623
So, you can think about this as being inefficient for

261
00:18:01,623 --> 00:18:03,420
someone who's trying to run a marathon.

262
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:06,118
So, they definitely do not want to be relying

263
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:10,307
under ketone body oxidation because it doesn't seal a lot of energy,

264
00:18:10,307 --> 00:18:15,064
whereas someone who might be trying to lose weight could benefit from the system

265
00:18:15,064 --> 00:18:18,740
because it's not energy efficient whatsoever.

266
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,463
And that's it.
