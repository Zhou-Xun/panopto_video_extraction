1
00:00:00,081 --> 00:00:04,431
So the exercise we're going to do right now can be really good for calming,

2
00:00:04,431 --> 00:00:09,181
it can be really good for having a hard time with self compassion and self talk,

3
00:00:09,181 --> 00:00:14,961
and it's just a way to kind of get back in our body, settle our body.

4
00:00:14,961 --> 00:00:26,551
So what we're going to start with, is just kind of hugging, holding yourself, and you can kind of just even notice how tight

5
00:00:26,551 --> 00:00:32,741
feels good. And once you find that,

6
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:41,071
you're just kind of breathing, settling,

7
00:00:41,071 --> 00:00:47,661
listening to your body, noticing what's there.

8
00:00:47,661 --> 00:00:54,171
They're kind of variations on this, it feels good to kind of just get on the bed, cocoon a little bit, fetal position,

9
00:00:54,171 --> 00:01:06,681
that's fine. Anytime we have kind of skin to skin contact, like when we've done our hands on our chests in the other exercises, our body releases oxytocin,

10
00:01:06,681 --> 00:01:13,411
and it helps lower cortisol, one of the stress hormones.

11
00:01:13,411 --> 00:01:23,431
So we just want to breathe. And then you're going to kind of notice if your body

12
00:01:23,431 --> 00:01:29,971
kind of wants any different kind of motion or anything added, it may not.

13
00:01:29,971 --> 00:01:39,511
Kind of just notice if it does, and I'll give you some options to try. Sometimes adding a little bit of a rock,

14
00:01:39,511 --> 00:01:46,701
this is a bilateral movement, and it helps to calm our nervous system. Some people like side to side.

15
00:01:46,701 --> 00:02:03,461
It can be small, and barely noticeable. So find a pace that feels right, some people like a little bit more like a rocking chair, front and back.

16
00:02:03,461 --> 00:02:10,651
And just do that as long as it feels good. Another option,

17
00:02:10,651 --> 00:02:24,171
is if you're just starting from that first place, is to add a slow, bilateral tap. So you're alternating hands,

18
00:02:24,171 --> 00:02:30,701
and you're just breathing. And however slowly you start,

19
00:02:30,701 --> 00:02:39,501
I would recommend getting yourself to slow down even a little bit more.

20
00:02:39,501 --> 00:02:54,101
Letting your breathing slow down to match it. This bilateral tapping also slows us down,

21
00:02:54,101 --> 00:03:10,051
and helps our nervous system calm down. The other thing, I'm not sure if you guys ever heard of singing bowls, actually, I can show you.

22
00:03:10,051 --> 00:03:17,251
They look like this, and let's see if I can get it to.

23
00:03:17,251 --> 00:03:25,601
And kind of have that vibration that moves through. We can kind of replicate that in our body a little bit, with a hum.

24
00:03:25,601 --> 00:03:29,931
It sends like a vibration through our body, and it can be steadily. You can just kind of notice.

25
00:03:29,931 --> 00:03:38,201
You can hum some song that's comforting and familiar to you, or you can just pick a tone.

26
00:03:38,201 --> 00:03:52,421
This might sound weird, but it's worth a try. So you just pick a tone.

27
00:03:52,421 --> 00:03:58,001
And just let it fade out at the pace that you want. You don't have to do it, if it doesn't feel right.

28
00:03:58,001 --> 00:04:05,481
You can just play with it. But again, all you're doing is calming

29
00:04:05,481 --> 00:04:12,051
and grounding your nervous system. You know that you can stay here for as long as you want.

30
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:17,481
You may find that something completely different feels good.

31
00:04:17,481 --> 00:04:20,211
This is one way of starting in a place,

32
00:04:20,211 --> 00:04:31,315
listening to our body and figuring out what is the practice in our body that helps us calm, settle, and comfort when we need it.
