1
00:00:08,792 --> 00:00:12,497
In this module, we'll talk about
how we dispose of hazardous waste.

2
00:00:12,497 --> 00:00:16,713
Of course, hazardous waste by its very
name is potentially harmful to humans and

3
00:00:16,713 --> 00:00:18,015
the environment.

4
00:00:18,015 --> 00:00:22,175
So we need to take special precautions to
make sure that this waste is disposed of

5
00:00:22,175 --> 00:00:25,825
in a way that's not going to
harm either us or the ecosystem.

6
00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:27,465
But how do we actually do that?

7
00:00:27,465 --> 00:00:29,790
Let's learn more.

8
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:33,640
In a previous module we talked about
the hierarchy of controls as a way for

9
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,630
us to rank order our preferences for
how to eliminate or

10
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:40,550
reduce environmental hazards around us.

11
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:44,620
We also talked in another module about
the hierarchy of waste management.

12
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:48,750
Now I'm going to introduce you to the
hierarchy of hazardous waste management.

13
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,320
This one looks a little different than
the other two we've looked at but

14
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,080
the concepts are absolutely the same.

15
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:58,130
So looking at this image, at the top we
have strategies that are most effective

16
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:00,910
going down to the bottom where
they're least effective.

17
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:04,780
The new dimension we've added here
is the x-axis which now goes from

18
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:07,990
least expensive to most expensive.

19
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:11,560
So what's actually in our hierarchy
of hazardous waste management?

20
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,600
The very top and
preferred level is management support.

21
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:19,720
So this is effectively a way of saying,
how can we create the waste in

22
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:23,880
such a way that it's going to be minimized
or perhaps even eliminated outright?

23
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,120
So we're going to manage
the waste at a very high level.

24
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,480
The second order of preference
would be source reduction.

25
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:33,590
So is there a way that we can
reduce the number of sources or

26
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:39,170
the amount of hazardous waste that's
generated by a specific source?

27
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:41,590
The third level is reuse or recycling.

28
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:46,080
If we can't eliminate the creation,
let's make something out of this waste so

29
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,360
it can again become productive.

30
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,410
The fourth level is volume reduction.

31
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:53,890
So even if we can't reduce the number of
sources that are generating hazardous

32
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:57,730
waste, maybe we can make
less waste nevertheless.

33
00:01:57,730 --> 00:01:59,800
And the lowest and least preferred and

34
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:04,360
most expensive option
of course is disposal.

35
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:08,150
Let's zoom in and look at some of the
reuse and recycling options particularly.

36
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:10,170
The good news is there
are a number of them.

37
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:12,560
So the first is reclamation.

38
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,560
This means basically we take a waste
product and we process it in a way that

39
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,850
we're going to recover a usable product or
perhaps we take a waste product and

40
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:25,426
we can clean that waste product and
regenerate new product out of that.

41
00:02:25,426 --> 00:02:29,730
Another reuse/recycling approach is reuse,
so

42
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:34,445
maybe the waste can just go directly in
as an ingredient to another industrial

43
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:36,960
process that's going to
make a new product.

44
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,240
Or maybe there's a commercial product
being produced now where the waste can

45
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:45,470
actually be employed as a substitute for
some other ingredient in that product.

46
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,540
A third type of reuse or

47
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:50,180
recycling option is what's called
use constituting disposal.

48
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:54,170
This is a very specific definition that
says we want to place the waste or

49
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:59,120
the products that are containing the waste
directly on land as a type of recycling.

50
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,020
That may not make sense.

51
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,490
Let me give you an example.

52
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:04,840
If we can take hazardous waste and
mix it into asphalt or

53
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:09,330
cement, then we can actually make
roads out of that asphalt and cement.

54
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:14,210
So we've recycled this into asphalt and
then we're using it to make a road.

55
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:18,330
We do very much the same thing with tires,
rubber tires that are hazardous waste.

56
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:22,930
We can grind them up, mix them with other
materials and make sidewalks out of them.

57
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:26,160
Finally, we can consider
a fourth option for reuse and

58
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,570
recycling which is burning for
energy recovery.

59
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:32,840
So if we can burn hazardous waste
as fuel and collect the energy and

60
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:37,650
steam that comes off that, we can use
that energy to create electricity.

61
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:40,660
I'll give you an example here
that comes back to cement.

62
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:45,860
So there are enormous kilns that are used
basically to burn lime and make cement and

63
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:50,780
many of these kilns will use hazardous
waste as the fuel to heat up that kiln and

64
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:56,470
directly create the heat necessary
to make a new product, cement.

65
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:59,151
Of course, reuse and
recycling our preferred approaches, but

66
00:03:59,151 --> 00:04:00,500
they're not always an option.

67
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,020
How do we actually dispose of
remaining hazardous waste?

68
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,130
Again, we have a number of options.

69
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:09,570
One for temporary storage is
to store to hazardous waste

70
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:14,400
along with water in a lagoon or
some other impoundment area.

71
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,480
The second and more permanent approach
is to use landfill disposal so

72
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,440
we can create a hazardous waste
landfill only for hazardous waste.

73
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,590
This could be a surface facility or
underground.

74
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:27,950
The difference between
a hazardous waste landfill and

75
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:31,840
a more traditional solid
waste sanitary landfill

76
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,050
is the hazardous waste landfill has
two heavy-duty liners surrounding it.

77
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:39,340
So basically double protection
against something leaking

78
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,280
outside of this hazardous waste landfill.

79
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:47,640
We can also use incinerators to burn or
destroy flammable toxic materials.

80
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:51,770
For liquid wastes especially,
it's common to use an injection well,

81
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:55,580
meaning that we're injecting
these liquid hazardous wastes

82
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:58,020
deep underground where humans
won't come into contact with them.

83
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:02,840
Of course, then we raise the possibility
that we're contaminating a groundwater

84
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,270
aquifer that might be used for
drinking water.

85
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:09,560
So injection wells are regulated
by the Safe Drinking Water Act.

86
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,315
And finally we can use
biological treatment.

87
00:05:11,315 --> 00:05:16,955
This involves the application of enzymes
or microorganisms to the hazardous waste.

88
00:05:16,955 --> 00:05:20,325
Those microorganisms can then
eliminate the hazardous waste or

89
00:05:20,325 --> 00:05:25,425
can basically eat it and
convert it to a less hazardous form.

90
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:28,845
I'd like to give you an example of why
storage lagoons in particular aren't

91
00:05:28,845 --> 00:05:32,755
a very good idea as
a long-term storage mechanism.

92
00:05:32,755 --> 00:05:35,820
This example comes from
the Tennessee Valley Authority

93
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,390
which operates a Kingston Fossil Plant.

94
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:42,360
And so you'll see images here that
are showing an overhead view of

95
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,520
the Kingston Fossil Plant and
its surrounding area.

96
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,450
What happened in this incident was a spill
basically of coal fly ash which is

97
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:53,980
basically the ash that's left
over after you've burned coal and

98
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:57,040
it's been mixed with water and
other liquids into a slurry.

99
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,160
So there was an enormous spill
from this impoundment in 2008.

100
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,970
You can see in the picture on the left,
it's a nice organized photograph

101
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:08,850
versus on the right, you see a lot of dark
material that's spread out from the plant.

102
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:12,980
That's a result of the failure basically
of a dike that was used to create this

103
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,130
impoundment.

104
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:18,320
As a result of that dyke failure
over 5 million cubic yards

105
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:22,520
of coal ash were released and
they eventually reached the Emory River.

106
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,250
So you can see this looks tragic
even in a high overhead view and

107
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:30,980
on the ground it was absolute destruction,
millions of dollars in property damage.

108
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:34,170
Amazingly, there were no
immediate injuries or deaths but

109
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:37,680
you might now imagine that people
are living in an area where the water and

110
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,640
the soil is contaminated with toxins.

111
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:43,450
This could lead to a more
chronic risk of health outcomes.

112
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:48,000
This is also incredibly expensive, cost
more than a billion dollars to clean up.

113
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,500
In fact, this is the worst coal ash
related disaster in US history,

114
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,775
but it's far from the only one.

115
00:06:52,775 --> 00:06:54,523
Now I want to zoom in and

116
00:06:54,523 --> 00:07:00,412
have you think about your own home- is
their hazardous waste in your house?

117
00:07:00,412 --> 00:07:04,314
The answer is almost certainly yes, if we
think about types of hazardous materials

118
00:07:04,314 --> 00:07:07,672
that might be there that are waste,
you're not using them any longer.

119
00:07:07,672 --> 00:07:11,964
Old paints and oils, old cleaners,
batteries, pesticides,

120
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:16,280
electronic and electrical equipment or
so-called E-Waste.

121
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:19,745
I'd like to take a moment and
just highlight ways that you can actually

122
00:07:19,745 --> 00:07:22,226
prevent the future creation
of hazardous waste.

123
00:07:22,226 --> 00:07:26,259
Again, that should be our first order
of business here by eliminating or

124
00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:28,120
substituting toxic materials.

125
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,860
So for example,
the next time your sink is clogged,

126
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:35,520
can you use a plunger instead
of toxic chemical drain cleaner?

127
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,810
If you have to clean glass instead of
using a chemical glass cleaner that's

128
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:42,455
going to be waste when you're done with
it, maybe just use vinegar and water.

129
00:07:42,455 --> 00:07:47,495
Or if you have an issue with moths use
cedar chips instead of chemical mothballs.

130
00:07:47,495 --> 00:07:50,365
So these are just a few simple
steps that you can take to

131
00:07:50,365 --> 00:07:55,480
potentially eliminate the creation
of hazardous waste in your own home.

132
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:59,410
Finally, I'd like to highlight a study
that focused on how we get existing

133
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:04,220
household hazardous waste out of
people's homes into safe disposal areas.

134
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:07,800
So this graphic and what I'm going to
describe to you come from a study that was

135
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,520
done in San Luis Obispo, California.

136
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:14,680
Now San Luis Obispo has an Integrated
Waste Management Authority responsible for

137
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,680
handling both solid and hazardous
waste and in particular, they set

138
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:23,310
a goal to get fluorescent lamps and
household batteries and medical sharps and

139
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:28,920
latex paint out of people's homes and
to a safe disposal location.

140
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,780
So they were actually able to
design an intervention here and

141
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:37,045
start to ask questions like,
what influences people's likelihood of

142
00:08:37,045 --> 00:08:39,995
appropriately disposing of
household hazardous waste?

143
00:08:39,995 --> 00:08:43,225
Things like, can they park wherever
they need to go to drop this off?

144
00:08:43,225 --> 00:08:45,745
What are the hours of
the place that they're going?

145
00:08:45,745 --> 00:08:50,040
What type of shop or store or
location are they going to?

146
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,080
So they were actually able to have
a number of different types of stores

147
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,864
involved here, grocery stores,

148
00:08:54,864 --> 00:09:00,220
mini-marts, pharmacies, electronics
retailers and home improvement stores.

149
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:03,300
And so the graphic here is showing
basically the flow of this system.

150
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,670
You'll see the San Luis Obispo
Integrated Waste Management Authority,

151
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:10,780
that blue box in the lower right corner,
and that's connected to the large box in

152
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:13,760
the upper left, the retailers
with full collection containers.

153
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,950
Again, the idea here is the consumers
come to the retailer and

154
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:19,400
they drop off their
household hazardous waste.

155
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,220
The retailer then lets
the management authority know, hey,

156
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,500
we've got hazardous waste.

157
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,860
And the authority then invoices the
retailer and the transfer facility where

158
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,940
this stuff needs to go comes out and
collects the waste directly

159
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:37,400
from the retailer or the retailer can self
transport it to the transfer facility.

160
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,740
You'll also see a dashed line
in the upper right hand corner.

161
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:43,890
In some cases, the retailer can send the
waste directly back to the manufacturer or

162
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:48,180
producer who may then recycle it and
use it to create new products.

163
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,450
So this is an example
of a very organized and

164
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:54,210
methodical way to look at
things that influence your and

165
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:57,740
my likelihood of taking household
hazardous waste where it needs to go.

166
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:02,040
And they found not surprisingly that
convenience was a very strong factor, but

167
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,180
also the type of store
that people were going to.

168
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:08,630
Both of these were predictive
of how many batteries and

169
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:11,060
how many lamps they collected.

170
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:13,810
So again,
here's an example of a local government

171
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:16,620
trying to do its best to recover

172
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:20,270
hazardous waste in a way that ensures
that it can be disposed of properly.

173
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:24,580
There are many other actions and
efforts like this going on in the US and

174
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:28,842
around the world to protect public
health from hazardous waste.
