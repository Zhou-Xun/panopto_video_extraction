1
00:00:09,578 --> 00:00:14,100
In a previous module, we discussed how
very dangerous workplaces can be for

2
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:18,554
workers and the tremendous toll that
injuries and illnesses represent for

3
00:00:18,554 --> 00:00:21,610
workers in the United States and
around the world.

4
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:25,125
But what can we actually do to
prevent those injuries and illnesses?

5
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:29,585
The good news is quite a bit as
we'll learn in this session.

6
00:00:29,585 --> 00:00:33,784
The hierarchy of controls as you see
visualized here is a framework that allows

7
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:36,647
us to organize our thoughts
around how to approach and

8
00:00:36,647 --> 00:00:38,506
reduce hazards in the workplace.

9
00:00:38,506 --> 00:00:42,945
I will say though that this hierarchy can
be applied to any environmental hazard.

10
00:00:42,945 --> 00:00:45,938
We'll talk about it here in the context
of the workplace but again,

11
00:00:45,938 --> 00:00:47,790
it applies to the community just as well.

12
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:51,078
This hierarchy actually grew
out of occupational health but

13
00:00:51,078 --> 00:00:54,568
has since been broadly adopted
in the public health community.

14
00:00:54,568 --> 00:00:56,272
So what is the hierarchy of controls?

15
00:00:56,272 --> 00:00:59,789
Well looking at the top of the image
here you can see in blue we have

16
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:02,409
elimination this is
marked as most effective.

17
00:01:02,409 --> 00:01:06,772
Elimination basically involves physically
removing a hazard from a workplace.

18
00:01:06,772 --> 00:01:11,009
So if the hazard is no longer there
they're can by definition be no exposure

19
00:01:11,009 --> 00:01:13,443
and no subsequent injury or illness risk.

20
00:01:13,443 --> 00:01:17,168
In circumstances where we can't eliminate
a hazard we could also consider

21
00:01:17,168 --> 00:01:18,416
substituting a hazard.

22
00:01:18,416 --> 00:01:22,366
This basically means replacing something
that's unsafe with something that

23
00:01:22,366 --> 00:01:25,963
is considered safer, perhaps not
completely safe but not as harmful.

24
00:01:25,963 --> 00:01:29,602
In some circumstances we have
the opportunity to apply what are called

25
00:01:29,602 --> 00:01:30,903
engineering controls.

26
00:01:30,903 --> 00:01:34,840
And these are basically physical changes
to the workplace designed to isolate

27
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,755
people from the hazards around them.

28
00:01:36,755 --> 00:01:40,039
So the hazards are still there but
we're preventing contact them.

29
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:44,839
Administrative controls are changes to
the way people do their work again to

30
00:01:44,839 --> 00:01:47,540
remove them from having those exposures.

31
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:52,501
And finally last on this list is PPE or
personal protective equipment.

32
00:01:52,501 --> 00:01:55,031
This is equipment that
the worker wears and

33
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:57,777
is designed to protect
them against hazards.

34
00:01:57,777 --> 00:01:59,470
So you might ask why this order?

35
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:03,626
Well, it turns out elimination, of course,
is most effective because if the hazard is

36
00:02:03,626 --> 00:02:06,731
no longer in the workplace we don't
have to worry about it at all.

37
00:02:06,731 --> 00:02:10,619
So basically as we go down from top
to bottom in the hierarchy we go

38
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:13,146
from most effective to least effective.

39
00:02:13,146 --> 00:02:18,076
And PPE is considered least effective
because it relies on the worker to know

40
00:02:18,076 --> 00:02:19,392
how to wear the PPE.

41
00:02:19,392 --> 00:02:20,540
When to wear it.

42
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,242
How to wear it correctly.

43
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:27,011
And so, of course, we don't want to put
that burden on the worker until we've

44
00:02:27,011 --> 00:02:29,273
exhausted all of our other options.

45
00:02:29,273 --> 00:02:32,899
So let's zoom in a little bit on the upper
levels of the hierarchy of controls.

46
00:02:32,899 --> 00:02:36,555
Let's imagine a workplace here
where we have a dip tank as

47
00:02:36,555 --> 00:02:39,839
you can see that's emitting some vapors or
gases.

48
00:02:39,839 --> 00:02:42,696
And those vapors and gases can travel
throughout the workplace until they come

49
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:44,433
into contact with a worker
who is then exposed.

50
00:02:44,433 --> 00:02:49,048
When I talk about elimination I'm talking
about reducing the quantity of the hazard

51
00:02:49,048 --> 00:02:50,023
in that dip tank or

52
00:02:50,023 --> 00:02:53,610
maybe preventing the creation of
that hazard in the first place.

53
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:55,759
Maybe I eliminate that process altogether.

54
00:02:55,759 --> 00:03:00,621
Substitution can also reduce
the quantity of a hazard in a workplace.

55
00:03:00,621 --> 00:03:04,605
And again this notion of replacing a
serious hazard with a less serious one may

56
00:03:04,605 --> 00:03:06,077
not fully fix the problem but

57
00:03:06,077 --> 00:03:08,852
can definitely result in
benefits to the workforce.

58
00:03:08,852 --> 00:03:12,460
And engineering controls as I
mentioned previously are ways for

59
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:16,212
us to prevent the worker from coming
into contact with the hazard.

60
00:03:16,212 --> 00:03:20,234
So the hazard is still present in
the workplace, but we've modified or

61
00:03:20,234 --> 00:03:23,719
reduced the rate or
the spatial distribution of the release of

62
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:27,960
that hazard to protect workers from
coming into contact with that hazard.

63
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,580
Some examples of
elimination that have been

64
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:34,627
incredibly successful are the US
ban on asbestos in most products.

65
00:03:34,627 --> 00:03:38,384
So we used a lot of asbestos in
this country prior to the 1970s

66
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:43,131
now we use virtually none because it's
been banned in almost all applications.

67
00:03:43,131 --> 00:03:49,737
We've had similar success with banning
lead for example in gasoline and in paint.

68
00:03:49,737 --> 00:03:54,829
In terms of substitution, many workplaces
have moved from organic solvents which can

69
00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:59,236
be quite toxic to workers to water-based
detergents that are less toxic.

70
00:03:59,236 --> 00:04:03,337
So for example, some workplaces have
abandoned the use of benzene which is

71
00:04:03,337 --> 00:04:05,291
a carcinogenic organic solvent and

72
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:09,668
instead use toluene which is not perfectly
safe but which is much, much safer.

73
00:04:09,668 --> 00:04:14,163
We can also think about using a less
hazardous physical form of the same

74
00:04:14,163 --> 00:04:14,778
hazard.

75
00:04:14,778 --> 00:04:19,335
So if you look at the image here your
risk of breathing in lead is minimal if

76
00:04:19,335 --> 00:04:21,965
we're dealing with a full ingot of lead.

77
00:04:21,965 --> 00:04:26,906
But the smaller and smaller we break
that lead into particles or flakes or

78
00:04:26,906 --> 00:04:30,632
powder or even a fume in the air
the easier it becomes for

79
00:04:30,632 --> 00:04:35,417
workers to have that come into contact
with them and enter their body.

80
00:04:35,417 --> 00:04:36,903
In terms of engineering controls,

81
00:04:36,903 --> 00:04:39,188
we've all had experience
with ventilation systems.

82
00:04:39,188 --> 00:04:42,822
So the ventilation systems in most
buildings are designed for heating and

83
00:04:42,822 --> 00:04:44,119
cooling and for comfort.

84
00:04:44,119 --> 00:04:47,406
But in factories, for example,
and also in laboratories,

85
00:04:47,406 --> 00:04:51,852
as you see visualized here there are vents
and hoods available that are designed to

86
00:04:51,852 --> 00:04:55,665
suck contaminants away from workers
before they can breathe them in.

87
00:04:55,665 --> 00:04:57,900
In some facilities,
there are also enclosures.

88
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:02,252
So, for example, a booth that the worker
sits inside that it's designed to keep

89
00:05:02,252 --> 00:05:05,517
the hazard outside the booth and
protect the worker inside.

90
00:05:05,517 --> 00:05:08,648
And you can find engineering
controls in virtually any location.

91
00:05:08,648 --> 00:05:12,639
So if you think of a healthcare
setting historically needle sticks

92
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,129
among healthcare providers have been
a huge cause of injury and Illness but

93
00:05:17,129 --> 00:05:20,420
new needles have been designed
to be operated safely.

94
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:24,481
They make it much harder for you to stick
yourself at all and very, very difficult

95
00:05:24,481 --> 00:05:28,502
to stick yourself with a needle that's
already been used and is contaminated.

96
00:05:28,502 --> 00:05:32,148
Administrative controls as I
mentioned earlier are designed to

97
00:05:32,148 --> 00:05:34,178
change the way that work gets done.

98
00:05:34,178 --> 00:05:37,441
So they in some cases will inform and
warn people that a hazard or

99
00:05:37,441 --> 00:05:38,745
an exposure is present.

100
00:05:38,745 --> 00:05:43,946
They can educate people on how to be safe,
how to work safely around a hazard.

101
00:05:43,946 --> 00:05:47,654
We can actually define procedures
to make hazardous operation safe.

102
00:05:47,654 --> 00:05:51,510
So as you can see in the image here
certain very dangerous procedures may

103
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:55,688
actually have a checklist or a routine
procedure that workers can follow that

104
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:59,365
it's specifically designed to
reduce their exposure to hazards.

105
00:05:59,365 --> 00:06:03,724
And then finally the lowest level of
the hierarchy of controls again is PPE.

106
00:06:03,724 --> 00:06:07,741
So this truly is our last line of defense
because again, we're relying on the worker

107
00:06:07,741 --> 00:06:11,604
to protect themselves rather than making
the workplace safe in the first place.

108
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:16,281
Examples of administrative
controls might include signs that

109
00:06:16,281 --> 00:06:18,315
are posted at work places.

110
00:06:18,315 --> 00:06:21,653
Things like safety training sessions or
safety briefings and

111
00:06:21,653 --> 00:06:25,262
as you can see in the image here
procedures like lockout/tagout.

112
00:06:25,262 --> 00:06:28,511
This particular procedure gives each
worker a lock and when they're working on

113
00:06:28,511 --> 00:06:31,421
equipment that could energize and
potentially electrocute or crush or

114
00:06:31,421 --> 00:06:34,767
otherwise harm them they're basically able
to lock the power switch off so that no

115
00:06:34,767 --> 00:06:38,086
one else can come on and accidentally turn
on that equipment and harm the worker.

116
00:06:38,086 --> 00:06:43,415
So until that worker is done with
the process and removes their lock

117
00:06:43,415 --> 00:06:49,327
that process can't be energized and
the worker is guaranteed to be safe.

118
00:06:49,327 --> 00:06:54,000
Personal protective equipment you may have
walked by a construction site or other

119
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,334
facility in the past and seen an image
like you see here where there's many,

120
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:01,062
many different types of
protection required.

121
00:07:01,062 --> 00:07:04,520
Again, we don't rely on this as
the only way to keep workers safe but

122
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,895
it can be the final line
of defense basically.

123
00:07:06,895 --> 00:07:11,746
And there's PPE available for virtually
any situation or body part you can

124
00:07:11,746 --> 00:07:17,227
conceive of, eyes, ears, your head,
your feet, your hands, your lungs, etc.

125
00:07:17,227 --> 00:07:22,682
So let's zoom in on a particular type of
PPE just to give you a better example.

126
00:07:22,682 --> 00:07:26,297
What about potential hazards
to your eyes in the workplace?

127
00:07:26,297 --> 00:07:29,470
What sorts of things could
harm your vision or your eyes?

128
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:33,118
Those things include heat,
the possibility of impacts,

129
00:07:33,118 --> 00:07:37,665
chemical exposure, dust exposure and
optical radiation like lasers.

130
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:42,102
So if we think about the types of eye
protection available there are quite

131
00:07:42,102 --> 00:07:46,610
a few, in fact, so here you can see
illustrations of safety spectacles,

132
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:48,671
safety goggles and face shield.

133
00:07:48,671 --> 00:07:53,304
So safety spectacles are basically
designed to protect only against frontal

134
00:07:53,304 --> 00:07:53,951
impacts.

135
00:07:53,951 --> 00:07:57,874
Safety goggles have side protection so
they can protect against impacts and

136
00:07:57,874 --> 00:08:01,383
also potentially against splashes,
for example, of chemicals.

137
00:08:01,383 --> 00:08:04,268
And then a face shield protects
not only your eyes but

138
00:08:04,268 --> 00:08:08,549
your entire face from impacts and
again from things like chemical splashes.

139
00:08:08,549 --> 00:08:11,465
I'd like to pose a question to you.

140
00:08:11,465 --> 00:08:15,835
Where would a vaccine fall in
the hierarchy of controls?

141
00:08:15,835 --> 00:08:19,504
So in a lot of healthcare workplaces
in recent years' flu shots,

142
00:08:19,504 --> 00:08:23,188
for example, have become mandatory for
healthcare providers.

143
00:08:23,188 --> 00:08:24,926
So you don't have to get the flu shot but

144
00:08:24,926 --> 00:08:28,100
if you don't get the flu shot you
can't work at that facility anymore.

145
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,822
So, where is this on
the hierarchy of controls?

146
00:08:30,822 --> 00:08:34,178
Is it a personal protective equipment
because we're actually injecting it into

147
00:08:34,178 --> 00:08:36,364
an individual and
it's going to protect that person?

148
00:08:36,364 --> 00:08:40,832
Is it an administrative control because
we're requiring this behavior change for

149
00:08:40,832 --> 00:08:42,890
all the workers in these facilities?

150
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:47,690
Is it an engineering control because we're
basically re-engineering the workers body

151
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:49,035
to reject this vaccine?

152
00:08:49,035 --> 00:08:53,526
Or is it elimination control because
we're basically trying to eliminate

153
00:08:53,526 --> 00:08:56,814
the virus from ever coming
into contact with workers?

154
00:08:56,814 --> 00:08:59,983
Well, the answer is it's
actually all of those things.

155
00:08:59,983 --> 00:09:04,768
So as we increasingly learn more about
how to control occupational hazards we're

156
00:09:04,768 --> 00:09:07,819
coming across controls that
actually meet multiple

157
00:09:07,819 --> 00:09:10,051
levels of the hierarchy of controls.

158
00:09:10,051 --> 00:09:14,852
The image here actually shows a way
you can communicate occupational

159
00:09:14,852 --> 00:09:16,847
controls to the workforce.

160
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:21,364
This specific image is focused on
Hexavalent Chromium which is a particular

161
00:09:21,364 --> 00:09:22,642
type of carcinogen.

162
00:09:22,642 --> 00:09:26,530
And as you can see across the top of
the image here we're looking at different

163
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:27,517
kinds of welding.

164
00:09:27,517 --> 00:09:31,754
So you and I as non welders may just think
of welding as a single operation but

165
00:09:31,754 --> 00:09:35,587
it turns out different types of
welding can be relatively cleaner or

166
00:09:35,587 --> 00:09:38,494
dirtier in terms of how
many hazards they produce.

167
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:42,540
So we've got different types of welding
across the top and on the vertical axis,

168
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,874
we're looking at different
environments that the worker might be

169
00:09:45,874 --> 00:09:49,233
welding in from outdoors all the way
down to a very confined space.

170
00:09:49,233 --> 00:09:53,496
The colors that you see on the image here
correspond to different types of controls

171
00:09:53,496 --> 00:09:54,434
that are needed.

172
00:09:54,434 --> 00:09:59,074
So in green you can see for certain
types of welding in certain conditions

173
00:09:59,074 --> 00:10:03,335
natural ventilation or just natural
air movement is enough to keep

174
00:10:03,335 --> 00:10:07,308
the concentrations of hazards
low enough around the welder.

175
00:10:07,308 --> 00:10:10,218
In orange conversely,
you can see areas and

176
00:10:10,218 --> 00:10:13,139
types of welding where that's not enough.

177
00:10:13,139 --> 00:10:17,182
We actually have to apply what's called
local exhaust ventilation to suck those

178
00:10:17,182 --> 00:10:20,578
contaminants away from the welder
before they can breathe them in.

179
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:23,118
And in red we're looking
at types of welding and

180
00:10:23,118 --> 00:10:27,439
different environments where local exhaust
ventilation alone is not enough and

181
00:10:27,439 --> 00:10:29,737
the worker also needs to use a respirator.

182
00:10:29,737 --> 00:10:31,989
So I quite like this example
because it's visual.

183
00:10:31,989 --> 00:10:36,105
It's designed to be used by
the end-user the welder in this case.

184
00:10:36,105 --> 00:10:40,725
And because it very clearly lays out
the hierarchy of controls in a real-world

185
00:10:40,725 --> 00:10:41,360
setting.

186
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,768
So I want to return us to this concept
of the exposure disease framework.

187
00:10:45,768 --> 00:10:49,596
Again, when we're talking about
occupational exposures each of the steps

188
00:10:49,596 --> 00:10:53,544
of the exposure disease framework from
source to adverse health effects occur

189
00:10:53,544 --> 00:10:54,767
within the workplace.

190
00:10:54,767 --> 00:10:59,259
And when we talk about occupational
controls we're basically trying to either

191
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:04,021
eliminate the source or stop the movement
of pollutants throughout the workplace or

192
00:11:04,021 --> 00:11:07,349
stop human exposure from occurring.
