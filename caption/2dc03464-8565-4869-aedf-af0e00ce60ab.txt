1
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:16,220
So it's. Person to person firms like.

2
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:35,580
As we talked. Wednesday.

3
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:54,450
Right. Today. Sorry.

4
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:59,790
So I. Those videos weren't in my office. Looks like the first one's a little confused, so we will see.

5
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:04,350
But they're really kind of fascinating. So I look forward to hearing what you guys think.

6
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:12,989
So today we're going to talk about some of the wastewater very specific,

7
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:19,200
but in a way sort of cuts across a lot of different topics that we've been talking about in this class all along.

8
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:27,930
My colleague, Emily Fredericks, I mentioned her because the case people have an interest in this area in sort of hospital settings,

9
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:33,240
medication adherence, pediatric psychology, that is like her domain.

10
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:39,830
And so people are interested. She always loves to chat with people who are coming from different disciplines.

11
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,389
And she and I have worked together on a few studies around sort of diabetes, diabetes management.

12
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:56,040
So I'll have some diabetes examples. But if people have interest in that in the space, that is her contact info, she could not make it today.

13
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:02,560
Also just did a course evaluation check maybe like an hour ago before my last thing and 14 out of 24.

14
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:07,470
So we're getting there. We've gotten over 50%. So that's good that we can keep going.

15
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:19,620
Okay. So today we'll talk about adherence, kind of what you know, what is involved in medical regimen adherence.

16
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,049
And this can cut across so many different things.

17
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:29,310
So we'll just talk a little bit broadly about experience and then kind of what to think about developmentally and sort of what kids can,

18
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:30,870
you know, be managing.

19
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:39,690
And then I'll go through some examples and we can talk about their developmental change and hopefully leave with some intervention strategy ideas.

20
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:45,930
But we'll watch a few videos because that's just upsetting to make it very real.

21
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:56,730
So starting off, why is this an issue? Well, certainly kids have, you know, as a group, a lot of health conditions to manage.

22
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:01,710
And we've talked a lot of we've talked very little relatively about this in a class that's called child health and development.

23
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:08,100
I am aware, but this is just a really specific core issue for a lot of kids.

24
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:18,080
And some of these illnesses can be chronic. Some can be not chronic, but have like sort of longer term components to them.

25
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:24,180
So asthma, I think we talked about like on day one, very common illness in childhood, starting a young child.

26
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:30,390
And some of these things can come on, you know, can be known at birth.

27
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:33,810
Some come on in very young kids and some even later.

28
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:38,780
So, you know, there's a wide range here.

29
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:44,550
And what's important to know is that a lot of kids and something we haven't talked about so much in here.

30
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:50,340
So type one diabetes is something that I've been studying for the past few years,

31
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:57,530
I would say with colleagues who know a whole lot about type one diabetes, which is not what I know about in depth.

32
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:03,419
It's just sort of like in case when people have detailed questions about diabetes.

33
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,850
But I have learned a lot from my wonderful colleagues.

34
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:11,070
This is why I do work with people who are who know things that are, you know, different than the things that you know.

35
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:20,130
So there is a lot going that kids and families need to manage and type one diabetes just kind of diving into this example.

36
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:29,010
So the goal here is to keep one's blood glucose at a manageable level and under control.

37
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:35,729
And what we can do to help kids manage that is a lot of these different behaviors.

38
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:39,930
So when we get insulin, we're checking glucose.

39
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:44,879
And if in an emergency situation, we have to sort of act fast.

40
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:52,470
We have emergency medications that kids might need if they're having a significant difficulty.

41
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:59,100
So type one diabetes, I think, is a good example of something that's just daily unremitting,

42
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:10,620
chronic disease to manage, and it also has some sort of high risk emergent moments to it.

43
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:17,520
Almost all kids who have it. The other thing to know is that with type one diabetes,

44
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:25,110
basically it's the idea that your pancreas isn't working and so you have to sort of manage the functions of your pancreas externally.

45
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,209
Right. So the key thing is that this is a lifelong condition.

46
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:35,730
And so if you're diagnosed with that as a really, really young kid, it's with you your entire life.

47
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:45,300
And so you need to manage that. And this point of demands, meticulous planning, it is remarkable the level of planning.

48
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,340
That is needed to manage type one diabetes.

49
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:55,240
I actually just this weekend was reading a bunch of interviews with moms that we did who were managing their kids diabetes.

50
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,630
And, you know, just on a simple level,

51
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:04,150
the never I was never being able to get sleep for like years on end because you're

52
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:09,219
having to monitor your child's blood sugar overnight and it can sort of go up and down.

53
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:11,680
And that's what you don't know how to do in diabetes.

54
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:18,880
So just as a sort of, you know, sleep is one example of many, many things that people are managing.

55
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:29,500
Another example, and this is really what Emily's work involves, is liver transplant and solid organ transplant.

56
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:37,120
And so this is another thing that is, again, not super common, but more common than we might think, even in pediatrics.

57
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:43,270
And so kids can get a transplant of an organ as working, which is great and wonderful and it saves their life.

58
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:50,260
But in order for that organ to keep working well, they need to take immunosuppressant medications,

59
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:53,799
have a lot of ongoing follow up again, like for their entire life.

60
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:59,860
So this is sort of the lifelong to be adherent to the medical regimen, whatever that may be.

61
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,280
And I also include this photo, which is real photo of someone's medication regimen.

62
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:11,920
So I don't know if you can see that, but there's, you know, lots and lots and lots of pillboxes there and numbers.

63
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:18,249
And so those all represent like pills that need to be taken in a certain order, different times of day,

64
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:23,200
some with food, some without food, some you must eat, some you can't eat, you know, before you take it.

65
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:28,010
And so it's just a nice, nice slash,

66
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:36,399
like stressful visual example of this is a lot this is a lot for kids to do to learn how to do this all for families to know how to do.

67
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,790
And it's a lot to sort of figure out how we're going to support families around.

68
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:47,320
So those are just are two examples of different types of chronic conditions that require medication management.

69
00:07:47,920 --> 00:08:04,270
And this video just sort of introduces us to some kids who've had various and assorted medical conditions that they need to manage their regimens for.

70
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:13,299
And one thing that's kind of cool is that this video is the kids who are involved

71
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:17,170
in making it like they were very inspired thinking about for next week,

72
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:20,020
which is positive youth engagement and empowerment.

73
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:25,959
Kids were very engaged in making this video at Myer, and so it was sort of a way for them to like give back.

74
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:32,080
So I think we at some point, various points have talked to some of the kids in this video,

75
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:37,810
which is now a few years old, but they were just so excited to like share their expertise.

76
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:44,410
And I think that that's something that's interesting to observe as you watch the kids talk about this, their medication management.

77
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:50,890
But just, you know, we can sit back and watch. It's like a five minute video and let me know what you notice.

78
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:57,400
And I may stop it if I. Okay.

79
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:11,970
Yeah. My one alarm clock in.

80
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:17,010
I have no clue. So, 7:00. Come in my shop.

81
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:22,800
My name is Jaylon and I had a kidney transplant in my 12 year old.

82
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:26,910
Hi. My name's Laura. And I have asthma too.

83
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:34,980
And I've been in that patient all my life. My mom reminds me when I forget, but most of the time, I'm responsible for my own care.

84
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:42,810
Hi, my name is Tom here. I'm 19 years old. I'm a student here at the University of Michigan, and I've been a patient in hospital my entire life.

85
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:49,500
Yeah, it's important that I take my medications on 12 hour increments for them to work effectively.

86
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:54,410
I was six months old when I was diagnosed with liver cancer, and I had a liver transplant for ten months.

87
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:58,080
So, you know, I started when I was little and all the medications.

88
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:07,860
So my mom was I don't want to say overbearing, but she was very, very good about always making me take my pills on time,

89
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:12,419
you know, because that's all I really knew was going to happen. So she was very good at that.

90
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:17,100
And then through the years, she's done really well bringing me up with the mentality of, Hey,

91
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:24,150
you have to take your pills on time, you have to take your belt out and see with my nurses and doctors down, here I am.

92
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:30,720
So what's one thing that we can already notice that a number of kids have mentioned?

93
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:35,250
I think maybe all three. Yeah. Crazy, definitely.

94
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:45,560
Like parental involvement. Sounds very pleasant and necessary to kind of help you take the medications and maybe to kind of be on the like.

95
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:50,430
Yeah, absolutely. Like my mom right there.

96
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:53,759
All I think all of my mom helped me. My mom helped me.

97
00:10:53,760 --> 00:11:01,170
And I like how she goes. I don't want to say overbearing, but, you know, and then imagine from that parent's perspective,

98
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:06,720
you know, he was actually a research assistant who was sort of helping with create this video to.

99
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:12,560
Just establishing a routine. Seems like everything's really regimented.

100
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:16,820
Yeah. Yeah. So some of those medications, the timing is really critical.

101
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:25,220
And again, like type one diabetes, the timing is very critical there because you're really monitoring every sort of nutritional intake meal snack,

102
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:29,360
too, and managing that with medication. Okay.

103
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:36,520
So we got Mom as a feeling for sure. And routine special late night night night.

104
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:41,689
Right? Oh, right. Hi.

105
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:46,610
I'm home. I'm 11 years old.

106
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:53,389
Oh, that's right. We actually take a lot of pills, and I really want some of that in the morning.

107
00:11:53,390 --> 00:12:04,880
Not at night. Well, at first it was hard, but now it's very easy for me to keep happening.

108
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:10,530
Just very confident. Finally I let him tell me.

109
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:16,650
I'm 12 years old and I was born with hypoplastic left heart syndrome and I just got a heart transplant three years ago.

110
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:26,610
Since I was in second rate, I've been taking concert only focus in school because of what I've been through.

111
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:33,530
And I. My mom would always remind me in the morning and to take my medication at school during lunch.

112
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:38,500
So I'd have to take it twice a day with all the pain. When I had my cancer.

113
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:42,780
I had to call every day for MRI's. It'd be every day.

114
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:46,320
And it'd be every week, every month, every couple of months.

115
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:50,430
Right now, not a year. Once a year, I call it from our eyes.

116
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:55,320
And I talk to Dr. asking my neurosurgeon about the scans.

117
00:12:55,870 --> 00:13:02,220
And before I used to get sedated and I just sit there for the hour or how long it would take.

118
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:09,270
And yes, they are very loud. I'm excited that I'm currently 17 years old and cancer free.

119
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:16,809
So there are some other things that they're like the kid who's a really confident kid with heart transplant.

120
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:22,570
It's just like I just pop them in. But I think that also reflects like it's aversive to take pills, right?

121
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:26,520
Like, if if you're a little kid, that's often something that people have to learn.

122
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:34,709
You know, if they're not used to taking a ton of pills at some point, you know, people need to learn that skill and it's a very physical swallow.

123
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:40,740
You have to be coordinated. You're not choke. And so he was 11, I think, and even a little bit younger.

124
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:46,559
And he was like focused on the sort of physicality of like, I take the pills now and that's not a problem.

125
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:51,780
But sort of thinking again long term that'll that'll probably shift as you know exactly what

126
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:57,170
you in this video with me because I have a friend who has a very similar situation oh,

127
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:00,870
same name and he got treated here. So I'm wondering if it's maybe it's him.

128
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,590
I don't know. I think I want to say it's like 2013.

129
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:08,790
Oh, my gosh. Yeah. No, that would be him and see what's going to happen.

130
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:11,940
So, you know, full disclosure, they were all against me. Video.

131
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:17,340
I have an extra sneak peek. Yeah, yeah.

132
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:20,540
I mean, I think that's the thing, too. Like, these kids are little.

133
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:25,740
Right. And it's interesting to kind of see how they conceptualize what it is that they're doing.

134
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,840
I think the other the last kid who was talking is 17 year old.

135
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:36,600
His treatment regimen has changed. Right. So he had cancer and so it was like intensive for a while.

136
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:42,720
And then now it's less frequent, but he still is kind of monitoring or being monitored.

137
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,900
So I think that's another thing to think about the sort of shift.

138
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:59,559
Is their advice always out of cloth or wash your hands or ask your mom, is it the time to take a soccer mom to all the dads?

139
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,980
Put them in my phone. Name them. Program the mother.

140
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:11,200
Where every time you have to have number one, he's the father. The alarm goes off is really loud and you're like, Wow.

141
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:14,880
But yeah, I programed them in the phone so people are not listening.

142
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:20,469
And I also have a little people playing it up in his pocket and have a little talk about who cares?

143
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:27,500
And I'll call him if he's outside play, you know, and [INAUDIBLE] come in because I think his sisters are not that good to me.

144
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:36,040
So lots of backup plans. And again, 2013, it's slightly older technology, but technology is certainly a theme.

145
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:41,860
So like people as backup technology, multiple pieces of technology in multiple places.

146
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:46,060
And her son is young enough that he was like now playing with friends.

147
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:49,630
And [INAUDIBLE] come in like, is he always going to do that? We don't know.

148
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:53,439
It's like every night around like 9:00. I do.

149
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,250
My students generally don't make calls for that night in the morning.

150
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:03,160
Things that I do to undertaking that is always keep it in one place,

151
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:11,140
one place where you always do it and repetition every morning at the same time and just every day thing after that.

152
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:18,690
I usually, you know, at the stick, you know, where and some somewhere where, you know,

153
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:24,940
I can see I see it every day and I know I need to take the ones that I need to have certain things.

154
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:29,470
But my other that's I just hate when I feel sick or nauseous.

155
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:36,070
Hi, my name is Michael and I am Rhabdomyosarcoma, a cancer patient.

156
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:42,490
I had stage four cancer after type one thing.

157
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:48,280
So he is also noting that there's my maintenance meds and then when I have symptoms, I take other ones again.

158
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:54,909
So like it's a lot of decision making, like a lot of like monit self-monitoring routines,

159
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:59,860
self-imposed routines and a lot of like decision making and kind of micro decision making.

160
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:10,570
Go back and then go back like that and write off one thing and make it go down.

161
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:19,540
So what I've been doing since I'm in college now is just keeping a right on my desk, right where I do all most of my homework and my research.

162
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:26,379
And I just picked a time that where I was going to be in my dorm every day and night

163
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:31,200
normally and just remember to take my roommate's pretty good about the anniversary,

164
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:41,440
so I'm thinking about that. Reflecting on being a college student, having a regular time at one is in one storm and like leaving meds on the desk.

165
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:47,319
I think we can see like lots of opportunities for that to sort of go wrong.

166
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:52,990
So you really have to be on that. And then the roommate I like the roommate reference is sort of become the mom.

167
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:58,540
Yeah. Also, I think he was the one that said you have to take it every 12 hours in a day.

168
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:05,290
So you would take it a lot like for him and like, that's crazy, you know what I'm saying?

169
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:06,489
Right, right.

170
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:16,420
Picking a time that you would reliably be awake in 12 and 12 hour anchor points in the college student environment when your sleep is all over.

171
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:30,250
Absolutely. Really good point. While my mom kind of reminds me of I just can remember like I like by looking at

172
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:37,390
the clock while I'm eating breakfast in the morning during before school because.

173
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:45,370
Okay. Okay. So that video one. Yeah.

174
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:50,270
So lots of sort of themes similar across kids.

175
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:59,630
Oops. Sorry. Now I'm going to have like 59 videos.

176
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,390
We'll see how they am. Okay.

177
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:08,160
So anything else you guys notice on video or.

178
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:14,309
No, I mean, we noticed a lot of like children that were very young or like started with like

179
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:17,610
there are three men very young and like a lot of over two of them are like,

180
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:22,919
oh yeah, you like manage my medications, but like your mom reminded them like that ownership at like 12.

181
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:27,150
And I'm like, even now at the moment, I have to take medication. It's like very hard for me to do it.

182
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:30,929
So I think like, they'll be establishing that routine and it's becoming an everyday thing.

183
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:36,299
So like, it's pretty cool to see them take ownership. Like, yeah, I mean, yeah, yeah, definitely.

184
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:40,790
It's a sort of transition point from talking about that to an adolescent period in Cali.

185
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:47,700
It made me think about kind of like what Jennifer said about management and keeping up with things that,

186
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:54,000
like most kids don't have to do, but even like a lot of health care professionals aren't trained to do, they think about passing meds.

187
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,180
Like, I have a lot of friends in nursing school and they can't pass meds,

188
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:02,639
but you're going to have a ten, 12 year old take all those pills and manage them themselves.

189
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:10,799
Or like for me as a phlebotomist, I'm not trained to draw blood out of pick lines or certain intravenous catheters.

190
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:19,800
But I saw another Tic TAC mom who was drawing her morning labs out of her port in the car.

191
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:23,219
And I'm not even trying to do that. I've been doing it for two or three years.

192
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:31,000
So just these types of things that these people are tasked with, tasked with are not minor in the whole health care situation.

193
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:35,370
There's a lot of training that actual professionals have to go through to be able to do that.

194
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:43,440
Yeah, yeah. That's a really good point. So like the level of expertise that you kind of have to immediately start to get to is really intense.

195
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:54,360
Yeah, I was thinking about how difficult it is that have to one of the kids have to like stop playing like I'm inside and take those medications.

196
00:20:54,900 --> 00:21:02,010
And the college students had to make sure that he was like in storms that you could take just like the timing of it and like feeling the like.

197
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:06,030
So now I'm going to do this responsible kind of.

198
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,409
Absolutely. And even something is sort of like relatively simpler.

199
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:16,360
It's like an asthma inhaler, right? I like to do that before playing sports, for example.

200
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:17,860
That's so common.

201
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:26,650
And yet it also requires a level of, again, like that self-monitoring of your body, remembering to bring it with you, having it in your bag.

202
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:32,100
And in addition to like your basketball shoes or whatever else you have to remember, it makes a lot of things to remember to.

203
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:40,550
Another thing I think all of these kids have been doing in life for a very young age since like in bed,

204
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:47,720
this is all they know is that they have to live life like this and be honest at times that tool and activity limitations.

205
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:54,950
So that's just another thing that I noticed is that this is like they don't, they really don't like any different from dad.

206
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:58,760
Yeah. So like that idea too of like time since diagnosis.

207
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:02,840
So, like in our diabetes study, we had a criterion that was like,

208
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:12,409
you have to have it for at least six months just because in the immediate aftermath of diagnosis, the condition is much more fluctuating.

209
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:17,090
And so routines are not established. So you're kind of floundering a little bit more?

210
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:26,030
Absolutely. Yes. And I just want to mention one thing I noticed that was kind of missing was maybe children who physically cannot swallow pounds.

211
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:32,750
I know I worked in a clinic where like one of my patients couldn't chew also during my food therapy,

212
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:36,470
just because like tart in textures is really difficult for some.

213
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:43,430
So I think that's a consideration too, like how medication is given and the options available.

214
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:51,530
Yes, it's a great point. And channeling Emily like one moment, that is a lot of how they look.

215
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:59,660
Some pediatric psychologist can like spend a lot of time because the you know, you can't take a pill.

216
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:04,520
You grind it up. Do you try to liquefy?

217
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:11,960
What does it taste like? So many things are like, you know, like child safe or bubble packet.

218
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:18,589
And so if you're taking 20 pills and they're all in a packet like that, that's just a lot of time to just methodically open them.

219
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:23,780
A lot of fine motor skills. So, you know, a lot of the physicality piece is can be a big,

220
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:29,419
big challenge for kids or families younger also just how inaccessible this is to so many people.

221
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:32,180
Obviously with like health insurance, I won't have health insurance,

222
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:37,940
but just to pass the time to travel, having to go back every few weeks to the hospital,

223
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:39,379
if you don't live close by the hospital,

224
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:47,240
even if you live them and take time off work from classes and there's just so much so inaccessible to so many families.

225
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:50,900
So it's just like, how do they handle all this, you know? Yeah, yeah.

226
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:56,389
It's inaccessible to some of the families and the cognitive load of doing it

227
00:23:56,390 --> 00:24:04,310
all we'll see that illustrated more to but absolutely get your point that um,

228
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:10,639
I was thinking actually about behaviors in general like with the eating and exercise

229
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:16,129
recently and the family that you're talking about this about like non-negotiable things.

230
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:22,340
And I feel like this falls into that category of like taking medicine is like something that's non-negotiable versus like,

231
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:26,300
am I going to eat pizza today or am I going to go exercise today?

232
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:33,319
And so how that changes, like I hear it's almost like how do you yeah, yeah.

233
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,209
So we'll talk about adherence.

234
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:43,580
But I think that's very true and I think like there is like there is this gray zone, there are things like non-negotiable,

235
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:52,579
take your medication every 12 hours or like your organ will fail and you're in real trouble if that happens.

236
00:24:52,580 --> 00:25:02,059
And there's a whole sort of ethical set of considerations around that, too, because if people who are the recipient of an organ, for example,

237
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:10,730
of transplant, if they're not sort of treating, they're taking their medications, if they're not adherent, that can be sort of a red flag.

238
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:15,230
And then if their organ does fail, the question is like, what does that again, a new organ,

239
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:20,150
they treated the first one so poorly and it's a very intense kind of ethical dilemma.

240
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:28,399
Yeah. Um, another thing, all the kids that, you know, depend on mom or some other,

241
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:35,120
like external support and like that in itself is also kind of a privilege because if you have to,

242
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:40,250
you know, if your child's depending on you that like you can't be at work at the time, you gotta be home or like around them.

243
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:46,220
And I think just because literally all of them mentioned some sort of support, you know,

244
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:53,360
there's a lot of issues that can probably come out of that, you know, having to be around here.

245
00:25:54,430 --> 00:26:01,459
I go to a place. Absolutely well, and just even like I said, I was reading these interviews this weekend.

246
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:08,270
And one of the big themes around type one diabetes and management that sort of impact on parents was, you know,

247
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:18,350
do I have kind of a co parent who can help me, can be tag team and monitor the kids, you know, sleep at night for their kids on the monitor at night.

248
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:25,940
And if I don't, then I do not sleep. And then during the day, I'm you know, someone was saying, like, I have a team,

249
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:29,140
but it's like having a newborn because I'm up all the time and I don't have sleep.

250
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:32,770
I don't have that kind of capacity to then help with all of this.

251
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:39,920
So absolutely. There's a lot a lot of toll on parents and on kids.

252
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:49,040
So thinking a little bit more about just these ideas of nonadherence and what it means and what are we asking?

253
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:53,930
So this is this idea of adherence, definitional ideas of adherence.

254
00:26:53,930 --> 00:27:04,759
So one key thing here to think about is or to note is that adherence ideally is like an agreement between the patient and the providers.

255
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:08,569
And so the providers, you know, know the medical regimen.

256
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:13,310
And then it has to be able to be something that the patient can adhere to in their life.

257
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:20,090
And so this is sort of where that a little bit of gray area can kind of come in.

258
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:26,900
Like it would be optimal if you could do it this way, but your life is such that you can do it this much.

259
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:34,069
And so what's good enough adherence? So that comes up a lot in that sort of medication adherence literature and this is the other thing.

260
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:41,930
So if people again, if people are interested in this like research wise and again this cuts across so many different types of things to adhere to.

261
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:46,610
And I've looked a lot at adherence and fidelity and behavioral interventions.

262
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:50,389
And so that's something, you know, if people are doing behavioral interventions,

263
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:55,830
we also talk about adherence to the manual or fidelity of the delivery of the intervention.

264
00:27:55,850 --> 00:28:03,380
And no, you can't assess that with a bio assay. Mean you know, I really doubt we've ever actually tried that.

265
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:09,320
But certainly in the medication adherence you can world you can but imagine that's costly and

266
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:15,709
painful and all sorts of things have people work with MEMS caps in here in any research,

267
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:20,090
study or opportunity. Okay. So those are kind of cool.

268
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:23,930
I've done a lot of like cortisol collection, saliva, and that's time sensitive.

269
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:29,749
And so the idea of the memes CAP is that it's like a really expensive cap you put on a pill

270
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:35,270
bottle or some sort of container and it gives a timestamp every time the person opens it.

271
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:41,540
And so we've used those in our research projects and I would say, you know,

272
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:45,590
they have to give five cortisol samples, for example, like a research project,

273
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:52,100
and sometimes they'll open at five times and just, you know, to get the sample at the same time,

274
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:55,069
which is, you know, we can see that they're doing that with the men's cap.

275
00:28:55,070 --> 00:29:00,950
And otherwise we would have just gotten five cortisol samples with some random times assignment, you know, not ever known.

276
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:07,760
So that's what those are. Another sort of key source of assessing adherence is like pharmacy refill data.

277
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:13,160
And so that's one way people look at it because you can't always get an automatic refill,

278
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:20,930
although per serving one point like getting an automatic refill like lessens burden and the lessens barrier.

279
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:27,800
So not all medication is sort of eligible for that, but that's one way to sort of promote adherence.

280
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:32,090
People do bring in like a bag of pills at their business.

281
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:42,740
And so that's one like potential way of measuring adherence, certainly self-reports and the rate of appointment attendance,

282
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:47,060
which that gets more into like our behavioral space, right when you come in doing the intervention.

283
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:51,410
And of course some of these methods are like very specific to treatment.

284
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:59,750
And so what we think about is having multiple strategies of course, because measuring with multiple measures, if you can, is great.

285
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:07,310
So what what do you guys think about some of those measures or methods of assessing adherence?

286
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:12,150
Let's have a little bit about how you get around the cap. Um.

287
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:23,060
Think about kids, families being the provider who might have to monitor those parents pieces in the research study.

288
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:30,760
Other. And sometimes caps are really cool.

289
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:39,700
Like not only I think I have some like where you can keep track doesn't it also send a message to like there is various versions.

290
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:45,669
Yeah. Like high tech like especially like with conditions that aren't necessarily

291
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:51,040
presenting with a danger right now versus something that can accumulate over time,

292
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:56,170
like making sure that like people are at hearings, it can get like much worse at time.

293
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:59,650
It gets worse. Right. As much you can do without that.

294
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:04,880
And that's actually a really key point with kids, right?

295
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:09,319
So this developmental factor, like some of the kids are like, oh, I feel bad.

296
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:15,380
So I take my medication and other kids are like, I may never feel bad, but I just have to take this thing like, why am I taking this?

297
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:19,180
Right? It's the fatigue of doing that for forever.

298
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:28,650
It's very real. And unless there's sort of an immediate feedback, that can be something that just is hard to keep motivation going.

299
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:34,249
Right. Are there other things?

300
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:39,410
I mean, I think that, you know, up here, these are like fairly invasive and expensive.

301
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:48,950
But, you know, we can see different ways that these could be, you know, lead to not giving, you know, accurate information.

302
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:56,569
Okay. Let me just say a few. This episode sort of was saying before,

303
00:31:56,570 --> 00:32:02,120
but sort of that idea of compliance with regimen from like the providers perspective

304
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:05,750
is a little bit different from this idea of like agreed upon adherence.

305
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:13,040
And so that's an important thing to kind of just keep in mind and again, relevant to behavioral interventions too, because we can say like,

306
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:20,300
oh, we have this awesome behavioral intervention that's going to take all this effort for the family or for the kid or for the parents.

307
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:25,920
But then what are the parents and kids kind of going to be willing to adhere to and what will they do?

308
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:31,910
So I think that this concept is important both in the kind of medical adherence space as well as behavioral space,

309
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:41,660
and then there's this idea of non-adherence. And so, you know, this is one situation volitional non-adherence,

310
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:47,330
like the parent or the kid or the whoever the patient says, like that's that's too much.

311
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:54,110
I'm not doing it. And that's less common. But happens and this is much more common.

312
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:57,290
So this is sort of this gray zone of like inadvertent non-adherence.

313
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:01,730
So the parents the parents or patient says, like, yeah, this is great.

314
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:03,620
We're going to go home, we're going to do this. Right.

315
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:11,029
But they may not understand, they may not have caught the like you have to take it at a certain times or they mix up what medications?

316
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:16,160
Like all those medications, like those 20 bottles, very easy to make an error.

317
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:23,930
And so we have to sort of think about, again, both in behavioral, you know, interventions and other interventions, like what's good enough?

318
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:29,630
What are barriers and can we make the like? Can we clarify the treatment regimen better?

319
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:39,650
And can we think about, of course, family circumstances that can maybe drive this sort of volitional or non volitional or inadvertent non-adherence?

320
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:50,510
Okay. And why do we care? Well, Nonadherence is associated with lots of different poor outcomes for whatever condition you're talking about.

321
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:58,129
And this idea of like rejection of your organ, if you're not taking immunosuppressant medications and transplant is really significant and severe,

322
00:33:58,130 --> 00:34:03,710
and you may be at risk for not getting a new organ if you're kind of caught and fails because of non-adherence.

323
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:07,520
So that's like a very big issue. Okay.

324
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:13,159
The other thing, of course, is that this has been studied quite a lot.

325
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:18,530
And one one thing we you know, it's important to just kind of remember is that adherence.

326
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:20,720
It's very kind of basic,

327
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:29,540
but it actually accounts for a lot of reason for why medications or treatments aren't working is that people aren't doing them the right way.

328
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:37,069
Again, seems like a really basic point, but it's like that's why adherence is important.

329
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:41,240
And it's important to study well as a person and as important to help troubleshoot.

330
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:50,240
Because if people were able to adhere to whatever the regimen is, then our outcomes would be much better and the cost would be more.

331
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:58,190
So yeah, I had a thought about well, I don't know if it's like non-adherence, but it's a challenge that like gets into it.

332
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:04,669
But like when you're traveling and like transferring prescriptions and also like depending on the medication,

333
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:08,950
like if it's a controlled substance, you can't get it, get it in certain state.

334
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:17,600
And so but then it's an issue because then like if it's too soon for the insurance to cover it, then you can't get it fills up before you go.

335
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:26,120
And then I like also to if I can change doctors or at least things I personally experienced.

336
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:34,519
And so it's just like a pain. I feel like it would feel like there's just be like a easier way to be able to get,

337
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:38,630
like, your medication, especially if you're, like, traveling and moving around.

338
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:50,240
Yes. Yes, that's an excellent point. And that's, you know, a health care system factor is a health insurance factor.

339
00:35:50,240 --> 00:36:00,050
It's related to just lots of different like non universal health care system reasons.

340
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:03,390
That these things don't transfer translate easily.

341
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:10,350
And yeah, international travel even for like sort of run of the mill, like psychiatric medications.

342
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:17,220
That's the challenge. People go on sabbatical and take their medications and that's a long time to be away.

343
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:21,270
And not everything refills automatically or could be eligible for that.

344
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:22,830
So it's a really good point. Yeah.

345
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:28,860
So yeah, it's highlighted to in like housing insecure families who might be moving around a lot or not have done the housing.

346
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:39,299
Absolutely. So lots of again, there's lots of those major barriers that can lead to non-adherence,

347
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:44,640
but for very inadvertent ways but very predictable ways and very systemically problematic ways.

348
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:53,310
So yeah, definitely do a lot of that sort of like policy level to reduce those costs.

349
00:36:54,090 --> 00:37:02,010
Yeah. So like who's making the decision about which medication to take, especially if they're like after like this time based on access.

350
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:09,809
Like I like this one off and this one it's like it's been shared decision making between the healthcare provider and the patient,

351
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:14,219
like especially if they're a child who's making the parent, you know, who's making that decision.

352
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:20,390
So I think decision making really comes in, I guess, and like prioritizing, right?

353
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,630
Like all bad options, which is my least bad option here.

354
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:33,450
And like that time perspective point, like what's my least bad option right now versus like what's most important for my future financial functioning?

355
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:36,480
I know sometimes this might not be the same thing. Yeah.

356
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:44,150
Being health literate and then also being one of the causes we talk about numeracy.

357
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:51,860
You have medication that tracks location, but you don't know how to use it in a sense.

358
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:57,980
Like you don't know the difference between like taking your medication every 12 hours versus twice a day.

359
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:06,890
And like, seems like that could be a little more locations patients navigate intake.

360
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,290
Mm Absolutely.

361
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:18,860
I think one of the well, I don't know if that's right, but one of the really intense things I think too about type one diabetes and many,

362
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:22,970
many, many other things is that there is so much math involved.

363
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:33,140
We've talked before about math as not a strength of our, you know, nation and put it mildly.

364
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:43,639
And and that's really a big problem, right? Because like that example of 12 every 12 hours versus twice a day, like how do you compensate for that?

365
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:48,160
How do you you know, if you have taken half the amount of medication,

366
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:54,320
what do you do and how do you sort of adjust and understanding the math there is really important.

367
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,510
And with diabetes, we'll see.

368
00:38:55,800 --> 00:39:06,050
Whoops, talk about counting carbs and what foods have, how many carbs and how many doses of how much insulin to give when you're ingesting food.

369
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:13,250
So there's so much and it's so much for little kids. It's so much for families, families who are under slept to be managing.

370
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:15,020
So it's a really, really important point.

371
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:27,530
We do know that with kids that this sort of nonadherence rates are really high and we can think about, you know, that's also families.

372
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:35,320
We know that also rates are higher for chronic conditions. So like the kids on that video are probably like the highest performers, right?

373
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:39,620
Because they're like being in a video, the University of Michigan, to show how good they are about adherence.

374
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:44,630
But not everybody is, you know, doing it at that level or with that level of support.

375
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:51,860
And so we know that rates are higher for chronic conditions, kind of just that that idea of like, I'm sick of this, I don't wanna do this anymore.

376
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:55,190
Like, I'm done. I want to, you know, that is a big thing.

377
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:58,459
Of course, adherence tends to decline over time.

378
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:05,720
So like once your disease is under control or your condition, then, you know, I'm sure we've all had that experience of, you know,

379
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:11,120
you take the whole sequence of antibiotics because you should even if you're feeling better, you don't feel like taking them.

380
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:12,980
You don't see the reason to take them anymore.

381
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:21,080
And then what we know also is that adolescents like we'll talk about this sort of transition period of adolescents,

382
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:24,200
and adolescents are less adherent than younger kids.

383
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:29,120
But the other thing is that non-adherence like sort of if you establish that,

384
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:33,020
it's sort of more likely to persist if we don't have intervention for that.

385
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:41,720
And so the other thing to note is that here we talk about adherence has been really important and it is,

386
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:51,200
but it's also this is like another inherent kind of problem is that adherence doesn't always like align 100% with health status for functioning.

387
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:59,150
Even if you're highly adherent, you may not have great health status kind of because of this.

388
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:05,360
So if you have high adherence, you're more likely to have better health outcomes.

389
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:15,080
But you can also just be unlucky and have high adherence and still not great health outcomes.

390
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:19,390
Because of your body, because of genetics, because of your condition,

391
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:27,020
and because of life circumstances for lots of reasons, that adherence may not protect you fully.

392
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:34,489
And so then if you are in this box of unlucky, then you know, you can imagine again certainly with that adolescent saying like,

393
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:38,450
well, forget it, I was trying, I was trying to be really good and then I had bad outcomes.

394
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:42,500
Anyway, my blood sugar went out of control. Screw it. You know, I don't want to do this anymore.

395
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:49,670
There also is this condition, this situation where you're sort of got poor adherence.

396
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:55,700
We would expect that person to have poorer health status again, like over time, but not always.

397
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:59,540
And so again, if you imagine adolescent being like, I didn't do it the other day and I was fine.

398
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:04,699
So like, why would I do it again? Like, right, we've all done that in certain domains.

399
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:09,350
And so I think this is another kind of inherent challenge with adherence.

400
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:19,040
And again, thinking about kids who are in this chronic health, who have chronic health conditions, how long they have to keep them up.

401
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:31,249
Okay. And so thinking about like the self-management part, so like how much kids are doing on their own or, you know, for themselves.

402
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:37,790
And we think about self-management as a sort of like interaction of behaviors and the children and or family members.

403
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:44,219
Mom. Take on in order to care for the chronic condition and sometimes non-adherence can relate

404
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:50,580
to poor self-management and this will increase the risk of adverse health outcomes.

405
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:55,830
So this is a subject this is an area of a lot of research focused self-management.

406
00:42:56,700 --> 00:43:02,339
And as we like to think about all of our layers of contexts in which kids are embedded,

407
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:06,030
so that's one of those readings talks about this pediatric self-management model.

408
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:09,569
And I always like to point out, which I feel like comes up a bit in the article,

409
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:18,420
but everybody should this should sound super familiar to everybody so that like individual self-regulation emerges across development.

410
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:24,090
And this is a really specific domain in which self-regulation kind of plays out in an important set of ways.

411
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:29,480
Yeah. On self-management or, and or adherence to that.

412
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:36,870
Like look at if it differs for like medication adherence versus like diet and like other lifestyle changes.

413
00:43:36,930 --> 00:43:40,200
So I feel like that lifestyle would be like we heard. Yeah.

414
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:45,780
I mean it's a lot fuzzier of a target and it's a lot more gray area.

415
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:59,790
Right. And so I will say, like I said, I've contributed to some literature in this space in terms of self-regulation and health behaviors,

416
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:07,380
and I am highly skeptical of that. It's just because I feel like it is necessary.

417
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:16,290
It's important to have self-regulation and self-management. That's an important piece of making any medication adherence or lifestyle behavior change.

418
00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:23,130
But I think all of these contexts shape that.

419
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:30,780
It's like all of these contexts shape it until the moment of individual choice.

420
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,600
And so I think people get really excited about being here and talking about

421
00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:42,960
individual choice and sometimes don't take all these contexts into account.

422
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:50,220
And so when I say have contributed to this literature, like because this is a process that I study and know a lot about.

423
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:54,810
And in the School of Public Health, I kind of applied it to health behaviors.

424
00:44:55,620 --> 00:45:02,069
People have kind of gone you know, people have talked to me and wanted to say, like, well, this is the main thing, right?

425
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:10,350
This is what it is. And I always say like it's a part of it, but if it's just by itself and you're ignoring all of this,

426
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:13,260
especially if we're talking about diet or exercise or something,

427
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:23,160
that's unless like super critical to maintain laser focus on like transplant medication that's not going to carry the day.

428
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:31,110
So that makes sense. So I'm always a little bit like, like important good thing to know about,

429
00:45:31,110 --> 00:45:37,620
important to study like in little kids that self-regulation it maps on to so many different things.

430
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:43,290
But if this isn't working well and supporting the kid,

431
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:49,950
then it's going to undercut that impact of self-regulation or the potential for self-regulation to help.

432
00:45:54,300 --> 00:46:03,920
Yeah. So that's that's an I think it is an interesting question because we do talk about adherence in behavioral

433
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:15,940
interventions to like do lifestyle change for other reasons and it can be challenging to to maintain adherence.

434
00:46:15,950 --> 00:46:21,020
Right. The other thing, again, sort of on the flip side, like the transplant medications,

435
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:27,050
even transplant medications, which I would say like that's very high stakes for adherence.

436
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:31,880
There's still low adherence. And so.

437
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:40,569
You know, the target of adherence is really different for talking about diet and lifestyle compared to transplant medications.

438
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:46,309
But some of those motivational processes and motivational factors that we could sort of amp up or

439
00:46:46,310 --> 00:46:54,250
our family routine supports for both of those things could increase adherence towards our target,

440
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:57,870
whatever our target is. We target health behavior.

441
00:47:00,390 --> 00:47:05,700
So, yeah, so I wanted to talk a little bit more and show you guys some examples of just

442
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:12,299
sort of those developmental shifts across all development in the t1d space.

443
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:19,410
And so this is just sort of some, you know, promotional stuff around type one diabetes,

444
00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:32,340
but t1d looks like me was sort of has been campaign around just trying to bring awareness and education of what t1d sort of entails.

445
00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:34,739
And sleep is up there.

446
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:44,760
So many hours of sleep lost, fingerprints becoming less of an issue as people get better technology that helps us monitor blood glucose levels.

447
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:52,200
But this is just sort of a sample of the number of shots a kid would have to take across this many days.

448
00:47:52,590 --> 00:47:56,070
So that's a lot of shots, right? So there's a lot of mouth. There's more shots.

449
00:47:57,450 --> 00:48:01,200
And this is sort of an example of just a like a backup bag.

450
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:07,800
So they talked about, you know, having a backup travel in, planning to go on a vacation.

451
00:48:08,310 --> 00:48:13,140
Right. Takes on a whole different level of hassle planning.

452
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:18,810
Right. And stress, because you have to think about, do I have all the medications or have enough?

453
00:48:18,810 --> 00:48:19,770
What if something goes wrong?

454
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:27,960
I have all the emergency medications and that's just like an afterschool soccer kind of bag, not like traveling for go on a trip kind of bag.

455
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:34,579
And then this is just an example of like a little monitor that someone has on their arm.

456
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:36,540
And so these are in type one diabetes.

457
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:45,180
You can have those little monitor patches on your arm and that you have to just clean and replace every so often, frequently.

458
00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:50,110
But so you see, like, this is a little kid to just go about her day, but she just had a patch on her.

459
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:54,629
So like it's, you know, in her life. But it's a task.

460
00:48:54,630 --> 00:48:58,290
She, she knows she's like learning how to do it, right. She's probably like seven or eight.

461
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:08,160
Yeah. I do think that like if you're into the property and I was like medical staff and patient, like I can see on that last slide,

462
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:11,370
if they're not taking the rest of the things into consideration,

463
00:49:11,370 --> 00:49:17,430
the medical staff may not engage with the patient as fully or like provide them with alternative treatment.

464
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:24,000
Yeah. Like if it's perceived to be an individual problem of non-adherence or like coalition on appearance.

465
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:26,820
Oh, absolutely. Yeah. Yeah.

466
00:49:27,270 --> 00:49:37,590
And so I think this even down to like the measurement of adherence and how you choose to assess that is like a clinic provider, clinic based provider,

467
00:49:38,190 --> 00:49:48,330
if you're, you know, doing like a blood blood assay of like, oh, look, your, you know, medication is not in your system very simply.

468
00:49:49,710 --> 00:49:52,680
And that's the that's like where you stop for adherence.

469
00:49:53,430 --> 00:50:00,690
Then I think they could go down the road of, well, you're an individual, you're not taking medication like you have bad adherence.

470
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:07,979
If you do like an interview and you say like, you know, how many times did you manage to take your medication yesterday?

471
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:09,390
Oh, and what got in the way?

472
00:50:09,450 --> 00:50:16,140
That's a really different approach that could actually lead you to understand the way that adherence may or may not be happening.

473
00:50:16,830 --> 00:50:26,130
So yeah, I think that that whole bigger picture in terms of interventions to support adherence is critical.

474
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:33,320
Um. So, yeah. Um, let me.

475
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:36,829
Let's see what else can. Oh, so, uh. Okay.

476
00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:39,950
Well, so let's watch a little videos of this. This little guy, so.

477
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:49,340
Oh, yeah. Let's see. Maybe it'll come up just here, and I'm sure it'll be a loud ad, but just to provide a little bit of background.

478
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:58,100
So this is a family who is now they're like sponsored, you know, his medical devices and things.

479
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:01,970
But basically their son was diagnosed at age two.

480
00:51:02,570 --> 00:51:09,889
And the you'll see the mom is like making all these videos of sort of his progress over

481
00:51:09,890 --> 00:51:15,500
time and their sort of family life around managing type one type one diabetes over time.

482
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:22,069
So just to sort of watch a few of these a few minutes of his life across different times and see what you notice.

483
00:51:22,070 --> 00:51:34,940
And then thinking about that model of all four additional big, big quadrants, what kind of supports might be in place for this family?

484
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:39,550
Or if it's if it were another family, what, what supports might need to be in place.

485
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:44,180
So let me see if this will please. And I skipped the ad.

486
00:51:44,450 --> 00:51:47,490
I can. Okay.

487
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:53,240
Can you tell everybody what's new with you? You don't have a pump anymore.

488
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:58,130
Do you like that? Yeah. What do you do instead of worrying about anything?

489
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:03,200
Yeah. You take shots. What is something that you like better about taking shots?

490
00:52:03,770 --> 00:52:09,320
Like I don't want you to away and embarrassing and.

491
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:19,340
So that little patch on the back, if he doesn't have that on his arm,

492
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:24,890
that sort of thing can roll and bounce and jump and play and and take shots and stuff.

493
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:31,100
How can you show everybody how brave you are with your shots?

494
00:52:31,970 --> 00:52:34,880
Okay. All right. I'm going to show you how we do. Okay.

495
00:52:35,450 --> 00:52:40,849
So that diabetes, there's the eating part and then there's the management of what eating does to your blood sugar.

496
00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:46,310
And so the shots are do you manage what you eat? Does your blood sugar? And now she's going to go over there, the watch.

497
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:50,840
And so he's had diabetes for two years. He's four meals for Henry.

498
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:57,770
So like all the fruit and vegetables and stuff, I weigh it actually on a food scale.

499
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:03,890
And every food imaginable has a number. I memorize a ton of them, so I know just my heart.

500
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:10,560
And then I just press the curve button and then I subtract fiber and then I write it on or should I?

501
00:53:14,270 --> 00:53:20,509
And this is a Taylor Taylor brand, and we've had it since he was diagnosed for like a year and a half now.

502
00:53:20,510 --> 00:53:23,450
I mean, love it. So everything is on here.

503
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:31,730
Vegetables is for watermelon, eat pineapple for he gets a half a cup, milk in all of our cups, we mark a half a cup.

504
00:53:31,730 --> 00:53:39,760
So you don't actually have to measure every single time. Pretzels or 14 peanut butter, three, that's a tablespoon.

505
00:53:39,770 --> 00:53:45,740
So we measure that out and ham is nothing. So yeah, I don't know what that's 40 so here his meal.

506
00:53:47,930 --> 00:53:52,290
This is 40 calves, and you'd always test his blood sugar before.

507
00:53:52,670 --> 00:53:55,670
Okay, I'll just pause there. How do you guys notice? What's your take?

508
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:04,050
On that process. We are seeing a lot of rain like slicks.

509
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:13,190
It almost makes me think like. You can't you can't watch by anybody else but you because you're the only one that knows.

510
00:54:14,410 --> 00:54:18,220
What to do, how it should be done. You have to train someone to do that.

511
00:54:18,610 --> 00:54:23,769
And then, like health care workers and the like, they care. People aren't trained to do that properly.

512
00:54:23,770 --> 00:54:28,839
So if something does go wrong, it's one that becomes their fault.

513
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:32,720
But they often. I would. Yeah.

514
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:38,100
I love everything you just said because. Yeah, I wouldn't know how to do this.

515
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:48,360
And then there's this mom who's had to learn, and she doesn't get a break because she's the one who's managing all of these things.

516
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:57,450
And like you said, training other caregivers, care providers for the child to the level that you feel like you could, you know, and trust your child.

517
00:54:57,450 --> 00:55:03,719
To them, it's a lot. Um, I will say that this he's now, I think 14 years old.

518
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:07,230
So this ten year old technology. So now this would be probably by an app.

519
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:14,150
But did anything else strike people in this in her little discussion?

520
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:19,559
Yeah. Yeah. Well, how she had memorized all these numbers was impressive.

521
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:25,440
And I'm like, he's four. That's a tough age. And she had another kid who was like 51 or two.

522
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:32,820
Yeah. So it's just amazing that she has time to do all this for every single thing that he needs while also managing his ideas and her.

523
00:55:33,510 --> 00:55:38,459
Yes. Yes. Like think about the hours she's spent to memorize.

524
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:42,720
I mean, when she says, like I pretty much have, I'm like, oh, my gosh, that's a lot.

525
00:55:43,290 --> 00:55:48,180
Right. And yeah, with the other child. So like, what are they doing when she's in here doing this?

526
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:53,490
And it seemed like a pretty balanced meal still like again, for a toddler,

527
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:59,550
for for a preschooler, like there's veggie cart, you know, pretzel fruit milk.

528
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:03,540
I mean, it's very balanced. Anything else?

529
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,380
Like the cups, like there are be like major.

530
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:14,879
But they're you can tell they're like they measured in like on their eyelids and they're like that part of is like technology,

531
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:17,940
just like appliance wise, like as we got older.

532
00:56:18,390 --> 00:56:27,470
But and then like. Yeah.

533
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:30,350
But I mean, you can imagine, like, right. Because she was like, oh, here's the half.

534
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:36,499
Like she went and drew with a Sharpie on every child cup that they had, you know?

535
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:40,240
So like, again, if they're moving houses, if they're, you know, other things are going on,

536
00:56:40,250 --> 00:56:44,510
they don't have like those labeled cups that are marked off with a Sharpie.

537
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:51,770
Yeah, currently. I mean, I think in general, like it's really difficult for a child to live with like chronic illness.

538
00:56:51,770 --> 00:57:04,190
But just the difficulty of even like your setting being so like monitored and like the medical even imagine for

539
00:57:04,190 --> 00:57:14,780
a kid that's really hard to be counting carbs and later like into like adolescence and like teenage years,

540
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:20,150
like how that overlaps with like other stuff about food and counting calories.

541
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:25,580
Obviously, this is like, you know, part of their chronic illness management care.

542
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:29,989
But um, yeah, I'm just curious how that, how that would play out.

543
00:57:29,990 --> 00:57:35,110
Like as. A kid in their teen years. There's a lot of other social pressures stuff.

544
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:38,850
Yeah, absolutely. Other foods. Yeah.

545
00:57:39,010 --> 00:57:43,300
I think to make it there. The shot then after eat or like that.

546
00:57:43,730 --> 00:57:54,570
Yeah. It depends on how high your blood sugar is. So if it's high, then you give insulin before and then you eat because insulin lowers the.

547
00:57:56,900 --> 00:58:01,510
The Blood sugar rescue team had to recalculate based on previous.

548
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:05,540
Yeah. Yeah. So is that checking when he's checking out?

549
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:07,510
Like the shots and the checking? Well, we'll see.

550
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:13,399
We're checking, but, yeah, you want to know at all times where your blood sugar is, which now, again,

551
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:18,440
with technology now it's getting much better and much more common to have continuous

552
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:23,810
glucose monitors that show you a little readout of what your blood sugar is.

553
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:27,980
But even ten years ago, that was not nearly as common as it is now.

554
00:58:28,730 --> 00:58:37,730
Yes. Oh, my goodness. It's interesting to think about like what is I don't know how like what trial and error looked like for like.

555
00:58:37,730 --> 00:58:44,420
Oh, yeah, when you eat like when you eat too much, like what that would like and how do you like manage that versus like if you didn't eat enough.

556
00:58:45,270 --> 00:58:48,629
But he's still hungry because, like, he's often rowing. Right.

557
00:58:48,630 --> 00:58:51,930
And this is right. This is totally independent of hunger, really.

558
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:55,889
I mean, it's lunch time, but like, if he was hungry, if that wasn't enough for him,

559
00:58:55,890 --> 00:58:59,160
then you have to do even more calibration like, okay, you're so hungry.

560
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:02,970
We gave this amount. Where are you now? What else can we give you?

561
00:59:04,050 --> 00:59:09,320
Absolutely. And what type of food? Yeah. And I'm like, how much I need you doing like I'm.

562
00:59:09,330 --> 00:59:16,500
But how much self-regulation, like, is needed to actually for the child to do this because, like, it might be somewhat easy at home,

563
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:24,809
but like when they're out of the home at their friend's house, that class, you know, at a pizza party eating class, you know, they can't eat anything.

564
00:59:24,810 --> 00:59:31,020
You know, it's like or they would have to counted on just like how disconnected they feel and and then friends and stuff,

565
00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:38,489
eating all this food and then they can't even do anything where mom is bringing bring up food, the kids party,

566
00:59:38,490 --> 00:59:43,290
which certainly, certainly happens all the time for not even for diabetes, the allergies and everything.

567
00:59:44,610 --> 00:59:53,160
And I was I was also thinking like, as you were speaking, be like the self regulation, like you guys will see like as a pretty compliant kid.

568
00:59:54,390 --> 01:00:02,040
But like if he's more hungry or if he's not hungry and he doesn't want to eat for half an hour, like that can be a huge issue with blood sugar.

569
01:00:02,070 --> 01:00:07,229
And so you've kind of got a perfectly calibrated meal to where he is and then he doesn't

570
01:00:07,230 --> 01:00:11,190
want to eat like you want to button on the food and because like he has to eat.

571
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:15,990
So how do you manage that and like your average sort of preschooler movement behavior?

572
01:00:16,860 --> 01:00:21,540
So let's see what he's doing. His blood sugar is normal, so we don't need to correct him for a high.

573
01:00:22,420 --> 01:00:26,520
We did 40 and we divide it depending on the time.

574
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:40,590
It's between 1030 and three. So we divide it by 18. So I take 40 and I divide by like again, lots, which equals 2.2 sodium, two units of insulin.

575
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:49,800
And if he was high and needed a correction, if they his blood year was 250, I would add a half a unit to that.

576
01:00:50,370 --> 01:00:53,520
So you add those two together and then give him one syringe.

577
01:00:54,570 --> 01:01:00,750
So that is what we do. So here is insulin and here is the syringes that we use.

578
01:01:00,750 --> 01:01:07,409
I'm going to draw two units, so I don't know if you can see that, but that is two units right there.

579
01:01:07,410 --> 01:01:09,720
That's how tiny of amount he needs right now.

580
01:01:10,590 --> 01:01:14,850
So think, figure, like like what you're talking about, kind of like all the parents are learning how to do this.

581
01:01:15,150 --> 01:01:22,500
It's also like the fine motor skills needed to to draw up that teeny tiny amount of insulin and availability of insulin.

582
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:26,190
So that whole health care system factor is insulin availability.

583
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:30,870
So then I give him his shot before he eats and then he can eat.

584
01:01:30,870 --> 01:01:32,309
And then if he doesn't eat something,

585
01:01:32,310 --> 01:01:39,990
I have to figure out either way that to the scale to see how many carbs he did not eat or guess how many carbs he did indeed.

586
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:45,390
And I have to substitute that with either juice or some other smaller other type of food.

587
01:01:45,630 --> 01:01:50,280
So kicking it can be tricky. But he is a very good eater and I'm very, very lucky.

588
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:54,179
So and that is what we do for meals and snacks and everything around here.

589
01:01:54,180 --> 01:01:58,469
So just the nature. So that's his individual factor.

590
01:01:58,470 --> 01:02:01,920
He's pretty good eater. This is all kind of new to me again, isn't it?

591
01:02:02,010 --> 01:02:05,520
It's been so long. Oh, yeah.

592
01:02:05,550 --> 01:02:13,950
Oh, you're brave, honey. So even like, I've got a routine, he was like, Oh, I'm sorry.

593
01:02:14,250 --> 01:02:24,540
I had his lunches. I sure. No, I am sorry, but it's like, [INAUDIBLE] get used to it when we get better.

594
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:27,750
I bet it will be better if I use a silly drink.

595
01:02:28,830 --> 01:02:32,610
You know me. Give me my review when you want to make the video.

596
01:02:33,810 --> 01:02:36,860
How about this?

597
01:02:38,590 --> 01:02:43,920
Okay. So, like, there are some coping, right? Like you would like that hurt as much as the sharp metal.

598
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:50,530
Like you was, like, expressing hands, like, upset with it. Rubbed his arm, got distracted.

599
01:02:51,190 --> 01:02:57,280
Like, so we saw a lot of emotion, regulation, coping strategies there. But, you know, so not fun.

600
01:02:58,300 --> 01:03:07,120
Not fun to get shot and or watch it. We'll watch a few more of him because he says, like, can we make another video?

601
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:12,329
Just like, yeah. And that he's four and he's 14. She's making still tons of videos.

602
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:16,000
So it's kind of interesting. Let me do another one.

603
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:20,300
Same kid. Oh, no, no.

604
01:03:20,990 --> 01:03:27,500
Okay. Recently, I think the victim's friends have been okay to type one since then.

605
01:03:28,010 --> 01:03:31,160
And that's the whole thing for practice.

606
01:03:32,270 --> 01:03:39,710
And the whole thing is that giving it insulin so that you can eat my breakfast is £42.

607
01:03:46,140 --> 01:03:52,860
So right away we can notice, like he's taking over some of the responsibilities of the carbs and he's like

608
01:03:52,860 --> 01:03:58,769
internalize and probably memorize every single carb content of his food items.

609
01:03:58,770 --> 01:04:13,280
Right. And he's 11. I'm going to swing by number 75, then go down 31 finger hands.

610
01:04:14,130 --> 01:04:18,240
So that's like his blood sugar reading and where it's headed.

611
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:25,830
So that's from his like a CGM pump. So it's giving him a little continuous readout of where he's doing, but he's still swimming in the backseat.

612
01:04:25,830 --> 01:04:31,540
So going about their daily tasks, you know, because, you know, he's operating.

613
01:04:32,740 --> 01:04:45,730
And I'm going to turn his life around. And so now he's at practice, he's having husbands and I'm going and I'm 73.

614
01:04:45,970 --> 01:04:55,540
And what I'm going to correct in three more, I'm going to hear this entire year that I'm going to get better.

615
01:04:58,430 --> 01:05:13,730
So I have my food and each piece of pizza, it's 13 cards, so that's 29 plus 16 for the applesauce and that's 55 in total and the number is 147.

616
01:05:14,380 --> 01:05:17,860
The 3850 only has to be a five. All right.

617
01:05:19,250 --> 01:05:25,250
Okay. So you think it's because he is doing a lot of math and he's like adjusting it?

618
01:05:25,250 --> 01:05:30,860
And I know I'm always like that, but like, that's a lot of like on the go.

619
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:37,220
It's applied math because it actually really relates to how he's going to feel if he doesn't do it right.

620
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:45,020
But we also like later find out about this guy, like he doesn't feel when his blood sugar is very high or when it's very low.

621
01:05:45,020 --> 01:05:51,839
And that's a big issue also in diabetes, because then you just don't have that internal sense of like when you need to do something.

622
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:56,570
And I'm very reliant on either your checking or your devices.

623
01:05:57,650 --> 01:06:05,090
And so let's see. I think I can I can I can do one more a little one of him because I think this illustrates.

624
01:06:05,090 --> 01:06:08,550
So Mom gets on and talks at the end of that video, too.

625
01:06:08,570 --> 01:06:13,399
Like Mom remains highly involved, as you guys can probably anticipate.

626
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:20,810
But I just want to share this one because the morning who just woke up going to school, it's first day of sixth grade,

627
01:06:21,290 --> 01:06:29,119
right pretty today in the life with type one diabetes first day of sixth grade always during the morning next in

628
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:37,370
life because why that's not he's not working yet that sounds not working how I'm going is out of nursing school.

629
01:06:38,090 --> 01:06:42,770
Okay so that's like his device that he's reliant on for budget monitoring.

630
01:06:42,770 --> 01:06:48,349
The technology fails. And so you then still have to go back to know how the prior technology was working.

631
01:06:48,350 --> 01:06:50,870
So he's now testing to figure out where his blood sugar is.

632
01:06:51,290 --> 01:06:59,540
And I don't know, what do you guys think about his, like, expression, you know, his his sixth grade missy, his emerging adolescent?

633
01:06:59,540 --> 01:07:02,510
There's just, like, so much else you're nervous about sixth grade.

634
01:07:02,570 --> 01:07:08,750
Like that's a big deal and like that to have to deal with this morning if your supplies isn't working correctly.

635
01:07:08,750 --> 01:07:13,070
That probably heightened some anxiety about the first day of school.

636
01:07:13,460 --> 01:07:14,810
Yeah, yeah, totally.

637
01:07:14,810 --> 01:07:25,490
And he and I would say like so well in future videos of him basically like, you know, and this is true for a lot of people like when he's excited his,

638
01:07:25,490 --> 01:07:28,520
you know, blood sugar will just react to that because it's you know,

639
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:32,149
we're a complex system in our moods and our blood sugar and everything are all connected.

640
01:07:32,150 --> 01:07:36,320
And so for him, first day of school, really exciting new classes and routines.

641
01:07:37,670 --> 01:07:43,129
Where does he go to check in about his, you know, snack and about his meds and about his emergency meds at school?

642
01:07:43,130 --> 01:07:46,940
And so it all sort of changes in sixth grade compared to elementary school.

643
01:07:46,940 --> 01:07:53,150
So that's like that school social context kind of coming in and reshaping some some behaviors.

644
01:07:54,440 --> 01:08:00,080
And I will say that this kid, again, he's very like his temperament.

645
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:08,450
I've watched it. I've watched a bunch of these videos, obviously, but like it's remarkably consistent, at least what is shown on his YouTube videos.

646
01:08:09,290 --> 01:08:13,849
And it's very like low key, compliant, responsible, self-regulated.

647
01:08:13,850 --> 01:08:18,650
And I am fascinated by thinking like, was he always that way?

648
01:08:18,890 --> 01:08:22,550
Was this like intensive monitoring of his life at all times?

649
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:26,870
Did that, you know, how did that sort of shape him and continue him to be that way?

650
01:08:27,620 --> 01:08:34,819
But so I would say he's very tolerant of like his mom's constant present in his life and his presence on YouTube with them.

651
01:08:34,820 --> 01:08:40,670
Also later they like respond to like call and, you know, reader questions and that kind of thing.

652
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:47,300
So he seems, you know, willing to to keep doing these videos, which I find very interesting.

653
01:08:48,980 --> 01:08:53,480
He also tracks almost exactly with my kids age son like would be okay with that.

654
01:08:53,480 --> 01:09:00,500
Yeah, that's sort of funny. So I'll just I'll say just a few more things on the last few minutes.

655
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:06,440
But again, it's really, really this family context is so important, right?

656
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:13,760
And in this family, it's like a mom and him right now are right here.

657
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:19,370
And this is this individual him factors both like facing that health insurance.

658
01:09:19,370 --> 01:09:23,779
They certainly, you know, live in a house where they have all these gaps and underlining and everything in a scale.

659
01:09:23,780 --> 01:09:29,090
So, you know, they have a lot of privilege and advantages here.

660
01:09:30,530 --> 01:09:33,380
The thing to know, of course, that people can, you know,

661
01:09:33,950 --> 01:09:40,939
I'm sure think about is how does this sort of timing of adolescence and like our regular developmental tasks of adolescence,

662
01:09:40,940 --> 01:09:46,429
how do those like crash together with kids medication adherence management at a

663
01:09:46,430 --> 01:09:50,690
time when they should be kind of taking over increasing responsibility for that?

664
01:09:50,690 --> 01:09:57,110
So he's starting to do that. But sort of how do these totally normative developmental factors that.

665
01:09:57,370 --> 01:10:01,570
Come up in adolescence interface with that. Emily, did you have come?

666
01:10:02,030 --> 01:10:09,550
Um, yeah. I'm just wondering. I don't have much exposure to diabetes at all, but do most young kids have to do that?

667
01:10:11,180 --> 01:10:14,889
Like the carbs? Yeah, that's a that's an inherent part of it.

668
01:10:14,890 --> 01:10:18,459
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So everybody needs to do that.

669
01:10:18,460 --> 01:10:21,760
And then sort of like, who does it is is the question. Yeah.

670
01:10:21,820 --> 01:10:27,040
So I think he's had also a lot of modeling like back to thinking about like modeling and social learning theory.

671
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:31,090
Like his mom is verbally modeling all those carbs all the time.

672
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:34,990
And so that he's he's that's another process by which he's learning that, I'm sure.

673
01:10:37,570 --> 01:10:44,680
Okay. And so these are just some sort of key parts that kind of come up, especially for adolescents in traffic illness.

674
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:49,090
Interfere potentially with medication and self management.

675
01:10:49,570 --> 01:10:54,310
Um, you know, self-esteem being different having a pump not everybody pump.

676
01:10:55,690 --> 01:11:06,700
Body image, lack of independence, right. So like his mom has been on him like the the first guy Tucker so not to think he's overbearing but you know,

677
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:12,850
um, sort of lack of independence and also this idea of like less social, more time with family,

678
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:19,420
maybe any time with your friends is sort of structured by all these sort of needs and family involvement, potential education, interruptions,

679
01:11:19,420 --> 01:11:22,660
especially if someone's getting like treatment for cancer, for example,

680
01:11:23,290 --> 01:11:28,480
large chunk of inner education interruption, perhaps, and that future could be uncertain.

681
01:11:30,670 --> 01:11:39,549
Yeah, and I think the key thing here is that sometimes, again, with adolescents, you know, we have rebellious adolescents, right?

682
01:11:39,550 --> 01:11:42,430
Like that's just a part of that developmental phase sometimes.

683
01:11:42,430 --> 01:11:52,180
And so when again, this is like a gray area for parents, the amount like when is it okay to have your adolescent assert independence?

684
01:11:52,180 --> 01:11:58,719
Like how far can they go in terms of medication management without being placing themselves in medical jeopardy?

685
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:01,210
So that's a really important piece, I think, for parents.

686
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:12,190
And that college transition is a really big deal because as we were seeing with Tucker, like routines change, context changes.

687
01:12:12,190 --> 01:12:15,940
You're in a dorm room. What do you do with all that medication management and you're homeless.

688
01:12:16,690 --> 01:12:26,139
Um, and so I think, uh, we've talked through some of these barriers, aversive medication skills,

689
01:12:26,140 --> 01:12:33,049
deficits that, things like that Sara brought up, like can you swallow voluntary resistance?

690
01:12:33,050 --> 01:12:37,480
So like, you know, adolescent, I don't want to do it.

691
01:12:38,170 --> 01:12:45,729
Family circumstances, barriers. And so again, we can imagine medication adherence becoming a big issue in the family.

692
01:12:45,730 --> 01:12:51,610
If he weren't so compliant, if it were a constant battle that was like set up the parent child dynamic very differently in the family dynamics.

693
01:12:52,140 --> 01:12:57,760
Um, and so just kind of ending on like this recommendations idea.

694
01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:07,660
So with assessment of medication adherence and managing so like does the person that you're working with as a family clearly understand the regimen,

695
01:13:07,670 --> 01:13:16,329
everything that it entails? How can we, you know, kind of think about ways to assess adherence, talk to multiple informants,

696
01:13:16,330 --> 01:13:21,040
involved, the kid, get the kid's voice in there, and instead of only the parents.

697
01:13:21,430 --> 01:13:25,839
And then this idea I can remember somebody brought up, maybe I can't remember who said this,

698
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:35,440
but that idea of like if you get divergent reports of adherence, like figuring out like, why are these reports divergent?

699
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:38,469
You say you're taking your medication all the time, but like it's not in your bloodstream.

700
01:13:38,470 --> 01:13:41,620
So what does that mean? And how can we help you problem solve? So that's important.

701
01:13:42,940 --> 01:13:48,880
And then this idea of what kinds of interventions we could think about to support adherence and therefore better outcomes,

702
01:13:49,030 --> 01:13:52,030
hopefully educational type one.

703
01:13:52,030 --> 01:14:00,429
So practicing skills, practicing pill swallowing, practicing memorizing, practicing counting calves outside of a clinic visit behavioral.

704
01:14:00,430 --> 01:14:09,309
So motivational interviewing, goal setting. Again, some of these are very familiar should be very familiar for behavioral interventions to and

705
01:14:09,310 --> 01:14:15,030
interventions that are multi-component and often again same with behavioral interventions.

706
01:14:15,050 --> 01:14:21,280
Tech can be used to support adherence and change in mortality and that kind of thing of delivery.

707
01:14:23,470 --> 01:14:26,230
And I think, oh, and how it changes across development of course.

708
01:14:27,370 --> 01:14:36,820
So I'm just going to leave Emilie's info up there in case people are interested in this or pediatrics like hospital settings, etc.

709
01:14:37,750 --> 01:14:41,190
Reach out to Emily and that's all I got.

710
01:14:41,380 --> 01:14:44,950
Got a few minutes to chat or do paper questions for an hour or so.

711
01:14:44,950 --> 01:14:51,640
Thanks, guys. Oh, and fill out your evaluations.

712
01:15:00,210 --> 01:15:04,200
I have a confession to make. So I'm doing it. Yes.

713
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:08,760
And I really want to take an intervention in a school like in a school.

714
01:15:08,820 --> 01:15:13,290
So to do that, which is like a bit more. Oh, yeah.

715
01:15:13,650 --> 01:15:18,209
Is that okay if I talk about my private life in my critique or like anybody suggestions

716
01:15:18,210 --> 01:15:22,320
like how they could do more of the sort of meetings that I've just been following?

717
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:26,370
Yes. I don't really get pretty much thinking through that.

718
01:15:27,780 --> 01:15:34,630
But, yes, I think that's I don't know, catchment area.

719
01:15:36,210 --> 01:15:39,900
It's maybe a missed opportunity. It's not something anything. Yeah.

720
01:15:40,540 --> 01:15:50,490
Okay. Because I was looking at my project, which is also but again, it was still a bit more like obesity prevention.

721
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:54,270
And so I just wanted to make sure that that was okay. And that's like the direction I take.

722
01:15:54,420 --> 01:16:06,570
Yeah. All right. Thank. Imagine that somewhere I had to go and learn my heart.

723
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:11,069
Yes, it's happened most again. So I was going to bring it in next week.

724
01:16:11,070 --> 01:16:23,590
But let me have some something reminder. Times is a full time, but it is basically going to be acting like a right hand person, a woman.

725
01:16:23,590 --> 01:16:28,800
One of the attrition who does media and she's got it.

726
01:16:29,100 --> 01:16:36,690
I'm thrilled that she's starting to look at it as a very good medium.

727
01:16:36,990 --> 01:16:39,990
I think so, yeah.

728
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:46,250
I definitely look forward it to you when I get the posting and then she's probably not graduating.

729
01:16:46,260 --> 01:16:52,820
I know I'm on the hunt for a part time work right now and I could remember that was like a whole lot of time.

730
01:16:53,140 --> 01:16:56,490
Yeah, I thought, Yeah, it's great, it's great.

731
01:16:56,610 --> 01:17:03,000
It's going to be really great. Yeah. Or like it needs to be that person.

732
01:17:03,750 --> 01:17:10,440
But I know she is going to be a hard time, but I also know that a lot of the people that they may not be graduating right now.

733
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:14,830
So. You know.

734
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:25,800
Do you have office hours on a Thursday? 80 when I got like this coming Thursday that week.

735
01:17:26,270 --> 01:17:29,690
Yeah, well, I have. Well, I have a meeting right at one.

736
01:17:29,690 --> 01:17:33,100
Oh, if you like to.

737
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:41,240
Yeah. Yeah. To too. Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

738
01:17:41,390 --> 01:17:47,150
If that happens to work, tomorrow might actually work better than you do now.

739
01:17:47,180 --> 01:17:53,170
No, no, I'm just. I may have to essentially, I'm here between, I think, 11 and two.

740
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:57,710
Oh, okay. Yeah, I can do one. Yeah. I mean, I'm sorry.

741
01:17:57,710 --> 01:18:04,460
I heard or. Well, I could do noon. I guess I can do your I hope this town hoping that you want to say new.

742
01:18:04,940 --> 01:18:08,390
Yeah, that's right. Well, just. Okay, let's say like 12, 15.

743
01:18:08,810 --> 01:18:12,890
Teaching till noon. Got it. Yeah.

744
01:18:13,130 --> 01:18:16,130
Do you want to come try it?

745
01:18:16,160 --> 01:18:19,820
Yeah. So if you're here. Yeah.

746
01:18:24,310 --> 01:18:27,410
I'm sorry to want to go to my office.

747
01:18:27,740 --> 01:18:30,800
Yeah, that works there. Okay. Yeah.

748
01:18:31,010 --> 01:18:37,160
Essentially, yes. I mean, I worked on the paper. I'm actually. Marty moved on to thinking about jobs.

749
01:18:37,340 --> 01:18:43,219
Yeah. And I'm still because I'm, like, kind of exploring, like, my interest area is I'm,

750
01:18:43,220 --> 01:18:47,630
like, struggling to even understand, like, what jobs you even search for in that area.

751
01:18:47,990 --> 01:18:53,250
So I just kind of want to have this, like, a conversation. Yeah. Tell you about some of my ideas.

752
01:18:53,270 --> 01:18:57,380
Yeah. And see where. Where I should potentially look.

753
01:18:57,930 --> 01:19:03,860
Mm hmm. Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah. Okay. If you find anything, you know, good looking.

754
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:09,019
Yeah. Read between the lines of things. Yeah. Yeah. So, like, figure out there's two directions.

755
01:19:09,020 --> 01:19:12,139
I'm either going, but I'll explain it. Office hours.

756
01:19:12,140 --> 01:19:17,480
But, um. Yeah. Yeah. One option I'm more familiar with the other one.

757
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:24,380
Families and kids less familiar with. So I figured you would know more often.

758
01:19:24,530 --> 01:19:28,390
That sounds great. All right. I'll see you tomorrow. That sounds good. Thanks.

759
01:19:29,250 --> 01:19:32,600
Uh, my first question.

760
01:19:32,630 --> 01:19:36,680
Yeah. I'm focusing on, like, childhood poverty and, like, that early childhood space.

761
01:19:37,100 --> 01:19:39,200
So I was looking at, like, since we talked about, like,

762
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:44,879
Headstart being a really great space and wanting to focus or like Headstart maybe to run for an intervention.

763
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:52,040
Because I was thinking also like looking more specifically, I like school based things or is Headstart when maybe you brought up an area?

764
01:19:53,060 --> 01:19:57,290
That's a good question. I mean, Headstart, it's broad, but.
