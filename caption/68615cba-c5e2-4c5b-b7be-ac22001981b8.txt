00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello, students. My name is Emily Wood and I am one of the co instructors for public health.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Two Hundred Health and Society Introduction to Public Health.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,224
Welcome to our course.

4
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:20,224
In this video, I'll introduce our teaching team.

5
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:29,224
Talk about the learning goals for the course and describe how you'll be learning this semester, including which learning platforms we'll use.

6
00:00:29,224 --> 00:00:34,224
I will also describe how you will be assessed course, grading procedures,

7
00:00:34,224 --> 00:00:42,224
some tools and tactics for you to be successful, and also some thoughts on academic integrity and student well-being.

8
00:00:42,224 --> 00:00:48,224
Two foundational components of the semester.

9
00:00:48,224 --> 00:00:58,224
Public health is an interdisciplinary fields in the field so broad it is best taught by including an array of perspectives.

10
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:03,224
In this spirit, there are two co instructors that lead this course.

11
00:01:03,224 --> 00:01:06,224
My colleague, Dr. Al Franzblau,

12
00:01:06,224 --> 00:01:14,224
a medical doctor and faculty member in the Department of Environmental Health Sciences and at the School of Public Health.

13
00:01:14,224 --> 00:01:24,224
Dr. Franzblau has worked in preventive and occupational medicine and has worked at the School of Public Health for more than 30 years.

14
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:30,224
Again, my name is Dr. Emily, you it and I'm a faculty member in the Department of Health,

15
00:01:30,224 --> 00:01:35,224
Behavior and Health Education at the School of Public Health.

16
00:01:35,224 --> 00:01:48,224
We look forward to introducing ourselves to you in greater detail when we meet the Zoome for our first class forum on September 1st.

17
00:01:48,224 --> 00:01:55,224
Adding to the array of perspectives teaching this course are our team of graduate student instructors,

18
00:01:55,224 --> 00:02:03,224
our GSI eyes represent four of the six departments that comprise the School of Public Health.

19
00:02:03,224 --> 00:02:13,224
Our G.S. eyes are all doctoral students and bring with them years of classroom and professional experience with various public health studies.

20
00:02:13,224 --> 00:02:27,224
Please take a moment to identify your section number and the GSI, who will be leading your discussion section this semester.

21
00:02:27,224 --> 00:02:32,224
Our team works closely together on all aspects of the course.

22
00:02:32,224 --> 00:02:42,224
We meet weekly to talk about the course, the students and how emerging issues intersect with what you're learning in the course.

23
00:02:42,224 --> 00:02:47,224
All instructors hold weekly office hours this semester.

24
00:02:47,224 --> 00:02:50,224
All office hours will be held virtually.

25
00:02:50,224 --> 00:03:01,224
Please visit our course canvass site to see when teaching team members are holding office hours and learn how you can meet with them.

26
00:03:01,224 --> 00:03:02,224
Not listed on this slide,

27
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:13,224
but important to note is that many of the online lessons and forums you'll experience this semester are offered by expert guest lecturers.

28
00:03:13,224 --> 00:03:21,224
We are so fortunate to have many extraordinary scientists and thought leaders here in our University of Michigan community,

29
00:03:21,224 --> 00:03:26,224
and they have graciously offered their expertize to this course.

30
00:03:26,224 --> 00:03:37,224
You'll have the opportunity to interact with several of these individuals in real time during our synchronous forum sessions throughout the semester.

31
00:03:37,224 --> 00:03:47,224
I'll say more about both our guest lecturers and our forum sections in a few minutes.

32
00:03:47,224 --> 00:03:51,224
So what will you be learning this semester in public health? Two hundred.

33
00:03:51,224 --> 00:03:57,224
Let me begin by emphasizing that Public Health 200 is an introductory course.

34
00:03:57,224 --> 00:04:02,224
A good starting point or baseline for learning about the field of public health.

35
00:04:02,224 --> 00:04:10,224
We will cover a lot of different topics throughout the semester. But to do so, we cannot go into much depth on any one topic.

36
00:04:10,224 --> 00:04:15,224
This may be a frustrating for some of you who want to learn more about a specific concept

37
00:04:15,224 --> 00:04:22,224
or health challenge or feel as though we don't pay enough attention to other health issues.

38
00:04:22,224 --> 00:04:26,224
We hope this is the first public health class you take,

39
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:32,224
not the only public health class you take while you're a student at the University of Michigan.

40
00:04:32,224 --> 00:04:42,224
The School of Public Health offers many elective public health courses that are open to all students, regardless of your school or major.

41
00:04:42,224 --> 00:04:48,224
We hope that taking Public Health 200 will spark your interest in learning more about public health and

42
00:04:48,224 --> 00:04:58,224
that you will take more classes that focus on specific topics that are of greatest interest to you.

43
00:04:58,224 --> 00:05:07,224
So here's what you'll learn this semester, by the end of this semester, you will be able to explain what public health is,

44
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:13,224
what distinguishes it, or makes it different from other health science disciplines like medicine or nursing.

45
00:05:13,224 --> 00:05:20,224
And also what unique contributions public health makes to population health.

46
00:05:20,224 --> 00:05:22,224
Second, by the end of the semester,

47
00:05:22,224 --> 00:05:33,224
students will understand our nation's major public health challenges and the underlying factors that determine or cause those health problems.

48
00:05:33,224 --> 00:05:42,224
This will include looking at biological, environmental and social factors that contribute to disease.

49
00:05:42,224 --> 00:05:52,224
Finally, by the end of the semester, we hope that you will gain both understanding and empathy for the pervasive and standing

50
00:05:52,224 --> 00:05:59,224
inequities in health outcomes and experiences that many of our nation's citizens experience.

51
00:05:59,224 --> 00:06:08,224
These inequities are well-documented but are not well understood by the general public through data,

52
00:06:08,224 --> 00:06:14,224
personal narratives, and perhaps by examining your own experiences.

53
00:06:14,224 --> 00:06:21,224
Our goal is for you to better understand why some people are less able to maintain their health and to

54
00:06:21,224 --> 00:06:33,224
gain empathy for the challenges facing so many of us in our attempts to maintain or improve our health.

55
00:06:33,224 --> 00:06:41,224
So those are some pretty big goals. Let me give you a few more specifics on what we'll cover during this semester.

56
00:06:41,224 --> 00:06:45,224
We'll start the course by giving you some background on the field of public health.

57
00:06:45,224 --> 00:06:52,224
The history of the field, an overview of the current state of our nation's health and some terms and

58
00:06:52,224 --> 00:06:58,224
definitions that have specific meanings and uses in the field of public health.

59
00:06:58,224 --> 00:07:05,224
Next, you'll learn about the core sciences of public health epidemiology and biostatistics.

60
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:15,224
We'll then explore some of the biological or biomedical factors that influence health, examining two broad disease categories.

61
00:07:15,224 --> 00:07:19,224
Infectious diseases and chronic diseases.

62
00:07:19,224 --> 00:07:28,224
Next, we will look at social and behavioral factors that influence health, followed by a focused on some specific populations.

63
00:07:28,224 --> 00:07:37,224
Toward the end of the course, you will learn about the U.S. health care system and the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.

64
00:07:37,224 --> 00:07:44,224
To wrap up this semester, we will look at how our physical environment influences health and is illness.

65
00:07:44,224 --> 00:07:54,224
And look ahead to the future of public health. It's going to be a busy but dynamic semester.

66
00:07:54,224 --> 00:08:02,224
As you likely know, all elements of teaching and learning this semester will be conducted remotely as I record this.

67
00:08:02,224 --> 00:08:12,224
Our nation is in the midst of multiple crippling public health crises, and the Koven 19 pandemic prevents our course from meeting safely.

68
00:08:12,224 --> 00:08:21,224
Like many of you, Dr. Franzblau and I are disappointed not to be able to teach and learn together in person.

69
00:08:21,224 --> 00:08:27,224
But in our distance we are upholding one of public health's values that individual

70
00:08:27,224 --> 00:08:34,224
sacrifices are often required to promote and protect the public's health.

71
00:08:34,224 --> 00:08:37,224
In staying at home to learn remotely,

72
00:08:37,224 --> 00:08:45,224
we are practicing what we preach and we are grateful for the sacrifices each of you are making to keep all of us healthy.

73
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:51,224
Our collective efforts can help shorten the length and lessen the impact of the pandemic.

74
00:08:51,224 --> 00:09:03,224
And we can get back to living and learning normally faster. So each week, we will offer a number of online lessons which include prerecorded lectures,

75
00:09:03,224 --> 00:09:13,224
some assigned readings from your text book or other sources, and debrief knowledge checks to make sure you are grasping key course concepts.

76
00:09:13,224 --> 00:09:18,224
These online lessons are posted in campus most weeks during this semester.

77
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:24,224
You will also virtually attend discussion section discussion sections,

78
00:09:24,224 --> 00:09:31,224
offer a chance to engage with your peers and go into greater depth on course concepts.

79
00:09:31,224 --> 00:09:37,224
There are unique readings or other materials you'll need to prepare for discussion section.

80
00:09:37,224 --> 00:09:41,224
Regular participation in discussion section is one of the best ways to connect

81
00:09:41,224 --> 00:09:47,224
with the material and to learn from the perspectives of your fellow classmates.

82
00:09:47,224 --> 00:09:58,224
Lastly, throughout the semester, you'll have the opportunity to interact with others in the course, as well as guest instructors via our forums.

83
00:09:58,224 --> 00:10:06,224
Forums will take place Veha Zoome during what would be our typical class meeting time either Tuesday or Thursday,

84
00:10:06,224 --> 00:10:11,224
starting at two thirty p.m. Eastern Standard Time.

85
00:10:11,224 --> 00:10:19,224
Some forums will help on class assessments, including a writing session and two exam reviews,

86
00:10:19,224 --> 00:10:33,224
while others will be conversations driven by student questions with experts on topics like Cauvin 19 smoking policies and the Affordable Care Act.

87
00:10:33,224 --> 00:10:39,224
This slide show, you see how our canvass site is organized on the top left.

88
00:10:39,224 --> 00:10:46,224
You'll see our course home page. If you scroll down, you'll see a link for each unit of the course.

89
00:10:46,224 --> 00:10:53,224
The image on the bottom right hand side of your screen shows you an example of how one unit is organized,

90
00:10:53,224 --> 00:11:03,224
including links to the prerecorded lecture and assigned readings for the online lesson.

91
00:11:03,224 --> 00:11:14,224
Within our course canvas site, you will also navigate to your GSI page to access content for discussion sections, your GSI maintains this page.

92
00:11:14,224 --> 00:11:25,224
And during discussion section, we'll describe for you how to access this page.

93
00:11:25,224 --> 00:11:33,224
Well, many course materials, including lectures, assigned articles, videos and podcasts, are on the campus site.

94
00:11:33,224 --> 00:11:40,224
You will need to purchase our course. Textbook Introduction to Public Health by Mary Jane Schneider.

95
00:11:40,224 --> 00:11:45,224
In all aspects of the course, we will use the sixth edition of the textbook.

96
00:11:45,224 --> 00:11:54,224
If you choose to buy an earlier version, please be aware that some of the facts and figures may be out of date.

97
00:11:54,224 --> 00:11:57,224
The textbook can be purchased directly from the publisher.

98
00:11:57,224 --> 00:12:10,224
Jones and Bartlett using the discount code listed on Wolverine Access, or you can buy it from Amazon or any other retailer.

99
00:12:10,224 --> 00:12:16,224
You might be curious about how we assess your learning in this course and how you will be greeted.

100
00:12:16,224 --> 00:12:27,224
This slide shows a table of the types of assessments, their due dates and the percent of your overall course grade that is linked to each assessment.

101
00:12:27,224 --> 00:12:32,224
As you can see, your learning is assessed through to writing assignments,

102
00:12:32,224 --> 00:12:41,224
to exams and view a weekly discussion section participation and engagement and online knowledge checks.

103
00:12:41,224 --> 00:12:51,224
More information about assessments and grading is provided on our canvass site.

104
00:12:51,224 --> 00:12:59,224
As students in this course and at this university, you are expected to maintain a high degree of professionalism.

105
00:12:59,224 --> 00:13:10,224
Professionalism includes a commitment to active learning and participation in class and also integrity in your behavior outside of the classroom.

106
00:13:10,224 --> 00:13:18,224
In this class, we expect preparation of your papers to reflect your unique individual effort.

107
00:13:18,224 --> 00:13:23,224
Papers will be evidence based and require citations in this course.

108
00:13:23,224 --> 00:13:35,224
All papers should use a P, a formatting, cheating and other forms of academic misconduct will not be tolerated and will be dealt with firmly.

109
00:13:35,224 --> 00:13:40,224
Academic misconducts refers to behavior that includes plagiarism.

110
00:13:40,224 --> 00:13:46,224
Cheating on exams or assignments. Fabrication of data or sources.

111
00:13:46,224 --> 00:13:55,224
Falsification of records or official documents. The intentional misuse of equipment or materials, including library materials.

112
00:13:55,224 --> 00:14:00,224
Or aiding and abetting the perpetration of such acts.

113
00:14:00,224 --> 00:14:13,224
If you have any questions or concern about appropriate conduct, either yours or of your peers, please reach out to a course instructor.

114
00:14:13,224 --> 00:14:18,224
We want everyone to be successful in this course to learn a lot.

115
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:23,224
And to meet your own expectations for your academic performance.

116
00:14:23,224 --> 00:14:29,224
There are lots of tools available on campus to help students succeed academically.

117
00:14:29,224 --> 00:14:33,224
One support we want to highlight is for student writing.

118
00:14:33,224 --> 00:14:42,224
As you'll learn, writing in public health courses looks a little different than in your typical high school or college English class.

119
00:14:42,224 --> 00:14:51,224
Sweetland Center for Writing can be helpful in organizing your papers and meeting basic standards for academic writing.

120
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:59,224
In addition to the support offered by Sweetland, I'll be hosting a writing workshop during our September 10th forum,

121
00:14:59,224 --> 00:15:06,224
and you're G.S. Size will offer extra office hours to help support you as you work on your writing assignments.

122
00:15:06,224 --> 00:15:13,224
Please pay close attention to the assignment, prompt and advice offered by our instructional team.

123
00:15:13,224 --> 00:15:23,224
Performing well on the first reading assignment is an important step to do it well in the course.

124
00:15:23,224 --> 00:15:28,224
We know that some of you have some additional needs when it comes to your academic success.

125
00:15:28,224 --> 00:15:34,224
If you are a student who is registered with the services for students with disability office,

126
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:46,224
please notify your GSI and give her or him your visa letter no later than September 30th.

127
00:15:46,224 --> 00:15:54,224
So what can you do to be successful this semester? Here are our recommendations to get the most out of this course.

128
00:15:54,224 --> 00:16:05,224
First, complete online lessons weekly completing these lessons carefully by watching all videos, doing all the readings and taking notes throughout.

129
00:16:05,224 --> 00:16:12,224
We'll help you keep up with Korth content and be prepared for discussion section and forums.

130
00:16:12,224 --> 00:16:18,224
And we'll also help you avoid feeling stressed during pre exam crunch times.

131
00:16:18,224 --> 00:16:23,224
Second, we know learning in isolation can be tough.

132
00:16:23,224 --> 00:16:31,224
Attending discussion section will give you an opportunity to see your G.S. eyes and interact with your peers in real time.

133
00:16:31,224 --> 00:16:44,224
Each week. This is your time to ask questions. To listen to the ideas of others and simply connect with other learners around course content.

134
00:16:44,224 --> 00:16:50,224
Watching forums and submitting questions to our guest lecturers will also help you learn.

135
00:16:50,224 --> 00:16:54,224
And of course, I would like to see you and get to know you via office hours.

136
00:16:54,224 --> 00:17:01,224
Don't hesitate to attend office hours with me. Dr. Franzblau or your GSI.

137
00:17:01,224 --> 00:17:05,224
You don't have to have a question or to be struggling with a course concept.

138
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:11,224
Just drop by. Introduce yourselves and tell us why you've decided to take this class.

139
00:17:11,224 --> 00:17:19,224
We'd be delighted to meet you. Our next tip is to seek help from your GSI on the writing assignments.

140
00:17:19,224 --> 00:17:25,224
As I mentioned, writing in public health is a unique and important skill.

141
00:17:25,224 --> 00:17:36,224
Talk to your GSI as you are drafting your paper to make sure you are addressing the key components of a public health paper.

142
00:17:36,224 --> 00:17:42,224
One final tip, you should read and reread the syllabus in its entirety.

143
00:17:42,224 --> 00:17:45,224
This video has only offered a broad summary of the course.

144
00:17:45,224 --> 00:17:53,224
So to learn more and to understand our expectations fully, please read the syllabus posted on campus.

145
00:17:53,224 --> 00:17:57,224
You are responsible for understanding the content of the syllabus.

146
00:17:57,224 --> 00:18:07,224
If you have any questions about course policies, please reach out to one of the instructors.

147
00:18:07,224 --> 00:18:15,224
And in closing, I'd like to remind you how important it is to take care of yourself this semester.

148
00:18:15,224 --> 00:18:20,224
Our minds and mental health are all strained by our current circumstances.

149
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:25,224
And we know that physical health isn't something we can take for granted these days.

150
00:18:25,224 --> 00:18:28,224
Please, please take care of yourself.

151
00:18:28,224 --> 00:18:36,224
Respect to the university and public health guidelines to protect to protect your health and to promote the well-being of others.

152
00:18:36,224 --> 00:18:44,224
And if you are unwell, either physically, mentally records, you need to care for someone who gets sick.

153
00:18:44,224 --> 00:18:48,224
We ask you to let us know as soon as possible,

154
00:18:48,224 --> 00:18:58,224
contact your GSI so that we can work with you to modify deadlines or to provide extra support to keep you on track with your academic goals.

155
00:18:58,224 --> 00:19:05,224
We're all in this together. And the teaching team is here with patience and with flexibility.

156
00:19:05,224 --> 00:19:15,224
Communication early and often will be critical to support students who become sick or need additional resources.

157
00:19:15,224 --> 00:19:28,224
Please feel free to reach out to any member of the teaching team if you are sick, worried about being sick or you don't know where to go for help.

158
