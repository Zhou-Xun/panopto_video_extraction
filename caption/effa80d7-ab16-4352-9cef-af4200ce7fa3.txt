1
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:16,470
Hey. Good morning, folks. That's an impressive fog outside, huh?

2
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:24,540
A little easier, actually, to view the death ducking out across the street.

3
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:34,520
So today we're going to start a series of lectures on a similar topic around controlling exposures.

4
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,480
Right. To what are opportunities to directly manage you?

5
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:44,970
Today we'll talk specifically within workplace settings of occupational exposures.

6
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:53,460
And then in Tuesday's class period, we're going to shift gears and talk about opportunities for control in more of a community setting.

7
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:01,650
Before we get into that, I want to apologize. The last couple of days have been super busy for me, so I have not yet posted that announcement.

8
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:09,690
That includes links to kind of suggestions for other list references in your proposal and also

9
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:15,900
some perhaps examples or a little bit of instruction on just how to write a proposal in general.

10
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:19,470
I will promise I'll do that this afternoon.

11
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:27,550
That said, are there any new questions that have come up regarding the proposal assignment that folks would like to ask about?

12
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:39,820
Okay. Fair enough. But as always, don't don't hesitate to reach out to me as questions might arise.

13
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:46,090
Okay. So let's dig into today's topic around occupational exposure control.

14
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:53,740
So our goal is really going to be to understand the concepts and specifically this hierarchy.

15
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:58,900
Yes. The question for the screen, God, thank you for prompting me.

16
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:04,870
I never realized the word. It sounds like I. Yeah, that would be problematic.

17
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:12,160
There you go. Sorry about that.

18
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:15,710
Okay. Okay.

19
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:20,420
So, yeah, so we have this hierarchy, right? It's not just kind of a random.

20
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:26,080
Try this. Try. That is a hierarchy that we use to approach opportunities for control.

21
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:33,850
And there's a there's a reasoning behind that and why there's a preferred order of different types of control approaches.

22
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:36,130
And then we'll talk about some examples.

23
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:44,319
We'll do so a little bit of break out discussion around different types of controls that might be implemented in different settings.

24
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,950
And again, remember, today we're focusing on an occupational setting.

25
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:51,910
So as you're thinking about different examples, think about the workplace environment.

26
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:56,930
On Tuesday we'll do a similar exercise or we'll be talking more about community settings.

27
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:05,160
So there's some fundamental assumptions here as we kind of talk through this.

28
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:10,110
All hazards can actually be controlled to to some degree.

29
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:14,310
Right. Some, perhaps better than others or more success than others.

30
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,990
There are alternative approaches to control.

31
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:26,250
It's not just one option. And then often it's not just choosing one control option.

32
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:35,820
It's kind of taking a layered approach. So implementing multiple approaches of control that might be most successful or useful.

33
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:46,100
And then, uh, some control measures are both more cost effective as well as more energy efficient than others.

34
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:51,360
So from both a cost and a resource perspective and we'll talk about some examples of those far.

35
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:59,310
So here is that hierarchy of controls that I alluded to a moment ago.

36
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,810
And again, within the workplace, this is regarding health and safety.

37
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:10,860
And up at the top here, we have what we would consider our most effective or our preferred opportunities for control.

38
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:20,850
And then kind of as we go down the list, we we go to least effective or at least desire to at the top is simply eliminating the hazard.

39
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:27,060
That would be the best case scenario. If we can get rid of it altogether, be a problem solved.

40
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:39,740
The risk of exposure is gone. Also at the top end is very common or at least uh, uh, tried to be implemented is substituting, right?

41
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:41,670
So we know there's a hazard that exists.

42
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:50,520
We can substitute maybe a chemical or a process or whatever it might be to something that's less hazardous than what currently exists.

43
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:53,280
That's also a win for the situation.

44
00:04:54,330 --> 00:05:01,170
Next on that list are opportunities for engineering controls and we'll talk about what some of the examples are there.

45
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:05,920
Next is warnings or alerts, right?

46
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:10,230
Making sure that people are well aware of the hazards that exist.

47
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,930
Beyond that is trainings and procedures. Right.

48
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:19,680
Maybe it's unavoidable that hazards exist in the workplace,

49
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:30,000
but at least if we can train people on on really detailed procedures to help minimize their exposure in that hazardous setting,

50
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:40,710
that could be helpful as well. And then kind of our least desired and really last resort is personal protective equipment on individual people.

51
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:52,430
So yeah. So I think actually I probably hit on most of these bullets on the previous slide, eliminating it, preventing the hazard in the first place.

52
00:05:52,520 --> 00:06:00,590
That would be the best, uh, substitution. If we can replace it with something that's less hazardous, that would be beneficial.

53
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,739
I mentioned the engineering controls, right?

54
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:16,040
It might be kind of containing a hazard within a workplace or increasing ventilation rates to diluted or to get rid of the hazard.

55
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:25,430
Uh, let's see your warnings. You talked about those educating folks and then you have the last line of defense would be personal protective equipment.

56
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:33,500
Okay. So before we start going through a bunch of examples, I'm going to turn and ask you all to come up with some on your own.

57
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:38,209
We actually don't even need to do groups if it's easier just to turn to the person next to you.

58
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:42,620
I would say like maybe groups of two or three give you, say 3 minutes.

59
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:49,040
Think of examples of control or elimination that you might be able to come up with within a workplace.

60
00:06:49,790 --> 00:07:03,499
Ready, set, go. Yeah, that's been taken.

61
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:11,710
This seems like this in here, I think.

62
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:23,990
Right. So I guess I would say things like that friction manufacturing capacity internally

63
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:29,660
and it sounds like as an alternative source for various contributions,

64
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:33,680
maybe other people used to smoke.

65
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:50,060
I Yes, but that's not really like they were minimizing this pharmaceutical and I'm actually playing on something.

66
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,530
I'm still making excuses. Yeah.

67
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:06,080
I don't know. The risk of helping us get rid of sessions I know is against this.

68
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:15,160
Obviously, it's like a physical hazard. Everything's good, actually.

69
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:31,520
It's just like our kids are getting access and the kids are turning around and say it's all had choices.

70
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:36,350
We just don't like the setting where you're working.

71
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:42,770
You don't have to worry about like just example, look like over here.

72
00:08:45,800 --> 00:09:01,070
It's just like this is like I told you, I kind of knew that I was already going to die.

73
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:21,910
So I asked my husband, because you're not going to use either product one and stuff like that because we're like noble, just not dangerous.

74
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:27,930
Yeah. When I was working at the vet clinic, I can't think about that.

75
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:33,650
It was supposed to be, you know, so, so many things.

76
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:49,160
Now, I think there are, you know, your dog, you know, I was like, oh, the next 3 seconds, yeah, yeah.

77
00:09:50,320 --> 00:10:02,570
Okay. He's suffering from cancer.

78
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:15,630
So I wasn't expecting to see what exactly I think.

79
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:25,010
All right. So what did folks come up with in terms of some examples of opportunities for control using eliminate?

80
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:44,400
Oh, Annie. I mean, we struggle with this a little bit, but one thing that we came up with was like staying home if you're sick.

81
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,970
Uh. I'm trying to. I'm with you.

82
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,200
I'm trying to rationalize it into how it would fit into elimination.

83
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:03,780
You're eliminating the risk, I guess, for others. It's not for you, right?

84
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:07,500
It would be some sort of policy that eliminates the risk for others.

85
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:12,240
So you get it magically, right? No. If someone is infected with the virus.

86
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,729
Right. You have a policy that they're not allowed to be in the workplace, that it's protective of others.

87
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:23,400
So you eliminate the hazard, so to speak. Okay. Any other folks came up with.

88
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:33,170
Yeah. We mostly talked about using an alternative substance that's safer to make a product, which is more like substitution, right?

89
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:36,349
It's still eliminating the use. And then, for example,

90
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:44,720
we thought about like that could be eliminating something is flame retardant because they're not actually that useful, but they're harmful.

91
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:50,000
Absolutely. Yeah. And you're right, that that would be classified more as substitution.

92
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,530
But it's also kind of why I said I listed as elimination slash substitution.

93
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:58,760
You're truly eliminating that hazardous chemical in this case.

94
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:08,660
Um, but then oftentimes the process can't be without something else to, to use to replace it as a substitution.

95
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:12,530
But yes, but hopefully be less. For example, they're seeing it over here.

96
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:16,400
Yeah, we thought about anti child labor laws.

97
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:23,180
Obviously you don't want kids to get exposed to stuff and like little kids running around is a hazard in of itself.

98
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:34,640
Absolutely. Yeah. And I think the next slide actually says this, if I recall, but elimination can be thought of as a lot of policy, right?

99
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:40,160
So kind of like the first example if we implemented a policy to not have sick people come to work.

100
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:49,250
So yeah, so this would be another example of a policy if the policy is in place and it it eliminates in terms of child labor, any others.

101
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:55,430
Yes. Removing lead from gasoline. Removing lead from gasoline.

102
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:57,719
Okay.

103
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:07,470
So that one's going to be a great example on Tuesday within community settings in terms of reducing a hazard and removing it from the environment,

104
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:13,620
so to speak. But the reason that I hesitated is I think it would work in a workplace, right?

105
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:24,450
So in workplaces that say people that work in like an auto shop or whenever work with automobiles as part of their

106
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:31,259
occupation would certainly be exposed to higher levels of lead when it is in gasoline and when it's removed.

107
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:36,540
Yeah. So that workplace setting could definitely be made safer by removing.

108
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:43,720
All right, cool. Nice work. So let's see what's mine. Oliver Oops.

109
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:49,420
I thought I had some examples here. I don't. Let's move on to substitution.

110
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:52,540
You guys did a great job with that, by the way. Let's move on to substitution.

111
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:55,950
So taking another couple of minutes and talk about it.

112
00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:00,350
So, yes. So this time you're not just tasked with having to eliminated altogether.

113
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:03,960
There are some opportunities to substitute a hazard.

114
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:28,660
What would be an example to come back around like some substitute within your own hands or even just making more efficient crossing?

115
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:43,690
I actually saw the movie completion of cosmetics.

116
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:59,560
I could do that also for me, but like using preservatives, like substituting the chemicals that are used for anything else.

117
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:07,040
It is, you know, like a certain place.

118
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:10,790
Okay. So, you know, you can think of oh yeah.

119
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:21,889
So these are just what I was thinking to just talking about or sharps and I think doing that like that.

120
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:26,400
So I thought about that and I'm like, Gosh.

121
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:31,480
So it's like that. We don't need anything interesting.

122
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:46,010
Is that where it's like, Yeah, I was like, Well, you know, because they're hiring something else.

123
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,820
You I didn't. You should be telling them to just think. I mean, great, great.

124
00:15:52,460 --> 00:16:14,060
That's really interesting. I mean, hiring probably things I just like specifically hard times due to the that as or something like that.

125
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:22,050
Yeah. Sorry, I just kept pace.

126
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:32,479
So it wasn't just like, oh my God, I see this like substituting.

127
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:57,620
That's like for my dad's team. This team when he came from, I mean, it was one of the greatest semesters.

128
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:10,490
That's something that I do not know enough about solutions.

129
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:24,380
Yeah, I think it was just one of the answers, just.

130
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:32,120
Yeah, you know, but it didn't bring out.

131
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:37,669
All right. What did folks come up with in terms of examples of substitution in the workplace?

132
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:48,100
Hopefully this one was a little bit easier than elimination. In.

133
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:57,999
Any examples of substitution? Yes. Fair trade be considered to be part of substitution.

134
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:05,700
Like if you're a, say, a chocolate maker and you want to include fair trade, does that also improve working conditions change?

135
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:14,060
Good question. So. Right. So, you know, certainly a more broadly speaking, you could see the benefit.

136
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:24,590
But, you know, your question that you asked is, can it actually improve the health and safety of workers right within the supply chain?

137
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:29,840
And you think can you think more specifically of an example within that where it could be a benefit?

138
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:30,499
Yeah, maybe.

139
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:40,790
So going back to the example of like a cocoa farm, if the workers of the cocoa farm in South America are able to have access to better pay,

140
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:45,440
maybe they can afford to get educations which can improve their health outcomes long term,

141
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:51,020
or the farm could afford to invest more and newer equipment for them.

142
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:55,610
Right, right, right, right. And then I'm trying to think of how I mean,

143
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:59,329
it certainly fits in that like elimination substitution category is kind of a

144
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:05,900
policy on that is it's it's I guess it's substituting I guess unfair with there.

145
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:09,560
Right. Okay. I'll take that. Thank you very much.

146
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:14,520
Any other ideas? Yes.

147
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:22,820
Taking out broken or old equipment for newer models can be within within a workplace.

148
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:28,380
Yeah. So maintaining equipment, right. Things are getting old, they might become hazardous.

149
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:36,090
So having a good maintenance protocol in place and substituting that potential hazard for something that's safer.

150
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:44,280
Okay, sounds good. Yeah. Kind of along the same lines are replacing like human manual labor with more technology.

151
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:50,100
Sure. So that people don't get hurt. It's often you don't have as unfair treatment in the workplace.

152
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:57,030
Absolutely. Yeah. I'm thinking back to Professor Knightley's lecture and I'm pretty sure he talked a little bit about like ergonomics.

153
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:00,300
Right. And repetitive motions, like an assembly line or something like that.

154
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:07,740
Yeah. If you can remove that that human from that workplace scenario and replace it with some sort of automation,

155
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:11,700
certainly it it's it's a substitution, right.

156
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:18,270
It's you're getting rid of the hazard, but you're substituting something else and the humans place to to do that task.

157
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:22,610
Good example. The authors that first came up with.

158
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:30,180
Yes. Phasing out certain chemicals that are used to preserve a substance for just less harmful alternatives.

159
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:36,030
Absolutely. Yeah. So so a ton of examples in that classification of chemicals, right.

160
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:39,960
Things that we know are hazardous that we can remove.

161
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:48,750
And then, yeah, the process still requires, you know, some sort of chemical to move things along, replacing it with something that is less hazardous.

162
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:54,300
Absolutely. Good example. Okay. I do have a follow up slide on this one.

163
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:58,590
So yeah, so, so think about and you guys have done a great job with this.

164
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:04,290
There is an example of, you know, specifically what the hazardous chemical substituting with something that's less hazardous,

165
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:09,659
but it doesn't have to be a chemical. Right? It can be like an operation or a process.

166
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:14,000
And we had good examples of that with with the Fair Trade labor, with, you know,

167
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:19,290
automation in terms of workers and repetitive motions and things like that.

168
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:29,280
And there's, uh, there's kind of a formal process for identifying substitutions, right?

169
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:39,960
And this is actually one that we are improving on, but it requires quite a bit of analysis and perspective analysis, right?

170
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:45,299
So it's easy to say, okay, we need to get rid of this and to come up with some ideas.

171
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:49,080
But hey, this sounds like a great idea. Let's implement this instead.

172
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:58,200
It's a it's a risk without that perspective analysis because what it gets substituted with would actually be worse.

173
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:06,840
Right? In which case it's a huge backfire. And we've gone we've gone backwards in terms of reducing hazardous exposure.

174
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:17,010
Yeah. So just kind of some bulleted, uh, a summary here on substitution in terms of strengths, right?

175
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:23,079
We can remove a known hazard substituting anywhere, something that's less hazardous, whether it be like a chemical,

176
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:30,220
a material or equipment that was mentioned or a specific process for automating in place of people.

177
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:39,910
Uh, it might be the least expensive and the most positive benefit in terms of controlling occupational hazards.

178
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:43,959
Some of the weaknesses, uh, is, yeah,

179
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:49,330
like what I just mentioned here is that we really need to be sure that what we

180
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:54,580
replace it with isn't some have some unforeseen hazard associated with it.

181
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:58,150
It doesn't occur a long substitution process.

182
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:05,320
And again, that prospective or resource can also include experimenting on a small scale.

183
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:11,830
Right? We're going to substitute we're going to implement it kind of in a pilot stage and make sure that does actually work.

184
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:19,239
And it is actually reducing the hazard. It doesn't it's not introducing a new hazard that was not foreseen before.

185
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:24,870
It's more broadly components. All right.

186
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,140
Shifting gears to engineering control.

187
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:40,020
Go ahead and take a couple of minutes and see if you can offer some examples of engineering controls to control hazardous exposures in.

188
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:57,050
Things like, what's it like?

189
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:02,660
It's like something like nothing like this.

190
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:19,660
It's just common sense for you to be able to work with like on that one, which is radiation.

191
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:39,740
You know, it's probably something that's even using it like a fairly like a quiet awareness, something that's always.

192
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:51,319
Yeah, and as a part of that, that is different than anything else to watch,

193
00:24:51,320 --> 00:25:04,470
like the insurance that they have to be able to like it would stay while or something like that to set up or like yeah.

194
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:30,680
So it would like to do is I would just like to go forward if you are working with someone like each one with some specific inverted Y, right?

195
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:45,950
Yeah, sure. So I can, I can read over some of your words.

196
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:52,030
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

197
00:25:53,170 --> 00:26:10,210
Isolated from a hazard are people who like, excuse me, worker firing them to like these groups against controlling it.

198
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:13,870
So that makes sense. It'll change to the organization.

199
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:26,660
Some people are trying to work and what you're saying few words is like a reason why.

200
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:46,870
It's like it's like our watches shows are just kind of what you do.

201
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:56,510
An expose. Yeah, yeah. That's a comment I would like to use in that case to public anger.

202
00:26:57,210 --> 00:27:13,950
Yeah. Well, that's something I mean, it's like it's just seems to have sensors and flow problems and verify.

203
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:34,430
Yeah, it's like orientation, whether it's like just making some things go off without any organization, certainly since.

204
00:27:48,210 --> 00:28:07,790
6% higher scores for faults use guardrail geometry results for those barricades for chemicals.

205
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:23,580
And that's something that you're using quite tools.

206
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:33,470
All right. What did folks come up with for engineering controls in terms of opportunities to reduce a hazard?

207
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:39,130
Oh, hands are going up left and right. This is awesome. Not so we pass on this.

208
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,870
I feel like a type of ventilation control for a few posts and labs.

209
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:48,410
So like when you're working with chemicals, you're not like. Absolutely right.

210
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:52,639
So in increased ventilation, for example, in a laboratory.

211
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,750
Right. Or in some manufacturing setting where chemicals are being used, I mean,

212
00:28:56,750 --> 00:29:02,630
that ventilation in place can actually remove the hazard from the workplace, from the worker coming here.

213
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:08,300
You talked about having equipment that can detect if there's something wrong with.

214
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,709
It's like how is like an auto shut off process? Absolutely.

215
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:19,220
So we have some some detection, some device, right. That's monitoring a process or maybe a chemical in the air or whatever it is.

216
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:27,170
And as soon as it detects it, right, it can shut down the process and therefore reduce the potential exposure to the worker.

217
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:43,960
Examples. Any others that folks came up with? For this one there's actually quite a bit right in the world is full of engineers

218
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:49,690
and so to an engineer right there's there's many potential solutions to a problem.

219
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:55,180
And so yeah. So, you know, a couple of follow up notes here.

220
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:59,680
Ventilation is a big one and I'm glad that it was already brought up.

221
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:07,300
There are a lot of ways this is actually part of the response to COVID to reduce

222
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:11,920
the exposure rate in in public spaces in the classrooms here in public health.

223
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:19,120
I know this was a response that's still in place, increasing the ventilation within indoor environments,

224
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:25,750
within a workplace environment, and at least you're diluting the potential hazard.

225
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:33,880
But with enough ventilation or in the case of a good rate, you can ask if you're isolating that chemical or whatever the hazard is,

226
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:38,440
you can actually be removing it from the worker's environment.

227
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:48,940
Isolation and enclosure is another common one, so you can physically separate a worker from that hazard,

228
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:52,870
whether it be an operation, piece of equipment, chemicals,

229
00:30:54,070 --> 00:31:00,700
you can either enclose the process to keep the process contained or actually enclose

230
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:09,550
the worker so that they're fully covered and protected from the external environment.

231
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:18,370
A couple of more. We've talked in this class a lot about health care settings and some of the hazards.

232
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:28,150
Right. So these in terms of needle use for cutaneous exposures to sharps would definitely fall under the category of engineering controls.

233
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:33,970
So there are some self reshaping needles where after it's used,

234
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:42,340
the user basically slides the sleeve forward over the needle and it kind of locked in place, therefore reducing that potential hazard.

235
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,870
Another example are syringes that have a retractable needle.

236
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:53,520
So after the needle is used out, is a plunger that's pushed that retracts the needle back into the syringe.

237
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:57,970
So again, reducing the potential for that sharps exposure.

238
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:04,560
Some strengths and weaknesses to this engineering control approach.

239
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:10,020
The strengths is it can be built into some large scale processes.

240
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:16,290
Right. And be very effective in that way. And if it's effective, there's really no further action.

241
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:20,330
Right, than engineering approach. Here's a problem. Here's the solution.

242
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:23,880
The solution works. Bam! We're done. Move forward.

243
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:28,260
Of course, we might want to continue surveillance, right?

244
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:36,870
To make sure that it remains untested. Some of the downsides to engineering control approaches is they can be quite expensive, quite costly.

245
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:48,780
They might not be 100% effective, and they might be disabled by workers if they're if they're poorly designed.

246
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:52,710
Right. And I was just putting two thoughts together, actually, for this note,

247
00:32:53,490 --> 00:33:00,270
the example of the of the device that could detect something and then automatically shut it down.

248
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:02,580
I believe this is what happened.

249
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:08,910
This is going back to the beginning of the semester, right upstream of the Grand River with the chromium that was released at this facility.

250
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:17,129
The alarm was sounding like all night long and the worker kept basically like hitting reset or disable on that detection.

251
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:24,660
So that would be an example of it can be if it's poorly designed, it can easily be disabled by a worker.

252
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:33,720
Okay. So back to that hierarchy. We've made our way through elimination substitution.

253
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:41,130
We talked about engineering controls. Now let's go on and talk about warnings and trainings and procedures.

254
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:46,350
So putting them all together because there's a bit of overlap.

255
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:50,189
Go ahead and take a few minutes and think of what examples you might come up

256
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:56,040
with for how we could implement controls in a workplace setting using warnings,

257
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:58,020
trainings and procedures.

258
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:28,930
Like they don't have like if you have some type of history about your character in a positive way, is lucky to get something like that.

259
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:58,210
What was the argument about trying to be just like I had just been watching updates for five days just to get into the matrix or

260
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:12,510
if you wherever you work on this like want to be or anything more like the procedural resistance posters or anything like that.

261
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:27,560
It's like it's here. I'm like, you got to try to was made probably more and maybe like because it probably doesn't help.

262
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:42,719
Specifically what made you say something like just like when you went to the secret screenings,

263
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:54,010
it was like, Oh yeah, we're supposed to what kinds of building this?

264
00:35:58,110 --> 00:36:01,590
I guess. I just make sure they get insurance.

265
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:07,260
It seems like they just want to make these.

266
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:20,950
And I was just like, So can I ask you a question?

267
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:28,479
So, like going to see the show, you know what I'm saying?

268
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:41,110
Like blogs that say like, oh, you check the temperature of this huge US gold, Charlie and the rest of you are like insane.

269
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:46,300
You have to wait for someone that is out of touch.

270
00:36:46,770 --> 00:37:00,180
So I going have to resist the eyelashes that began to sound like I was about to shower like someone's iWatch.

271
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:06,229
But it is detectable like they are doing with a whole lot of design.

272
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:26,870
And it's like a running start, you know, I think it works like you have to like it to introduce you to a lot of discussion about this.

273
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:42,640
So honestly, I think that's when people stickers and stir people like this, you know,

274
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:52,220
it's so terrifying sometimes, but that has nothing to do with the chemicals.

275
00:37:52,640 --> 00:38:11,110
I think it was just like video or whatever, you know, just like it's a cloud because someone else knew what they were going to get.

276
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:31,839
So it was not until it was like, yeah, so you know, like yeah, I think to some extent this about training is very different.

277
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:40,310
So much technical. Yeah, I'm gonna drop it off.

278
00:38:40,870 --> 00:39:02,620
Yeah. So, you know, these are all supposed to sound like doing all right.

279
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:06,130
What are folks come up with more examples for warnings,

280
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:12,730
trainings and different procedures that could be implemented as controls to reduce exposure to hazard.

281
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:23,410
Yes. It's not like stickers and labels on hazardous materials to inform the workers like what they're using.

282
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:29,109
Absolutely right. And I'm thinking, too, I think as Professor Mika's one of his lectures, right,

283
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:36,670
where you talked about in a biohazard label, chemical hazard labels that can be easily affixed,

284
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:45,080
symbols that, you know, that mean things about having to to read or easily legible from multiple directions, depending on the vantage point.

285
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:51,790
For example, what else? Yes. Like fire alarms and things like that during the building.

286
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:56,230
Absolutely. Yeah. So warnings that can be put into place.

287
00:39:57,190 --> 00:40:00,300
And then also I think even related to that, right. Like trainings.

288
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:09,430
Right. So fire drills, for example. Right. Or some sort of procedural training around what happens when this when this alarm or warning is indicated.

289
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:21,370
Good example. Yes, there are a lot of like warnings and user friendly guidelines in a manual for a lot of the machinery that workers use.

290
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:26,320
But unless it's in the correct language or if they rewrite the manual for each tool that they're using,

291
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:32,020
won't be super effective unless the employer translates that.

292
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:40,200
Absolutely. Yeah. So I'm going to, uh, I mean, you mentioned manual, so I'm going to put that into like procedural control, right?

293
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:43,750
So it's not just that like, yeah, read the manual.

294
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:49,660
Right. Okay. That would be good if you were to require your employees to read the manual, but actually be more active.

295
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:54,219
Right. Put that into a training mechanism where it's directly translated.

296
00:40:54,220 --> 00:41:01,000
Right. Maybe all of the aspects of the manual don't apply to what the the worker is actually doing as part of that task.

297
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:06,970
So being able to translate it much more specifically to the worker task would be a huge help.

298
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:13,460
Any other examples? Yes.

299
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:21,050
Before you work in any kind of lab, you have to take, like chemistry or chemical training or like bloodborne pathogen training.

300
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:25,620
Yeah. And are you referring to the university or elsewhere?

301
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:29,009
But just in general, yeah, I'm thinking of.

302
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:32,150
Right. So in my lab, anyone who works in my lab does have to do this, right?

303
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:37,090
There are several module that they have to complete before they're even allowed to step foot into the laboratory.

304
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:41,729
And so, yes, a lot of organizations would have something like this in place until you're kind of certified.

305
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:42,030
Right.

306
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:50,430
Or you've passed you know, you've demonstrated some confidence in your understanding before you even enter into that potentially hazardous setting.

307
00:41:51,210 --> 00:42:00,440
Great examples. So yeah, um, this, this includes, you know, education, uh,

308
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:07,660
in various forms and trainings as you can with good examples, uh, needed and to supplement really all control.

309
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:11,979
So this was one where we would hope that it's an, it's kind of an overlapping, right?

310
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:20,620
It's not the only control approach that would be implemented and it would be in addition to other controls, uh, would include, you know,

311
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:29,500
both supervisors as playing an important role in work for education and making sure that workers know what those proper

312
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:37,270
operating procedures are in terms of what they're actually doing as part of their tasks to make those controls most effective.

313
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:44,740
It also could include that general, um, preventative maintenance, as was mentioned earlier.

314
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:54,400
Um, so reducing the risk of something catastrophic happening on site, something is properly maintained, it reduces that chance.

315
00:42:54,940 --> 00:43:00,429
And then also reducing something called fugitive emissions is if anyone knows what that means.

316
00:43:00,430 --> 00:43:03,580
It's kind of in quotes there, what's a fugitive emission?

317
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:12,260
Yes. Is it emissions from fire? Emissions from fire?

318
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:23,450
And exactly I'm thinking of ways it could be related to fire but not specifically signal arms going up yet.

319
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:30,740
Is it like. I have an example in my head and it's kind of dumb.

320
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:39,490
No, my point is that, like in Monsters Inc, when he comes out of the door and there's like a sock on his back, that could be.

321
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:43,000
I think that's a awesome example. Oh, yeah.

322
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:51,350
Right. So there's you're trying to control for I didn't see monsters or whatever things coming from the

323
00:43:51,350 --> 00:43:57,350
other side of the door and this sock wasn't supposed to going to happen and it did it got through.

324
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:01,489
But I saw another game. Yeah, I was just thinking like a fugitive.

325
00:44:01,490 --> 00:44:05,410
I think of, like, escaping. So, like a mission that you're not expecting, I guess.

326
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:08,479
For sure. For sure. So I'm actually going to go back to.

327
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:12,530
So he's early example of what the humor is, right? So you have this theme here in plays.

328
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:17,390
It's like, you know, it's very well calibrated, it's it's sealed, it's pulling air.

329
00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:21,830
You know, the chemical or whatever or whatever hazard you're working with is within this film.

330
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:31,910
And it's it's taking any fumes out and removing it from the workplace environment if there's a crack somewhere in the hood.

331
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:36,700
Right. This would be a huge opportunity for a fugitive, a mission.

332
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:44,510
It's supposed to be going up the hood and out of the workplace, down, but, you know, underside of the hood because it hasn't been properly maintained.

333
00:44:44,570 --> 00:44:52,310
There's now a crack so that that that fumes is being emitted inside the hood is leaking right out the side of it into the workplace setting.

334
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:57,080
So that would be that would be my my easiest example of a fugitive emission.

335
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:00,650
But I'm really going to work on the soc, on the monster.

336
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:08,780
All right. Uh, so let's see. Yeah.

337
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:13,460
And another example of. Of procedural controls.

338
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:18,380
And I did want to step through this because this is something that's very common in workplace

339
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:27,530
settings around scheduling and tracking of jobs to potentially reduce the hours of exposure.

340
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:34,100
So this would place a burden of responsibility on the worker.

341
00:45:35,330 --> 00:45:43,250
And again, it's often effectively used, whereas a layered approach with other controls, for example, engineering controls.

342
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:46,710
So, you know, this very simple slide up here.

343
00:45:46,730 --> 00:45:55,880
These are agricultural workers. You know, someone's bending over, digging, someone's pushing a wheelbarrow, someone is riding on the tractor.

344
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:59,810
They all might have different hazards associated with them.

345
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:06,020
Uh, but if we consider things like job rotation, right?

346
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:16,700
So the person who's, you know, might be assigned where to just driving the tractor all day long and perhaps the vibration associated with that, right?

347
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:21,950
If there's some job rotation implemented and it's not that person doing it the whole time.

348
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:27,350
Right. It reduces that person's exposure so we can reduce the exposure time.

349
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:34,880
Um, it requires that the term Good Housekeeping here is basically record keeping, right?

350
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:40,699
So you need to keep track of it and have everybody on the same page and have things documented to

351
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:47,990
know that people are actually moving from one task to the other if this job rotation is implemented.

352
00:46:48,470 --> 00:46:55,040
And then, of course, you know, there would be additional training and education required for these employees

353
00:46:55,430 --> 00:47:01,309
because they're now moving on to multiple jobs as part of the rotation here.

354
00:47:01,310 --> 00:47:06,800
Here's an example. And of course, I'm always going back to to try to use, you know, an air pollutant has one of the examples.

355
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:19,250
Let's say we have a worker who is working for 8 hours on a task and there's an airborne concentration of of paper, 100 parts per million there.

356
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:24,110
There are eight hour time weighted. Average exposure would be 100 parts per million.

357
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:28,879
If there's some sort of job rotation that's put into place right now,

358
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:35,810
they're swapping with another employee if they're now only spending half of their work shift, half of their day on that task,

359
00:47:35,810 --> 00:47:40,879
only 4 hours it would take their equivalent eight hour time weighted average and cut it in

360
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:47,390
half right down to 50 parts per million if there was further reduce to only 2 hours on task.

361
00:47:47,390 --> 00:47:53,330
Right. And now perhaps there's three other employees for employees taking turns over that time period.

362
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:55,340
It would further reduce that. Right.

363
00:47:55,340 --> 00:48:03,410
And then, of course, if it was only one hour at effective time, weighted average exposure to the vapor would be down as low as 13 parts per million.

364
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:14,890
Uh, if that exposure limit is as low as, say, 15 parts per million, we would need eight workers, right?

365
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:20,150
Each spending one hour on task needed to complete that shift.

366
00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:26,210
So these are some issues with that approach, right? We're achieving the reduction in exposure.

367
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:36,890
In this case, if there's an exposure limit that's enforced, it's meaning that worker is exposed over that eight hour limit.

368
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:43,129
The downside now is we have eight people that need to be well trained in how to do

369
00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:50,660
this task instead of one eight sets of personal protective equipment might be needed,

370
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:55,340
right? So from a cost perspective, in a lot of workplaces,

371
00:48:56,060 --> 00:49:01,969
there are medical exams required for people that are known to be exposed to to make

372
00:49:01,970 --> 00:49:07,520
sure that their exposure isn't resulting in some sort of kind of symptomatic,

373
00:49:07,970 --> 00:49:14,230
uh, condition. Now, just following one person's health, now you have to follow people.

374
00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:21,380
So there's a sort of cost effective considerations that come into play for that organization that's trying to manage this.

375
00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:33,450
Uh, summarizing a little bit around, you know, strengths and weaknesses or this kind of combined category of warnings, trainings and procedures.

376
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:41,280
Uh, the strength is that Mac management, right from an organizational perspective, is now actively engaged in the process business.

377
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:48,420
Good talked about the Good Housekeeping. So documentation and accountability are ensured in the process.

378
00:49:49,050 --> 00:49:56,970
And you know, ideally, if it's implemented correctly, it's spreading the exposure across a larger group of workers,

379
00:49:56,970 --> 00:50:02,370
thereby lowering the exposures of those that would otherwise be highly exposed.

380
00:50:02,370 --> 00:50:11,820
Right. And they were the only ones doing the task. Uh, some downsides to it is that like with most things, there's potential for human error, right?

381
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:15,630
That could cause problems. In some cases.

382
00:50:15,630 --> 00:50:19,680
It's kind of it's passing responsibility to the worker, right?

383
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:22,680
Like, okay, this is what you guys are supposed to do. Go do it.

384
00:50:23,250 --> 00:50:26,520
Uh, it's supervision. Is it possible kind of in real time?

385
00:50:27,330 --> 00:50:33,750
Um, it now, you know, kind of on the flip side of, of this benefit over here,

386
00:50:34,950 --> 00:50:41,670
it's actually a weakness that it's now spreading some exposure across many people.

387
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:47,370
Right? So there were if it was only one person doing that job, the other seven people weren't exposed at all.

388
00:50:47,790 --> 00:50:51,089
Now all eight people are exposed, at least that to some degree.

389
00:50:51,090 --> 00:51:00,410
So that would be kind of viewed as a negative. And again, in for a variety of reasons, they can increase the cost to the organization.

390
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:06,200
This is trying to carry out this task. All right.

391
00:51:06,350 --> 00:51:18,590
Our our last one. And this is our kind of our least desirable control approach for controlling exposure to hazards, personal protective equipment.

392
00:51:19,070 --> 00:51:24,889
Go ahead and take a few minutes and think of what types of control opportunities

393
00:51:24,890 --> 00:51:29,000
and workplaces that you might come up with for personal protective equipment.

394
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:49,050
There's trouble getting comfortable, but I think she'll like us just like that.

395
00:51:52,530 --> 00:52:05,220
You know, I think she's doing a good job.

396
00:52:06,810 --> 00:52:25,650
I think she's supposed to do something like this where we have to get close to our clients.

397
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:29,460
Construction workers and public safety.

398
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:40,740
How did you write?

399
00:52:41,190 --> 00:52:47,390
Oh, he still loves to do stuff.

400
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:51,140
I think most of.

401
00:52:57,550 --> 00:53:15,810
Time I was like, you know, I think he's just like, I started insomnia specifically because I'm like, that whole album chart that was.

402
00:53:23,090 --> 00:53:33,860
I just felt like I was like that. An expert on something such as what I was doing on something like this was the

403
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:43,940
easiest way to start in this business because it was obviously they were added.

404
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:58,190
Everything takes two pages to I out to the and then the masters.

405
00:53:58,190 --> 00:54:17,280
I think the only way to do the project was just like it was like it was online.

406
00:54:17,330 --> 00:54:25,060
So it's not it's not just nice to actually let you watch it on anything is after a while

407
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:34,400
usually adult jokes that I was putting out quickly when I just like the right time.

408
00:54:35,550 --> 00:54:38,630
Yeah, yeah. Just like playing against.

409
00:54:38,690 --> 00:54:45,940
It's such a good biological. Oh, I'm taking this personality thing, this one before.

410
00:54:46,010 --> 00:55:00,180
Okay, so let's say this type of exposure area and you want to just.

411
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:18,700
I'm guessing that you're quite comfortable with that.

412
00:55:19,890 --> 00:55:28,200
Yeah. Yeah, that.

413
00:55:28,570 --> 00:55:33,280
All right. What did folks come up with for examples of personal protective equipment?

414
00:55:36,730 --> 00:55:42,580
Exhibit appearing for construction workers, like wearing the noise,

415
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:46,690
canceling headphones and, like, hard hats and like, work boots and stuff like that.

416
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:49,890
Awesome. So I heard, uh, hearing protection.

417
00:55:50,470 --> 00:55:57,260
Um. But protection and then had protection on us.

418
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:01,209
Sorry. And and like the fluorescent vests. Yeah, right.

419
00:56:01,210 --> 00:56:04,380
So making themselves visible. Absolutely.

420
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:09,730
Yeah. Sunscreen and protective clothing for any kind of weather.

421
00:56:10,210 --> 00:56:13,630
Sure. So. So you've. But then what else?

422
00:56:13,630 --> 00:56:17,170
What other things you think of or whether just like long sleeves and.

423
00:56:20,230 --> 00:56:25,809
Yeah. I guess like the material can help a lot of what kind of job you're doing for sure.

424
00:56:25,810 --> 00:56:27,850
So having, having skin covered, right.

425
00:56:28,330 --> 00:56:36,550
Um, for, for many different types of hazards that would be, you know, both indoors as well as outdoors I would say.

426
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:42,340
What else did Brooks come up with? Yeah, we thought of, like, firefighter uniforms.

427
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:47,460
Sure. Yeah. There's a ton of protection built in. What?

428
00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:52,120
What are some of the. On the flip side, what are some of the downsides of wearing those firefighter uniforms?

429
00:56:53,770 --> 00:56:56,680
And eat stress, right? Absolutely.

430
00:56:56,700 --> 00:57:03,720
I mean, not only you're wearing it all, but you're then entering like this extremely hot environment as a profession.

431
00:57:06,090 --> 00:57:11,290
Any other issues that folks came up with? Yes.

432
00:57:11,630 --> 00:57:16,670
My go tos are like gloves, safety, glasses, eye protection.

433
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:20,809
Right. Absolutely. Now, these are all great, great examples.

434
00:57:20,810 --> 00:57:25,940
And I think I have an image at some point. Yeah. That depicts most of these.

435
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:37,730
Let's back out for a moment, though, and recognize that that personal protective equipment truly is considered kind of the least desirable.

436
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:38,120
Right.

437
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:46,970
What we would like to do in preference is to implement any of those controls about it in the hierarchy because they're generally much more effective.

438
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:53,030
Right. The PPE, the personal protective equipment, is really a last resort,

439
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:57,980
and that's how it's viewed if none of the other controls above it in the hierarchy are working.

440
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:02,450
The goal, then, is to use PPE, but not as a long term solution.

441
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:09,290
So, you know, OSHA as a regulatory agency really regards PPE as an interim measure.

442
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:17,570
Right. It's not meant to be kind of a permanent solution. It's to use in the meantime until we come up with a more effective control.

443
00:58:19,910 --> 00:58:25,520
And then, yeah, another, you know, kind of important thing is it as it could be added as part of a layering approach, right.

444
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:31,700
So maybe we do have some control measures, progress in the hierarchy, but has an added protection of safety.

445
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:34,340
We're still going to add, you know, PPE to that.

446
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:46,220
And then, you know, one of the challenges of it is that PPE is only effective if it's if it's properly applied.

447
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:54,640
Right. This is this is a huge issue. So training workers before using it, not just saying here, right.

448
00:58:55,370 --> 00:58:58,430
Here's your PPE, make sure you use it.

449
00:58:58,790 --> 00:59:01,910
It's actually training folks on how to do it again.

450
00:59:02,210 --> 00:59:06,620
We've already mentioned earlier about following procedures of being trained.

451
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:16,110
Uh, yeah. Here's some images, right? We talked about, uh, hardhats, head protection, hearing protection, eye protection,

452
00:59:16,770 --> 00:59:24,560
glove for hands, uh, face shields, uh, protective boots, respirators.

453
00:59:24,570 --> 00:59:27,360
I think you guys, you know all of these as examples.

454
00:59:29,850 --> 00:59:38,130
So I wanted to finish with just a couple of examples of my own that I chose that we can kind of, uh,

455
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:45,180
isolate a topic and then think through, you know, what would be the opportunities for control down this hierarchy.

456
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:52,379
One of them might be, and I try to pick ones that I didn't think we might not necessarily get on as the different examples.

457
00:59:52,380 --> 01:00:01,710
So we talked a lot about chemicals. I didn't pick chemicals. Um, so for exposing or controlling exposures for ionizing radiation, right.

458
01:00:02,370 --> 01:00:09,720
Uh, so for elimination, of course, we're going to try to eliminate, uh, that exposure whenever possible.

459
01:00:10,590 --> 01:00:19,340
How would we substitute in this case? Well, Professor Neitzel taught us that that non-ionizing radiation is less harmful.

460
01:00:19,350 --> 01:00:23,790
It's still a concern, but it's less of a hazard than ionizing radiation.

461
01:00:23,790 --> 01:00:33,450
So that might be an opportunity for substitution in terms of engineering controls, uh, shielding might be one, right?

462
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:37,799
So I'm thinking back to like a health care setting.

463
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:44,270
If anyone's ever gone for imaging exam, the technician who is completing that is often, you know,

464
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:52,590
getting you set up or getting the patient set up and then is retreating to another room to actually kind of remotely do the imaging.

465
01:00:52,590 --> 01:01:03,110
So their shielding in place is increasing their distance from that source of radiation as part of their workplace, setting the administrative, uh,

466
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:06,440
controls that we might be able to implement, um,

467
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:13,540
which would be another term for kind of like the procedural controls is reducing the exposure time, right?

468
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:22,110
We can't prevent perhaps, uh, the emission taking place, the hazard, uh, being released into the workplace environment.

469
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:27,600
But if we can reduce the exposure time, maybe we regulate that.

470
01:01:28,110 --> 01:01:32,950
Going back to the example of the technician operating the imaging equipment, we, uh, you know,

471
01:01:32,970 --> 01:01:39,000
we have them working only certain hours, you know, with that equipment and then again, personal protective equipment.

472
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:45,090
Uh, so actually wearing, uh, shielding to prevent exposure.

473
01:01:45,090 --> 01:01:52,290
To help decrease exposure. Another example would be noise.

474
01:01:52,530 --> 01:02:02,140
Right. And so we can talk through this one a little bit. Obviously, again, if we can eliminate it, we would do that for substitution.

475
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:08,790
Maybe there's an opportunity to change the source, whatever it is that's making the loud noise.

476
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:12,870
Perhaps we can replace that with something that makes less noise.

477
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:18,780
Right. If at all possible, there are some engineering controls that we might be able to implement.

478
01:02:19,170 --> 01:02:26,790
We could install some sound barriers or perhaps, you know, whatever it is that's making the noise.

479
01:02:26,790 --> 01:02:36,180
If we can enclose that with maybe some sound insulating foam or whatever it is to help kind of control the noise at the source,

480
01:02:37,110 --> 01:02:40,170
we might be able to implement some procedural controls.

481
01:02:41,070 --> 01:02:45,160
So change the timing of when it's done.

482
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:50,520
Change the duration. Right. Ideally, we could we could prohibit it.

483
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:54,630
Right. And this would actually kind of overlap with with elimination.

484
01:02:55,530 --> 01:02:58,950
And then the personal protective equipment recently that we already talked about,

485
01:02:59,250 --> 01:03:04,230
you know, having some some hearing protection in place on the person.

486
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:08,970
Again, ideally, that's not the only control measure that would be done.

487
01:03:09,330 --> 01:03:14,250
It would be layered with additional control measures to be most effective.

488
01:03:14,820 --> 01:03:22,530
So, yeah, so these were, you know, ionizing radiation and noise were two examples that I wanted to just walk through briefly.

489
01:03:23,010 --> 01:03:25,830
Are there any questions about this,

490
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:34,230
either these specific examples or just about that hierarchy of controls for reducing exposures within workplace settings?

491
01:03:37,710 --> 01:03:46,170
Yeah, it's kind of specific. But like in your last example, when you're talking about changing out the ionizing radiation for non,

492
01:03:46,470 --> 01:03:50,310
I just feel like ionizing radiation is used for like very specific things.

493
01:03:50,340 --> 01:03:54,930
Could you give an example of where non-ionizing could be substituted in?

494
01:03:55,230 --> 01:03:58,360
Yeah. Not a good one.

495
01:03:59,730 --> 01:04:04,100
Um, but that would be. It's certainly an opportunity, right?

496
01:04:04,110 --> 01:04:09,069
So that for the people that develop, uh, usually in this case, it's.

497
01:04:09,070 --> 01:04:14,880
It's equipment. Right. Um, that, that can be an option.

498
01:04:15,030 --> 01:04:22,080
Not in all situations, obviously. Right? Because if it was that easy, we wouldn't have sources of ionizing radiation for the most part.

499
01:04:22,530 --> 01:04:28,500
Um, but it's, it's something that can be, uh, investigated and looked into.

500
01:04:28,620 --> 01:04:38,660
And oftentimes, uh, it is. And in those cases, um, at least in most settings, that that substitution happened a long time ago.

501
01:04:38,730 --> 01:04:42,980
And so in terms of practice, it's not even something you recognize, right?

502
01:04:42,990 --> 01:04:48,780
That, I mean, even in the development, uh, in the first place it was recognized that oh yeah, this would work.

503
01:04:48,780 --> 01:04:54,540
But you know what, we can also do this. It would accomplish the same thing, but it would be much safer.

504
01:04:56,430 --> 01:05:02,020
Good question. Any others?

505
01:05:09,710 --> 01:05:13,250
All right. Well, hey, I'm setting a bad precedent.

506
01:05:13,250 --> 01:05:17,690
I think we're done early again. I don't I don't think anyone's going to object to that.

507
01:05:17,690 --> 01:05:27,799
But I know promises are going forward. I feel like I'm on the other end it trying to rush to get three things before you don't have a great afternoon.

508
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:33,020
You all enjoy the fog. I think it's ought to be live and have a good weekend.

509
01:05:33,020 --> 01:05:39,600
And again, reach out to me. If you come up with any questions, look out for the announcement this afternoon with some news.

510
01:05:39,950 --> 01:05:49,010
But I don't know about that.

511
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:49,620
So.
