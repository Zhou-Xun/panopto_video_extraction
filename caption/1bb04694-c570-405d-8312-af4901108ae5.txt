1
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:07,260
Followed by announcements from anyone.

2
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,110
No announcements. One announcement. Yeah.

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,830
Our last farmstand is today from 12 to 3 outside. It was the last one of the whole season.

4
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:26,080
All right. You want to farm fresh food, right?

5
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:33,320
I think so.

6
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:37,980
So what do you think about the elections? Think about elections and public health.

7
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:51,990
So I was a little nervous this time, speaking as an individual U.S. citizen and not as an employer, but as a human.

8
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:58,310
I was terrified when I saw how many votes Tudor Nixon was giving us.

9
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:05,460
It was much closer than and really shouldn't happen in a sane society.

10
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:13,920
My opinion, not the University of Michigan's opinion. But yeah, I was just like you want but.

11
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:22,130
And then follow through. Also, things are going to look different in the state of Michigan with our state House and Senate.

12
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:28,560
So there's a lot of really important public health legislation that's been sitting

13
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,590
and lost in committee because the Republican leadership has not wanted it to move

14
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:42,659
forward a lot around sexual education and schools and a number of bills that have been

15
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:53,559
introduced to change the way that the state of Michigan does its mandated segment.

16
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:57,060
But it's it's really just focused on HIV prevention.

17
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:03,270
But the way that it's done, it doesn't have to be medically accurate. It doesn't have to be inclusive and always very nice.

18
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:09,239
Also, conversion therapy might actually be the ban on conversion therapy might actually

19
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:14,760
move forward a lot of things around women's sexual health and reproductive rights.

20
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:20,310
So this is a good time to be in public health, at least until another election.

21
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:26,970
So work your asses off for the next two years until we have another election and see what happens.

22
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:36,930
I think nationally too, it was a good election for LGBT two plus candidates.

23
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:42,870
It was a great election for people of color, for young people in Florida.

24
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:47,430
And now have the youngest representative right in the Senate, right?

25
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:54,570
Maxwell Yeah. Maxwell Yeah. Yeah. Also, I think the first Afro-Caribbean member too.

26
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:59,130
So yeah, we'll see. Things will hopefully be different.

27
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:07,050
And I'm not just talking about politics because I like to talk about politics, but as we talked about in this class, we'll be back in other classes.

28
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:14,970
We can do public health without politics. So we rely on the CDC.

29
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,299
We rely on county and state and city health departments for our funding, for participation, for cooperation.

30
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:26,490
So yeah, so go and see.

31
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,929
And I can say go blue. Yeah, no blue. It'll have like multiple meanings and I know that's really cool.

32
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:38,310
I didn't realize I could do that. WJ I typically don't do that, but now I will.

33
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:43,440
Any comments on the election and what this has to do with public health?

34
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:51,280
The people have a sigh of relief or really anxious with duty.

35
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,320
That is cool. That like University of Michigan made national news for how long?

36
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:01,810
Really? I didn't even know that from an MBA. Wow, that was cool.

37
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:07,530
I was actually forced out of town, so I didn't get a chance to see the local stuff.

38
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:14,590
So I was like tapping into the internet all the time to go to all these areas.

39
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:19,750
Wow. Is it gratitude that the governor raised by that point?

40
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:25,710
Yeah. My friend was in line at Pass one and then I know another grad student was there.

41
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:35,320
So to something am. Yeah, that's cool. I think he was the last one to know that I am a little disappointed with my friends in Georgia.

42
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:44,079
At least they'll be run off between or knocked and yeah, I can't even say his name does that.

43
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,980
It gives life to the reality that they got some votes.

44
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,680
And what is going on with Georgia and Stacey Abrams?

45
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,770
I mean, I think she's run for president and get it over with.

46
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:05,440
And, you know, but she didn't do so hard. But there were a lot of other you know, like I said, quote, man,

47
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:11,740
women of color know some of the first trans individuals in positions of power authority.

48
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:15,190
So first lesbian women in high positions.

49
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,759
So yeah, I think things are changing hopefully a little bit.

50
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:24,670
You all are the next generation, so keep voting and keep changing the face of politics.

51
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:33,160
And I can retire somewhere and just sit back and watch the there you go.

52
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,180
And then also I.

53
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:42,280
So last time we talked a lot about communities, remember, and it's been a really long time, so I shouldn't even ask you to visit them.

54
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:47,620
I mean, rich and student years is like ten years.

55
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,400
So especially right now because I know it's getting close to the end this semester.

56
00:05:52,570 --> 00:06:01,070
Before I ask you, what were you remembered? I just remembered something I was going to say is the semester is coming to a close.

57
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:16,660
So anything in this class, our last day of kind of traditional class lecture discussion stuff is before Thanksgiving.

58
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:22,120
And then I think after Thanksgiving is when the presentations start, although I don't like that word presentation.

59
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:29,050
So we're reframing I letting some terror rippling through the audience I want.

60
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:38,170
Yeah again this is this is all about, you know, critical thought changing things up after we come back.

61
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:44,010
And there may be one more luxury thing and then I a number on top of my head.

62
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:51,160
But what we are going to do is have peer feedback sessions.

63
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:58,480
Right. And so it's I want people to get like the whole idea of like presentation out of your head.

64
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:08,799
So the idea of it and the guidelines are in the syllabus and we'll go over those on Tuesday is for you

65
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:16,540
and your group to present what you're doing for your final project and get some feedback from the class.

66
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:18,670
And it's very flexible.

67
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:27,190
You don't have to you know, you can use a PowerPoint, most groups do, but it doesn't have to be all flashy and, you know, fancy and stuff.

68
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:37,060
It must be purple. That's the only requirement. It can be any color you want, but you don't have to.

69
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:42,700
You know, I don't want you to just spend tons of time on making pretty slides unless you really like present.

70
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:49,510
So then go ahead make. It was pretty advanced, but the idea is to really talk to your classmates and get feedback.

71
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:55,450
All right. So and you can do it about any aspect of your final project.

72
00:07:55,450 --> 00:08:03,040
So you could focus the majority of your time on talking about some of the intervention

73
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:07,840
activities that you have planned and get feedback about how to make them more critical.

74
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,330
You could have it when you've been talking with your group members.

75
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:19,270
You may be stuck on some aspect about, well, how do we get this particular population to come in?

76
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:24,130
You could do that. Also, it's your time.

77
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:27,640
I don't know again, the time off the top of my head,

78
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:38,320
but I will on Tuesday and it's all and get all this is written in the assignment but you can break the class up into smaller groups.

79
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:44,050
So if you have three people in a group, you can, you know, cut the class into threes or fours.

80
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:47,429
And have a smaller discussion. Some of you got there.

81
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:51,060
Some of you grew up there. So, I mean, come here. It's whatever you want to do.

82
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:57,330
So I want you to get out of this, like, mindset of traditional, like, presentations where,

83
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:02,130
you know, we're we're looking at how you present and, you know, the material present.

84
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:07,380
You get all the points if you just come up here and you're coherent and you make sense.

85
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,670
Well, those are the same. You'll get all the points, right.

86
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,410
This is not a high pressure thing.

87
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:20,130
Again, you know, part of what we try to do in this class is to make things as reality based and practice based as possible.

88
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:23,640
In the real world, we often get peer reviews.

89
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:28,530
So we create interventions or frameworks for interventions.

90
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:34,020
And then we meet with community members to get feedback or we meet with other colleagues to get feedback.

91
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:42,870
That's what we're mirroring here is this is just a meeting with a bunch of like minded people to get feedback.

92
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:49,899
Any questions about that? Does that sound?

93
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:56,070
Anxiety producing? If you are anxious, that's okay.

94
00:09:56,070 --> 00:10:01,160
It's a human emotion, it's a feeling. But the goal is not anxiety.

95
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:05,220
The goal is actually productivity. So again, don't freak out.

96
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:12,710
You don't have to wear matching outfits. And you know where you're finding clothes again if you want to, you know,

97
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:19,620
if you want to do level sequin outfits and maybe like a gradation of colors or whatever, or do you want to just wear whatever you got?

98
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:24,450
That is fine. All right. Any comments?

99
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:28,080
Also, one last thing. I guess I should have my brain more organized.

100
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:33,330
There are some people who still haven't signed up. I sent an announcement out today.

101
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:36,780
I counted and I forget what the number was.

102
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:41,550
There's only like about 40 people. So we have about 20 people who haven't signed up for a group.

103
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:47,250
So if you haven't done it by midnight tomorrow, we're just going to randomly assign you to a group.

104
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:56,640
And so if you're physically here or you're on the all or you're not listening to this, then you really don't get a choice.

105
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:02,609
But we really do want you to be in groups where you're with other people who want to

106
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:08,010
do similar topics and where you feel like you can have a productive working group.

107
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:15,420
So we really encourage you to pick them. If not again, we'll just we'll sit in a group or something.

108
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:23,399
So that would be helpful if like even if you haven't landed on a topic for groups to start today,

109
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,809
like filling in topics you're considering because I've I have gotten emails from students who are looking

110
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:35,510
for a group based on topic and the gym isn't necessarily completely 100% lining up with the spreadsheet.

111
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:40,500
So it's like you have like a few topics that you're considering if you could just like type those in really fast.

112
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:45,840
That might help me to like help place students in groups that don't have them because there are a few groups that only have like two people.

113
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:53,790
Okay. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, I did see that. I like this one's. Any course is all about the final assignment, about the presentations.

114
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:00,090
Anything like that I feel is still grading your other assignments.

115
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:05,880
So those are taking a little bit of time so you will get those back out.

116
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:10,260
There were a bit time consuming. So, yeah.

117
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:15,050
So you'll get those back? Yeah. All right. Anyone remember I gave you a lot of lead time to look at?

118
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:18,120
You know, you don't remember anything about what we talked about last class.

119
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:22,740
It's like one more thing. Yeah, right. Just like what?

120
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:26,400
How we define community and how it's a privilege to be able to have.

121
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,770
Mm hmm. Yeah, those are two points.

122
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:36,300
And that's like the power systems of, like, power and compassion emerge, like, across communities and also, like, within good.

123
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:41,390
So we just get a lot of counts of.

124
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:49,229
Mm hmm. Yeah. That's a new term I'm going to grab on to.

125
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:58,950
I really like that. It does mean I started the thought process for intersectional communities and then becomes a famous term.

126
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:03,240
I will give you credit. Anyone else remember anything?

127
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:13,940
And I was just kind of mentioning like we talked about how certain individuals often have the privilege to create their own communities,

128
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:20,780
while other times individuals are going through hardships or are forced into like constructing communities.

129
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:28,370
Yeah. And then sometimes people are just labeled in thinking, right? I mean, you may not even get to choose at all.

130
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:32,660
You may not even have what you would consider a shared experience, but some external work,

131
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:37,580
the power and privilege is assigning you into whether you like it or not.

132
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:46,330
And the other thing to remember. Nothing else because you did a great job.

133
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:51,709
I mean, we really had a great discussion. I know it was like 10 minutes at the end and only gotten to the first.

134
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:58,560
I hadn't even gotten to the first line. And also, the community can be advantageous or disadvantageous because.

135
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:04,790
Do you mind, say, a little bit more of like if you're forced into a certain community,

136
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:09,500
how like detaching yourself from that certain identity might be advantageous depending on the individual.

137
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:15,350
Right. Yeah. And I think, you know, one thing that that touches on, too, and other comments is that, you know,

138
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:20,480
communities can have different meanings to different people at different times, under different circumstances.

139
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:24,290
So it's not just like monolithic kind of thing that we all agree on.

140
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:29,270
It's something that can take different forms and shapes from how we can use.

141
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:39,000
Like in public health, we can use communities to like use to execute interventions remotely.

142
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:41,030
Like if you know a lot of certain communities, yeah,

143
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:48,200
we can be more advantageous in making sure that they understand, like the intervention you're trying to get across.

144
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:56,180
Right. Yeah. And if we, you know, if we're not working with and on behalf of communities, we're we're just wasting a lot of our effort.

145
00:14:56,270 --> 00:15:04,249
Right. And and a lot of true public health work is really done in the communities in different ways.

146
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:08,960
And that can look differently. I mean, it can be a physical community, a virtual community, an affinity community,

147
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,030
you know, all these different a shared interests community, all these different things.

148
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:17,870
But, you know, as humans, we are social beings.

149
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:22,610
So we we want to gravitate toward other people in different ways.

150
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:29,960
And it just makes sense then that if you're trying to change behaviors or change thoughts or change attitudes,

151
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:34,340
you're going to be more influenced by people who are like you in some way.

152
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:39,530
Right. So that's one of the advantages of community is also if we're talking about things

153
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:43,040
like communities where you have a lot of contact with other people in that community,

154
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:48,810
those are constant reinforcers of behavior change or positive behaviors.

155
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:56,360
So sometimes it's through modeling and not like America's Next Top model, but some data and myself there.

156
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:04,700
But modeling like if I'm showing, you know, healthy exercise behavior, other people might be like, oh, look,

157
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:12,410
you know, Gary's walking to work and then Akeelah starts to walk to work and, you know, it kind of catches on.

158
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:21,920
So that's the other benefit of communities, too, is there's a social reinforcement modeling and just social support, right?

159
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,440
If you're, you know, how many times have you look.

160
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:32,419
Well, I know some people try to, like start working out again after not working out and you know, like, yeah, I'm going really go to the gym.

161
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:35,750
But if you're like, Hey, I'm going to meet you at the gym or come pick me up.

162
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:40,130
You're more likely to go. We're doing. What's the benefit of things like social work?

163
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:44,840
All right, excellent. Anything else? All right.

164
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:51,290
So we want to talk a little bit about community capacity building and capacity sharing.

165
00:16:52,220 --> 00:17:00,350
And it's just been in the past couple of years, I guess a year, maybe a year and a half, two years that I've started using the term capacity sharing.

166
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:12,110
What what do you think is a benefit of using that term capacity building, either along with or in place of capacity building?

167
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:20,110
Yeah. So oftentimes when we talk about capacity and our workloads,

168
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:31,660
it kind of refers to the amount of like work or things that we're involved in or have to do on a GAAP basis and by capacity building and sharing.

169
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:45,100
Like attacking different kind of like like resources and so on and so forth amongst like a large portion rather than having the burden of office,

170
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:50,050
especially on to like those who may not have positions. Okay.

171
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:54,560
One aspect. What else? And that's.

172
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:59,080
It's a little bit different than this, but that also makes a ton of sense to some.

173
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,710
And I especially when we're looking at kind of like you said, like workload distribution,

174
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:08,350
you know, and sharing responsibility, I'll just jump right in.

175
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:14,620
So typically when we're talking about capacity building in terms of community public health,

176
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:19,870
we're talking about people who have more power and privilege going into a place

177
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,590
where people don't have that power and privilege and giving them new skills.

178
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:28,059
Right. So if you're working with, let's say,

179
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:35,530
a low income community in the U.P. and they don't really have many skills

180
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:41,770
around positive coping or adaptive coping behaviors related to mental health.

181
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:46,719
And you teach them about here's know difference between adaptive and maladaptive and

182
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:54,680
here's ways that you can deal with stress that's often seen as doing capacity building.

183
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:59,610
You're going in and you're building people's capacity to be able to be healthier.

184
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:09,850
And what might be a challenge with that approach being really super vague and that's okay if you're like, What the [INAUDIBLE] are you talking about?

185
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,340
What's a concern with that approach?

186
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:22,000
Let's say Akeelah goes to the U.P. cause she's a mental health expert and she is training groups of young people and positive mental health.

187
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:29,560
In the back. We'll just go down the road. Yeah. First thing I thought about was like, maybe people aren't.

188
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:35,980
I mean, like, they're educated on the topic. They're not educated on like the community that they're going to.

189
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:43,059
So it could be a little damaging to not have a true perspective on like the the needs

190
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:47,980
and or just desires or opinions or values of the community that you're working with.

191
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:54,639
Okay. And also, I think a lot of the time, like Savior Complex comes into this, they can play a major role.

192
00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:00,400
And like so it's you have to be very critical of how, you know, I think.

193
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:02,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

194
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:10,780
I was going to say, like, it can come off as like condescending and very kind of like lecture, kind of like, you know, everything you don't.

195
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,550
And especially when like a lot of people like, like in the mental health example,

196
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:21,550
like a lot of people know sometimes that their coping mechanisms aren't healthy and it's not

197
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:25,930
necessarily helpful to just tell them you're doing something wrong when they already know that.

198
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:28,120
Right. Yeah. Yeah. Both excellent points.

199
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:36,610
And you know, often when we're when we are doing capacity building, I mean, you know, you brought up the point both of you touched on the point that,

200
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:41,589
you know, whatever you do needs to be something the community wants and needs and that it's action oriented.

201
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:44,470
It's just not, oh, you're, you know, you're screwing up.

202
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:55,600
But the the thing that can be damaging at times is, you know, one, we need to make sure they actually want it and needed.

203
00:20:55,780 --> 00:21:02,620
We need to make sure it's culturally appropriate, all those things. But the with the savior complex aspect,

204
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:10,359
it can become this hierarchical structure where again you're taking people who are already being minoritized and feeling oppressed,

205
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:15,759
are experiencing some. And then and when you're doing okay, I'm going to build your capacity.

206
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:20,380
That again is hierarchical and saying, I'm coming in, I'm going to build it for you.

207
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:31,090
So because of that, especially in really capacity sharing is starting to take traction in the global and global public health communities

208
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:38,680
because we often talk about high income countries coming into low and middle income countries and building capacity.

209
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:44,140
And so it is presented as if it's only a one way street, right?

210
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:48,190
So of a high income, um, institution,

211
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:54,819
organization person is coming in and then they're the ones that are giving all the

212
00:21:54,820 --> 00:22:00,430
benefit and capacity sharing is really recognizing that it can be a two way street.

213
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:06,270
So even if I have more resources around, say, mental health promotion,

214
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:13,690
the community has all the expertise around their community, then of all the expertise around what works and what doesn't work.

215
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:20,800
And oftentimes when we go into different communities, especially other global communities.

216
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:31,690
By using a US framework, the community may not be seen to be functioning at a level that we would be comfortable with,

217
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,770
but they may be doing pretty damn well and be really, really happy.

218
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:38,650
And so we have to be careful not to mess with that.

219
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:49,210
There's even a term that's used in some global health arenas, which kind of makes me sick to my stomach when I hear it is reverse innovation.

220
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:52,150
And what reverse innovation is,

221
00:22:52,300 --> 00:23:00,850
is when you go to typically a lower middle income country and you take some kind of intervention that they're doing there,

222
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:04,390
and then you translate it into a U.S. context.

223
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:09,670
And so what that I mean, the fact it's called reverse innovation.

224
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:16,630
So it's again, the hierarchy that anything that we create is innovative and we're giving it to you,

225
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:20,830
but you create something and then we're utilizing that.

226
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:30,370
It's a reverse innovation. So, you know, there's a lot of problematic public health work in the global arena, and that could be a whole other glass.

227
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:34,000
But and there's one but I don't know how much they're critical.

228
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:37,479
But you know, again, even in the US context,

229
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:44,680
we have to be really careful when we're talking about capacity building that we're not getting too much into that savior complex and

230
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:53,050
too much into that hierarchy where it's like we hold all the knowledge and you should be happy that we're even here to work with you.

231
00:23:53,890 --> 00:24:06,100
So when do you think capacity building? I mean, we had a little bit of how when could capacity building be dangerous in some communities?

232
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:11,730
When could it be actually dangerous and have potential adaptogenic effects?

233
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:15,090
The big fancy $25 word. Yeah.

234
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:20,980
I mean, I think like maybe when it becomes a burden on the community themselves to like develop all these

235
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:26,379
new skills and stuff or like the when people come in and try to like building capacity and stuff,

236
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:30,010
like if that is like totally different than their normal lifestyle,

237
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:37,300
I feel like I'm going to probably tack on some stress or have like negative side effects.

238
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:44,919
Yeah. No, that's totally true. With, I know a study that one of my doctoral students worked on with us.

239
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:52,480
Back when I was at DePaul, we interviewed 14 people from 14 different community coalitions where they were doing capacity.

240
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,000
It was really more capacity building and sharing work.

241
00:24:55,390 --> 00:25:00,910
And when she interviewed all the people that were engaged in the community, some are like, I don't have time for all of it.

242
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,879
You know, I don't I don't want to do this, you know.

243
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:13,360
And sometimes people in an effort to be more reciprocal will be like, okay, we want to have shared leadership, shared ownership.

244
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:19,690
And that they're like, we don't have time. So if you want to come in and do something for us and get out, that's cool.

245
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:23,110
But we don't have the time and resources to start a whole new project.

246
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:31,930
So we have to really again, if we have that good communication with communities and we're really have them at the table, we won't get to that point.

247
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:38,710
What might be another way that capacity building could be detrimental or have negative effects?

248
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:51,389
Enjoy the quiet. Yeah, I was trying to think of an example, but I couldn't really off the top of my head.

249
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:59,670
But what I'm thinking is like, if there's kind of like a dominant narrative push throughout either the public health field or like a health field,

250
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:02,820
and then you go into a community which values completely different things.

251
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:08,489
The first thing that came to mind and this is just like a what just my first thought was like a lot of Native

252
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:15,389
American communities are kind of autonomous or like have strong communities that don't focus too much on the outside,

253
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:20,610
like values or dominant narrative. So like if you go in there and try and push a dominant narrative of health,

254
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:25,590
I don't know what like I don't know what it would be, but if you're trying to push certain dominant narratives,

255
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:35,880
they I think it probably wouldn't get a strong reception and also can be damaging by like overlooking their like beliefs and things such as that.

256
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,969
Yeah. And that's really an issue too again.

257
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:47,670
And different I think more closed communities and also in global communities to when you start to see generational differences.

258
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:53,010
So it's a newer generation if you're coming in and you know, kind of saying this is how you should do it,

259
00:26:53,010 --> 00:27:00,209
this how you do and and you're making it, you know, kind of all like this is attractive, this is innovative.

260
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:05,730
All this stuff that you can start putting up against cultural norms with the elders and other people.

261
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:14,100
And I definitely see that in global work where, you know, because of the Internet, because of social media, because of all this exposure,

262
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:22,889
some families and communities are really struggling because the younger generations are taking on different values,

263
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:28,080
like you said, and they're kind of losing touch with the traditional values.

264
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,720
And so that can have actually really dangerous long term negative effects, you know,

265
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:39,990
because you start to see a crumbling of the traditional culture that that kept some communities together.

266
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:44,930
Good. What else? Anything else? Right. Um, maybe.

267
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:57,870
Like, what is it like trying to act like whatever capacity you're trying to build and basically try and that is still is the correct way.

268
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:03,750
Right, exactly. This, um, like medicine, western like health.

269
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:12,600
A lot of people try to sweep out traditional, traditional practices of medicine which were practices, public health,

270
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:22,890
um, and try to like invalidate the really harmful because it kind of like got relationship building right.

271
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,990
Yeah. And that's an excellent point.

272
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:32,580
And you know, if you think about a lot of kind of cultures that have been around for a very long time, it's worked for a long time.

273
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:36,510
So, you know, I remember back when I was doing clinical work when I was younger,

274
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:40,589
I had a good supervisor who would say, you know, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.

275
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:46,920
So, you know, even if it's something that you don't think is the appropriate or proper way to do it,

276
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:51,420
if it's working and people are healthy and people are happy, you know, step back.

277
00:28:51,600 --> 00:29:00,590
It's not your job to do. I mean, I always think about with like if you think about like Chinese herbs and Chinese medicine, you know,

278
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:07,860
it's a different Eastern conceptualizations of health and the body and things that are very different than Western.

279
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:15,240
And, you know, a lot of cultures have been around much longer than U.S. culture, and people are alive and live a long time.

280
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:20,850
So there must be something, you know, going on just because we don't with our Western lands,

281
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:26,970
because we don't understand it or we can't prove it doesn't mean that it's wrong.

282
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:31,920
You know, I remember years ago I went to a acupuncturist and it was kind of cool because he was

283
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:39,030
trained first as a microbiologist and then became an acupuncturist and herbalist.

284
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:43,350
And so he would explain things from both a western and Eastern perspective.

285
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:47,460
And it was just very interesting to see, you know, the differences.

286
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:53,879
And there's a lot of, you know, journals that you won't see in our, you know, library system,

287
00:29:53,880 --> 00:30:03,060
but journals with more Eastern kind of health and medical approaches that have done randomized controlled trials of different types of,

288
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:08,219
you know, acupuncture and herbs and things like that that are just as effective.

289
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:18,660
So, yeah, so we have to be careful not to push our Western health values over any other ways in which capacity building attempts could backfire,

290
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:25,440
either not work or even worse, do it yet. And I think that like if a community has had.

291
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:35,120
In the past. It was a remarkable experience.

292
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:45,550
I think that. Yeah. Mm hmm.

293
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:50,280
Like, create reparations and. Like overcome that.

294
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:56,719
That some intervention might not even. Yeah, yeah.

295
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,320
Excellent point. I think, you know, we have to be very aware of historical trauma.

296
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:06,680
And, you know, the public health system has has done some really [INAUDIBLE] things in the past to different communities.

297
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:11,520
And if we come in, like you said, and we're just we're you know, we pretend like our pretend,

298
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,870
but we're oblivious to those or we're like, oh, well, that wasn't me.

299
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:22,970
That was those people. You know, the historical trauma lives within communities and it can come out in different ways.

300
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:29,600
And so not acknowledging it is just really it's kind of has a double whammy because one,

301
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:37,010
it basically says, well, you know, your history of trauma isn't important enough for me to consider.

302
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:42,679
And some people will also see it as that you're just ignoring it, ah,

303
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:47,980
pretending like it never existed, you know, just kind of erasing that erasure can be more dangerous.

304
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:50,870
Yeah. And then. Yes, you know, just to add on to that, too,

305
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:56,940
like some people in certain communities to have more trust when it comes to capacity building

306
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:03,890
or others may not like a divide within the actual community over like what type of resource,

307
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:12,379
what type of help do are we going to accept together if people are like arguing over, you know, yeah, that's a really good point.

308
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:17,209
And I think, you know, again, you know, we talk a lot about what, you know, how we define those communities.

309
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:22,040
And so if we do have a community that starts to get divided, then that puts them at risk for other things, too.

310
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:22,870
So, you know,

311
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:31,340
you may have come in with like this health issue around healthy eating and you create some divides and they're they may be more vulnerable to attacks,

312
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:38,690
you know, related to others. Something that I thought about was like exploitation and the like the nonprofit sectors,

313
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:44,720
like taking pictures of like young children and using that as a way to market for their organization.

314
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:50,540
Whereas like a lot of these kids, either they get consent because they don't understand or whatever,

315
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:58,820
but like or the opposite is like they've moved on and they don't want their picture on them or just not getting consent at all.

316
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:03,260
Yeah, I think like, although the intention might be to like, you know, use like,

317
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:09,200
like the ethos pathos whenever, like trying to get people to kind of like donate and whatever.

318
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,580
I just think that like.

319
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:20,080
Now understanding that that community might not want that or those people, individuals in general might not want to just be all over like that.

320
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:22,540
Yeah. Yeah. That's a really good point.

321
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:28,480
And I think that, you know, unfortunately, there are a lot of nonprofits and even universities, you know, do this too well.

322
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:34,899
Universities and primarily state ones are nonprofit organizations, too.

323
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:38,379
But they'll, you know, take pictures of black and brown children.

324
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:42,130
And that just further supports this, you know,

325
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:47,200
kind of narrative where there's the big white savior that's going to come in and help these poor little children.

326
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,429
And and and you're right.

327
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:55,510
I mean, I've been in a lot of global situations where, you know, they'll want their picture taken, you know, because that's kind of cool.

328
00:33:56,980 --> 00:34:03,970
You know, what we do is will offer to take their picture alone and then development and bring it and frame it and give it to them.

329
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:10,480
But we won't take pictures with ourselves unless it's like a family or people we work with.

330
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:18,580
I know for a while, a long time, and I used to always come back after a trip with like a suitcase full of framed pictures,

331
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:24,680
because for a lot of families that was cool or something they couldn't access, especially in really rural places.

332
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:31,599
But yeah, there are there's just a lot of exploitation when it comes to global work and even us work.

333
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:38,169
I mean, you know, I get really sick of saying like, Oh, we're going to help poor black kids in Detroit.

334
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:42,670
And, you know, they show the paint, chipping off the wall and all this other kind of crap.

335
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:51,580
And then people, you know, people who aren't aware, look at that and they're like, oh, my God, you know, it must be so terrible there.

336
00:34:52,780 --> 00:35:01,360
Yeah, it's it's interesting. Yeah. I just then and so it goes again, which was really scary around election time in some parts of Missouri.

337
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:13,089
I left. When I left, there were several people with hunting rifles who had been at polling sites with their rifles.

338
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:16,360
Yeah, which was a little frightening. But anyway.

339
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:25,450
But, you know, when I tell people, you know, where I live and, you know, near Detroit, I go, oh, that's really dangerous.

340
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:28,479
Like I but I mean, like weapons are really dangerous.

341
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:34,540
And then like, I used to live in Oakland, California, and you're Oh my God, how did you live in Oakland?

342
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:40,000
So, like, I got up every day breakfast, you know, it's just a city.

343
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:52,750
But people have those misconceptions and they are often really supported by these attempts to kind of help people by showing these really tragic,

344
00:35:52,870 --> 00:36:00,610
you know, kind of situation. And they don't show all the extremely bright, you know, innovative, powerful people in those situations.

345
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:06,100
Excellent. Any other ways in which our. Well, we try and help. We hurt.

346
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:13,900
Your new friends? We hope so.

347
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:27,439
So this reading is part of there's a series of texts on trying to take like critical pedagogy approaches

348
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:33,979
to different concepts in both public health and social justice and and every kind of different fields.

349
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:45,470
And so with this in the Smith article, they read chapter, they talk about different kind of philosophical reasons for capacity building.

350
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:52,250
And know, when I read this stuff, I mean, I still always read a certain critical lens,

351
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:58,760
even though some of what they say they're critical is I yes, these could be forms of capacity building.

352
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:03,430
But we have to think about why are we doing this in a why?

353
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:08,270
Why do we feel like we need to build someone's capacity? Are they asking for capacity?

354
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:17,270
All those other things. So, I mean, one type of capacity is relational capacity where you're, you know,

355
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:31,340
you're building or helping to build those or you want to help build or be active in the process of building more relation.

356
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:36,650
This I also talk about making sure the capacity building is inclusive.

357
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:46,729
So when you're doing capacity building, capacity sharing work, making sure that you're including people from all parts of the sector.

358
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:53,300
So if it's a physical community, then it's participative, socially just and sustainable.

359
00:37:53,310 --> 00:38:02,030
So we're, we're thinking about doing capacity building in a more community centered and socially just way.

360
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:09,290
These are some of the recommendations that are offered for, you know, thinking about that.

361
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:17,120
The one that I try to think about all the time is the sustainable the sustainability aspect.

362
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:26,660
Because so many times when we go into communities and we're trying to work with them and even if it's participative and inclusive and socially just,

363
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:33,170
we may help to co-create things that are just not sustainable.

364
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:42,050
And I see this happening a lot when people have big grants that run out after three years or five years.

365
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:52,040
And again, I see this a lot in the global arena when I was in done work over the years and Haiti.

366
00:38:52,310 --> 00:39:00,680
And it's just it makes me so sad when I go to different parts of the country because you see tons

367
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:08,430
of abandoned buildings that were started by nonprofit organizations that did not try and well,

368
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:11,480
they might have tried, but they were not successful in sustainability.

369
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:20,240
And you'll just see the structure after structure after structure that have been I mean, years and years of this has happened in Haiti.

370
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:25,700
So it's kind of sad to see that lack of sustainability.

371
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:31,250
And this is, I think, another I know, Yasmin, you brought up about like the nonprofit world.

372
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:35,389
I mean, when we look at a lot of places like again, as a country, you know,

373
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:41,570
Haiti probably has more nonprofits working at it than than most small countries.

374
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:53,000
And the more you have, I think when you get that such a high number of them and they're not really working together or working towards sustainability,

375
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:57,610
I think you end up doing more danger than than good. Yeah.

376
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,450
Well I also wanted to add to that how important the sustainability is,

377
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:10,069
but also how important it is to, you know, work so well and so like integrated within communities.

378
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:21,590
Because to give an example of this, like in my mom's school district, they had this program for young black male youth and it was funded by a grant.

379
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:28,490
And that grant was and it was really successful for like five years. And then the grant was taken away or maybe ran out, not taken away.

380
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:36,980
But the community was so engaged in this program that like they had so many like business leaders and just like different community leaders,

381
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:41,840
like all black men who were just like really engaged and wanted to keep the program going.

382
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:47,809
So they, like, funded it, you know, and then they were like continue to stay involved and engaged in it.

383
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:57,980
And so I think that's also why it's so important to really engage community in your programing, because it really build not only build that capacity,

384
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:05,600
but really share that capacity within the community so that it can be sustainable without like funding that was previously done.

385
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:10,270
So it can be done, but I feel like it's really. Rare. Yeah, we're sure it is.

386
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:16,410
And you really have to think about sustainability, not at the end of the ground, but at the beginning of the middle of the ground.

387
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:25,150
So, you know, if you have a five year brand year, too, you need to be thinking about sustainability because it may take a couple of years.

388
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:30,680
Let's say you do have to get you know, members of the community rallied around fundraising or commitment.

389
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:39,550
You have to start that early event because you can apply for grants and you don't get a, you know, funding changes.

390
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:48,920
Like we have a center here and an HPC center for racial health equity crash.

391
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:57,700
Anyway, it's got a lot of and there's too many, too many acronyms. But, you know, it was fully funded for many, many years.

392
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:02,520
And a couple of years ago, NIH changed the way that they were funding.

393
00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:10,899
And under this funding mechanism and we no longer have that funding source, then we've tried to write new grants,

394
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:18,160
but sometimes the federal government changes the way they want to do certain things and there was nothing else left.

395
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:23,319
So it's been kept alive in some ways through different structures.

396
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:28,550
But it was one of those things where, you know, there were multiple attempts to still get funding.

397
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:36,010
And sometimes you have to think about alternate ways like, you know, again, turning ownership over to different entities or to different groups.

398
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:47,930
So when we think about relational community building, this is from Brandon, one of the other readings.

399
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:54,319
We want to make sure that things are done in an integrated way again and we feel like we talk about this a lot,

400
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:57,860
but we need to always make sure that we're integrating different viewpoints.

401
00:42:57,860 --> 00:43:06,780
We're integrating the community and the relational community capacity sorts of questions about how the most excluded can be included.

402
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:14,000
So again, how do we bring people in and acknowledges and allows for a plethora of ideas and strategies among groups?

403
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:22,250
And that can be tough when you have different groups who are part of a community that may not always see eye to eye, and it can be really challenging.

404
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:28,520
So we were doing a project that I work with in Chicago years and years ago.

405
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:37,129
We were trying to bring mental health services into public housing in the city of Chicago, because if you wanted mental health services,

406
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:43,370
you typically had to think like multiple busses or trains in order to get to anywhere with the services.

407
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:49,910
So what we did as we brought mental health services to the public housing developments and created offices within them.

408
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:57,860
Now, not everyone in and some of our public housing communities agreed with the approaches.

409
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:04,250
Some people there's still a lot of stigma around mental health meant what it was, what treatment was like.

410
00:44:04,490 --> 00:44:09,319
And so we spent a lot of time in community meeting after community meeting after

411
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:15,560
community meeting and trying to come to some consensus about how to do certain things.

412
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:19,880
Because some people are like, No, that's not how we do it here.

413
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:23,479
We were working in the Cabrini-Green public housing development.

414
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:29,330
If anyone's from Chicago or if you saw Candyman, that's where that was based.

415
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:35,330
You know, Cabrini-Green was a public housing development in Chicago that was there for a very long time.

416
00:44:35,330 --> 00:44:41,540
And so there were different communities created, depending on if you were in a high rise or low rise,

417
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:47,899
if you were what were called the the reds or the whites, which were the color of different buildings and things like that.

418
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:54,110
And so trying to get these groups together to agree was was not easy.

419
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,389
But it really,

420
00:44:56,390 --> 00:45:05,660
if you're going to be working to try to create something again sustainable and this program until the public housing developments were torn down

421
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:15,260
was still functioning because it was being we were able to get funding from the Department of Mental Health and it was all community owned.

422
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:17,120
And then we were just near the end.

423
00:45:17,390 --> 00:45:28,100
And the support of and the role of supporting and promoting, not delivering that also foregrounds historical oppression.

424
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:38,780
So I know what you were talking about in terms of like being aware of that historical trauma and also position solutions as everyone's problems.

425
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:43,670
You know, I don't like that word solution because there really isn't a solution to anything.

426
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:53,500
You know, we're never going to solve. Poverty are solved and maybe I'll be dead, but I don't know.

427
00:45:53,510 --> 00:46:05,240
Frame 158 years old and I doubt it.

428
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:09,200
So how can community capacity be detrimental?

429
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:13,100
Again, what do you have to think about? What is capacity?

430
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:20,030
You know, again, for one community, something that's seen as capacity, maybe a burden like you talked about to another.

431
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:28,310
You know, one community may be like, yes, we want to be able to know how to do program evaluation so we can write grants and get more funding.

432
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:31,879
Another community might be like, this is just so much extra [INAUDIBLE].

433
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:36,470
We don't have time. I don't want to fill out a pre and post survey, you know, I don't want to, you know,

434
00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:43,520
an Excel spreadsheet where you can show me what the difference is where another community might get all heated up about that,

435
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:49,190
who defines capacity, who needs and also the capacity to do what.

436
00:46:50,210 --> 00:46:56,540
And then sometimes in public health, we have an idea of what a community needs or what kind of capacity they may need,

437
00:46:56,690 --> 00:46:59,750
and it may be something totally, totally different than what they need.

438
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:12,240
So, you know, this is something that with a research project I have in Kenya, we're doing this right now where we have a community.

439
00:47:13,010 --> 00:47:16,339
So it's a community development team.

440
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:20,209
So we're working on issues of mental health for gay men.

441
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:24,740
And so we have representatives from ten different community organizations,

442
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:30,830
and all the leaders are all gay and bisexual men who run or work in these organizations.

443
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:36,770
And so what we're doing is and this has nothing to do with the research project, but we're doing.

444
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:41,460
Because we feel like ethically will contribute. We're asking them, how can we help you?

445
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:47,530
So they get paid to be part of the project. They get paid for every meeting we give them transport, things like that.

446
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:52,580
But we also want to make sure that when the project's over, the community is in better shape than when we came in.

447
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:56,420
And so we're in this process now of asking them, What do you want?

448
00:47:56,660 --> 00:48:04,750
What do you need? And so then we're developing individual development plans.

449
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:07,820
We're not using the term capacity we're talking about in terms of development.

450
00:48:08,060 --> 00:48:14,480
And so with every organization, we're going to help support whatever kind of development they want.

451
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:21,160
So someone program about someone intervention development, someone grant writing.

452
00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:27,410
And so we're really letting them define what it is, also whose interests are being served when people's capacities are built.

453
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:34,670
Is it to just take another picture and put on your website and, you know, show, oh, look at this fancy school that we built.

454
00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:41,300
I was going to share a story about Oprah and fancy schools, but I'm not a big fan of Oprah.

455
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:42,710
Another story, another day.

456
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:52,130
But I want also who determines the process with what it facts and then who evaluates and ascertains that capacity has actually been achieved.

457
00:48:52,970 --> 00:49:00,890
So I'm going to jump into the next set of slides because next class is going to be all Akeelah you're supposed to say.

458
00:49:01,950 --> 00:49:10,770
Yeah, I don't want to buy it is your opinion.

459
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:20,180
But so for the rest of class, we're going to talk about community engagement, collaborative partnerships and participatory approaches.

460
00:49:20,930 --> 00:49:30,950
Just to quote again in alignment, celebration of Native American American Indian History Month.

461
00:49:32,210 --> 00:49:35,570
Here's one. Tell me, tell me and I'll forget.

462
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:40,130
Show me. And I may not remember. Involve me and I'll understand.

463
00:49:40,370 --> 00:49:43,610
So again, talking about the importance of engagement and involvement.

464
00:49:43,970 --> 00:49:50,630
And then an Apache quote, It is better to have less thunder in the mouth and more lightning in the hands.

465
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:54,170
I really like that one because a lot of people have thunder in the mouth. I'm sure.

466
00:49:54,170 --> 00:49:58,330
You bet. A lot of thunder is just now is.

467
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:01,440
But you can have both.

468
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:10,340
I think sometimes I have a little thunder in my mouth and I try and connected with lightning in my hands that you really think about it.

469
00:50:12,590 --> 00:50:21,799
So this is, again, one of the parts of class where I'm going to be talking about work that my team that I work with have done where I was again,

470
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:25,310
feel weird reciting my own writings.

471
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:31,850
But we're going to talk about is like the benefits of collaborative community based partnership.

472
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:35,990
So we talked a lot about, you know, working with the community, involving community.

473
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:45,140
This is going to talk more specifically about working with primarily nonprofit organizations and community organizing community groups.

474
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:50,450
All right. Because that's a it is a bit of a different process than kind of working with the general community and individuals.

475
00:50:50,990 --> 00:50:58,400
But there's a lot of work, I think, in public health where people are working with community based organizations or nonprofits.

476
00:50:58,410 --> 00:51:01,459
So a lot of work is happening in CPR.

477
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:11,540
Community based participatory research happens when universities are interfacing with nonprofit organizations in the global arena.

478
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:15,620
We often talk about them as NGOs, non-governmental organizations,

479
00:51:15,950 --> 00:51:25,700
and then in some places they may be considered civil society organizations or CSOs, the whole different range CBOs community based organizations.

480
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:29,629
But basically they're entities anonymous.

481
00:51:29,630 --> 00:51:38,590
I mean, how do I do that? I maybe I was unhappy and I have to feed it.

482
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:45,830
But there's there's different ways that nonprofits or organizations can look.

483
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:52,399
Also, there are huge differences in the sizes of nonprofit organizations.

484
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:56,030
So I know when I was working in Chicago,

485
00:51:56,390 --> 00:52:02,000
there's some nonprofit organizations or community based organizations that are really the size of a corporation,

486
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:07,450
you know, and they've got, you know, multiple buildings and, you know, lots of resources.

487
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:13,610
So when we're talking about working with community based organizations or nonprofit organizations,

488
00:52:14,450 --> 00:52:19,730
it's also important to see what type and what size of organizations you're working with.

489
00:52:21,290 --> 00:52:29,330
Because, again, some are really almost like their own mini academic institution because they can be really big.

490
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:33,860
So I think and well, I should put this slide away.

491
00:52:34,790 --> 00:52:39,490
Why? Why would it be important? To work specifically with nonprofit organizations.

492
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:43,209
So we're talking about working with communities in general, which includes nonprofits.

493
00:52:43,210 --> 00:52:49,670
But why? Why are public health professionals? Is it important to work directly with organizations?

494
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:59,860
Nonprofit CBOs Yeah. I think at the beginning you talk about how power and money oftentimes influence the work right now.

495
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:09,580
So I guess because nonprofits, I don't know, I think money plays a different role that that's a good avenue to kind of serve communities.

496
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:14,710
Yeah, the focus isn't trying to gain a lot of profit, right? Exactly right.

497
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:24,970
Yeah. What else does it mean? I think also, just like knowing that how whether it be like, for example, that somebody wants to donate like,

498
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:31,710
I don't know, like 5000 chairs, what sort of area or what specific region will need 5000 chairs?

499
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:38,500
Obviously, you know, there's certain areas that are not going to see that as of importance also.

500
00:53:38,830 --> 00:53:48,010
For example, like when I was working, I remember that in Afghanistan when the US decided to leave.

501
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:56,620
The only way for UNICEF to like be in Afghanistan at that point was to actually work with.

502
00:53:57,530 --> 00:54:03,710
That working with the organizations that were prohibiting them to be there in the first place.

503
00:54:04,190 --> 00:54:09,980
Not a lot of times nonprofit organizations have to work even with the enemy in order to stay there.

504
00:54:10,190 --> 00:54:17,479
And so I think that having that average with nonprofit is super important because you

505
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:22,210
can't just go into a territory and expecting to be able to just make a change like that.

506
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:25,670
You have to have an organization doing that. Yeah.

507
00:54:25,670 --> 00:54:28,850
And I think again, in the global arena, that's a really good point too.

508
00:54:28,850 --> 00:54:35,810
When you're working with non-governmental organizations or nonprofits, you don't have the same restrictions that governmental organizations do.

509
00:54:36,170 --> 00:54:40,490
Like, for instance, the US government will not negotiate with terrorists.

510
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:50,300
An NGO can negotiate with terrorists. The US government will not pay ransom if someone is held hostage.

511
00:54:50,750 --> 00:54:53,120
Nonprofits can do that.

512
00:54:53,480 --> 00:55:02,450
So when you don't have and again, it depends because in the global arena and in the US, if you're a nonprofit, you're usually a registered 501c3.

513
00:55:02,450 --> 00:55:05,720
So it's a government designation. So you don't pay taxes.

514
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:12,850
You know, you have all these other benefits, but you still have a tie to the government because you're registered with the government.

515
00:55:12,860 --> 00:55:19,460
So you still if you're a registered 523, you still have some governmental regulations and the global arena.

516
00:55:19,610 --> 00:55:22,880
A lot of times, if you're an NGO, you don't have.

517
00:55:23,270 --> 00:55:25,849
Well, again, it varies tremendously country to country.

518
00:55:25,850 --> 00:55:33,140
But there may be some kind of registration process, but you don't have the same governmental controls.

519
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:39,320
And you're absolutely right. I mean, I have a friend who does really amazing work in Somalia.

520
00:55:39,650 --> 00:55:46,700
And sometimes she has to deal with, you know, al-Shabab and some of the other terrorist groups.

521
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:51,499
It just is the reality. When she was working on behalf of the government, she couldn't do that.

522
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:57,110
If she did, she wouldn't be. She's Kenyan. She wasn't would be allowed back in the US.

523
00:55:58,550 --> 00:56:04,250
So when she switched organizations and had a different affiliation, then she could and she could still enter the US.

524
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:07,370
That's crazy. Just wanted to add one more thing.

525
00:56:07,370 --> 00:56:15,470
So I like one thing that I noticed too was that like for any issues that came up like during, like, I don't know, like for example,

526
00:56:16,490 --> 00:56:19,309
any sort of controversial politics which I don't want to get into,

527
00:56:19,310 --> 00:56:24,000
but like anything like that, like they couldn't really take a stance on their viewpoint.

528
00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:25,880
So because they have to remain apolitical,

529
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:32,060
which I think is like and although like there's sometimes like you'll see like some sort of narrative being discussed,

530
00:56:33,710 --> 00:56:39,050
you know, I think that's what made it okay for them to collaborate with the Taliban,

531
00:56:39,050 --> 00:56:42,050
because at that point, it's not politics that are coming in between.

532
00:56:42,050 --> 00:56:45,560
It's like a human life. Yeah, that's a good point.

533
00:56:45,830 --> 00:56:54,290
And here in the U.S., if you're a registered by the 1c3, you cannot use your funding for political purposes.

534
00:56:54,290 --> 00:56:59,689
You have to have a separate arm. That is, it's under another registration.

535
00:56:59,690 --> 00:57:05,280
I can't remember the code, but that's why I like is the University of Michigan is a Bible one,

536
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:13,519
two, three or a nonprofit organization, which cracks me up about how much is our war machine.

537
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:16,670
And, you know, it's really nonprofit.

538
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:24,260
But anyway, football is a big football, but I realize I would say professional wrestling.

539
00:57:24,740 --> 00:57:32,270
But but with yeah, with the university, we can't say certain things and offer political views.

540
00:57:32,270 --> 00:57:35,870
That's why I was talking on behalf of myself as a U.S. citizen.

541
00:57:36,740 --> 00:57:40,160
And when I make certain statements, there's like in the political work that I do,

542
00:57:41,090 --> 00:57:49,490
I have to always identify that I'm making this statement as an independent U.S. citizen, not in connection with the University of Michigan.

543
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:56,149
And every time I write anything, if I write a policy brief, anything I do, I always have a disclaimer in there.

544
00:57:56,150 --> 00:58:02,180
And so that's a challenge with some nonprofits, is that when it comes to political action,

545
00:58:02,390 --> 00:58:08,930
you can lose your 523 status, your nonprofit status, if you are too political.

546
00:58:09,470 --> 00:58:16,310
So it does, yeah, it's a challenge because again, if you think about public health, the link between politics and public health,

547
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:23,090
but then if we're working with nonprofits, their hands are tied when it comes to being able to make political statements.

548
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:30,200
So it's kind of kind of scary. Why else should we work with CBOs, nonprofits and public health?

549
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:38,420
And then they're more fun. I didn't really get any love.

550
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:42,090
Or is there any other reasons? All right.

551
00:58:43,470 --> 00:58:44,400
So why don't I tell you something?

552
00:58:45,630 --> 00:58:54,450
You know, as I mentioned before, you know, most of the direct public health services is going through, you know, non-profits.

553
00:58:54,450 --> 00:59:01,680
And this has been a challenge a lot of times with the when researchers are developing interventions,

554
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:07,620
especially using federal funding with big National Institutes of Health grants,

555
00:59:08,610 --> 00:59:12,450
they're not always looking at how could this be implemented on the ground.

556
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:14,069
So you can get you know,

557
00:59:14,070 --> 00:59:25,860
you might have $1,000,000 grant to look at how do we in and increase sexual and reproductive health among adolescents and young adult women and girls.

558
00:59:26,820 --> 00:59:33,330
But it's done under these like really highly controlled circumstances because we have $1,000,000 to do it.

559
00:59:33,750 --> 00:59:40,350
But then they have a women's health clinic and Blair is going to be the one actually implementing that.

560
00:59:40,650 --> 00:59:44,310
They don't have millions of dollars. They don't have the resources.

561
00:59:44,730 --> 00:59:55,080
And so a lot of times what we see in public health research is that things are done under tightly controlled environments and conditions,

562
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:58,170
and then there's no translation at all to communities.

563
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:03,629
That's why there's been a big push in public health and related fields around implementation science.

564
01:00:03,630 --> 01:00:06,030
So how do we actually implement this?

565
01:00:06,750 --> 01:00:14,190
Because there's so much research has been done in public health that is just a total waste of money because we are never

566
01:00:14,190 --> 01:00:21,180
going to be able to have the conditions and a community based organization that you have at the University of Michigan.

567
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:28,350
So that's one thing that I think this is also so important that we're not just

568
01:00:28,350 --> 01:00:35,040
getting hearing are getting chauvinistic views of communities and saying,

569
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:39,690
oh, I have a community advisory board. And they said, this is cool, so we're good to go.

570
01:00:40,020 --> 01:00:46,650
I mean, they need to be at the table and the organizations, they need to be at the table who are going to be the ones who eventually deliver it.

571
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:54,150
You know, if we're talking about sexual reproductive health for adolescent girls in Ypsilanti,

572
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:57,540
we need to have Corner Health Center there because they provide a lot of that service.

573
01:00:57,900 --> 01:01:05,970
We need to have other local clinics and we're working with trans women in Detroit and Corktown Health Center does a lot of really amazing work.

574
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:09,210
Corktown needs to be central to that project.

575
01:01:10,190 --> 01:01:15,830
So for instance, in our department, Christy Gambrell does a lot of work with trans women in Detroit, trans women of color,

576
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:27,790
and she has a new grant where her partner is Corktown Health Center, who is which is in Detroit, serving trans women of color.

577
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:31,190
A lot of the staff are trans women of color in this project.

578
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:35,300
That way we know that once she gets the results of that study,

579
01:01:35,540 --> 01:01:43,940
it'll be totally applicable because it's an organization that's actually involved in the law and also kind of related.

580
01:01:44,290 --> 01:01:47,719
You know, we need to make sure that the interventions are relevant, as we've talked about a lot,

581
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:51,290
and then you can act that it's actually feasible because again,

582
01:01:51,290 --> 01:01:56,900
you can you can develop these interventions where there's like ten sessions and you know,

583
01:01:57,330 --> 01:02:02,479
you talk, you work with people for 2 hours across ten sessions, and when you do the research,

584
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:07,550
you're paying them, you know, 50 bucks every time they come in for the session and fill out a survey.

585
01:02:07,910 --> 01:02:11,630
No nonprofit can be able to do that. They can't afford, you know, that level.

586
01:02:11,870 --> 01:02:15,290
So we have to think again what will actually work? What's the feasibility?

587
01:02:17,390 --> 01:02:24,980
This is a work that I worked on with folks back in Chicago years ago to develop

588
01:02:24,980 --> 01:02:28,490
an interactive and contextual model of community university collaboration.

589
01:02:28,970 --> 01:02:33,350
And it's not rocket science. So I'm not saying, Oh, this is like groundbreaking.

590
01:02:33,650 --> 01:02:38,270
It just is really work that we created based on years and years of doing this work together.

591
01:02:38,750 --> 01:02:42,200
And we talk about it in like three different phases.

592
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:47,480
So there's gain entry into the community and then actually doing the project.

593
01:02:47,750 --> 01:02:54,469
And then the last part is recognizing and thinking about the benefits and the outcomes.

594
01:02:54,470 --> 01:03:02,299
So, you know, and as we talk about like how how do we gain entry into communities, what are some ideas?

595
01:03:02,300 --> 01:03:05,360
What do you think? So if you want to work in, let's say, Flint,

596
01:03:05,390 --> 01:03:11,870
you want to work in Flint and you want to work on sexual reproductive health for adolescent and young adult women.

597
01:03:12,970 --> 01:03:17,770
How might you gain entry into some of the community based organizations there that you

598
01:03:17,770 --> 01:03:22,150
might want to collaborate with to do some kind of public health intervention development?

599
01:03:23,050 --> 01:03:33,160
What might be a way to gain entry into that community is like, knock on the door back on to this project, we think.

600
01:03:34,170 --> 01:03:39,160
Yeah. I think it's really important for.

601
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:46,660
Organizations that are not really established in that area must be like one of those proxy.

602
01:03:48,040 --> 01:04:00,580
Go for an email face to face or whatever, but with a very clear plan of how that can work with community organizations and what you're willing to do,

603
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:06,970
because at the end of the day, they're the ones that everything is okay.

604
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:11,979
I'm going to great. And I will push you to do that.

605
01:04:11,980 --> 01:04:20,380
Terrifying. Like what might be a potential challenge if you can come in with everything laid out already.

606
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:29,430
Think that shows a challenge if you didn't take.

607
01:04:31,130 --> 01:04:41,740
Exactly. I mean, it's showing what you also mentioned that you won't be cleaning all of this.

608
01:04:43,070 --> 01:04:47,360
Excellent. Yeah. So it's a it's a delicate balance, right? Because I think you're absolutely right.

609
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:49,570
You don't want to come in just like, loosey goosey, like.

610
01:04:49,580 --> 01:04:55,399
Yeah, I mean, let's work together, you know, you want to have some structure, but you also have to be really, really clear.

611
01:04:55,400 --> 01:05:00,080
This is just a beginning. You know, we may end up scrapping this entire thing.

612
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:05,210
But here's what we're thinking. And I think what's really important you mention is like, here's what we can offer you.

613
01:05:05,660 --> 01:05:09,230
You know, be really clear about that. That's really important.

614
01:05:09,260 --> 01:05:10,460
What else? What else can you do?

615
01:05:14,380 --> 01:05:21,010
The rest of you are just going to let all that the grant money go and women are going to get the health care they need.

616
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:33,800
What else are you going to do? Is that you don't know or you're afraid to talk.

617
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:47,260
Reem, you look like you're about to say something. I was thinking maybe you could start off the sincerity.

618
01:05:48,840 --> 01:05:56,800
Okay, good. Rather than, like, bringing in your own team, like, use of resources that they already have.

619
01:05:57,460 --> 01:06:01,930
Good. So. So Vlad is in Genesee County. Genesee County has the Department of Public Health.

620
01:06:02,470 --> 01:06:04,620
You know, finding out what's going on there. Right.

621
01:06:04,630 --> 01:06:14,320
Because, again, I think and I see this a lot at University of Michigan, which is a lovely place to work where people come in because we're U of M,

622
01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:18,070
you know, we're going to come in and we're going to just do things in Flint.

623
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:22,090
Well, you know, Genesee County Department of Public Health has been there a long time.

624
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:26,950
They've done some really incredible work around sexual reproductive health.

625
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:32,550
Let's talk to them first. Try to figure out what's what are the resources.

626
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:40,300
So, you know, you have to make sure that you are in alignment with the other entities that may be doing this work.

627
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:49,510
See, that was a brilliant idea. It's like on someone else, it'll have a brilliant idea because I could see it percolating in your head.

628
01:06:49,900 --> 01:07:00,850
Anyone else percolating out there? This isn't like another idea, but just something that's thinking about it.

629
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:09,930
Like my social work class I was talking about, like the differences between like allies and coconspirators, how allies show up when it's convenient.

630
01:07:11,220 --> 01:07:15,600
Coconspirators are like ones who kind of show up before, like the problem occurs.

631
01:07:16,020 --> 01:07:17,890
And I'm like, that can be insane.

632
01:07:18,270 --> 01:07:26,670
So instead of like trying to bring in organization and like, oh, you hear on the news like this, I mean, while that can be helpful to something that,

633
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:34,050
like, that's like you should kind of already try to work with them before, like that problem occurs like such a wide level.

634
01:07:34,330 --> 01:07:37,049
Yeah. Yeah, that's a great point. So don't wait for a crisis, right?

635
01:07:37,050 --> 01:07:48,930
So if you're really committed to sexual reproductive health and young women, don't wait until we have a, you know, an epidemic of STIs or, you know,

636
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:53,190
pregnancy complications, low birth weight go right in when, you know,

637
01:07:54,780 --> 01:08:00,390
when you have the resources, when you have the capacity yourself to know what else.

638
01:08:03,090 --> 01:08:07,200
It's not rocket science. So I think sometimes we get in our heads too much.

639
01:08:07,410 --> 01:08:11,120
Think about what you learned in kindergarten, right?

640
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:19,680
What are some basic principles you learned in kindergarten? Young people.

641
01:08:22,340 --> 01:08:24,620
What are some of the things you do? Yeah. ADLER What did you do in kindergarten?

642
01:08:25,300 --> 01:08:36,709
Oh, remember, you know, I read, like, picture books and stuff like that, but bring picture books now that, you know, I think, like,

643
01:08:36,710 --> 01:08:40,940
the biggest thing and then I was kind of thinking about was like community building like in the first

644
01:08:40,940 --> 01:08:49,099
place is like actually building trust or like a relationship with the community and whether it's

645
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:54,440
like just like literally becoming friends with like individuals you might be helping or just like I

646
01:08:54,440 --> 01:09:00,379
think it's important to like bring the community together and really learn and kind of not take like,

647
01:09:00,380 --> 01:09:06,300
take us like not don't take the driver's seat like just like sit back and like actually learn.

648
01:09:06,490 --> 01:09:14,000
You got to be critical and like learn about perhaps a new culture that you haven't necessarily interacted with before.

649
01:09:14,630 --> 01:09:19,740
So learning about kind of new cultures, also building relationships is critical.

650
01:09:19,740 --> 01:09:23,570
Is critical. Critical because again, at the end of the day, you're dealing with humans.

651
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:29,690
And even though someone may be the executive director of an organization you really want to work with,

652
01:09:29,780 --> 01:09:32,780
they're also a person, you know, they eat food the way you eat.

653
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:38,960
They bring all those other things. They have emotions. So you have to get on that relational level.

654
01:09:39,290 --> 01:09:49,460
Yeah, I think something that I kind of took away from things about the importance of,

655
01:09:50,420 --> 01:09:57,140
yes, yes, this is entering the community and something that like I was like,

656
01:09:57,710 --> 01:10:06,620
oh, there someone who came to the nonprofit every so or like pretty frequently and like so yes.

657
01:10:06,620 --> 01:10:14,830
Every day. Yeah. Yeah. And it was kind of in a moment kind of reminding me you're saying what kindergarten like in my kindergarten,

658
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:21,470
we had this thing where it's like a stuffed animal and like, I think like every week or so, like, someone would bring it home.

659
01:10:21,710 --> 01:10:26,450
Like we talk about like where we've got this something and I'm like, what to do with this, right?

660
01:10:26,750 --> 01:10:33,260
So it's like kind of like, yeah, virtual building and like seeing the person before like the position.

661
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:34,460
Yeah.

662
01:10:34,580 --> 01:10:44,600
So, you know, one thing that gets you one second is, you know, in one of the readings or in the work that we did with the second project Beta is that,

663
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:52,639
you know, it was an a nonprofit organization that had a lot of ritual and all organizations have ritual, whether you call it a ritual or not.

664
01:10:52,640 --> 01:11:00,530
You do. We have a ritual in here, right? I say it to be in a class and the announcements and then I ask, what are we talking about last time?

665
01:11:00,530 --> 01:11:04,320
And you all look at me with blank stares, but you know, that's our ritual, right?

666
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:14,749
We do it. And so it's learning about organizations rituals because those are important, you know, and I think here and it's always weird,

667
01:11:14,750 --> 01:11:23,360
like when I do go who are coming back to the U.S., I'm always like, Oh, no, I mean, I'm not say that now, but this is like working in other places.

668
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:25,090
They're much more relational, right?

669
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:33,470
So like if I'm in a meeting in Kenya or Zambia at the beginning of the meeting is always, How did you sleep last night and how is your family?

670
01:11:33,770 --> 01:11:37,310
Those are the first two questions you ask every single meeting.

671
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:46,309
And so here, if I would say that, you know, people look at me like 100%, but it's because that's a ritual.

672
01:11:46,310 --> 01:11:50,629
It's about relationships. So we have to be really sensitive to those.

673
01:11:50,630 --> 01:11:55,850
Yes. One thing I was thinking about was like the kidney transplant is like I think one

674
01:11:55,850 --> 01:12:00,049
way that you're able to kind of like start to gain trust within the community,

675
01:12:00,050 --> 01:12:05,300
just like talking to you first, because sometimes I think like.

676
01:12:06,210 --> 01:12:12,990
Talking to maybe like the president first, and I am just telling you, that may not be the most effective.

677
01:12:13,890 --> 01:12:20,370
Maybe first understanding of the community kind of. What they think are the biggest issues.

678
01:12:20,370 --> 01:12:28,000
Maybe a better way to train. Do I get it?

679
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:32,570
Yeah. And it's it's, you know, listening is so, so important.

680
01:12:32,810 --> 01:12:37,670
I mean, listening cannot be overrated when you're developing these relationships.

681
01:12:38,010 --> 01:12:46,549
So a lot of times when, you know, we're working with a new organization, you know, first I do all the homework.

682
01:12:46,550 --> 01:12:51,170
So finding out what's going on and finding out, you know, reading as much as I can on the Web.

683
01:12:51,290 --> 01:12:58,670
If they have a website about their website, you know, we're really learning about what's happening both in the community and in their organization.

684
01:12:59,540 --> 01:13:06,829
And then, you know, I just I show up, you know, I go to like if they're having a fundraiser, I'll go to the fundraiser, having a cultural band.

685
01:13:06,830 --> 01:13:13,520
I go to the cultural event. And I like your difference between an ally and a coconspirator.

686
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:18,860
Because what happens is a lot of times when people are working with nonprofit organizations,

687
01:13:19,370 --> 01:13:25,100
they're only showing up for the meetings and for the grand, but nothing else, you know?

688
01:13:25,110 --> 01:13:31,159
So when I'm working with different organizations, I'm always helping with fundraisers.

689
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:36,440
I don't know how many thousands of fundraisers I've been to or helping with, you know,

690
01:13:36,470 --> 01:13:41,209
when the holidays come around with like a winter coat drive or a food drive, you know,

691
01:13:41,210 --> 01:13:46,940
stuff like that, or if someone was maybe on the news because something happened,

692
01:13:46,940 --> 01:13:51,769
the community calling them up and saying, That's a really great job or someone has a podcast, you know?

693
01:13:51,770 --> 01:13:58,610
So those kind of things where you're showing that you really are interested in the organization and the people within that.

694
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:08,210
I think too, yeah, especially coming from more academic spaces is that we have to meet in order to get that trust.

695
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:16,880
We have to show them who we are. And I think that, you know, part of why I love doing community work is I can just be Gary.

696
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:21,260
I don't have to be Professor Harper or Dr. Harper or any of that [INAUDIBLE] that people want to hear.

697
01:14:22,430 --> 01:14:27,799
I'm just me. So, you know, I'm not always a 100% serious guy, as you probably figure it up.

698
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:36,800
So, you know, I joke and I laugh and I, you know, I was raised in a community where everywhere you go, somewhere, you bring a gift.

699
01:14:37,130 --> 01:14:40,640
Right. Even if you have no money. There were times where we didn't have any money.

700
01:14:41,090 --> 01:14:45,320
If you go to someone's house, you bring a gift. You never go to someone, a child without a gift.

701
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:49,460
So, you know, I might bring a gift. You know, here's something.

702
01:14:50,750 --> 01:14:58,490
And then, too, I was offered to do something for the organization before I even talk about what we might want to collaboratively do.

703
01:14:58,730 --> 01:15:05,510
And so, again, we have often have a lot of skills that to us may seem like, oh, it's not a big deal, but a nonprofit.

704
01:15:05,510 --> 01:15:08,980
It could be really huge. So program evaluation is a big one.

705
01:15:08,990 --> 01:15:16,040
So a lot of times I'll work with an organization, help them do a program about I'll help them write a grant, I'll do something.

706
01:15:16,040 --> 01:15:19,490
And during that process is when we're kind of figuring each other out.

707
01:15:20,060 --> 01:15:24,890
So, you know, I'm figuring out, can I work with them? They're figuring out can they work with us?

708
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:29,990
You know, and going back and forth. And I've worked with some organizations where we've done that process.

709
01:15:30,260 --> 01:15:37,040
And after I do the initial activity, we both have kind of decided not a great fit and it's cool.

710
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:40,730
And then you leave. They're left with some benefit.

711
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:45,620
And you, you know, you kind of regroup and figure out what you're going to do.

712
01:15:46,700 --> 01:15:49,309
But when I see some of the folks there as they come in, it's like, Oh,

713
01:15:49,310 --> 01:15:54,740
I've got to work with this group because this is the main group that does sexual reproductive health for women.

714
01:15:55,060 --> 01:16:01,070
And then someone's like the forceful with the organization, you know, because they really, really want to do this.

715
01:16:01,820 --> 01:16:10,070
That can be a real turnoff, you know, to to folks in the nonprofit sector or just humans because they don't you know,

716
01:16:11,030 --> 01:16:18,170
if they're feeling pressured, then they're going to end up saying, no, you know, I really appreciate it, but don't do.

717
01:16:18,770 --> 01:16:25,550
So, again, and when I was talking about women like, you know, things you learn in kindergarten, so it's like work and play well with others, right?

718
01:16:26,060 --> 01:16:30,950
You know, share your toys, you know, be respectful.

719
01:16:30,950 --> 01:16:32,359
Don't call people names.

720
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:40,849
I mean, it's like really just basic human interactions and relational building and sharing is some of that, some of the elements that are helpful.

721
01:16:40,850 --> 01:16:44,989
Yeah, I kind of want to give an example, I guess like how you're talking about like sharing yourself,

722
01:16:44,990 --> 01:16:49,340
but also kind of like, yeah, the organization, the communities. And so like over the summer,

723
01:16:49,340 --> 01:16:53,059
like me and a group of students are kind of like working on this intervention for like a community and our

724
01:16:53,060 --> 01:16:58,430
like and we were working with like a nonprofit and like crews are working with that like tiny community.

725
01:16:58,700 --> 01:17:03,409
And so you want there to kind of like do like learn more about them and like do like a needs assessment and things like that.

726
01:17:03,410 --> 01:17:07,700
And so the university actually also like made us go through like this training to kind

727
01:17:07,700 --> 01:17:11,660
of understand more about the community before and then do research and was like mentor.

728
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:15,409
And then one of the biggest things we learned is kind of like bringing a gift wherever you go, if you're meeting,

729
01:17:15,410 --> 01:17:20,420
people are like if you're asking them for help and like you should kind of give something like for that.

730
01:17:20,420 --> 01:17:26,630
And so like we also learned that while we were going it was Mother's Day and so we brought them like the Michigan cherries from like your public as.

731
01:17:26,740 --> 01:17:29,010
A way for us to be like, oh, like this is part of like, you know,

732
01:17:29,010 --> 01:17:36,240
something that's really important for us and like our community in Michigan as like a way to kind of cherish something that they did there.

733
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:39,730
That's cool. Yeah. I mean, that's I mean, that's how we should be doing things.

734
01:17:39,750 --> 01:17:47,520
You know, again, it's like, yeah, just being respectful, be nice, being kind, you know, sharing your toys, bringing, you know, bringing a cookie.

735
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:53,260
No, seriously, like when you're a kid, I mean, you can, like, win someone over for a long time.

736
01:17:53,340 --> 01:17:57,040
The good thing is, you know, hopefully you bring more than a cookie.

737
01:17:57,070 --> 01:17:59,850
I like the Michigan cherry idea, you know?

738
01:18:00,230 --> 01:18:07,080
And, you know, in our global world, every time I, I go over to Kenya, I always have one suitcase that's just for,

739
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:11,790
like, donations and and other things like that, and they can be really beneficial.

740
01:18:11,790 --> 01:18:22,079
So I did get to hang out with Barack Obama's grandma in Kenya because we were going around different parts of western Kenya.

741
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:28,140
And I always bring university baseball caps because that's like high currency.

742
01:18:29,010 --> 01:18:38,430
And so, uh, so one of the, the people from the medical facility that we were working with was like showing us different clinics and stuff.

743
01:18:38,610 --> 01:18:42,670
And he's like, Oh, do you want to go buy Barack Obama's grandmother's house?

744
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:43,890
Let's go.

745
01:18:44,310 --> 01:18:51,090
So, you know, we went by there and he's like, you had you know, you got to just kind of, you know, they never let anyone in, but you can just see it.

746
01:18:51,090 --> 01:18:55,559
So we went there and I said, Do you mind if I get out of the car? And he was like, Yeah.

747
01:18:55,560 --> 01:19:02,040
So I just went up to the gate and I started talking to the guards and I gave them baseball caps and they're like,

748
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:06,810
Oh, do you want to meet, you know, my mom and Sarah?

749
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:11,940
And I'm like, Oh, sure. So we're just friends right up there.

750
01:19:12,210 --> 01:19:19,350
And we were hanging out with her. She's really nice. And Obama's cousin was there.

751
01:19:19,350 --> 01:19:23,850
And so we were like literally sitting on the porch in the middle of western Kenya.

752
01:19:24,810 --> 01:19:29,070
Everyone had their baseball caps on, you know, just hanging out.

753
01:19:29,370 --> 01:19:34,019
And all that happened because I had baseball caps. So, you know, think about that.

754
01:19:34,020 --> 01:19:37,560
You never know what a baseball cap will get you.

755
01:19:41,430 --> 01:19:46,590
Oh, are you serious? My bad looking is always the cardinals going on really long.

756
01:19:47,130 --> 01:19:58,540
Oh, my lawn is going to be like, I don't know the first person you're going to respond to.

757
01:19:58,650 --> 01:20:04,830
Like, I saw you, like, slowly. Maybe it's going to be like.

758
01:20:17,310 --> 01:20:28,190
What I'm going to tell you is that you've got great planning on the ground right now.

759
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:32,680
I.
