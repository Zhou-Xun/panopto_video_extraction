1
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:06,440
In this next segment, I'd like to dive a little more deeply into access to care.

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:14,750
I will explain what access is and the evolution of the health insurance system in the U.S.

3
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:18,170
So what is access to care and what do we mean?

4
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:25,990
This is a diagram from the World Health Organization that illustrates the multiple dimensions of access to care.

5
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:30,700
We have availability, so weather services are available in the first place,

6
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:40,120
whether there is adequate continued supply of available services, and whether services are effectively available for utilization.

7
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:48,080
And then, there's affordability. A system for financing health services so people do not suffer from financial hardship when using them.

8
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,240
And we also have to think about appropriateness.

9
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:57,940
So are services available in a way that are relevant to different parts of the population in terms of their health needs and

10
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:06,910
material and cultural settings? Different resources really need to be able to meet the needs of different population groups.

11
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:12,670
So you'll see here in this diagram that there is not an explicit mention of health insurance.

12
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:18,640
Health insurance is complicated. As we talk through the origins of health insurance and what it is,

13
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:26,830
you'll see that many of these dimensions of access show up in what we understand about it.

14
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:33,850
How did employers end up paying for our health insurance if they don't pay for other necessities like our groceries?

15
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:40,210
What are the origins of the health care system that we know of today?

16
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:46,570
In the early 1900s, health care was a trivial part of the average person's annual budget.

17
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:54,400
The average Americans spent five dollars a year on health care, which is like 100 dollars in today's money.

18
00:01:54,400 --> 00:02:00,160
No one had health insurance, because you don't need insurance for something that costs five dollars a year.

19
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:06,550
From an economic standpoint, the very purpose of health insurance is to protect against financial risk.

20
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:14,420
Before modern medicine, hospitals were considered an institution where the indigent population went to die.

21
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:22,760
Then came modern medicine. Effective medicines, especially antibiotics, along with the revolution in medical schools,

22
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:27,560
hospitals then started marketing themselves as places to have babies.

23
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:32,780
Health care became much more effective, and therefore much more expensive.

24
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:42,610
There was a real cost associated with clean hospitals, educated doctors and real pharmacological research, all of which costs money.

25
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:51,460
People were willing to pay for care when they were really sick, but it wasn't yet common to go for preventative or well care.

26
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:55,750
By the late 1920s, hospitals noticed most of their beds were going empty

27
00:02:55,750 --> 00:03:01,570
every night. They wanted to get people who weren't deathly ill to start coming in.

28
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:07,180
Hospital officials started offering a deal to a group of public school teachers in Dallas.

29
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:15,880
They offered a plan for the teachers to pay 50 cents each month in exchange for Baylor picking up the tab on hospital visits.

30
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:22,540
When the Great Depression hit, almost every hospital in the country saw its patient load disappear.

31
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:27,190
The Baylor idea became hugely popular. It eventually got a name,

32
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:30,980
what we know of today as Blue Cross.

33
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:38,750
The modern system of getting benefits through a job required another catalyst, which was World War II. During World War II,

34
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:45,470
there was a federal wage freeze and labor shortages. Industries needed to attract workers.

35
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:54,010
They couldn't afford more money, so they offered other perks, such as health insurance. In 1943,

36
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:59,560
the Internal Revenue Service ruled that employer based health care could be tax free.

37
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:05,170
A second law in 1954 made the tax advantages even more attractive.

38
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:11,930
So employer based insurance spread because of government price controls and tax breaks, which became our system.

39
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:18,970
And by the mid 1960s, Americans started to see that system in which people with good jobs get health care through work,

40
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:26,900
and almost everyone else looks to government, as if it were the natural order of things.

41
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:33,560
Values we see when it comes to health care in the United States are important to understand.

42
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:42,000
They directly influence what we see in terms of access to health care in the United States and most notably, differential access.

43
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:50,180
So one value is individualism. If health is important to us, we will make independent lifestyle choices.

44
00:04:50,180 --> 00:05:00,810
Another value we see is meritocracy. We have access and received the level of health care that we have earned through our hard work.

45
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:11,440
And then we see technocracy. Technology will solve our problems with better biomedicine, such as surgery and medicines.

46
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,960
I'd like to provide you with a broad overview of current insurance programs that we have in the U.S. to illustrate how

47
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:26,280
segments of the population have mechanisms to protect against the financial burden associated with seeking health care.

48
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:33,220
There are three main points when it comes to health insurance in the United States and the system we have here.

49
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:36,730
We have a lot of different insurance systems in the U.S.

50
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:42,430
There are different eligibility criteria and coverage provisions for all of these different systems.

51
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:46,750
And lastly, we still have a sizable uninsured rate in the U.S.

52
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:55,110
Not all individuals who are eligible for any given program are actually enrolled.

53
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:59,280
Employer sponsored insurance is offered by the employer as part of the employment

54
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,050
package and typically cost shared between the individual and the employee.

55
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:09,540
It is a form of private insurance. Not all employers offer health insurance.

56
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:13,680
So for the employed population, they have to really ask themselves two questions.

57
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,320
Is it available to me through my job? And is it affordable?

58
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:26,030
The cost sharing of private insurance may not be tenable for low wage workers.

59
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:31,280
Health insurance for the military population is available through the Department of Veterans Affairs.

60
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:37,160
It covers about 25 percent of all veterans, which is roughly nine million people annually.

61
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:45,920
You have to apply to get these benefits, and you're eligible if you served on active duty or separated under conditions other than dishonorable.

62
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:57,620
There are also priority groups for coverage that are based on a whole host of factors, including your service history, disability rating, etc.

63
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:03,140
Medicaid provides coverage to more than one in four non-elderly American Indian

64
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:09,320
Alaskan native adults and half of American Indian Alaskan native children.

65
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:16,340
Medicaid coverage helps to fill gaps in employer sponsored insurance for this population,

66
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:25,760
and enables them to access a broader array of services and providers than they can access solely through services funded by the Indian Health Service.

67
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:31,950
It also provides a key source of financing for Indian Health Service and tribal providers.

68
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:36,510
Indian Health Services within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and

69
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:41,850
came out of government to government relationships between the U.S. and tribes.

70
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:46,230
It is responsible for providing direct medical and public health services to members

71
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:53,010
of federally recognized Native American tribes and Alaskan native people.

72
00:07:53,010 --> 00:08:01,960
Indian Health Service is the principal federal health care provider and health advocate for Indian people.

73
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:07,780
Medicare and Medicaid are government funded programs that were both passed in 1965.

74
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:16,330
Medicare is a federally administered social insurance program for older adults 65 years of age and older who pay into the tax system,

75
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:26,850
typically working a minimum of 10 years. It's also available to children and adults with end stage renal disease and people with disabilities.

76
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:34,170
This is a federal program and actually segregated hospitals in 1965 because they would

77
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:40,200
be in violation of Title VI if they took federal funds from the Medicare program.

78
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:45,270
So because of Medicare, hospitals desegregated dramatically across the nation.

79
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:49,910
It was one of the greatest achievements of the civil rights movement.

80
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:55,700
Medicare consists of parts A and B, which cover inpatient nursing facilities, hospice care,

81
00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:02,940
limited home health, doctor's visits, ambulance rides, lab tests, vaccines, screenings and medical equipment.

82
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:15,700
People on Medicare can also purchase optional plans that cover prescription vision, dental and hearing, as well as fitness memberships.

83
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:20,170
Providing health care to Americans with low income was never politically popular.

84
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:30,250
Which is why in 1965, when Medicare was passed, Medicaid was a small provision within the overall legislation, essentially tucked in there.

85
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:35,460
For a longtime, Medicaid eligibility was limited to specific low income groups.

86
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:44,130
In 2010, the Affordable Care Act created provisions to expand eligibility criteria based on a higher income threshold.

87
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:52,320
Medicaid is cost shared between the federal government and states, giving states quite a bit of discretion in terms of what services to cover and

88
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:57,420
whether they want to expand Medicaid to larger segments of their population.

89
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:04,390
Because of this, we essentially have 50 different Medicaid programs in the U.S.

90
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:07,720
In thinking about immigrants, to qualify for Medicaid,

91
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:15,250
you have to be a citizen or have a green card for more than five years or have refugee or humanitarian status.

92
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:21,040
There are also some emergency options for people who are undocumented or local insurance options

93
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:32,320
outside of Medicaid for specific groups that aren't eligible for any other form of health insurance.

94
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,760
Geographic variation in health care is also another way in which we can think about

95
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:41,890
racial and ethnic disparities in health care as it relates to access and care delivery.

96
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:45,700
So we went over a bunch of different insurance programs.

97
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:53,170
But we also want to think about geographic variation, what does this have to do with disparities?

98
00:10:53,170 --> 00:11:00,900
So Catherine Baker and colleagues argue that racial disparities in health are really a local phenomena.

99
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:09,300
With data, they demonstrated that some areas have substantial disparities, while others do not, and that some areas have disparity in one treatment,

100
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:19,800
but no disparity in other treatments or procedures. They used hospital referral regions as a unit of analysis to look at geographic variation,

101
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:25,170
which is derived from a complex algorithm with data on how people seek care.

102
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:31,980
These regions can cross state borders in some instances and can be thought of as a local health care market.

103
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:37,040
Their papers showed that there are differences in care between hospital referral regions,

104
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:42,690
and these differences can stem from a number of factors, such as historical practice patterns,

105
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:53,830
the slow diffusion of technology, differential supply of specialists and hospital capacity and differences in patient characteristics and preferences.

106
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:58,270
They also showed that there are disparities within hospital referral regions and

107
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:05,250
residential segregation may be one factor that increases those racial differences.

108
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:12,240
From their paper, they concluded that health care disparities should be considered as the sum of two components.

109
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:19,940
Unequal treatment within a hospital or by a given provider, and unequal treatment because of where people live.

110
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:26,570
They said this distinction is important because the sources of inequity are quite different. In the first case,

111
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:35,570
it is either at the level of the health care interaction, whether because of bias by the provider or poor information or preferences of the patient,

112
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:39,950
while in the second, it is related to differences in where people live,

113
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:43,430
which is dependent on factors such as wage and income,

114
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:48,860
as well as barriers to housing that are less likely to be associated with the health health care system

115
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:56,580
persay. So thinking about social and political factors.

116
00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:02,760
So as you can see, the health care system in the U.S., specifically the health insurance system,

117
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,990
illustrates a really complex web when it comes to access to care.

118
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:15,690
And this complexity in some ways explains why we would see differential health outcomes among different racial and ethnic groups.

119
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:21,570
To highlight key takeaways, I want to convey a few things.

120
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:29,820
So health care access is really not equivalent to coverage. Coverage means gaining entry into the health care system.

121
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:39,870
We also need to think about the timeliness of services. So the health care systems ability to provide health care quickly after need is recognized.

122
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:46,520
We also need to think about services, ensuring that people have usual and ongoing sources of care.

123
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:52,880
We insure ourselves against things that are expensive or would cause significant financial risk.

124
00:13:52,880 --> 00:14:01,660
Health care did not pose a financial risk to the population until medicine started advancing and therefore becoming more expensive.

125
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:11,430
Our employer sponsored system came to be in order to sweeten the benefits package that would move more people into the workforce during World War II.

126
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:20,150
Thereafter, one of the values that became cemented within the health insurance system is that health insurance was something that you earned.

127
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:27,470
Geography plays a significant role in thinking about access and disparities.

128
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:37,738
So in segment three, you'll hear from Dorothy Roberts who will illustrate how race is ubiquitous in the practice of medicine and care.
