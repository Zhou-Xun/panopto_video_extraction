00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,740
Welcome to motivational interviewing.

2
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:15,840
This is our first lecture in the online series.

3
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,801
Let's begin by watching a video.

4
00:00:18,801 --> 00:00:22,977
You're gonna see an emergency room physician talking to his patient about his

5
00:00:22,977 --> 00:00:25,140
health behaviors.

6
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,340
Do you think he's gonna change?

7
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:33,140
Take a look.

8
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:35,440
>> Hello, Mr Blake.

9
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,183
Just sit back, relax.

10
00:00:38,183 --> 00:00:38,848
>> Why now?

11
00:00:38,848 --> 00:00:40,020
>> Your insanity.

12
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,630
You have a broken ankle.

13
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:43,240
You also have a concussion.

14
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,027
Just relax.

15
00:00:44,027 --> 00:00:44,758
>> My guitar?

16
00:00:44,758 --> 00:00:48,240
>> Here in the closet with your clothes.

17
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,647
>> Yeah, when [INAUDIBLE].

18
00:00:50,647 --> 00:00:52,751
>> You can go is up to the doctor.

19
00:00:52,751 --> 00:00:54,041
>> Where's the doctor.

20
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:55,950
>> I'll get the doctor for you.

21
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:56,850
Just sit back.

22
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:57,641
Just relax.

23
00:00:57,641 --> 00:01:01,843
We'll get the doctor.

24
00:01:01,843 --> 00:01:06,340
>> Let me be honest with you, Okay?

25
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,371
The problem is in your ankle will heal cleanly.

26
00:01:08,371 --> 00:01:13,740
The problem is your general condition or the extreme lack of it.

27
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,840
Now, the kinds of stuff we're talking here.

28
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,580
Emphysema, heart failure, cancer.

29
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:27,440
An extremely good chance of a stroke, are gonna kill you.

30
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,840
Are you gonna talk to me?

31
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,540
>> About what?

32
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:35,240
>> Look, let's not kid ourselves about this one.

33
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,140
You're an alcoholic.

34
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,040
I'll take care of your leg, give you something for your cholesterol.

35
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:47,012
But you have to stop smoking, stop drinking and lose 25 pounds.

36
00:01:47,012 --> 00:01:58,427
Okay, Mr Blake?

37
00:01:58,427 --> 00:02:01,070
>> Well, what did you see here?

38
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:05,940
Well, you saw a provider, trying to control his patient.

39
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:09,039
You heard language like you must you should, you have to.

40
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:12,153
That style of communication controlling motivation,

41
00:02:12,153 --> 00:02:15,007
we know from hundreds of studies, doesn't work.

42
00:02:15,007 --> 00:02:19,703
And in fact in many cases actually pushes a patient in the direction of the risk

43
00:02:19,703 --> 00:02:20,432
behavior.

44
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:22,310
It actually makes things worse.

45
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:28,240
We call that reactant, so clearly, this is not motivational interviewing.

46
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:32,771
Now let's take a look at a client's statement and let's compare sort of

47
00:02:32,771 --> 00:02:38,040
the old school traditional response to motivational interviewing.

48
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:49,533
Take a second to read the client's statement.

49
00:02:49,533 --> 00:02:53,740
Let's begin with the old school none MI response.

50
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:57,140
You can exercise at home, ride your bike or walk.

51
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,221
Ask her husband to help.

52
00:02:58,221 --> 00:03:02,538
What you see here is the counselor ignores the emotion, ignores the barriers,

53
00:03:02,538 --> 00:03:06,940
ignores the feeling and jumps right into unsolicited advice.

54
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:09,940
How effective do you think that would be?

55
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:14,640
He's even a little bit of a condescending, snarky tone to it.

56
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:25,240
Now, let's contrast that with the MI or new school response.

57
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,269
Let's deconstruct that new school response.

58
00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:32,140
So, it starts out with a double sided reflection.

59
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:35,940
The double sided reflection acknowledges the patient's ambivalence.

60
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:39,040
Part of you wants to be part of you is scared.

61
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,640
We also call that rolling with resistance.

62
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,793
We're acknowledging their barrier without trying to fix it or overcome it.

63
00:03:45,793 --> 00:03:47,919
At this early stage of the encounter or

64
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:52,040
simply accept their barriers as face valid.

65
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,740
Next we do something called crossing off the list.

66
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:57,078
This person is saying, I don't like the gym and

67
00:03:57,078 --> 00:03:59,902
I don't think I'll be able to exercise with my husband.

68
00:03:59,902 --> 00:04:04,940
At this point, we roll with it, we accept it, we cross it off the list.

69
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:10,940
And finally, we end our response by emphasizing the change talk.

70
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:13,878
Even though the person is tentative, in their change talk,

71
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:17,001
we wanna at least acknowledge that they're thinking about it.

72
00:04:17,001 --> 00:04:20,260
It's a possibility, and we do that with this statement.

73
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,940
It's something you think could be good for you.

74
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:27,440
It's not too definitive, just strikes the right tone.

75
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,540
Let's take a look at another patient statement.

76
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:34,115
The blue text is something we're going to want the MI counsel to make sure they

77
00:04:34,115 --> 00:04:43,640
incorporate in their response.

78
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,240
Here's the old school response.

79
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,218
Notice that controlling language, you will have to,

80
00:04:50,218 --> 00:04:55,640
notice the unsolicited advice, diets don't work here.

81
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,940
The provider does not acknowledge those emotional aspects.

82
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,640
Their fears are the barriers.

83
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:18,640
So, now let's take a look at an MI consistent response.

84
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:23,061
We see the counselor is acknowledging the patient's resistance and their struggles.

85
00:05:23,061 --> 00:05:26,040
You've tried a lot of things here, and put a lot of effort into it.

86
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,740
We call that affirmation.

87
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:31,040
It's a very important part of the MI process.

88
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,140
But then we acknowledge their barriers and their fears.

89
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,760
These diets haven't lasted.

90
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:39,240
They just make you hungry, and you're getting discouraged.

91
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,920
And finally, again, we acknowledge the change talk,

92
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,925
although again the person is tentative.

93
00:05:43,925 --> 00:05:47,590
We still want to capture the fact that they're starting to think about.

94
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:48,810
Is there another way?

95
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:53,240
Can I do something other than diets, that might help me long term?

96
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:58,140
Let's end with the hope in most of our MI encounters.

97
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:01,501
We can reduce behavior change to essentially two phases.

98
00:06:01,501 --> 00:06:03,860
The why phase, and the how phase.

99
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:08,240
During the why phase when MI is your primary strategy.

100
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:13,811
We're trying to motivate people, but increasingly we view motivation

101
00:06:13,811 --> 00:06:19,127
as synonymous with how much energy are you willing to devote to this?

102
00:06:19,127 --> 00:06:24,020
MI is the best technique we know to energize behavior change,

103
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,911
but we also need a plan.

104
00:06:25,911 --> 00:06:29,140
We also need structure, and that's where things like behavior therapy and

105
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:32,040
cognitive behavior therapy come in.

106
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,180
That's where we establish goals.

107
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,760
You might keep a diary.

108
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,140
You might have some reward for your behavior.

109
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:45,140
Now, MI still relevant during the how phase, there's an MI way to do CBT.

110
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:51,140
So, you're still going to do lots of reflections when you do MI informed CBT.

111
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:55,457
You're still gonna support autonomy you're still not gonna use should must have to

112
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:56,135
you better.

113
00:06:56,135 --> 00:06:59,337
But MI moves to the background, whereas in the first why phase,

114
00:06:59,337 --> 00:07:02,240
it's in the foreground.

115
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,167
Another way to think about MI,

116
00:07:04,167 --> 00:07:09,140
is that it's the balance between these two fundamental principles.

117
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:12,740
Comfort the afflicted, and afflict the comfortable.

118
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:15,040
What do I mean by comfort the afflicted?

119
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,490
Well, generally that means rule with resistance.

120
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:20,611
We've already done it a few times, acknowledge the patient's fears.

121
00:07:20,611 --> 00:07:22,221
You're dreading this, you're scared about this.

122
00:07:22,221 --> 00:07:24,840
You don't like salad, you don't like exercise.

123
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,940
You're scared of withdrawal symptoms.

124
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,740
You don't know you can do this.

125
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:33,430
That's all rolling with resistance statements, you pull up alongside and

126
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:35,830
you acknowledge this might be tough.

127
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,640
You're not looking forward to this.

128
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:42,940
But if that's all we do, we may not get the person actually to move forward.

129
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:45,240
For that, we have to afflict the comfortable.

130
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,966
And typically what that means is,

131
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:52,140
we wanna establish a discrepancy between what they value and this current behavior.

132
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,340
What do we mean?

133
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,818
We often ask the person, what's important to you?

134
00:07:55,818 --> 00:07:57,040
And we show them a list.

135
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,001
We'll do this later in the semester, and they may choose.

136
00:08:00,001 --> 00:08:00,990
I wanna be a good parent.

137
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,280
I wanna be respected at work.

138
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,740
I wanna feel in control of things.

139
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:08,021
And then we asked, well, how does your behavior let's just use cigarette smoking?

140
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:13,340
How does smoking cigarettes relate to being a good parent respected at work?

141
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:16,176
And typically there's a dramatic tension between the two,

142
00:08:16,176 --> 00:08:18,744
that they say I'll be a better dad if I'm not smoking.

143
00:08:18,744 --> 00:08:22,240
I'll be more respected in work in the community if I don't smoke.

144
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,951
And by creating that dramatic tension were afflicting the comfortable.

145
00:08:24,951 --> 00:08:26,561
That's where we get the movement.

146
00:08:26,561 --> 00:08:28,302
Now, it can be uncomfortable,

147
00:08:28,302 --> 00:08:31,209
an MI session can be very exhausting because of that.

148
00:08:31,209 --> 00:08:36,740
You have to question a lot about who you are, and what you're doing.

149
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,039
That ends our first lecture.

150
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:43,340
Well, we tried to show you, first of all, what MI is not.

151
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:46,300
We've given you a little peek into what MI is, and

152
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:50,140
how it differs from traditional counseling.

153
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,766
Thanks for watching.
