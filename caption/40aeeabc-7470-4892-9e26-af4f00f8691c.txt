1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:06,290
It was because I didn't want to.

2
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:17,190
And so that was in the morning, everyone.

3
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:26,640
So today we have a wonderful guest presenter.

4
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,380
This is Rachel Lazar. I'm sorry.

5
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:35,970
Peyser Rachel Peyser is an alumna from our program.

6
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:49,500
She's a registered dietitian, and she has been working at Immune System Michigan University on research with titular community interventions.

7
00:00:49,860 --> 00:01:00,180
Her research is really interesting, and I'm so glad that, Rachel, you were able to come back and visit us just real quick after Rachel's presentation.

8
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,010
I just want to touch base with you about your advocacy one pager.

9
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:15,720
Rachel, thank you so much for coming. Dr. Cole, it's so great to be back again at the School of Public Health.

10
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:24,209
I'm really excited to speak to you speak to you today because this is something I've been wanting to do for a couple of years now.

11
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:28,950
And it was right before the pandemic that we had talked about me coming to speak.

12
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:32,140
And finally I'm able to now.

13
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:42,090
So I'm very excited to share and I hope, you know, my presentation inspires you and there will be time for questions at the end.

14
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,330
So I'm really excited to share today.

15
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:55,130
So I work in the Center for Health Disparities, Innovations and Studies, and Dr. Sue Wu is the director of the center.

16
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,560
She's also the school.

17
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:04,769
She's in the school of Nursing, and she's one of the main faculty at Eastern Michigan University.

18
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:14,670
And she's basically collected a whole team of professors and other professionals at Eastern Michigan University.

19
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:22,110
So I'll talk about one of the programs that's in the center, but we've been going for four years now,

20
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:27,600
and we're in our final year of this current project that I'm working on.

21
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:39,000
So I'm going to talk about EMU Reach, what it is like the events and the education that we do in our program as well as the project,

22
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,970
the publications that we've produced.

23
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:51,660
So Rich stands for our racial and ethnic approaches to community health, and our priority population is Asian-Americans.

24
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:59,040
But we've also expanded to other populations simply because they work in the areas that we work in.

25
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:09,300
For example, we work in Hamtramck, and there's also a high population of Yemeni and Arab Middle Eastern communities there.

26
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:17,910
So we've included them. And now in in our work on the west side of Michigan, there are African refugee populations,

27
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:25,140
so we're expanding to them as well, in addition to the Vietnamese and Nepali communities that we work with over there.

28
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:30,810
So we have this five year cooperative agreement with the CDC.

29
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:37,740
So that just means that they expect certain things from us and they give us feedback.

30
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:50,640
We have to meet with our officer every month and provide monthly progress reports as well as annual evaluation plans and performance measures.

31
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:54,780
So it's more of a that's why it's called a cooperative agreement,

32
00:03:54,780 --> 00:04:00,180
because they are not just giving us the money and then letting us do whatever we want.

33
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:09,060
We're kind of like engaged in this more back and forth conversation with them and having,

34
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:13,860
you know, making sure our plans align with their goals for the funding.

35
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:25,470
So we have three domains. We have nutrition, physical activity and community clinical linkages, as well as communications and evaluation.

36
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:37,440
And then we work with many community partners in Wayne, Oakland and Kent Counties and also with the Burmese in Battle Creek.

37
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,940
And that's a different county than I forget the name of it.

38
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:48,090
So this is just a short little list of some of our partners in communities.

39
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:52,919
We work with the Bangladeshi American Public Affairs Committee.

40
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:59,940
So they are really focused on civil rights and immigration, helping people when they immigrate.

41
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:08,980
Connect to resources in the area. They have English as a second language classes, ESL.

42
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:16,840
And then we also work with Detroit Friendship House, which is a food pantry in Hamtramck, and they do a lot of work.

43
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:23,979
They actually just hired a social worker and they are helping people get connected to resources in the community.

44
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:32,080
They also have Cooking Matters classes in partnership with Gleaners, which is a food bank that provides the food to them.

45
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:36,430
And what else? They're just doing a lot right now.

46
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:44,410
And one of the exciting things that I'll talk about later is they are implementing the swap program, which stands for supporting wellness at Pantries.

47
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:51,430
So those various community centers that we work with, including the Association of Chinese Americans,

48
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:54,729
they actually have four community centers in the Detroit,

49
00:05:54,730 --> 00:06:05,740
Madison Heights and Canton area, and they do a lot of ESL classes, fitness classes for seniors, a lot of cultural events.

50
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:13,150
You know, there's a lot of holidays throughout the year. They have a summer camp for the kids that I always teach at every summer.

51
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:24,160
So they're doing a lot. They also have preventative care programs, so they are one of our partners that's doing the diabetes prevention program.

52
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:31,450
And they also help people. They have like navigators that help connect people to Medicare and Medicaid.

53
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:38,860
And, you know, if they need a ride to the doctor, a doctor's appointment, they'll help set everything up for them.

54
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:43,300
So we're actually in Hamtramck, Detroit area.

55
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:50,320
And also we've worked with Wayne County Healthy Communities, which is in a federally qualified health center in Hamtramck.

56
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:57,340
We had a nature grant with them and we did a lot of breastfeeding work.

57
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:03,520
That's part of the nutrition domain is we also have a lactation consultant on our staff

58
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:09,640
that has helped us implement some different programs and done peer counselor trainings.

59
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:15,580
So I have some pictures of that counselor training.

60
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:22,630
Actually, this first one was in June 2020 and we had our second one in January 2021.

61
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:34,720
So we really wanted to expand that capacity and really, you know, help that community engage in more breastfeeding work.

62
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:42,730
Because a lot of the population, when we did a literature review and we started talking to people,

63
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:50,470
we found that a lot of the women tend to not they don't breastfeed exclusively,

64
00:07:50,470 --> 00:08:02,680
they will either use formula or on feeding or and it's seen formula is seen as somewhat of a status symbol.

65
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:08,560
And so we're trying to educate them about the benefits of breastfeeding.

66
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,309
So doing these peer counselor trainings was one way to do that.

67
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:16,719
And then another way that we did that was through community baby shower.

68
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:24,190
So we had to clean in the community baby showers in 2019 and we had another one recently in Warren in August.

69
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:39,700
Another thing that we've done are like food tasting events and we try to educate people about healthy eating through,

70
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:43,780
you know, like promoting, like showing them what a healthy snack looks like.

71
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:49,390
So there's this one. The first summer I was working at Cetus,

72
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:59,530
we did a whole series of fruity scenes and I made this yellow split pea dip with vegetables, as you see in the pictures.

73
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:05,050
And so there's various events like that that we've done.

74
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:15,580
Um, also we attended the ACA has association, Chinese-Americans has a women's group.

75
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:28,420
And so I kind of talked to them about healthy on a budget and the fun of snacks that has some culturally cultural dried fruits.

76
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:33,820
Goji berries in there is a muffin recipe and I really loved it.

77
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:42,400
We've also been attending their gardening fairs and we gave a little presentation on like healthy

78
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:50,979
canned goods and reducing sodium because that's one of the big issues with like high blood pressure.

79
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:57,250
And so we're trying to educate on how to reduce your salt intake.

80
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:06,840
And then there's a picture here on the. Lower side of a seat counting activity that we did with summer camp kids.

81
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,190
So that was really fun.

82
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:22,590
I taught the theme this year for the summer camp was like sustainability, love of food, kind of teaching them how to grow and how it's beneficial,

83
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:29,880
you know, how it all connects to your health and also sustainability and health of the planet as well.

84
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:37,260
So something that was also really exciting this year is we did some virtual cooking classes,

85
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:47,620
so we actually got a grant from the American Heart Association and we were able to provide these virtual cooking classes.

86
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:58,590
So what we did is we reached out through our food pantry partner in one of the community centers in Hamtramck, and we recruited participants,

87
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:08,040
and then we created these cooking kits, and I delivered them to the food pantry for people's houses if they didn't have transportation.

88
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:14,910
And then we had the Zoom cooking classes and we had a series of four of them.

89
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:27,000
But we tried to keep people engaged by having them take photos of their dishes that they made because they were cooking along right with us.

90
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:33,980
So they would, you know, make the dish, take a picture, and then whoever.

91
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:41,370
Like the following week when we delivered the kit, we would also deliver a little gift or prize if they submitted a photo.

92
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:50,370
So that's those are photos from the actual participants of the dishes that you see here and an example of one of the kitchen kits.

93
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,050
So some other projects that we've done, I've created some toolkits.

94
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:05,100
I'm working on a breastfeeding tool kit for our peer counselors and just some different

95
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:12,660
resources that are also have the handouts that are translated into Arabic and Bangla,

96
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:20,070
because those are the two languages that we primarily focus on on the east side.

97
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:25,890
And then we also have done a lot of manuscript writing.

98
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:36,840
I know I'll touch on some of those journal articles later, but I tend to do a lot of literature reviews and really dig into what have people done.

99
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,530
And, you know,

100
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:47,550
a big part of my job is like writing the background for those journal articles as well as the results and the methods and the discussion.

101
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:57,850
So you really have to get used to researching what papers are relevant to your topic of research and finding out what other people.

102
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:10,530
And and also we have, you know, meetings are part of my day to day schedule and the reports also planning events.

103
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:18,960
I did a huge event like the first year I started for National Nutrition Month and it was kind of like a health fair style setup.

104
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:29,340
So I had like one table for breakfast, one table for like healthy snacks, one table for like healthy beverages, stuff like that.

105
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:32,460
So that was a big project that was that I was really proud of.

106
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:40,770
We also do a lot of research like Dr. Cole mentioned, so I've done a number of different surveys.

107
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:47,160
We did one recently last year on cultural food. So we reached out to our partners and said, Hey,

108
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:59,160
can you survey your clients about what kind of foods they prefer so that we can help you provide more of those foods or know,

109
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:04,800
get connected to or help you know what foods to request or provide.

110
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:11,910
And then we've also did the survey, done the surveys on food insecurity and diabetes,

111
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:18,000
which I'll be sharing the results of our paper, and also nutrition and breastfeeding.

112
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:26,700
We did those surveys at the community baby showers. And then we're also about to start our surveys for the Soil Awareness Program.

113
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:34,290
So we're trying to see if the clients at Friendship House, if they're aware of the program,

114
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:40,080
if they find it useful, and if it's changing their behaviors.

115
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:46,889
And then another thing that I do is our social media posts.

116
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:52,010
So we try to create at least 2 to 3 more.

117
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:58,710
If it is, there's a busy month with a lot of like, you know, national.

118
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:07,650
Or like health leaks or stuff like that. So Vegetarian Awareness Month, that was I think in October.

119
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:22,230
So I made a post for that. We do have some of our Asian populations are being taken and then also creating content for National Breastfeeding Month.

120
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:34,350
So that's in August. And also sharing, trying to share posts on local foods and how they can access cheaper foods.

121
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:43,259
For example, the eastern market actually has farm boxes that you can get for like against $20.

122
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:53,220
Yeah, farm boxes for pickup. And, you know, if they have staff and they can get that reduced price and it's a ton of food.

123
00:15:54,660 --> 00:16:00,060
And I also share recipes on social media and just a ton of resources.

124
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:05,050
So I'm Canva is my favorite.

125
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:09,389
I'm sure many of you have heard of it, or maybe some of you have used it.

126
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:15,000
But I really love Canva for creating a lot of my content.

127
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:26,040
So like I was talking about, this is the Detroit Friendship House, but we are using the it's called the stock light system.

128
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:34,319
That's part of the the swap. And it basically ranks foods by yellow, green or red.

129
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:41,670
So choose so often is green, choose sometimes it's yellow and choose rarely is red.

130
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:52,230
So based on, you know, some parameters that you guidelines, whatever you fall into, it's one of those colors.

131
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:56,770
So they have some signs on the shelf.

132
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:07,130
And and then we have a nutrition corner that we're going to be soon providing a monthly topic and some handouts as well as a recipe card.

133
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:13,620
So we're trying to set up this incentive program where the clients will take a handout and a recipe card.

134
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:20,310
They will go home and using the food at the food pantry, they will make the recipe,

135
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:25,530
take a picture, submit it, email it to us, and then they'll receive that gift card.

136
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:32,700
So we have some Europe students actually from Europe who are going to be helping us with that.

137
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:45,150
We've also done 100 culturally relevant food surveys recently, and we're going to be doing some cart audits to see like what foods people choose.

138
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:49,200
We're going to do 100 of those coming up pretty soon.

139
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:55,970
And then another thing that we do that I haven't mentioned is our farm to work.

140
00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:04,350
So we received Kabbage Grant from PHN, which stands for Association of State and Public Health Nutritionists.

141
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:15,750
They give money for like food grants and capital grants, which do the Early Childhood Education Center work.

142
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:19,770
And they funded us for the past couple of years.

143
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:27,250
So we helped a learning center in Battle Creek and help them set up a garden.

144
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:37,890
We paid for CSA boxes so that they can use the foods from a local farm and give them to the kids.

145
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:44,460
And then recently we did an Apple Crunch Day, which was October 13th,

146
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:56,940
and so we went to the Hamtramck Preschool Center in Hamtramck and made these little food samples.

147
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:01,679
And we had three apples. It was Granny Smith, Gold Delicious and Honeycrisp.

148
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:08,250
And then we had the kids rate, which was their favorite, and they really loved that as a fun activity.

149
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:13,739
So we're hoping to do more work. We don't have anything planned as of right now.

150
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:19,500
We are serving this, the teachers, to see what kind of activities they're interested in,

151
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:28,810
because that one of the things that we found that's really important for this work is that the teachers really need to be engaged.

152
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:33,450
The principal, Vicki, she's been really great to work with,

153
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:41,070
but the teachers also have to be on board and excited about the work because they are the main driver and help,

154
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:43,730
you know, do the activities with the kids.

155
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:58,319
So we're working on that and we're also actually in the state steps of making a food pantry with a church in Grand Rapids.

156
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:07,420
So there's a. The Enemies church that is interested in having that food pantry status so that they can

157
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:15,700
provide food to their congregation and specifically more culturally relevant foods.

158
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:28,360
And so they they need that status. And the partner or the organization that does that certification process is feeding America.

159
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:34,720
So we are helping them, like apply for that.

160
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,780
So then I'm going to talk about our publications next.

161
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:50,000
And the first one is the grocery store study that we did.

162
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:57,310
So we actually used the Nutrition Environment Measures Survey from the University of Pennsylvania.

163
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:04,700
And this is a pretty gold standard survey for looking at grocery stores and convenience stores.

164
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:08,060
And when I was looking at the two different surveys,

165
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:15,920
I actually found that the convenience store survey had a lot more thorough questions and included a lot more

166
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:25,370
information that was helpful because some of the stores had certain these certain items and that wasn't found,

167
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:28,850
but they didn't find on the regular store survey.

168
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:38,810
So that's why I chose that one. And also, these stores tend to be smaller, too, so they're more like a convenience store size.

169
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:46,280
But then we used the way we went about finding the stores that we were going to survey.

170
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:50,780
We used policy map to identify all the locations.

171
00:21:51,770 --> 00:22:00,320
So that was 42 off. And then we had to go back through and exclude the gas stations and the stores.

172
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:04,100
So we ended up carrying it down to 21 stores.

173
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:09,090
And this is just a picture of Hamtramck.

174
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:13,350
Used to be very foolish. So much so.

175
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:18,030
This is just an. Yes, just. Yeah.

176
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:22,760
So this is an example of some of the stories that I went to.

177
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:27,240
So a lot of them looked like the two pictures on the left and middle.

178
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:33,120
There were kind of somewhat organized but very dirty.

179
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:43,350
Like it was winter. There was like cardboard everywhere, like leaks, like just different things and nothing.

180
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:46,590
None of the shelves were really labeled. There weren't.

181
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:50,340
It was hard to find price stickers on the items.

182
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:53,640
They were usually just like little white stickers.

183
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:58,229
But there is one really nice grocery store.

184
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:02,520
It's called al-Haram, meaning that one that is the one on the right.

185
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:08,430
And they were the one store that actually had a good variety of fruits and vegetables.

186
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:18,450
And something that I also found was a lot of expired goods, which is common and easy to find in the literature,

187
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:27,299
that that's a lot of something that people that immigrants that move here, something that they notice.

188
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:30,960
It's not a mixed bag. And so that's the picture up there.

189
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:37,559
But the scores actually range kind of on the lower end.

190
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:41,520
There's 58 points that you can get total.

191
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:48,929
But our scores for the Hamtramck area range from 4 to 33 and the average was 16.

192
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:57,059
So 16 out of 58 is like pretty low and 13 out stories out of 21 offered fruit.

193
00:23:57,060 --> 00:24:08,670
So that's about just over half. 11 stores offered any vegetables and then only seven stores actually offered three or more fruits and vegetables.

194
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:15,179
And then eight stores had brown rice. Seven stores had 4 to 6 types of legumes.

195
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:18,870
So something they do have legumes there.

196
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:22,900
And but the whole grains was definitely lacking.

197
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:29,850
They typically eat more white rice and jasmine rice, stuff like that.

198
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,610
So do you think if there's anything else I want to say about that?

199
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:42,630
Rachel Yeah, the, the scoring. So I assume it's scoring for quality.

200
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:52,499
So if you to get 58 points, it would mean just a greater variety of fruits and vegetables.

201
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:56,219
Yeah. And there's I think I'd have to go back and look at it,

202
00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:05,360
but there's like some of the measures include like quality ratings to read the fruits and vegetables.

203
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:11,670
So yeah, it's not just, it's like availability, quality.

204
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:17,090
And then I'm trying to think of there's like a third thing that they kind of know, but that gets me.

205
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:22,559
I mean, that makes sense because people will say that there may be fruits and vegetables at these stores,

206
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:27,750
but they look like they've been there for three weeks. So the quality is yeah, yeah.

207
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:40,709
That's kind of yeah, that's built in in the survey. So one of the things that we can learn through writing research papers or that I've

208
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:47,280
learned is adding as many statistics and methodology explanations as possible,

209
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:55,319
because a lot of the reviewers don't like being from a different area of research that are reading your paper.

210
00:25:55,320 --> 00:26:02,390
They may not be in public health or dietetics, and they may not be familiar with the measures that you're using.

211
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,310
So that's really helpful.

212
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:16,200
Also, double checking numbers, which I'm still working on and getting better at, also being clear in definitions and using inclusive language.

213
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:26,549
We had to go through our breastfeeding paper that for an intro grant in our work that we did with UHC because they didn't want us

214
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:37,560
to use I think they wanted to switch us to switch from like women to like breastfeeding persons or people or something like that.

215
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:45,450
So and then they also like one of them said, Oh, we don't know what which is.

216
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:51,300
So like dieticians, like we know what work is, but someone else may not know.

217
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:54,240
So we just had to give like a little quick definition.

218
00:26:55,470 --> 00:27:04,440
Also in one of our papers, they wanted us to provide like a evidence based model for like our research.

219
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:08,670
So that was for our food insecurity and diabetes paper.

220
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:19,830
So we found this public health innovation model, which we kind of only cover, like the upper right hand side,

221
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:27,450
because we communicated with our community partners and kind of got their buy in.

222
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:33,180
So that's the commitment section. And then we jumped to planning.

223
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:39,629
So we kind of like defined the problem, which is we were looking at food security,

224
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:57,510
insecurity and diabetes and then we implemented or created the research to find out what was going on and see also.

225
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:11,670
Oh yeah, when you're designing interventions, something that we've also tried to do is look in the literature and find research methods.

226
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:17,160
So we ended up using the hunger vital sign for the food insecurity part of that paper.

227
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:27,150
And there's it's two questions. That is the food is it's food insecurity screening tool.

228
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:38,959
So we use those two questions in our survey. So continuing on with that study.

229
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:49,520
So we actually collected 168 surveys and found that a lot of Asians are not aware that they have a higher risk of diabetes.

230
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:55,159
So 53.3%. And that kind of varied.

231
00:28:55,160 --> 00:29:05,750
So the Southeast Asians, they were 56% of them were aware, 54.8% of South Asians were aware and then 47.8% of East Asians.

232
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:15,620
And I should add that we defined each section of our populations that we were looking at.

233
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:23,239
So Southeast Asians are the Burmese, Filipino, Lao, Thai and Vietnamese.

234
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:30,080
Then ourselves group was Nepali, Bangladeshi, Indian and then East was Chinese, Hmong and Korean.

235
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:40,160
So that's how we kind of group them. And 48% of the participants reported having ever been tested for diabetes.

236
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:46,160
We did look at gestational diabetes and food insecurity, but there was no correlation.

237
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:56,480
And we also looked at high blood pressure and BMI and found that 50% of East Asians were diagnosed with high blood pressure,

238
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:10,070
which was statistically significant. And the mean BMI for the participants was 25.6, which is higher than their the cutoff.

239
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:18,590
So that meant that 60.8% of the participants had a BMI over the cutoff of 23 or greater.

240
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:23,000
And that's actually a BMI cutoff.

241
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:29,239
That is it's different for all the other racial and ethnic groups.

242
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:35,299
It's lower for Asians because they have genetic differences.

243
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:46,370
They have genetic factors like higher body fat and less muscle mass and also more just disposed to having that visceral fat,

244
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:57,530
which is increases your risk for type two diabetes. So that reason why they're at a higher risk.

245
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:06,080
And then we a big finding in our paper was that food insecurity was actually negatively associated with BMI,

246
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:11,569
with study participants who were overweight, reporting less food insecurity.

247
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:15,469
So it was kind of like a counterintuitive finding.

248
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:22,700
And in our explanation, if you read the paper in the discussion section,

249
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:32,120
we talk about how it's more of a negative association or negative correlation because

250
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:42,290
there's possibly access to unhealthy foods that people with more food security have.

251
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:47,060
And so that's why they're overweight. But it was statistically significant.

252
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:55,850
And another thing that I forgot to cite was the prevalence of type two diabetes in

253
00:31:55,850 --> 00:32:05,450
Asian Americans in the US is 16.7% compared to 11.3% among the general U.S. population.

254
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:11,420
So that's another reason that's just kind of the background of where we were coming from.

255
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:24,800
Yeah. And then one more thing that I wanted to add was that when we were looking at the literature,

256
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:32,630
there was a study that had enhanced data and they found that South Asians had a higher prevalence of diabetes.

257
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:43,850
But in our study we reported a lower prevalence, but that's most likely because they weren't as tested for diabetes, so they were less likely.

258
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:48,170
So that means they weren't showing up because they weren't being tested for diabetes.

259
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:58,729
So we found some interesting and some interesting findings and then some limitations that we had.

260
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:05,230
We didn't collect any income data or look at their participation in our way.

261
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:10,880
We didn't look at some of the research articles that I read.

262
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:13,399
They looked at like migration, stress,

263
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:22,520
and they said their level of acculturation could kind of probably play into food insecurity and their risk of diabetes.

264
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:27,829
And then we don't know if these participants were actually food secure prior to COVID 19.

265
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:34,970
So that's a whole nother ballgame. That could be a huge factor in playing with.

266
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:43,140
Their food insecurity. So that's plan for that.

267
00:33:43,470 --> 00:34:02,380
Are there any questions? What have you enjoyed most about working with the different communities and your job in general?

268
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:21,660
I see. Probably that I get to like have more of like a direct impact and like work with art.

269
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:30,010
I don't know. I feel like I get to kind of be on the cutting edge and work directly with populations.

270
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:33,879
And it's like we can go like we're directly connected to the source,

271
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:41,170
like the community center or the the Vietnamese church or whatever, food pantry, whatever it may be.

272
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:49,060
So like we can kind of, I don't know, make changes or like come up with new programs pretty quickly.

273
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:58,780
So yeah, I mean, another thing is like the education part of it too, and being able to do something different every day.

274
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:04,930
So yeah, it's, that's, I never get bored because it's different every day.

275
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:12,790
Yeah. I was going to ask in terms of kind of all of the different areas that you work on.

276
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:16,450
So like the social media and the event planning and kind of like all of that.

277
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:24,400
You might have said this when you started, but are you just by yourself or is there another registered dietitian who works with you or are you.

278
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:28,360
Oh, yeah. So I have two professors that I work with.

279
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:31,480
So we are constitute the nutrition team.

280
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:38,679
So I'm the coordinator and I like and basically the hands and feet of the nutrition domain

281
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:44,049
and like coordinate planning everything and then we have like our weekly check in meetings.

282
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:48,340
So, you know, they'll ask me or tell me like, Hey, you need to do this or.

283
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:52,390
So then I go off and you know, whatever projects are going on.

284
00:35:52,990 --> 00:36:01,360
So yeah. And I, since I'm like no time and they're only part time because they do, they have their normal teaching assignments.

285
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:08,920
I'm like the main person, like doing everything and pulling everything together in the nutrition doing.

286
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:18,860
Yeah. What other experiences did you have while you were here that led you to this role?

287
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:29,389
Oh, yeah. Um, I did have some community rotations in my head to do dietetic internship, so I did the match,

288
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:38,900
and I ended up doing the internship through the hospital like U of M, I did the pediatric pediatric focused one.

289
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:47,720
So it was mainly clinical, but I did get to work with like the Action Network and Hope Gardens,

290
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:54,290
and I just found that I really enjoyed that work and I got to do some education there with kids.

291
00:36:54,290 --> 00:37:00,290
So I kind of found that I like that and nutrition a lot.

292
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:13,940
What did you do for your summer internship? For my summer internship, I went to the summer camp in New Hampshire.

293
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:19,100
Yeah, so I was a food allergy. Food allergy specialist.

294
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:23,900
So was like a whole it was basically all summer is three months long.

295
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:29,359
So it's like a huge it's called Camp Bartlett, Walt Whitman.

296
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:37,610
But they have like, I want to say it's around 200 staff and 400 kids that like are all there.

297
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:50,430
So it's a big camp. I had like a group of about 20 kids that had some food allergies that I had to kind of manage and look out for.

298
00:37:50,450 --> 00:38:03,830
So. I was just going to comment that your job is a really nice mix of research and hands on in the community.

299
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:09,250
Yeah. Yeah, it's it's interesting.

300
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:18,940
Yeah. That we sometimes we have to, like, offer our services it's and like go out and like,

301
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:23,870
you know, because some of the work that we've done is like nutrition standards.

302
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:33,550
So we'll say, hey, do you want to set up, you know, a nutrition policy and for like your events or, you know, this program that you have.

303
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:43,690
And then sometimes they'll ask us to do something like, for example, Jenny Kennedy release they used to do before COVID.

304
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:52,210
They had like an after school program. And after that they kind of the director switched to like more online stuff.

305
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:58,839
And so I ended up doing like virtual afterschool workshops for the kids, which was really fun.

306
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:02,319
So like one workshop we did in the winter,

307
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:10,840
we made snowflakes and little energy balls and I like gave that I made up little kids

308
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:15,130
and like gave them to the director and then she came out to the different families.

309
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:26,920
So it's a two way street, which is nice to hear because you don't always with community interventions, you don't always see that.

310
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:38,590
I mean, to some degree, right? But I mean, I, there's a lot of that going on in this particular group.

311
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:42,280
Yeah. Which is great I'm sure. And yeah.

312
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:49,599
And our request for the, the food pantry thing, it was only through our coalition meeting that we had in September.

313
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:55,540
We invited all of our partners from all over the state to come to Eastern.

314
00:39:55,540 --> 00:40:04,000
And we kind of just shared when our group was working on and, you know, kind of asked them like, what do you guys need?

315
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:10,480
And so through that, one of the attendees was my friend that came to start a food pantry.

316
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:19,850
Like, Can you help us out? I was just curious if you know what the rationale was for using that to question

317
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:27,430
hunger survey versus the even the food security one survey that the USDA puts out?

318
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:38,470
Oh, that's a good question. I think it's I think the reason we used it because it was pretty simple language that hunger vital sounds really easy.

319
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:45,520
So. And then what's the future for reach?

320
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:50,190
So that is in the works.

321
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:54,890
I have heard that they're going to apply for another round of funding.

322
00:40:55,670 --> 00:41:01,360
Our year starts at the beginning of October and ends at the end of September next year.

323
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:05,410
So maybe applying for another round.

324
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:10,960
Not so. I'm not staying for another round, but.

325
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:24,850
Any other questions for Rachel? Well, if you say you're not staying for another round, you know what that's going to look like for me.

326
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:29,399
I am planning to move to North Carolina. My best friend lives down there.

327
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:37,710
And yeah, she's going to look for kind of jump off either into or nutrition coaching area.

328
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:43,320
I've been wanting to start my own business for a long, long time, but I might.

329
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:47,520
I kind of want to have a full time job still, like, well, I'm setting that up.

330
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:55,080
So that's something I want to do or kind of work in a similar public health sphere.

331
00:41:56,310 --> 00:42:03,959
I would like to avoid clinical but will see something in the public health

332
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:07,800
or nutrition education because I feel like that's one of my favorite places,

333
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:20,339
nutrition. And even like I even briefly when I was in my internship, we had a a corporate dietician from Aramark who came and spoke to us.

334
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:25,940
So I could definitely see since my role is like being a convener,

335
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:31,590
like it's been creating programs which is very similar to what like a corporate dietitian does for employees.

336
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:34,210
And so I could see myself maybe doing that.

337
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:49,130
Did you take any classes while you were here that really helped you with what you're doing, especially with education?

338
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:58,860
Yes, I would say. The motivational interviewing class was helpful.

339
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:08,220
Maybe not. Maybe in an indirect way with my work, because I don't get to do like one on one with people.

340
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:13,470
But I think that's a good back counts for talking to people.

341
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:22,320
And then. We took anything in each of you that was helpful.

342
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:28,650
Yeah, I think that was helpful for, like, the stages of behavior change.

343
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:35,790
So that's kind of. And also trying to remember which class talks about the social determinants of health.

344
00:43:35,790 --> 00:43:42,160
But we talk about that a lot in this work and that's all over the literature.

345
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:47,290
So yeah, they're taking a class, specifically social determinants.

346
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:53,790
Okay. Is that true? I think it's the same public health.

347
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:56,970
It's just the public part. Public health core. Okay. Yeah.

348
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:01,530
Might maybe a little different. Yeah. I didn't know if you were taken.

349
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:07,610
There's a sticky communication course through each of you that some students had talked about in the past.

350
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:14,400
I think it's still taught, but I didn't know if that would help in terms of education.

351
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:23,600
Yeah. The other thing I think was definitely like bio statistics, like it didn't stick up really very well.

352
00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:25,799
My rank and statistics is hard,

353
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:35,940
but it is very useful if you're going to be writing research papers to remember like the definitions and like what the values actually mean.

354
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:41,580
So yeah, yeah. Trying to keep that in the back of your brain is really helpful.

355
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:51,720
And any I think there is an evaluation course program program that that would be helpful too.

356
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:59,070
I didn't take that, but I know how it is. Okay. And now everybody has to take a course that has program evaluation in it.

357
00:44:59,210 --> 00:45:05,520
Yeah. Okay. Yeah, that's right. They had.

358
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:11,260
Rachel, thank you so much. Really a pleasure to have you here.

359
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:31,960
Okay. So just a reminder that you have one more assignment to do this semester.

360
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:40,100
So if you were not in class on Monday or last Wednesday, please be sure to go through the assignment.

361
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:50,049
One thing I'm noticing with the community assessment reports is that I think folks

362
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:55,840
forgot to read the instructions and we're using the example of a little bit more.

363
00:45:56,830 --> 00:46:05,649
Not that you'll have well, you have some examples for the one pager, but just again, you're going the rubric is based on the instructions.

364
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:15,850
So please, please, please make sure you go through and read the assignment instructions and just don't rely on the examples to guide you.

365
00:46:15,850 --> 00:46:23,140
I mean, they're there to help you get an idea of what it might look like, but it's the instructions that you want to rely on.

366
00:46:23,770 --> 00:46:31,720
Also, if you were not in class last Wednesday, the slides, probably the last third or half,

367
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:37,480
all have websites where you can find evidence based interventions.

368
00:46:38,410 --> 00:46:44,080
And so use those slides, review the Panopto recording and so forth that you need to get yourself.

369
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:55,060
You need to find an evidence based intervention first to then be able to develop your one pager as well as you gather your oral presentation.

370
00:46:55,690 --> 00:47:04,059
So I'm going to hang out and look to see what time it is where we to send 1050.

371
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:12,280
Okay. So I'm just going to hang out after class if anybody has any questions about their assignment.

372
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:17,589
Otherwise, have a great rest for the week weekend and I'll see you guys on Monday.

373
00:47:17,590 --> 00:47:21,870
We only have one class last week. Monday. Right.

374
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:24,930
So now we have assets coming.
