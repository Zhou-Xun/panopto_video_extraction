1
00:00:26,520 --> 00:01:03,780
Okay. But keep.

2
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:33,219
Hank started an to get through the day and I think so we're going to finish up our discussion of food labeling to allergens.

3
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:41,010
So I'm just going to start with that. And then we're going to take a look at front of package labeling.

4
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:49,710
And then you guys had a reading today that's relevant to the front of your show.

5
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:58,229
But before I start on food allergens, I just wanted to just touch base.

6
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:03,360
We're going to finish up, as I said today, the labeling discussion on Monday,

7
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:13,469
Sarah Finney from the Food and Nutrition Service at the USDA, the regional office in Chicago, will be visiting the class.

8
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:17,970
She'll be visiting via Zoom. That will be in person.

9
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:35,040
Sarah is a registered dietitian and she worked for a school service program for a school district and then went to F.A. at least last year.

10
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,689
Part of her job was working with the school lunch program and talk about somebody who has

11
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:46,590
experience working as a food service director in a school district and then going to the USDA.

12
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,590
So she will talk about the school lunch program.

13
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:56,820
She probably will talk briefly about some of the programs that the food and Nutrition Service oversees.

14
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:05,159
So that'll be a bit of a review. But then the bulk of it will be about the school lunch program.

15
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:11,430
And she's a great resource for questions both at school lunch as well as career.

16
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:17,580
And she is going to talk about her career path and what led her to USDA last year.

17
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:25,799
Few students came up to me after and said, You know, it never occurred to me and I'm becoming a dietitian to go and work for the government.

18
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,640
And I said, people like you working in the government.

19
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:41,430
So so anyway, she will be visiting on Monday and then on the ninth I'll introduce nutrition intervention programs.

20
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:47,370
The ninth is also the date for your needs is your community assessment report.

21
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:55,800
And if you weren't here in class on Friday or Friday, Monday months, if you weren't here on Monday because I may not be around this weekend,

22
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:00,540
I extended the due date a couple of days so that if you had questions over the weekend,

23
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:05,969
I'd be able to address them on Monday or Tuesday before TV or before you submit.

24
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:09,450
So we have a new due date for your community assessment report.

25
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:15,240
And then on the ninth, I'm going to introduce your final project in this class.

26
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:24,269
It's an extension of your needs assessment based on the priorities that you identify in your needs assessment.

27
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:31,889
That is what you think the community might want to address with some type of intervention recall.

28
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:36,180
You're not going to be discussing interventions in your needs assessment report.

29
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:41,070
You're just going to highlight the priorities that filtered out of the data.

30
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:50,340
This is an opportunity to find an evidence based intervention in response to one of the priorities in your assessment.

31
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:57,540
And you're going to develop an advocacy one pager that will advocate for this

32
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:05,730
intervention as if you were conveying it to a stakeholder city council community meeting.

33
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:14,189
So it's a really nice way to kind of come a little bit of a full circle assessment and then identifying an

34
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:21,840
evidence based intervention that the community could consider implementing in response to the needs assessment.

35
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:28,860
So I'll be going over that on the ninth. I just wanted to circle back.

36
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:37,020
Stephanie got back to me was there were some questions in class when she covered Blake and one of the questions was,

37
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,240
is there different wake income guidelines in the state of Michigan?

38
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:48,690
And in fact, the income guidelines are the same across the United States.

39
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:56,670
Alaska and Hawaii have different income guidelines because the cost of living in those two states is more expensive.

40
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:01,920
So she wanted me to convey that to you.

41
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:11,370
And also a couple of questions came up about barriers to participating in way and actually that's a really good.

42
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:23,280
Academy reports that Khatami was actually asked to do an overview for which a lot of different information is in this report,

43
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:30,870
but one of which is in the appendix is this whole table of barriers to participating and which so some of these barriers are here,

44
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:42,809
stigma associated with competing in a government assistance program due to lack of awareness issues related to transportation.

45
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:53,760
So prior to COVID, moms and children had to be in-person, especially to get in for metric measurements and so forth.

46
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,220
So there was issues in terms of related to transportation.

47
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:08,490
That's a key example of a social determinant of how transportation or lack of transportation can impact health.

48
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:16,100
And then limitations of wick approved items. So there's actually a number of issues with grocery stores.

49
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:27,829
Either it's a small store that doesn't carry all of the items, or they had experienced issues in grocery stores where the staff was not well informed,

50
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:36,050
educated on which items or they were treated poorly by staff and other customers.

51
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:45,650
So these are just some of the areas. And so for those of you interested, there's a link here and also Stephanie's contact information.

52
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:49,459
So I reached out to her and this is actually the preferred contact information.

53
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:57,950
So for those of you interested in maternal and child nutrition and health and interested in a possible summer internship, you can reach out to her.

54
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:11,800
Any questions about this? I wanted to follow up regarding draft submissions.

55
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:17,229
I have not gotten any. Nobody's really reached out. So I'm hoping my explanations.

56
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:22,150
I know some of them can be lengthy. Hopefully they were self-explanatory.

57
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:29,920
But again, if you have any questions that are related to my comments on your draft, please reach out to me.

58
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:33,220
But I just want to go over some of the general things that I saw.

59
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:38,200
One inconsistent capitalization of your tables and figures.

60
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:44,740
So there might be five major words in the title, and only two were capitalized with sort of random.

61
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:52,930
So in general, this is a good rule of thumb, and I am so here.

62
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:56,320
All major words should be capitalized in the title.

63
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:01,900
Minor words, three letters or less, or lowercase.

64
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:07,210
Now obviously something like the name of a city and arbor and is going to be capitalized.

65
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:11,730
Right. But it's just minor words. So this is a good rule of thumb.

66
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:14,469
This is one of those things that when you're at the end of your report,

67
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:21,100
you can go through and do some of those like little housekeeping cleaning, you know, make sure you have some free capitalization.

68
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:28,259
The reason why we go over this at the graduate level is because you only have two

69
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:33,540
years to get used to elevating your writing to a much more professional level.

70
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:41,250
And it can take two years to kind of have all of this sort of information kind of there and intuitive.

71
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,930
You don't want your professional writing when you're actually out working to undermine your

72
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:59,520
integrity as a professional simply because it's poor writing or or sentence structure and grammar.

73
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,370
So this is why we're going over it.

74
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:12,720
The caveat to the capitalization is recognizing that in journal articles, theses and so forth, there are different requirements.

75
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:18,360
So, for example, a figure oftentimes in a journal article is not going to be at the top, it's going to be at the bottom.

76
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:25,650
And oftentimes figure titles are not capitalized except for the very first letter of the first word.

77
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:34,350
This is not a journal article. And so for all your titles, for your tables and figures, I want them to be consistent at the top.

78
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:41,220
This, again, would be a document that the public would have access to, and they're going to look for it at the top.

79
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:47,190
And it's just ease of also you have your citation, your source citation underneath.

80
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:56,850
Also, just another thing I noticed is that some of you had figures in which the labels of your X and y axis as well as the legend.

81
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:03,030
Really, really, really, really small. It needs to be readable by a reader.

82
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:11,490
Okay. So make sure your font for any of your figures for your labels is big enough for a reader to actually.

83
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:24,649
You know. And I also want to just highlight that if you have a figure bar graph, if there is a category like if you're presenting something by race,

84
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:28,160
ethnicity and there's a category where there's just basically no data,

85
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:35,239
take that category out of your graph because that looks odd when there's a space and nothing's there.

86
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,180
You can just say in the text that maybe.

87
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:52,900
The percentage of Native American or Pacific Islander, Hawaiian Hawaiian Pacific Islander is, you know, .03 or 0.3 or something like that.

88
00:11:53,110 --> 00:12:00,520
I'm just saying that for some of you, you had nothing in your bar graph for a particular category.

89
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:07,120
And in a bar graph that looks odd. So just take it out in terms of your tables.

90
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:13,480
You can leave. I'm going to jump ahead. You can leave those categories if there's not.

91
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:23,110
This is just an example. I'm not saying in Ann Arbor there is not any percentage for American Indian or Alaska Native, but I just need an example.

92
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:31,390
Some of you are including categories where the sample size is too small to count or be reliable from the Census Bureau.

93
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:34,630
If you choose to include it, you don't have to.

94
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:42,040
You guys are one of the first cohorts to really actually include categories that are categories but no data.

95
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:46,150
In the years past, students just didn't include the category in a table.

96
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:53,290
But if you do, just make sure you have a little footnote at the bottom of the table for the reader to let them know what end means.

97
00:12:53,290 --> 00:13:00,730
Or if you're using an asterisks or whatever in that cell where there's no number, you need to let the reader know why.

98
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:09,490
Okay. So just make sure you include a little footnote underneath the source citation list so you can put your hand up.

99
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:21,639
Oh, yeah. But I looked at the example from like last year and they had explained like, Oh, this population, there was not enough data collected yet.

100
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:25,040
So is that good? We should explain that when we're writing about it.

101
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:34,240
If you don't have if you have a table and you don't have and you have an RN with something underneath it, you don't have to.

102
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:38,470
If you were in practice, you would want to just highlight that.

103
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:43,510
That would be very thorough to include it both in text and underneath the table or figure.

104
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:49,950
But. I'm not expecting none of you guys because you guys have other stuff you need to do,

105
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,760
but in practice you would because you want to inform the reader as much as possible.

106
00:13:53,910 --> 00:14:01,860
Right. You don't want to have them guessing. The table should be self-explanatory, which is why you want to put a footnote if you have missing data.

107
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:06,750
But that would be very thorough to also include it in the text.

108
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,960
If you choose to, you won't be graded if you don't include that.

109
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,629
Thank you. Demographic Economics Section.

110
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:19,170
So this first section where you're getting data from the U.S. Census Bureau,

111
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:28,200
you need to when you go when you address an indicator such as education attainment, median income.

112
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:46,000
And oh, I would say education attainment, median income and like I have health and nutrition of my brain scan planets.

113
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:49,080
Thank you. Thank you. Unemployment still thinking, Nicole?

114
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:57,610
Any indicator that you go through and you present, you need to relate that indicator to your nutrition and health concern.

115
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:08,410
In other words, why is it important that education attainment, unemployment, poverty, the optional one,

116
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:15,940
and your social determinants of health might be transportation or housing, like whether they rent or own a home.

117
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:25,870
Why is that indicator important? So hopefully you can take citations from your social determinants of health section on your background,

118
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:34,840
from your background paper, and use those as explanations as to why it's important that we look at education attainment.

119
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:46,150
Why? Because we know from the literature that low education attainment has been found to be associated with adverse health outcomes.

120
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:55,020
He's up for it. Or it might even be for those of you who have specific topics like food access.

121
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:00,510
Lower education may be related directly to poor food access.

122
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:10,530
So it's important in the U.S. Census Bureau section of your paper that you link your indicators to.

123
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:15,630
One sentence is enough. You can do it at the very end where you're highlighting each of the data.

124
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:23,970
But I want you to link it so that I and that I know you understand why you are highlighting that indicator in the assessment report.

125
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,600
In practice, you may or may not choose to do this, but I haven't.

126
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:32,940
I want you guys to do it so that I know you understand why you collected that data.

127
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:40,730
Okay. Same for y you present your population distribution by race ethnicity.

128
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:48,680
Because we know that some populations we know there's disparities in terms of health outcomes.

129
00:16:49,360 --> 00:17:03,730
Right. So. All right. In the citation of your tables and figures, make sure you include the agency first and then the survey.

130
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:07,640
I know one of the examples did not.

131
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:14,270
But it's really important that you include the agency in practice.

132
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:20,270
I know especially assessments that have a lot of data coming from the U.S. Census Bureau.

133
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:28,400
They'll often just use American community survey instead of saying U.S. Census Bureau than American Community Survey.

134
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:37,250
But it's really important practice to always have the name of the agency, then the survey, so that the reader knows where the data is coming from.

135
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:43,610
The census should not begin with new else.

136
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:49,440
That's another just writing, Annika.

137
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:59,200
The example here is the sentences that 13% of adults in whatever community completed high school education,

138
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:04,660
any kind of number at the beginning of the Senate should be spelled out. Okay.

139
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:12,520
So if you have a percentage, that's maybe something like 12.9% of adults.

140
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:17,589
You don't have to spell it out by saying 12.9.

141
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:23,830
Instead, you can just say nearly 13% or approximately 13%.

142
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:28,930
Okay. So the whole point here is you don't want to be in your number, your sentences with numbers.

143
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:32,320
Numbers can be insensitive. They just should not begin.

144
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:43,060
And then the other point I just wanted to highlight is a number of you had your percentage estimates in your tables carried out to the hundreds.

145
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:48,610
Only the 10th is necessary. So, like in this table here.

146
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:59,050
Right. Percentages are carried to the 10th. And then the last thing is, please, please, please review assignment instructions.

147
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:05,830
Sometimes I go in and clarify or add additional information to clarify.

148
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:10,600
I know some of you have kind of copied the instructions within your document.

149
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:17,139
When you're doing your draft, that's fine. But you've got to go back and see if I've added anything or changed anything.

150
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:23,049
I'm not changing it like turning it upside down on you guys, but sometimes those questions about some of the instructions.

151
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:26,320
So I go in and I add or clarify.

152
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:34,750
So please go back and review the instructions before you do final submission before you move from one segment to the next.

153
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:45,010
Okay. The last thing I wanted to go over was just what Liz saw from the background.

154
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:53,530
There was really heavy, heavy use of parentheses or not parentheses quotes for sentences.

155
00:19:53,530 --> 00:20:05,510
And oftentimes it was where you were presenting data or you're presenting findings from a paper, heavy reliance on quotes instead of paraphrasing.

156
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:15,470
Okay, so quotes are fine in papers if you're providing like a definition from the USDA of what food security means.

157
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:23,140
So if you're providing a definition or something very specific that's coming from an agency, that's fine use quotes.

158
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:30,040
If you're using quotes because you're not comfortable paraphrasing and you're worried about plagiarism, I get it.

159
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:37,090
Nobody got points taken off. But this is a time for you to start using the speech writing clinic to get help.

160
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:44,440
Because by the time you're done, you should not be using quotes because you don't know how to paraphrase that.

161
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:53,080
Well impact. I just have to tell you that if I saw a document from a professional and they were using quotes,

162
00:20:53,320 --> 00:21:03,970
instead of understanding the findings and just saying in their own words, it would impact my opinion of them as a professional.

163
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:13,200
Right. That they perhaps didn't understand it. So I just want you to be just it's just something to start working on, right?

164
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:21,400
That if you're not comfortable with paraphrasing. And again, I understand that you didn't want to risk plagiarism,

165
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:26,290
but it's an important time to start using resources so that you can work on this skill set.

166
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:36,579
To clarify, I see something in a study, I want to paraphrase it, but then I follow it up with a in parentheses,

167
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:42,760
a number that then refers to down to my reference section for that document that I pulled that paraphrase statement.

168
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:50,050
Correct? Correct. I mean, you always when I say paraphrasing, you're just presenting the study findings,

169
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:55,270
but if you put it in quotes, then that means you didn't paraphrase it for yourself.

170
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:59,680
But you always want to cite those statements. Yes. You're making a claim.

171
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:05,499
You're you're you're providing study findings in a statement.

172
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:13,000
That's what you always want, a citation. But then in your example, like according to the CDC, blah, blah, blah quotations,

173
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,280
I don't have to include a reference at that point because I've already said the CDC said, no, you do need to provide a reference.

174
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:22,330
Just stating the agency or just stating the author is not a sufficient citation.

175
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:30,799
I'll fix that. I also need citations. Yeah. Yeah. First Officer citations, can we sometimes just put the Web address where we got it,

176
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,940
as you want to see, like in CDC, Washington, D.C., all that information.

177
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:36,319
You need that information, too,

178
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:43,690
because you should be in the you should start getting used to doing that because that would be incomplete to just have that.

179
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:50,060
Yeah. Yeah. So now we're supposed to protect your background section to it and like, submitted this one file.

180
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:56,700
Yep. But I know it also states that, like, we will be created on the background section since we've already received already been graded.

181
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:03,320
Okay. So even if we were to make adjustments, you know, so if you want to submit any corrections or update, you know,

182
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:12,200
y you want to get some practice paraphrasing, you can submit it same as the food for thought, 50% of the points deducted.

183
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:17,930
But I don't want any background submitted until you get your community assessment report done.

184
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:22,820
So just submit your background section as it is without any comments as it is.

185
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:29,750
We're not. We need it to just remind ourselves what your assessment is about.

186
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:33,330
But I want it to be just a complete report. Yeah.

187
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:43,969
And just the reminder that your reference page should be, you know, whatever references you had in your background section.

188
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:53,390
And then if there's new references in your community assessment, you just start, you just append your reference page.

189
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:59,600
So again, you're going to be using numbers, numerals in parentheses, not brackets, parentheses.

190
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:06,590
It's really important to follow instructions to get used to it because if you were to submit to

191
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:12,290
an agency or to a journal and you use brackets instead of parentheses or you did superscript.

192
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:18,680
It could get rejected simply because you weren't following the formatting requirements.

193
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:25,460
So it's just good policy to just start getting used to those kinds of instructions.

194
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:34,650
Yes. Well, yes. So the U.S. Census Bureau, where we're gathering all our data with that goal and the references as well.

195
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:37,760
And then when we're talking about it, we split the number with it.

196
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:45,910
Or do we just leave it underneath the table? Source citations underneath your tables and figures do not go into your references.

197
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:57,080
Those are standalone source citations. The only time you need to include something into your reference page is if you're discussing

198
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:03,590
maybe linking the indicator to your nutrition or health concern and you have a citation for it.

199
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:10,850
And maybe it's not you. You do need to cite those statements and maybe it's not a citation that you used in the background section.

200
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:15,170
Then you're going to be amending your reference page.

201
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:23,990
Also, if you introduce the statistic in the text that's not from a table, then that needs a citation.

202
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:33,989
Does that make sense? So if you have, let's say, in the very beginning with population distribution,

203
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:41,340
you have a big table that has all the ages and you introduce your community and you say the total population is x,

204
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:49,260
x, x, and then you say the gender breakdown is 51% women or females.

205
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:56,200
49% males that those two percentages may not be coming from the table.

206
00:25:56,410 --> 00:26:01,660
You're introducing just two stats in the text. That sentence needs a citation.

207
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:03,550
That makes sense.

208
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:12,040
If you're if you're talking about data that's from a table in your statements, you don't need a citation at the end of that sentence.

209
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:18,610
But if you introduce new stats in the text, it needs a citation because the reader won't know where it's coming from.

210
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:22,780
So do we put like, Oh, look at figure one or table one as reference.

211
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:27,339
As you're talking about data, you refer the reader to table one.

212
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:31,320
Table two. Yep. So they know where it's coming from? Yep.

213
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:41,470
That makes sense to everybody. Any questions about Oh, that was great too.

214
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:45,290
So talking about use of not parentheses but quotes.

215
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:51,600
Also some of you talked about politicians and mayors as being potential stakeholders

216
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:57,570
for participating in the planning and implementation of a needs assessment.

217
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:07,430
I'm just going to let you know, politicians are not. Good go tos for stakeholders in planning and needs assessment and implementation.

218
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:16,719
What we're really talking about in conducting a needs assessment are people who know what kind of surveys,

219
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,170
if there is a survey that needs to be developed for the community.

220
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:25,330
They're familiar with the information developing the survey.

221
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:29,080
There's a whole host of reasons why stakeholders might be involved.

222
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:34,030
Maybe they have a particular interest in the health of women or children.

223
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:39,340
So health care professionals, school districts, teachers, parents,

224
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:50,900
but politicians are not the best choice because they really it's too specific for them to be involved in planning and needs assessment.

225
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,470
So I just wanted to kind of touch base with you on that.

226
00:27:55,690 --> 00:28:02,169
You really want people in on the committee who are actually going to bring important information to the

227
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:08,440
committee about how the needs assessment should be conducted and implemented and so forth and analyzed.

228
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:16,110
So having an epidemiologist is a good stakeholder like the, you know, an epidemiologist from the health department and so forth.

229
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:20,050
So I think that might be it.

230
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:25,930
Oh, the other thing, this is just another writing etiquette thing.

231
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:36,309
If you introduce an abbreviation like WEC or the FDA or the USDA, any kind of abbreviation,

232
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:41,350
you want to spell it out first for the reader and then put it in parentheses,

233
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:44,620
the abbreviation, and then for the rest of the paper you can use the abbreviation.

234
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:57,190
Okay. That's good. Basic paper writing is that you introduced the abbreviation early on and then spelling it out and then like body mass index.

235
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:00,580
Don't assume that they know what a body mass and a BMI is.

236
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:05,490
You spell it out. In some cases to be very thorough.

237
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:14,760
You also provide an explanation of what it is. You have to assume the readers don't know the specific terms and so on.

238
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:20,930
Okay. Any questions about what I've covered? Yes.

239
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,439
I just want to clarify for the background. If you do make corrections,

240
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:29,599
do you want that beforehand or do you just want it like to submit and you would know I want you to

241
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:35,150
submit it after like just winning that document and you would know and like look at it for me.

242
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,640
So just like the food is food for thought.

243
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:46,520
You guys can make revisions, get 50% of the points deducted and you would submit it to Liz cause she'll just be going over them.

244
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:51,400
I don't want you guys to do any submissions before your community assessment reports.

245
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:53,030
I want you guys to focus on this.

246
00:29:53,030 --> 00:30:00,170
I know you guys still have stuff you need to do, so I don't want revisions for background before the assessment papers submitted.

247
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:07,910
I don't care if you, in other words, your background section that you're submitting with your community assessment,

248
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:13,730
both paper is going to be the Unrevised background section, and that's fine.

249
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:19,170
And if you decide you want to revise it after.

250
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:25,030
You can just submit your background section to Liz with your updates.

251
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:29,559
Do it in a different font so she knows what you've done. Ideally,

252
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:34,690
I like any revisions for the background section to be submitted before Thanksgiving

253
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:38,770
so that Liz does not have a whole bunch during Thanksgiving hour after.

254
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:45,550
So any revisions, both food for thought or background section should be submitted to Liz before Thanksgiving.

255
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:55,230
At that point I already made the revisions, so it's okay if you've already done it, then go ahead and submit it to her.

256
00:30:55,230 --> 00:31:00,059
But I just didn't want anybody taking the time now to do it when I'd rather you be focusing.

257
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:03,900
If you've already done it, then go ahead and submit it to her. Yeah. Thank you.

258
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:12,620
Yep. Yep. All right.

259
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:16,490
I want to circle back to a question that Nicole had asked about the dual column.

260
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:24,650
And this actually has the regulate you well, has the instructions that would go to industry about using a dual column?

261
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:39,650
So what I do column is use for products that contain at least 200% and up to and including 300% of the applicable serving size.

262
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:47,920
So at least 200. And up to and including 300% of the serving size.

263
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:58,780
So the example here is a bag of chips. A 75 gram bag of chips is 250% of what a serving size of potato chips is.

264
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:11,430
And so we have here the serving size of we have the nutrition column or information for one serving size.

265
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:19,930
And then over here we have the nutrition information for the whole container or in the case of the bag of potato chips and be the whole bag.

266
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:27,370
And I just want to add.

267
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:35,340
So this rule pertains to products that are packaged and sold individually.

268
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:46,830
And again, we contain at least 200% and up to and including 300% of the RCC that the serving size.

269
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:52,920
So again, these are food products that are sold individually,

270
00:32:53,910 --> 00:33:00,960
even though they might have multiple serving sizes or servings in them, people can consume them in their entirety.

271
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:11,520
I think it's a box of mac and cheese is another great example where people I know my son does not just eat a cup of cheese,

272
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:17,760
even though the whole box of a mac and cheese. So there's a great example of where a dual column would be helpful.

273
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:22,739
Elizabeth, I so my question and I realize should brought this up last night too,

274
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:29,640
but when it comes to kind of basically like when we've updated the serving size based on what people eat,

275
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:37,440
yeah, I feel like I don't is there not a standardized way to kind of have like this is like one serving of this?

276
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:42,300
Because I think about the mac and cheese example, right? Like I also will eat a box by myself.

277
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:48,150
And I feel like sometimes there's foods that you're like, Oh, this serving isn't actually that much.

278
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:52,320
So I, you know, I don't know the insert, but again,

279
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:59,700
the servings are based on what is customarily eaten in one sitting at one time based on the Heinz survey.

280
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:06,450
So apparently mac and cheese, I can't remember what the serving size of the rack is for mac and cheese,

281
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:12,120
but apparently from the NHANES surveys, that is the average serving size.

282
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:19,230
So the company can choose to include a dual column, a beautiful box.

283
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:25,220
I guess the question I have with that is when Americans are historically over consuming,

284
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:37,170
like how like what is reported to and Heinz as what is consumed, is that kind of over what a healthy guideline would be for that?

285
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:43,770
I guess that's kind of my question. Like why? Why? I mean, we know that serving sizes have gotten bigger in this country.

286
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:47,040
Absolutely. So I guess that label does not address that.

287
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:56,640
And they can't really because we can come up with what would be sort of an appropriate serving size for for a number of foods.

288
00:34:56,970 --> 00:35:05,580
But again, we discussed that there are no sort of recommended serving sizes for potato chips and snack foods and pudding.

289
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:09,600
And, you know, there's just a whole host of foods that we just don't have recommended.

290
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:17,579
So, in fact, this is where you as dietitians and public health professionals can have a conversation with somebody,

291
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:25,650
especially if you're going over the label to just highlight, you know, this actually is just based on what people customarily consume.

292
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:35,220
This might be a little bit more than what you would actually consume, but that's why the calories are there, too.

293
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:40,020
Yeah, I understand what you're getting at, Elizabeth.

294
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:43,169
It's just not doing a good. No, no, no. I know exactly what you're saying.

295
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:53,630
It's just, you know, the FDA has not been able to, with their scientific advisory group, come up with a resolution to that expense.

296
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:58,500
And you have some foods that have racks and other foods recommended intake.

297
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:03,180
You know, it would be it adds more confusion because I just think too and it definitely would.

298
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:06,090
I just think for your examples about like putting or the chips,

299
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:12,659
I think and it'd just be a lot more work if you tried to highlight instead of calories, you'd be like, this is how much sodium and like this is.

300
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:17,040
You're, you're supposed to stay under this amount of sodium in a day, but that's just a lot more work.

301
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:21,220
So I can understand why there's a huge barrier there. That's why it also has the absolute amounts.

302
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:26,370
Right. And so that's again, our job is to help educate.

303
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:32,670
So those who are watching their sodium intake can look at the absolute amounts based on one serving size,

304
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:37,950
and they know what the serving is because they are required to actually say what the unit of measurement is.

305
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:46,830
So yeah, I hear you. It's just there hasn't been a really good way to address that.

306
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:57,550
So you guys will be gainfully employed on all these label claims.

307
00:36:57,580 --> 00:37:02,350
Couple of students had questions about claims that can be made on foods.

308
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:07,600
So we have nutrition, health and structure function claims on food products.

309
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:11,079
I don't have time to go through that, and I think it's pretty self-explanatory.

310
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:15,790
If you go on the FDA website, this is the link, this is the landing page.

311
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:26,560
They define what nutrition and health and structure function claims are on food products.

312
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:36,880
Okay. So if you're interested on everything from the nutrition would be like low fat, high fat, low sodium, high sodium.

313
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:46,270
Health claims have to do with, you know, a diet high in calcium has been shown to prevent risk of osteoporosis.

314
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:53,540
But all of these claims have to be appropriate, have to be accepted by the FDA.

315
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:58,930
In other words, the FDA will only tolerate certain claims based on scientific evidence.

316
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:06,160
And if your claim does not fulfill the criteria, then it can't be on the package.

317
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:11,380
So again, I it's a it's a actually a really interesting section to go through.

318
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:29,060
Okay. Food, allergens. So we in 2006 and 2004 implemented labeling of.

319
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:32,830
At the time we had eight major food allergens.

320
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:38,230
These all account for 90% of food allergies in the United States.

321
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:41,500
And it goes three eight, which is from wheat to shellfish.

322
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:48,190
No, shellfish does not include things like scallops and oysters and clams and mussels

323
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:55,030
because the prevalence of allergy to those particular types of shellfish is very low.

324
00:38:55,150 --> 00:39:00,970
So when they say shellfish, it's very specific to crab, lobster, shrimp all the way to soybeans.

325
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:14,280
Those of you interested in food allergies that are not here, lists that are not listed here, food into sensitivities and so forth like gluten.

326
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:18,250
Food coloring. Use this bottom line here.

327
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:28,629
You can also go into the FDA or just in Google, just type in gluten allergy and FDA and you'll pull up documents.

328
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:40,760
And they also have a ruling now that manufacturers need to indicate if there's gluten in the ingredients of the product.

329
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:48,340
There is no specific guideline of where it's indicated it could be on the front, could be on the back, but they have to indicate it.

330
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:55,030
And there is a threshold cutoff in terms of how much gluten can be.

331
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:58,450
It's out and has to be below 20 parts per million.

332
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,080
So there are guidelines.

333
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:12,330
It was updated in 2020 in terms of food products that have gluten labeling for people who have celiac or celiac disease and so forth.

334
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:21,520
So. So we now have nine major food allergens because sesame has been added to the list.

335
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:27,330
Thank goodness my son has a number of food allergies and sesame is one of them.

336
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:31,990
And it's awful because sesame can be included in spices.

337
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:37,960
Thankfully, we knew that tahini was a sesame product, but a lot of people wouldn't know this.

338
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:45,130
Maybe tahini is a sesame product. So thankfully manufacturers.

339
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:53,230
I can't remember what the date is. They have to start. They have to have sesame as part of the food allergen labeling.

340
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:58,210
It might be by January 2023 has to be on there.

341
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:09,650
So. And this is just a little bit about the efforts trying to get Sesame as one of their major allergens.

342
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:17,050
So this was something this was a letter that was for researchers and health professionals to the FDA commissioner.

343
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:24,940
It's an interesting letter, if you're interested. And then NIH felt that the FDA was not working fast, and I felt this.

344
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:30,610
And so then they started pushing out research findings regarding here.

345
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:37,090
It's showing that 17% of kids with food allergies have a sesame allergy and in fact, they think it's even higher.

346
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:42,730
So this is what it was taking to get the FDA to move.

347
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:52,950
And they finally have. I would say is like and how much of the population has to have one of these allergies for it to become listed?

348
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:57,210
Because I feel like so many people have a variety of allergies.

349
00:41:57,230 --> 00:42:01,520
Right. So there is a technical report that you can get into.

350
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:10,670
I mean, it's based on the prevalence. But again, and I don't know if they did some kind of modeling of what to include,

351
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:18,350
like regression of what contributes the most in terms of prediction or variance or whatever.

352
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:25,490
But I just know that those eight accounted for 90% of allergies in children and adults.

353
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:32,390
Yeah. Yeah. You know, it's I mean, I even think of like 1% of the population still, like millions of people.

354
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:38,900
But I mean, at that point, 1% of allergies you're listing have by.

355
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:47,810
There's I think they have on their website. There's I think it's like 160 something allergies that they had to look at.

356
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:56,270
But it came down to those eight. Because the other issue is, is that manufacturers then have to test their products to make sure that they don't have,

357
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:58,850
you know, so there is a lot of testing that goes into it.

358
00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:06,830
Not to say that we shouldn't be doing it for others, other allergy or allergens, but yeah, yeah.

359
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:11,870
My uncle's an allergist specialist. And so he goes through all those products.

360
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:26,690
And then in 2021 we passed a new bill was passed that updated it to include Sesame.

361
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:29,870
Oh yeah, it is. So by January 1st, 2023,

362
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:38,210
Sesame has to be included on all labels and food products in the U.S. So and this also applies to products coming into the country.

363
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,979
That's something the FDA has to monitor,

364
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:52,760
that they are monitoring their food contents because there have been issues where foods have come in imported and there's been allergens in the foods.

365
00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:57,750
Identification of food allergies is one of two approaches.

366
00:43:57,770 --> 00:44:05,210
It's in the ingredient list in parentheses. So, for example, in the ingredient list where there's flour, it lets the person know it's wheat.

367
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:10,680
Or if there's an ingredient, you know, way, it's actually milk.

368
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:16,970
So it's just letting the consumer know which of these milk it or which of these allergens are in the product.

369
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:27,110
Or alternatively, they can have this one statement underneath the ingredient list where it says contains and then the list of allergens.

370
00:44:27,590 --> 00:44:30,770
And so it's either embedded in the ingredient list or below.

371
00:44:31,490 --> 00:44:38,270
So this is why the FDA does this cover like skin care or hair care, makeup products that contain these items if it does.

372
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:42,469
This is all food based products that would be separate and I haven't gotten into.

373
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:51,770
It's a good question. Yeah. And this is just showing of the from a visual.

374
00:44:51,950 --> 00:44:55,130
The allergens are in parentheses on the left.

375
00:44:55,460 --> 00:45:02,660
And on the right is the approach to just put it down below the allergens, down below the ingredient list.

376
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:13,280
So that's allergen labeling does not apply to possible allergen presence in the food from contamination.

377
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:22,100
So but manufacturers can voluntarily include statements like process in a facility that also processes.

378
00:45:22,310 --> 00:45:29,660
And so as a parent of a child that had food allergies, I really appreciated that because then you have otherwise if it didn't,

379
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:38,269
then you're lying and then calling the company or emailing them and saying, you know, what's the story here?

380
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:43,559
So I do appreciate that manufacturers do include that. All right.

381
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:47,160
That's all I have for food allergy and any other any questions about that?

382
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:59,380
Okay. Freedom package labeling.

383
00:46:02,410 --> 00:46:08,080
Anybody use any of these from a label pack in front of package labels?

384
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:13,060
We have them in the U.S. Yeah.

385
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:20,290
You guys have used them. I have to confess. I always want them boxer and or whatever to look at the nutrition facts.

386
00:46:20,290 --> 00:46:24,370
But I'm going to I've got to be more cognizant to look at them.

387
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,730
Anyway, we're going to go through these a bit.

388
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:32,720
And I've got resources for you, for those of you who are interested in delving into it a little bit more.

389
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:40,030
So front of package labels are labels or logos that are on the front of the food package.

390
00:46:40,270 --> 00:46:47,379
And that makes sense in many ways, right? Because the person will pick the package up, look at it to make sure it's what they want.

391
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:53,080
And boom, information's right there. Right. And instead of having to flip it to look at the nutrition facts label.

392
00:46:54,970 --> 00:47:00,460
So again, the whole point of this is to help consumers make healthier food choices.

393
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:08,799
In the U.S., a flip labeling is currently voluntary, and right now what we have is developed by food industry.

394
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:11,920
So the grocer, manufacturer and not manufacturers,

395
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:22,690
but association grocery stores and other food manufacturers have introduced various forms of food labeling, front of package.

396
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:31,120
Nutrition and health professionals would like the FDA to standardize the RFP in the United States.

397
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:45,730
So and I just wanted to highlight, you know, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill has a really interesting global food research program.

398
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:50,950
I've got the link here. No, I don't have the link. That's for Center for Science in the Public Interest.

399
00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:58,450
But if you just type in USC Global Food Research Program, they have this really interesting resources.

400
00:47:58,450 --> 00:48:04,269
And later in one of the other slides, there's a fact sheet about peas.

401
00:48:04,270 --> 00:48:08,349
And they have a lot of really interesting information about systematic reviews

402
00:48:08,350 --> 00:48:15,400
and the findings and which ones are more appear to be more effective as a label.

403
00:48:16,210 --> 00:48:22,240
So it's a really nice resource because it's a really great review of the effectiveness of the various labels.

404
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:30,590
I just want to point that out. So the first one is I want to go over the guideline daily amount GDS in the United States.

405
00:48:30,610 --> 00:48:43,689
We call them facts upfront because of facts up front organization, which I think is the great grocery grocer grocery store association.

406
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:49,569
But it might also have food in the street. So we have three different approaches with these labels.

407
00:48:49,570 --> 00:48:51,700
At the very top is the simplest.

408
00:48:52,420 --> 00:49:03,010
It has the calories and then it has the the nutrients or food ingredients that we should be limiting from a health standpoint.

409
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:07,240
And it does it has the information per serving size.

410
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:20,410
So that's the very basic FP coming out of four products in the U.S., the simplest one is a simple calorie.

411
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:31,190
Indicator. And then for those products, for those manufacturers that want to include nutrients that we should be encouraging,

412
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:39,110
you have the basic for you and these are the calories plus the three either nutrients or food ingredients we want to limit.

413
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:51,010
And then to that, we want to encourage. And those that we want to encourage must be at least 10% of the daily value.

414
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:55,010
So all of this information is coming from the nutrition facts label.

415
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:58,330
It's just brought out to the front of the product.

416
00:49:58,990 --> 00:50:04,390
So there's some examples here on the very bottom here.

417
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:12,399
Loaf of bread. That's the basic folk in the U.S. here with the calories.

418
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:16,780
And well, actually, the really basic one is the very top here with black olives.

419
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:27,070
All we see up there is the calories. Then down here, we have calories plus the three nutrients or ingredients that we want to limit.

420
00:50:28,950 --> 00:50:35,849
And then appears peanut butter, which includes a protein that we want to promote.

421
00:50:35,850 --> 00:50:41,370
And I think that, one, it just wants to highlight that there's seven grams of protein in this peanut butter per serving.

422
00:50:42,090 --> 00:50:47,340
And so those are the peas that we would typically see in the US.

423
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:59,030
There are other countries that use this type of guideline of daily amounts.

424
00:50:59,030 --> 00:51:03,260
And again, it's just information coming from the nutrition facts label.

425
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:08,870
I don't remember which is I think isn't really matter.

426
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:13,429
But this other countries that use this approach to the format looks a little different.

427
00:51:13,430 --> 00:51:22,670
But it's it's along the same lines. The other approach is using health or rating logos.

428
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:26,760
So one logo and it can be a checkmark.

429
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:34,460
It can be. In the case of the Nordic green keyhole here, which is on the left up here.

430
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:39,920
That one's actually fairly well-known for health logos.

431
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:45,950
Sweden, Norway and I think Denmark.

432
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:51,750
Well, I know Sweden and Norway. I can't remember what the other country is. They've been using this for a while.

433
00:51:52,220 --> 00:52:00,170
And the keyhole one is promoting healthy foods, limiting those nutrients that should be limited.

434
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:05,630
And actually, there's a new inclusion here.

435
00:52:07,010 --> 00:52:14,510
It is not. If you do a search for Nordic keyhole, it'll take you to a nonprofit organization that talks more about it.

436
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:25,940
They are now including climate issues in their healthy food choice, so more plant based so that there is less greenhouse gases and so forth.

437
00:52:25,970 --> 00:52:34,430
So that one's very expensive. The American Heart Association has this bottom at the very top checkmark in the heart.

438
00:52:35,810 --> 00:52:46,910
I have a link. That first link here is how a food can become certified for that logo.

439
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:53,000
So there's all sorts of requirements by the American Heart Association for Food to receive a check mark.

440
00:52:55,730 --> 00:52:58,070
And then some of these others are from other countries.

441
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:06,800
The other label is called Traffic Lights and this is another really popular FP use in multiple countries.

442
00:53:08,270 --> 00:53:19,639
The traffic light is very similar to the to the guideline daily amounts, except they use color to let the consumer know,

443
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:28,850
oh, this is really high in sodium, so it's red, but then this green for some of the other components in the food.

444
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:41,350
So this is an example of traffic. Light green is go red is well and then amber is sort of, you know, in between.

445
00:53:41,450 --> 00:53:51,240
Yeah. And then the other one that I wanted to go over is called Nutri Score.

446
00:53:51,390 --> 00:53:59,010
This was developed in France and now the W.H.O. is advocating it.

447
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:06,240
Well, let me take a step back. So it was developed in France, and then at least four or five other European countries picked up the system.

448
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:14,190
And there has been some studies that have looked at the Nutri Score and its effectiveness.

449
00:54:14,910 --> 00:54:18,300
And there's a whole paper here by the W.H.O.

450
00:54:18,710 --> 00:54:23,970
And for those of you interested, but basically it's on a scale of 0 to 5 scoring.

451
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:30,380
And the higher the score, so you can see this muesli here actually received a score of C.

452
00:54:30,930 --> 00:54:38,100
So there's obviously something in it whether too much sugar is high in sodium, too, I'm not sure.

453
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:44,130
But there's something about this product that did not allow it to earn an A, which would be the best,

454
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:48,440
and they have the highest score with an egg and the lowest score when you eat.

455
00:54:49,530 --> 00:54:59,669
And if there's products that are scored EA, would they even make the shelf at that point in Japan?

456
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:09,959
That's a great question. Well, so one of the interesting things about the EFO peas in general is that in countries where they're

457
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:18,700
enforcing it forces manufacturers to re re reduce the food because they don't want to have like,

458
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:22,080
as you said, in B or a warning label on their food product.

459
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:26,220
So it does force manufacturers to re do the recipe.

460
00:55:26,550 --> 00:55:31,650
So then does that inherently create a minimum score that food has to be on the shelf?

461
00:55:31,770 --> 00:55:37,139
I don't know. I think it's a great question, but I don't have a specific answer to that.

462
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:41,370
But you can check out the Andreeva article.

463
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:52,200
But what it does is they do know the FP scoring in countries where it's mandatory and manufacturers have had to change because they don't want to be,

464
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:56,790
you know, either getting warning labels or having low scores on their products.

465
00:55:56,970 --> 00:56:03,300
Because in some countries, in addition to the neutral score, they have the number next to it.

466
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:11,490
Not all countries do it, but some do. So once again, the manufacturers sort of put out there as your products only into.

467
00:56:12,730 --> 00:56:20,760
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. It would be interesting to know and I don't know that they do this,

468
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:27,930
but to survey manufacturers to find out how many of them have to make the choice to make

469
00:56:27,930 --> 00:56:31,710
changes just because they don't want to live score or if it influences them at all.

470
00:56:32,030 --> 00:56:35,790
But there does appear to be evidence that it does influence the manufacturers.

471
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:41,820
These are the piece that are getting a lot of attention.

472
00:56:41,830 --> 00:56:51,440
So these are warning labels and they are used in a number of countries Chile, Uruguay, Peru and so forth,

473
00:56:51,460 --> 00:57:03,210
Mexico that have been shown to be actually very effective in reducing consumer choice, you know, not reducing choice, reducing consumer purchasing.

474
00:57:03,630 --> 00:57:15,060
In other words, they've the actual numbers about the example is in Chile, they have a mandatory system now of using warning labels.

475
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:16,770
And there was a considerable drop.

476
00:57:16,770 --> 00:57:28,920
And it could be because they cannot causally say it was due to the warning labels because there were other initiatives implemented.

477
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:38,910
But these warning labels do seem to be effective in modifying consumer choice in the grocery store.

478
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:42,570
And so this is actually an RFP of interest.

479
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:52,590
So you can see examples here of where this product here has all four of the.

480
00:57:52,920 --> 00:58:09,730
So it's excessive calories, excessive sodium, excessive sugar, and then excessive is the word for sugar, excessive consumption of trans fats.

481
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:13,380
What is the one about it, though? Yeah, sugar. Sugar. Okay.

482
00:58:13,650 --> 00:58:22,490
So this poor product has a lot of warning labels and likewise warning labels on beverages and so forth.

483
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:31,530
So this is a great example of an RFP that is getting a lot of interest in various countries because it does appear to be effective.

484
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:37,480
And then I just have one systematic review here.

485
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:46,400
I included the global, the U.N. C paper, and actually I have instructions once you land on the website, go to resources, fact sheets and then FP,

486
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:58,360
they did a really nice little review of all the different systematic reviews and meta analyzes of whether or not these just in general with F ops,

487
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:03,249
but it's broken down by type of FP. So there's really great information on that.

488
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:09,790
And so it's just like a, I don't remember how long it is five, six page fact sheet, but it has a lot of great information on that.

489
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:18,670
The one thing that I want to point out is that a lot of the research was either conducted in a laboratory setting with consumers,

490
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:25,180
you know, answering a survey saying, as this makes sense to you, is it easy to read?

491
00:59:25,510 --> 00:59:31,600
Are you able to interpret it? So that's that sort of experimental in the laboratory type.

492
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:40,419
There are some studies that are evaluating consumer choice based in real life settings, but there are fewer.

493
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:43,749
And so that's part of the reason why I have this last bullet,

494
00:59:43,750 --> 00:59:50,620
is that we need more research in which we're assessing consumer choice in the real world.

495
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:56,710
And does it actually translate to a change in the dietary intake?

496
00:59:57,220 --> 01:00:04,450
So at some point we need to assess dietary intake as well as their food purchasing patterns.

497
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:10,600
And then ultimately we want to know if it translates to changes in dietary intake.

498
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:14,170
Does that change health outcomes long term?

499
01:00:14,530 --> 01:00:22,390
We're not there yet, obviously, but so that's the information and.

500
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:31,960
FP And again, just to highlight warning labels, so I had color coded traffic light as well as warning labels appear to promote healthier food choices.

501
01:00:32,140 --> 01:00:40,420
I think now that based on the number of reviews and systematic reviews and meta analyzes,

502
01:00:40,420 --> 01:00:50,260
I think the warning labels are the ones that are rising to the top. So it'll be interesting to see how various countries move forward.

503
01:00:53,680 --> 01:01:02,560
Also, for those of you that are interested in Asian countries, there's a paper in The Lancet about Philippines in Southeast Asia.

504
01:01:02,590 --> 01:01:18,249
So if you're interested in thinking about so I wanted to just wrap up our class a time in your reading for today and thinking about first of all,

505
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:24,410
can FP labels be made more effective? Improving food choices.

506
01:01:24,650 --> 01:01:30,440
And then what are the concerns that have been raised regarding food labels with respect to.

507
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:40,040
Equity. And what are the unintended consequences that a food label can result in?

508
01:01:41,390 --> 01:01:45,690
So anybody have whatever comes to mind.

509
01:01:46,090 --> 01:01:50,920
It doesn't matter what we address first and foremost, but just go ahead.

510
01:01:51,510 --> 01:01:57,860
Yeah. Just that they two people have different educational, social and economic backgrounds.

511
01:01:57,890 --> 01:02:02,750
They may not be able to interpret or understand labels in the same way, depending on those factors.

512
01:02:02,990 --> 01:02:08,629
And also the thing that really shocked me about that one discussion was that sometimes food prices

513
01:02:08,630 --> 01:02:14,360
will go up in step with the nutrition labeling and that that I never really thought of that.

514
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:17,880
So this is particularly problematic with these types of labels.

515
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:23,420
Right. Manufacturer gets a stamp of approval from the American Heart Association.

516
01:02:23,620 --> 01:02:36,890
Oh, this is a food that we can promote. And in our country, manufacturers might increase because it would be a desirable food item.

517
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:43,400
Yeah, it's it's that's the sort of aspect of the food industry that's frustrating for me.

518
01:02:46,070 --> 01:02:50,660
Well, I, I really like the idea of putting instead of, like,

519
01:02:50,990 --> 01:03:00,170
associating foods healthier and healthy because I was brought up like that can be raised problems like what would we consider healthy?

520
01:03:00,170 --> 01:03:06,920
What would be considered unhealthy? But I like the idea of like the warning label for things we want people to be aware of.

521
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:11,849
Yes. Which I haven't seen yet here. But that is helpful.

522
01:03:11,850 --> 01:03:16,730
Like, oh, this item is considerably higher in saturated fat compared to decide.

523
01:03:17,090 --> 01:03:23,090
You will choose this one instead. So I think that seems like it's more simple and straightforward.

524
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:34,010
Yeah, I agree. I like instead of giving people so much information, there's some aspects of the product that we want to caution them.

525
01:03:34,220 --> 01:03:37,549
Too much sugar, you know, is a problem. Too much sodium.

526
01:03:37,550 --> 01:03:38,870
We already know it's a problem.

527
01:03:38,870 --> 01:03:48,770
So highlighting it with a warning label is a way to just give them a little bit of information, but important information.

528
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:55,280
Nicole, I think that some of these labels would say good source of calcium,

529
01:03:55,460 --> 01:04:01,220
high fiber, organic, still a cookie and somebody's trying to help washes it.

530
01:04:01,220 --> 01:04:04,850
Right. So that people are like, oh, the package says it's good for me.

531
01:04:04,910 --> 01:04:08,450
Right? And I think people gravitate towards that.

532
01:04:08,450 --> 01:04:14,240
So they kind of miss the other. Parks like what I call this soaking in the set must not be bad for me.

533
01:04:14,510 --> 01:04:24,920
It's a good friend. And if we had warning labels that might.

534
01:04:25,580 --> 01:04:28,760
I think Black Box Label kind of says that. Says it right there.

535
01:04:29,180 --> 01:04:37,130
So California used a warning label for I believe it was sugar sweetened beverage and it was shown to be effective.

536
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:41,990
But I. I can't remember why it got dropped unless.

537
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:47,000
Food industry. So we're going to have a hard time with warning labels in this country.

538
01:04:47,010 --> 01:04:58,170
I'm just predicting that the food industry is going to have some tremendous pushback in our country because they have such powerful lobbyists.

539
01:04:58,190 --> 01:05:01,820
And it will also depend on the administration that's in.

540
01:05:01,970 --> 01:05:11,740
Right. So I think we have a bit of an uphill battle with some of these approaches, especially if it's a warning label.

541
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:16,720
I just imagine that that doesn't mean we're not going to forge ahead.

542
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:21,220
I'm kind of playing devil's advocate here and seeing how warning labels won't work.

543
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:28,210
Maybe people with those low income or just out of habit by the same thing over and over again and don't really read the nutritional facts.

544
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:36,510
That warning label will mean nothing like it's just there as marketing and they won't really look at it like, well, it's got a convenient side.

545
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:39,960
So there would have to be an education campaign to go in that. Right.

546
01:05:39,970 --> 01:05:42,150
So there are some studies, though.

547
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:51,580
I think one of them was in Chile where they found that warning labels were used by both low and medium income women,

548
01:05:53,140 --> 01:05:56,860
and it did result in changes in their food choices because of that.

549
01:05:56,860 --> 01:06:06,520
But you raise that important point that we would have to be including some education, not some education around.

550
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:09,660
How do we interpret those labels? Right. Yeah. Yeah,

551
01:06:10,030 --> 01:06:16,089
I kinda I thought like the warning labels are particularly useful in the sense that

552
01:06:16,090 --> 01:06:21,100
they already kind of give an interpretation of the information as being important.

553
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:26,070
Like whatever important information like this food is high in sugar.

554
01:06:26,110 --> 01:06:29,260
That's a key point to keep in mind. But you might not.

555
01:06:30,450 --> 01:06:38,609
It's a lot more actionable for a lot broader demographics of people just because it's not like, here's the information.

556
01:06:38,610 --> 01:06:39,990
You figure out what to do with it. It's.

557
01:06:40,290 --> 01:06:49,649
This is high in sugar where implying that you probably shouldn't eat too much of it, but it's like it does because,

558
01:06:49,650 --> 01:06:56,640
you know, we know there's a lot going on in the tuition facts label, whereas this is just nuggets of information.

559
01:06:56,970 --> 01:07:04,440
But, you know, circling back to shift point, some folks may not understand why we are concerned about high end sugar.

560
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:06,870
Why does it matter that it's high in sugar?

561
01:07:06,870 --> 01:07:15,180
Should I why do I have to be concerned about that or high in facts, especially since we know that some fats are healthy fats.

562
01:07:15,450 --> 01:07:22,960
So education of how to use the label interpreting the label would have to be part of a labeling system.

563
01:07:22,980 --> 01:07:24,809
Yeah, I'm thinking about your first point too.

564
01:07:24,810 --> 01:07:32,280
If like the shelf only has like the canned things that are high in sodium, if every product is high in sodium,

565
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:36,900
then it won't mean anything to people who are used to buying canned beans or something.

566
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:37,260
Right.

567
01:07:37,530 --> 01:07:46,260
So there would I feel like that would be a place where the industry would push back because inherently maybe one brand would do better than the other,

568
01:07:46,950 --> 01:07:54,120
which is healthier choice. But yeah, they would view that as like a decline and we already know that's happened.

569
01:07:54,120 --> 01:08:05,099
Like, I don't remember when the first dietary guidelines for Americans came out with the recommendation that sodium should be no more than 2300.

570
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:13,139
That was a big drop from the original companies like Campbell's Soups, you know, decreased the sodium in some of the products.

571
01:08:13,140 --> 01:08:17,610
And it didn't make it because that wasn't done across the board.

572
01:08:18,210 --> 01:08:21,600
Right. So the consumer was like, ooh, this is too flat tasting for me.

573
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:23,550
So I'm going to go to a product that tastes better.

574
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:30,809
So to your point, it would be something that all manufacturers in general need to embrace and slowly dialing down.

575
01:08:30,810 --> 01:08:36,030
And actually, there is an initiative going on where manufacturers are slowly dialing down sodium.

576
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:40,260
But to your point about labels, I. I understand what you're saying.

577
01:08:40,380 --> 01:08:41,260
Yeah. Yeah,

578
01:08:41,430 --> 01:08:51,870
I'd even think from a marketing standpoint and labels switching towards like darker labels that you're not seeing as much like this lack portion.

579
01:08:51,870 --> 01:09:00,350
I know we think like colors just like people are going to. And if even there's a small section and starts getting darker like easily,

580
01:09:00,370 --> 01:09:09,480
you could see the marketing leaning away from that or making sure like whatever is in front of the label is super bright and transparent that yeah,

581
01:09:10,050 --> 01:09:18,000
yeah. In the U.S., these black labels, I think, yeah, I would not see them like white black label pharmaceuticals, so.

582
01:09:18,450 --> 01:09:26,040
Right, right. Yeah. And I think from food inequity standpoint, when you have places where there's food deserts and people are shopping,

583
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:30,959
a lot of convenience stores and a lot of these food products have a lot of these warning labels that

584
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:36,000
you have people who already feel like they have limited choices being double down and limited again,

585
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,590
like how I keep my family healthy.

586
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:45,690
But all of these black labels, they have even less choice because some things are just being demonized and something's better than Yeah.

587
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:52,530
Now that's a really important point. And if you have the choice of having any vegetables or none at all,

588
01:09:52,530 --> 01:09:58,350
and your choices a can of green beans, which, unless it's low sodium, is going to have sodium.

589
01:09:58,500 --> 01:10:04,350
And if it had a black label on that and high in sodium, then you might not buy the cans.

590
01:10:04,350 --> 01:10:10,770
So that is a really important point and that's one of the reasons why I had that paper on there for you guys to read, to think about.

591
01:10:10,770 --> 01:10:18,360
Is that how if we if we at any point as a country move forward with front of packaged labeling,

592
01:10:18,510 --> 01:10:27,390
these are some really important considerations from a social determinant standpoint as well as an inequity and in community is how do we address.

593
01:10:29,060 --> 01:10:36,800
Access to products that wouldn't have high sodium that they can afford to buy without traveling 20 miles.

594
01:10:37,490 --> 01:10:41,680
Right. So, yeah, it also kind of makes me think so.

595
01:10:41,700 --> 01:10:51,079
Like there are a couple of foods that may advertise as like being low-fodmap or like low potassium for people with chronic kidney disease,

596
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:57,180
things like that. So I wonder with these like warning labels how that also would offset.

597
01:10:57,210 --> 01:11:01,010
Like things like that. So like for people with chronic kidney disease.

598
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:06,520
They're not going to have a label that says high in potassium.

599
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:14,290
So I felt like if there is a particular food that's geared toward that diet, then how would they handle that?

600
01:11:14,470 --> 01:11:17,470
Right. I mean, these are big labels.

601
01:11:17,790 --> 01:11:27,600
Yeah. If we ever had anything like this in the US, I can imagine it would be a lot smaller and smaller and they might not be on the front.

602
01:11:27,610 --> 01:11:32,350
They may not be have options. But yes, your point is well taken.

603
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:41,200
And this again, is where if you're working with certain audiences, they may not be relying just on peas,

604
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:52,230
but flipping the container around to the nutrition facts label where they can actually get the absolute amounts of potassium or sodium and so forth.

605
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:57,069
So that Nutrition Facts label has a lot of important information.

606
01:11:57,070 --> 01:12:04,300
And so for those who are interested and want to learn, you know, you guys will have a lot of teaching moments.

607
01:12:05,350 --> 01:12:10,330
Yeah, I would even I mean, to go back to like the whole nutrition label standpoint,

608
01:12:10,420 --> 01:12:16,990
like there's a lot of information there of not that I would ever add more to a public school teachers,

609
01:12:17,270 --> 01:12:23,469
but like adding back home EC into the high school education to cover food labels,

610
01:12:23,470 --> 01:12:29,440
just getting it from a generalized standpoint, you don't need to go into all these super specific,

611
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:37,150
but if you know how much by reading that package, how much of your sodium, you don't need to know how much sodium you need to have in your diet.

612
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:41,150
That is a certain percentage. I don't know. I would never add more.

613
01:12:41,170 --> 01:12:44,409
My mom's a public school teacher, so it would never work to that plate.

614
01:12:44,410 --> 01:12:49,629
But like, it's just something that is not currently being covered.

615
01:12:49,630 --> 01:12:58,480
And some schools are covering it in their health class because my son actually got some exposure to food labeling in his health class, which is great,

616
01:12:59,770 --> 01:13:10,240
you know, so where they can include that, but it's still comes down to all of us at a community level finding ways to convey this information.

617
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:17,709
I mean, there's a lot of misinformation in communities when we were running the food,

618
01:13:17,710 --> 01:13:26,170
the Nutrition Facts label curriculum through community members and Flynn, one member said, I don't remember.

619
01:13:26,170 --> 01:13:29,820
Somehow or another I brought up skim milk versus whole milk.

620
01:13:29,860 --> 01:13:36,040
Oh, we were somebody asked about children and came up about milk and and she said, Oh,

621
01:13:36,310 --> 01:13:41,890
I only give my family whole milk because we know it's got more nutrients than skim milk.

622
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:45,420
And that was the first time I'd ever heard that,

623
01:13:45,540 --> 01:13:54,390
that there was a perception in among consumers that whole milk is actually more nutritionally dense than skim milk.

624
01:13:55,230 --> 01:14:02,910
And I don't know if it's the fact that whole milk is thicker and skim milk is thin, but in fact, if you actually look at a nutrient breakdown,

625
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:11,190
skim milk actually is slightly higher just because when they take the fat out, they have to add more milk solids to bring it up to the same volume.

626
01:14:11,430 --> 01:14:16,080
And so the nutrient content of skim milk is actually a smidgen higher than whole milk.

627
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:22,410
So it's these kind of these perceptions in the community that you guys will be playing.

628
01:14:22,430 --> 01:14:29,970
Important role flipping and educating on labels is what we have to date.

629
01:14:33,130 --> 01:14:36,870
The other thoughts about what we covered. The last few classes.

630
01:14:36,910 --> 01:14:41,450
Last two classes. Yeah.

631
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:47,940
We hear so much about like the power of like industry lobbyists to make food policy and affect all of these decisions,

632
01:14:47,940 --> 01:14:53,069
like what non business interested agencies or groups are really like,

633
01:14:53,070 --> 01:14:58,800
effective in counteracting some of that lobbying and bringing more health concerns to the government,

634
01:14:58,820 --> 01:15:03,510
you know, the legislative bodies, so that some of those issues start to take a little more priority.

635
01:15:03,540 --> 01:15:07,980
Yeah. Can I share what your question was that that you would ask me?

636
01:15:08,310 --> 01:15:10,260
So Kelly had asked, you know,

637
01:15:10,260 --> 01:15:18,000
given the concerns of added sugar and we know now the links with chronic disease that's been really coming out in the last few years.

638
01:15:18,900 --> 01:15:25,980
And it's really a research why are we still at 10% of added sugar is total energy intake.

639
01:15:26,220 --> 01:15:31,050
And if you remember going back to your dietary guidelines for Americans,

640
01:15:31,230 --> 01:15:38,430
the scientific advisory committee for the 2020 2025 recommended that we drop it from 10%

641
01:15:38,430 --> 01:15:43,829
down to 6% because there's scientific evidence that we should be consuming less sugar,

642
01:15:43,830 --> 01:15:53,270
not at 10%. And. The administration at the time was swayed by food industry.

643
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:56,900
Right. There was pushback from a number of.

644
01:15:57,080 --> 01:16:00,500
I'm sure the beverage industry and other food industry.

645
01:16:01,250 --> 01:16:11,360
So the short answer, Kelly, is that in part depends on who's in the administration at the time and if will be willingly be swayed,

646
01:16:11,870 --> 01:16:14,359
I shouldn't say willingly, but is weighing in.

647
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:23,450
Also, all the professional organizations like American Heart, American Medical Association, the Center for Science in the Public Interest.

648
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:37,260
That is an advocacy. I have it in one of your I was do this to you guys here it is, the Center for Science in the Public Interest.

649
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:48,230
They are very staunch advocates for improving and not allowing food industry lobbyists from having the upper hand.

650
01:16:49,670 --> 01:16:53,450
The woman who is the director has been here a few times to give some.

651
01:16:56,090 --> 01:16:59,270
Presentations. And they work hard at it.

652
01:16:59,300 --> 01:17:07,850
So there are organizations out there countering. It's just I do know that it also depends on who's in office, oftentimes times.

653
01:17:08,730 --> 01:17:09,060
Yeah.

654
01:17:09,510 --> 01:17:20,640
The year that they made that big drop to 2300 milligrams of sodium, those researchers and those on the scientific panel pushed back hard and they won.

655
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:24,930
They got it. I mean, that's why we have the recommended recommendations.

656
01:17:24,930 --> 01:17:30,990
They push back against food industry. And boy, I'll tell you, there was a big hullabaloo about it, as you can imagine.

657
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:42,720
So it's doable. It's just in this where the way the framework is in this country, food industry does have a powerful voice.

658
01:17:42,870 --> 01:17:49,169
So we just have to have the Academy for Nutrition and Dietetics is also another very powerful organization.

659
01:17:49,170 --> 01:17:53,890
So being involved in these organizations and parts of voice.

660
01:17:53,930 --> 01:18:00,270
Yeah, there's actually a good book on the sodium lobbying issue.

661
01:18:00,270 --> 01:18:04,890
It's called Salt Wars, and it kind of goes like over that whole process.

662
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:08,969
Yeah. Yeah. So those are all great questions.

663
01:18:08,970 --> 01:18:12,240
So I don't that I answer it. Kelly That was really long and drawn out.

664
01:18:16,020 --> 01:18:20,880
We do have organizations that have a voice and we just have to collectively use it.

665
01:18:21,480 --> 01:18:26,850
So given the time, I'm going to end class, but great discussions.

666
01:18:27,570 --> 01:18:32,070
I will hang around outside because there is a class will be coming in.

667
01:18:32,070 --> 01:18:38,280
