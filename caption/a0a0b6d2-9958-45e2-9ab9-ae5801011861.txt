00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:15,600
Welcome to Epit 634 is module on the history of mathematical epidemiology, part B after Mick Hendricks landmark development of the essay Our Model.

2
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:20,130
The next major advancement in transmission modeling comes from Wade Hampton Frost,

3
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:26,810
who in the 1930s developed the first description of epidemics using a discrete binomial expression.

4
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:37,400
Yes, our model is a continuous model, which is which was a fine approximation or is a fine approximation when examining large population processes.

5
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:43,950
But in actuality, infection, the infection process is a discrete process.

6
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,880
The idea behind the France model is that infectious individual,

7
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:55,020
when coming in contact with a susceptible individual, either causes an infection or does not.

8
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:59,790
What transpires is a stochastic event or a flip of a coin.

9
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:07,920
As an example below, we start with one infected and two susceptible is where there are four possible outcomes.

10
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,670
One by one infected may not infect either.

11
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,030
The susceptible us to that one infected May.

12
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:21,030
In fact, one of these two susceptible and the other Sentebale is never infected.

13
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:25,980
Three, that one infected May in fact one of the two stubbles.

14
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:32,760
And then the new and that new infected the new infected infects the other susceptible

15
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:40,050
or for that one infected may transmit infection to both of the two susceptible.

16
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:44,610
We will explore in more depth the comparison between this discrete frost model and the

17
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:52,160
continuous mass action model of transmission that Mackendrick developed later in the course.

18
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:57,560
The next major advancement in transmission modeling came from George McDonald in the 1950s.

19
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:02,300
He furthers Ross's work on malaria transmission by realizing that the importance

20
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:06,440
of Leighton's realizing the importance of latency within the mosquito,

21
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:16,940
which is the time from being exposed to being infectious. Ross understood this, that mosquito density biting rate infectivity,

22
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:25,430
mosquito mortality rate and the duration of infections were critical features of transmission as shown here.

23
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:31,430
He didn't appreciate that the importance of the time it took to become infectious.

24
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,210
All it takes to become infectious.

25
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:45,350
Since mosquitoes only live on the order of weeks and latency is also on the order of weeks, many mosquitoes don't survive to transmit much.

26
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:55,550
Donald modifies Ross's model in order to incorporate this latency.

27
00:02:55,550 --> 00:03:03,910
In the 1970s, Anderson and May repackaged Mackendrick model into an ecologic framework.

28
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:13,450
Their first contribution was proposed that infectious diseases can be categorized based on population biology and mechanisms of transmission,

29
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:22,660
vector borne, waterborne. Person to person, etc., rather than more a more clinical orientation of categorizing based on taxonomy, viruses,

30
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:30,040
bacteria and protozoa, they write, framing the problem from the perspective of interventions rather than treatment.

31
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:39,990
Their second contribution was a shift was to shift the modeling framework from a to species model, host and parasite.

32
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:45,750
That is was used in ecology to Nepeta Logical model tracking epidemiologic states.

33
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:49,080
The number of susceptible is infected and recovered.

34
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:57,870
The reason for this is that it wasn't tractable or interesting to track the number of viruses within a host.

35
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:07,660
As opposed to tracking the spread of disease within populations.

36
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:17,840
Anderson, it may provided. Of another framing of the problem, using the same as a model that Mackendrick developed,

37
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:31,510
the basic properties of a micro pairs parasite that was best modeled using an essay or model is that direct reproduction occurs within host.

38
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:38,050
These passages are small in size and have short generation times recovered.

39
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:43,540
Hosts are often immune for a period of time and sometimes sometimes for life.

40
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:47,340
And the duration of infection is short. Often short.

41
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:56,470
To compare to the lifespan of the host, this was in contrast to what Anderson may refer to as the macro parasites.

42
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:02,020
For example, helmets where there is no direct reproduction within the host.

43
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:08,800
The parasite is large in size and has large generation time, long generation time.

44
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:16,600
Importantly, there are many factors that depend on the number of parasites within a host, such as the number of eggs shed into the environment.

45
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:24,900
Reflecting contagiousness, pathologic effects, immune response and parasite death.

46
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:31,000
And these parasites are rarely distributed among hosts randomly. They are generally a small.

47
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,810
There are generally a small number of people that are highly infected with a large egg count.

48
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:44,800
And then many people that are not infected at all. And so these kinds of parasites.

49
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,100
So for these kind of parasites, two species model is a better structure,

50
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:58,780
described transmission of pathogen like helmet's antigen and may also distinguish between direct and indirect transmission.

51
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:08,950
Direct transmission, meaning? Person to person transmission, such as sexually transmitted diseases as well as respiratory diseases,

52
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:17,560
airborne droplet such as influenza and TB, indirect transmission.

53
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:25,900
Are infectious diseases where there exists an intermediate host that a pathogen must, in fact, prior to infecting another host.

54
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:31,210
This includes vector borne diseases as well as other helmet's such as such as meiosis.

55
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:39,070
We will be talking about the distinction between direct and indirect transmission in more detail later in the course.

56
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:48,460
There has been a number of advancements since Anders may answer Anderson and work that has occurred in the past 30 years or so in the 1980s.

57
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:52,420
Health Code proposes the importance of building population heterogeneity into

58
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:57,700
models to account for often small numbers that have a high risk behavior.

59
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:04,500
This was a breakthrough in thinking about target intervention as opposed to mass interventions.

60
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:09,780
Halleran furthers Ross's notion of dependent happenings and develops a framework of direct

61
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:15,480
and indirect effects distinguishing between being protected because you were vaccinated,

62
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:24,300
for example, versus protected because there are many among you that are vaccinated.

63
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:28,860
That protects you from becoming infected.

64
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:37,350
We developed a framework here at UVM that especially accounts for pathogens surviving in environments such as water and air.

65
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:42,810
And finally, with the development of molecular approaches to genotyping and sequencing pathogens,

66
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:49,800
phyla dynamics were developed to model how pathogens spread through populations.

67
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:58,503
We will cover many of these topics, not all during the during this course, to provide an introduction to transmission modeling.
