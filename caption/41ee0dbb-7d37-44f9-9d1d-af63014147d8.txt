1
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:11,890
You can email us if you'd like to.

2
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:22,920
Okay. Often just for a format. Originally I think it's 15 minutes on a thing or assignment or ten or or just kind of go for it or yeah.

3
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:28,890
Just give me a so as to know if there is any format of stuff that you want to.

4
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:38,179
Ready? Yep. All right. So, how are you guys feeling?

5
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:41,830
You guys feeling awake? Alert. Deep breathing, sir.

6
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:46,129
So, have you guys ever been in, like, a meeting and it's, like, been going on,

7
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:50,270
and you just start falling asleep, and then the door opens and you're suddenly much more alert.

8
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:58,900
It's interesting. All right. Well, I find that very often, sometimes just getting like fresh air really clears my head elsewhere quite a bit.

9
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:04,570
And so I was kind of interested in kind of environmental factors and how that impacts worker productivity.

10
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,190
And as I've been kind of looking at green space, but I started thinking of like,

11
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:16,389
I think a confounding factor sometimes of Christmas interventions are going outside for a walk is your air in vernal air is changing.

12
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:20,830
And so the amount of carbon dioxide that you're your intake is also different.

13
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:26,680
So for my lecture, if you want to look at the impact of workplace carbon dioxide levels and employee productivity and health,

14
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:31,900
because I found that to be a really interesting topic. And so a little bit of a background.

15
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:37,540
Since the start of the COVID 19 pandemic, there's been an increasing amount of attention and kind of focus on indoor air quality.

16
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:46,510
Particular carbon dioxide monitors have been increasingly used to kind of provide a parameter, like a barometer of like the ventilation of a room.

17
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:53,650
And I have some examples next. People put them up on a desk or something and use that as kind of a proxy of airflow, exchange rates.

18
00:01:54,220 --> 00:02:00,520
And so CO2, I mean, everyone knows carbon dioxide, global warming kind of important in that context.

19
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:09,250
But in terms of more of a, you know, our health and safety context, it's generally only a worry in confined spaces or in areas with poor ventilation.

20
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:16,780
The CDC classifies it as immediately dangerous to life or health concentrations, depending on the concentration.

21
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:22,030
And they also acknowledge that it might cause health effects at lower and chronic exposure levels.

22
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:28,450
And so there is a growing body of research that demonstrates that short term exposure of CO2 from

23
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:33,489
concentrations ranging from 500 to 5000 parts per million can impact cognitive performance,

24
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:35,890
which includes decision making and problem resolution.

25
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:42,759
So this has a pretty huge impact on the workplace, especially when I mean one employee, that's something.

26
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,520
But when you're looking at an entire office building full of employees,

27
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:52,320
if maybe people are just working a little bit slower or just a little bit less attentive, that can have not only huge economic impact, but also huge.

28
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:58,180
So social, social and quality of life impact of people could be more productive, but they're not.

29
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:02,740
And so this is just some Twitter science.

30
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:08,410
But so this is kind of showing CO2 monitors being used for COVID just to people

31
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:14,020
to larger Twitter accounts once on the left shown like on a flight on CO2,

32
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:17,170
going all the way up to 2000, which is actually incredibly high.

33
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:24,249
And I kind of go to the effects of that. And then additionally on another flight, this guy talked about masking,

34
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:33,640
but his CO2 monitor showed exposure of up to 1800 parts per million of CO2, and I'm not sure how exactly accurate these kind of sensors are,

35
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:38,469
but it kind of goes to show that there are a lot of situations,

36
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:48,190
particularly public transit or small offices with a lot of people because we respirator CO2 concentration quickly get to increase quite a bit.

37
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,079
And currently because of global warming of the ambient CO2 levels,

38
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:57,160
it is roughly around between 405 hundred, depending on your current global conditions.

39
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:03,910
But as that increases to internal or building concentrations of CO2 will only increase as well.

40
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:08,290
And so this kind of goes to show more people using CO2 monitors at the workplace.

41
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:17,290
This one person on the left, they had a personal CO2 monitor and they realized that 1500 in one day and they were like, that's not right.

42
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:24,490
And so they actually had a call in their office, like administrative staff, and they found out that the ventilation was just off.

43
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:29,200
Which kind of, Andy, that you just had a monitor that could tell that there is no airflow at all.

44
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,460
I think that's really interesting.

45
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:39,969
And then another person on the right kind of did a little tiny internal study where he noticed that he was happier at work when he went to open.

46
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:43,930
He's more alert, is more focused, and he was wondering if this had anything to do with CO2.

47
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:48,100
And so he kind of made a mark, I think it would refresh data every 12 hours.

48
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,710
And so he tested it like without having the windows open and then having them for 12 hours.

49
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,020
He noticed the indoor CO2 dropped by 55% and that's just like a single point of data.

50
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:02,560
But it's interesting, this one person made that correlation on their own.

51
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:07,570
Maybe I'm happier or more focused when the windows are open and this is just silly,

52
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:11,950
but I'll search with all these different Twitter threads of people using CO2 monitors.

53
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:16,899
This one person got upset that someone had a CO2 monitor in the in the office and

54
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,610
they ended up resetting it multiple times or something and started messing with.

55
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:23,890
People don't know. A lot of people are like that, but I thought that was interesting.

56
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,600
I don't know why that would bug you.

57
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:33,580
So anyways, my methods for the lecture search is I used Google Scholar and I searched for any kind of relevant articles and keywords,

58
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:37,210
so to carbon dioxide health, workplace productivity.

59
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:41,620
And I try to keep this as much as possible, but I do filter some articles,

60
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:50,980
the ones that were peer reviewed or accessible that I could view as a student, I restrict the results to any lecture produced after 2010.

61
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,320
Because I wanted to do stuff that was more current, so a little bit more of a niche topic.

62
00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:03,180
But I thought giving myself a 12 year window was decent enough and I found a good amount and I tried to use official government sources,

63
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:07,050
academic sources, to learn more about the background of CO2.

64
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,790
This is classified. How it works. Health impacts. I'm just kind of background section.

65
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:19,770
Then I read the abstracts of these articles and then I selected the four articles to review based on ones that I think would be a good fit.

66
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:23,850
And so here this the four articles are going to them in more depth.

67
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:31,830
But there is a surprising amount of research on indoor air pollution in regards to CO2 than I thought it would be,

68
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:38,250
particularly a lot more than I would thought that relates to psychosocial factors or worker productivity.

69
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:45,750
And there's a lot of really cool literature on this, and I just chose these two articles as well, and I recommend people read them later on.

70
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:51,860
One on the left is called Time Spent in Office and Workers Productivity, Comfort and Health Perception Study.

71
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:58,589
And I thought there is one key thing that came out of it that was really interesting where it's no worker

72
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:03,300
thought their productivity was substantially affected by like indoor environmental quality factors,

73
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:06,420
but it was in the study.

74
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:13,260
And so that kind of showed that even workers or most people kind of, I think, underestimate the impact that their environment has on their work.

75
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,880
And so this is one of the first move, this little book.

76
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:23,790
Yeah, you can see this is one of the first articles reviewed and it's kind of more of a meta analysis.

77
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:29,910
That was a good jumping off point. It's direct human health risks of increased atmospheric carbon dioxide from

78
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,780
Jefferson that all seem as though the meaninglessness of existing literature.

79
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:42,090
They took a ton of like older studies and kind of looked at the both what they're saying,

80
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:46,380
but like also their confidence in the research and reliability kind of stuff.

81
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:54,240
And so they found that there is potential health risks to see CO2 exposure as low as 1000 parts per million.

82
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:01,500
And so that's a threshold is commonly exceeded in many kind of rooms, office layouts and indoor environments.

83
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:11,440
And especially in the context of energy efficient designs, you often kind of want to limit ventilation rates or to the bare minimum.

84
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:15,060
So obviously, as you ventilate more cost, higher amounts of energy,

85
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:21,960
but they kind of saw that as growing trend, it might have a worse impact on the indoor concentrations of CO2.

86
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:27,209
And so they also found that increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations due to climate

87
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:32,550
change and air pollution could make adverse exposures more frequent and prolonged.

88
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:38,370
And also, as it gets kind of worse or hotter outside, people spend more time indoors.

89
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:45,690
So CO2 potentially is going to become increasingly a potentially have a greater impact on workers and employers.

90
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:51,390
And so they'll still there's further research is needed to quantify the major sources of CO2 exposure,

91
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:56,730
particularly to find mitigation strategies or find account, particularly in vulnerable populations.

92
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:04,589
And interestingly enough, they found a study that showed that increased CO2 exposures are strongly correlated with increased

93
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:08,970
student absenteeism and decreased cognitive cognitive performance among elementary students.

94
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,980
So it kind of goes to show that even like academics or academic places or schools,

95
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:21,600
it's really important to be kind of cognizant of the airflow and ventilation rates, particularly in places where people were particularly kids.

96
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:28,560
Right. And they'll set this really wonderful table for the Jakobsen at all.

97
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:33,450
And so this kind of goes to show. So they have different concentrations.

98
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:39,720
So they say from 1000 to 5000 parts per million, we still having difficulty in CO2 retention.

99
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:45,629
Ms. 13 information from 24,000 cognitive effects from 1000 to 2700.

100
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:51,090
And so it was just a good jumping off point for a lot of my research. The basis of this is some of the stuff that happens.

101
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:58,860
And so our next article, which is effects of carbon dioxide exposure on human cognitive abilities in an enclosed workplace environment.

102
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:02,880
And so this is more of a experiment which is starting to get kind of interesting.

103
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:11,100
So there are 15 participants in enclosed chambers, and so they kind of control the air pretty intensely.

104
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:17,399
They both either pumped in carbon to get to the higher concentrations but just get to the lower concentration.

105
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:24,120
They just kind of control the airflow. And so they want to investigate the effects of carbon dioxide in cognitive abilities.

106
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:29,310
And so that three different concentrations, 1530 505,000.

107
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,280
And so they found that they did that in several types of test vs test or Stroop test.

108
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:40,050
The strip test is the one where it's like they'll have a word blue, but it's red.

109
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:43,350
And you have to say like what?

110
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:48,059
What the word says, not the color says and test and the reaction time.

111
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:56,070
And so they found that significant crease in response time for all those tests when you're compared to the lower concentration.

112
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:59,220
So that's due to increased response time, decreased it.

113
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:06,230
And so they said that this reflected the negative abilities or the negative effects of CO2 concentration on human visual tension,

114
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,470
risk, decision making and executive ability, which is like higher cognitive function.

115
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:17,249
And they said that work performance could be negatively impacted by exposure to CO2 at the current occupational concentration limit,

116
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:23,610
which is actually, I think the current. Don't tell, but it's five.

117
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:31,950
I think the answer is 5000 is the time weighted average that workers should be exposed to and they are saying that they're fine.

118
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:35,700
It affects below that so that maybe the current level is not productive enough.

119
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:40,950
If you're looking at productivity and cognitive performance and this is just a table,

120
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:46,439
the test that they did at the bottom, the strip test is like the executive ability test, part test.

121
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,589
It's more of a risky decision making test. And I'm not psychologist.

122
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:56,969
I found it useful to figure out what test they're doing. And there's another test that's kind of similar in a experimental design.

123
00:11:56,970 --> 00:12:02,010
And so it's effects of carbon dioxide exposure on human vigilance and sentiment in an enclosed workspace.

124
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:13,709
Yeah. So I Google search and so a similar exposure set up the like long exposures high and then higher

125
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:19,050
exposure brackets and so they're looking more severe and like sleepiness and like negative affects,

126
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:22,530
which is like negative thoughts and like they weren't your weakness.

127
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:27,390
And so they found that human vigilance decreased significantly with elevated concentrations,

128
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:33,570
particularly about 1500 parts per million, but started to see that increasingly as we got to 3500.

129
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:40,860
And so, interestingly enough, they also said that participants reported less positive and more negative emotions as CO2 increased.

130
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:50,580
So I thought that was incredibly interesting where I don't know exactly how they determine that it is based off the negative effect schedule test,

131
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:54,310
which I've been able to read more to. But I think that's an important,

132
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:59,250
essential kind of mental health and also just overall mood and total worker

133
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:03,690
health where you want to think that carbon dioxide may be making you unhappy,

134
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:05,250
but it could be certainly a contributor.

135
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,540
And so lastly, is CO2 and indoor air pollution direct effects of low to moderate super concentrations on human decision making performance.

136
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:22,019
And so this had a lot larger sample group two participants, they're exposed to CO2 levels of 600, 1000 to 2500 in the office chamber and six groups.

137
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:28,530
And so they is like a computer based test of decision making performance, as well as questionnaires and health symptoms and perceived air quality.

138
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:41,520
And so similarly, products like other the other tests, they found that as is due to increased executive and decision making performance decreased.

139
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:48,690
And so they also noted a potential link of a trade off between environmental

140
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:53,730
concerns of reducing energy emissions to keep buildings and ventilate buildings,

141
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:59,069
but also said that decreased human performance might be an important economic consideration in itself,

142
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:03,660
where salaries are one of the largest considerations for a company.

143
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:10,950
And so ultimately, the literature is pretty clear that high levels of CO2, roughly about 1000 parts per million,

144
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:14,820
will negatively impact decision making, problem solving and vigilance in workplace.

145
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:18,480
Also, it links to mental health. As CO2 rose,

146
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:27,629
adults seem to potentially decrease and I think potential research could be done in the future to link potential CO2 levels to

147
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:35,610
mental health overall and seeing if there's a tradeoff for environmental efficiency and there's really real symbolic health,

148
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:44,129
the buildings kind of got some ideas from it. And yeah, I learned a lot about the kind of safety, climate, culture of workplace stress,

149
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:49,020
subsidies to health, and often all this has to be resilient to future career goals.

150
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:52,380
And this course also taught me a lot about social science, which I've been enjoying.

151
00:14:52,920 --> 00:15:02,370
So I don't have a lot of time. Yeah, maybe I'll be able to get in there and then I'll let your peers ask questions first.

152
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:07,940
Before I ask questions I thought was extremely fascinating.

153
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:12,389
We start there. I was kind of like, What could an individual do in office?

154
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:17,940
Can you just have a ban? I'm assuming that the workplace won't be able to do much.

155
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:21,360
Ah, like you said, they don't want increase inflation because increase costs a lot.

156
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:26,510
This is like they even add on the worker or what did they do that they knew about the.

157
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:28,510
Yeah. Around this. Yeah. Yes.

158
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:34,410
I mean obviously it depends on your relationship to your employer, but also your work environment and how much control they have over it.

159
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:39,660
But obviously, having any kind of fans move in air intrusion, ventilation rates is good.

160
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:42,240
If you can open windows, that's good. That will certainly help.

161
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:50,100
But I mean, there is a good case to be made of increase in ventilation rates, not only for COVID reasons, but for workspace ratings.

162
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:55,650
And there's really good cost benefit analysis done in that healthy buildings book that I referenced.

163
00:15:55,980 --> 00:16:02,490
They look at since salary is one of the highest costs on a payroll organization, they found that even if like,

164
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:09,630
let's say CO2, 2% decrease in performance, if you look at that per employee per hour, it's a huge amount of money.

165
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:15,420
And you could even potentially make that case to your employer to improve ventilation rates, saying that that's going to save the money.

166
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:22,050
I hope that. I know.

167
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:27,320
Question and I'll come and then.

168
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:34,860
So now I will say, for a lot of these new buildings that are LEED certified and like smart buildings,

169
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:41,009
what they do is this building certainly is not because it's old and we are entitled to right now,

170
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:47,640
which I know from talking to the central facilities when it first summer here my office was 90 degrees that

171
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:57,660
it was not insulated but newer buildings where there is a thermostat in each classroom that actually works.

172
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:04,620
When I was at Indiana University, one of the newer buildings was functional based on CO2 emission.

173
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:10,170
That's awesome. Obviously, the more people you have in the room, the more CO2 is expired.

174
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,479
And once it reaches a threshold,

175
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:20,790
the AC takes on or stays on to a certain level until the CO2 levels go back down to a certain level by the price per million.

176
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:26,190
So when it's empty, it knows there isn't as much CO2, so doesn't need to be working as hard.

177
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,900
So I think a lot of the smart buildings are kind of trying to do that with balance.

178
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:38,009
My question for you is, you know, like in a building like this for charging, for example,

179
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:43,630
we can't open our windows because if I open my window without a cigaret, I literally just die here.

180
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:53,350
But some places don't allow you to open the windows because they don't trust the occupants to regulate it.

181
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:56,300
So how do you like balance?

182
00:17:56,610 --> 00:18:05,070
You know, oh, I don't want to jack up the temperature and humidity and cause, like, indoor mode, which is another huge issue versus like, CO2.

183
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,660
Yeah. What do you think? No, I mean I mean, obviously, that's it's a push and pull.

184
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:15,809
I mean, obviously, I feel very important about I feel very strongly about reducing carbon emissions and saving energy.

185
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:20,010
And so it's something you have to own as a per building case, obviously.

186
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:25,060
But I would have a conversation with the building facilities manager or see what should be done.

187
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:31,800
I mean, you mentioned falling out of a building potential that could be mitigated if you have like a window design that doesn't allow you to fall out,

188
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:38,820
but it's a push and pull. And so obviously, I think energy efficiency is incredibly important,

189
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:44,280
but I think maybe potentially more attention needs to be paid to the human impact from CO2.

190
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:49,390
Okay, then I don't know. Another question, if you saw this in your literature review,

191
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:54,209
this is like impacting my kids in school and kind of just like a learning environment of kids

192
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:59,310
that have had 30 kids in some of these classrooms and probably not the best ventilation rates.

193
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:07,230
Did you see any literature looking into that? Yeah, the only one I was trying to focus more on, like the arch, typical office or workspace setting.

194
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,500
But there was that one a little bit.

195
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:17,309
Yeah, there was that one bit about it was the meta analysis study and they found it was more in regards to sick building syndrome,

196
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:19,850
but they found that increased student absenteeism,

197
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:27,360
so basically students being absent and they found decreased cognitive performance among a lot of schools that had higher CO2 levels.

198
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:33,330
So, I mean, I think especially when you're looking at all the impacts that they were having,

199
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:40,390
particularly like on executive function or decision making, I think that the only you could make a case that that's impacting learning somehow.

200
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:44,840
I don't I don't know what exactly part of the brain's activity when you're trying to learn, but.

201
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:52,050
I would say with the oxygen levels. That's a great point.

202
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:58,920
Obviously, oxygen goes to your brain that offers to like energy, essentially energy and like keep your body alive.

203
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:04,109
But then with the like executive decision making, your frontal cortex, prefrontal cortex,

204
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:12,630
which is responsible for a lot of that, it sucks up a lot more oxygen than like speech part or like even the memory.

205
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:18,060
Yeah. Yeah. CO2 monitors are not that expensive.

206
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:25,650
I mean, you can get, like, a good one for 60 bucks or. Yeah, I mean, yeah, it's probably not, like scientifically accurate, right?

207
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:33,120
Pretty average of an algorithm here, I think. But like in your presentation, like you mentioned sick buildings and that is.

208
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:42,000
Nonspecific, whereas building related illness, which sometimes people use those terms interchangeably,

209
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:48,629
building related illness you can very much point it to like they're doing asbestos mitigation or

210
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:53,760
something like that where a sick building syndrome is like generally a group of workers in the area.

211
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:56,920
Like I feel the deeds and like not this.

212
00:20:56,970 --> 00:21:01,050
And like then you would do a survey like a physical survey, but also like.

213
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:06,340
The kind of service. Well. Thank you so much, Josh.

214
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:12,070
Very interesting. Thank you. I hope you guys found it illuminating as the next.

215
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:34,230
Rigid. All right. Go for it, Bridget. Also part of that work is, you know, you build up 20 minutes, but it was entertaining.

216
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:37,830
I like it. I was going to be able to listen to the whole time.

217
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:43,080
Okay, Bridget. Yes.

218
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:51,540
All right. Go ahead. Okay. So I chose to do mine on climate change and interactions with mental health and well-being for indigenous peoples.

219
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:55,739
Because I was thinking of just doing climate change and mental health,

220
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:59,340
but then I thought doing something on climate change and mental health kind of

221
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:03,419
minimizes the people that climate change is actually having the largest impact on,

222
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:08,550
which is indigenous people. And that also does go down a lot, which made it easier to find articles.

223
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,780
So that is why my rationale for this topic.

224
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:21,370
So climate change is a significant influencing factor for mental health globally, and in the coming years it's expected to become more significant.

225
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:29,350
And since Indigenous people have a more unique connection with the land compared to other Western culture,

226
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:34,959
they're expected to be the most heavily impacted and some of them in certain areas

227
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,770
are already experiencing the physical and mental health impacts in their daily life.

228
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:48,060
And the. General idea of this presentation is that mental health and wellbeing issues for Indigenous people

229
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:53,730
generally stem from the physical disruptions caused by climate change that lead to cultural disruptions,

230
00:22:54,180 --> 00:23:00,870
which feeds into their mental health and wellbeing issues. So as I've already mentioned, some background,

231
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:08,220
climate change is expected to greatly change the landscapes in which we live and this is especially significant for Indigenous groups

232
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:15,330
since the landscape in which they live has high cultural importance and heavily influences the cultural practices that they observe.

233
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:21,680
And many indigenous groups rely heavily on the land for wild food and subsistence,

234
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:25,880
so they will primarily get their food from hunting or farming, depending on where they are.

235
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,590
And Indigenous models of wellness, as I've mentioned, is classic.

236
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:34,600
A couple of times it's like they don't view the health of the environment as separate from their own health.

237
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,370
So it's really important that those two things are intertwined outside of the sea in there because.

238
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:44,540
Some groups have more significance with the sea rather than the land, just depending on where they live.

239
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:49,880
And for communities in vulnerable and remote areas.

240
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:55,250
The risk that climate change poses to these key factors are more pronounced and severe.

241
00:23:56,090 --> 00:24:00,250
So most of the research in this area focuses on indigenous groups in the Arctic areas.

242
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:05,450
As you can expect, they're already experiencing a lot of the things that we've been talking about climate

243
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:12,740
change with sea ice changing and just different influences over their ecosystems.

244
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:20,230
And these groups are especially well researched because they already have generally higher rates

245
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:25,570
of preexisting mental health issues compared to other populations in other areas that are not.

246
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,600
This is a figure from one of the papers,

247
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:41,649
but you can see the general idea that they have is that physical impacts influence human systems and infrastructure impacts that influences mental,

248
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:46,540
physical and community health impacts. I simplified this a little bit.

249
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:54,550
To just say that the physical disruptions contribute to cultural disruptions that contribute to mental health and wellbeing issues.

250
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:59,980
And I want to walk through each of these kind of steps and I'll give a couple of examples.

251
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:06,130
So fiscal disruptions included changes to sea ice loss of land due to sea level rise.

252
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:14,800
Natural disasters. This includes long term disasters like droughts and acute disasters like natural disasters, hurricanes, storms and stuff like that.

253
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:18,020
They're also experiencing less access to land,

254
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:26,030
whether that be from losing the land due to sea level rise or just bureaucratic government issues that they can't access their land.

255
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:31,910
Groups have already been noticing changes in culturally significant animals and wild foods.

256
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:37,880
So they've already noticed some new illnesses or population reductions in the foods that they normally eat.

257
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:42,739
There's also been a large variability in weather like rain and snow.

258
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:47,719
Groups used to be able to predict what the rain and snow is going to be like.

259
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:52,880
And now it's become so variable that they usually don't have any idea what the season is going to be like.

260
00:25:55,260 --> 00:26:00,370
They're also threatened ecosystems, especially in already sensitive ecosystems like the tundra.

261
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:06,810
This can really influence their livelihoods with the animals that they eat in the crops that they grow.

262
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:11,490
Also, vector borne disease outbreaks also in the Arctic.

263
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,920
I'm going to talk a lot about the Arctic.

264
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:22,200
Also in the Arctic, the permafrost is melting and that has different diseases that we haven't seen because it was in the permafrost.

265
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:27,479
So that's like an emerging issue for them. And also existing infrastructure issues.

266
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:31,890
A lot of times, as we know in the US, they don't have access to things like clean water.

267
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:36,209
It's somewhat like deliberately designed that they're disadvantaged so they

268
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:40,170
don't have access to things like clean water or easy access to health care,

269
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:46,600
which kind of compounds a lot of these issues. So some cultural disruptions.

270
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:50,380
A large one is the inability to pass along traditional knowledge.

271
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:59,109
A lot of this has to do with losing their land. If they had specific ceremonies related to the land or if their group traditionally

272
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:02,230
hunted a kind of animal and they're not able to do that kind of hunting anymore.

273
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:07,480
That has had a huge contributor, huge destruction for a lot of groups.

274
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:17,470
Lots of cultural practices. Some groups have lost access to local land, which is where they do their traditional healing practices.

275
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:23,200
And that's just one example of some of the things that they're losing as they lose access to the land or as the land is being degraded.

276
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,210
Some groups have been relocated or are in the process of being relocated.

277
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:37,020
This is another huge stressor for these groups, especially. Because they might be relocated due to sea level rising or just in general,

278
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:44,070
like the area that they live in has become inhabitable and their cultural ties to land are really important to them.

279
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:52,790
Loss of traditional livelihoods. I'm going to go into an example in a second here about losing their traditional livelihoods,

280
00:27:54,470 --> 00:28:04,930
but that's another significant disruption of citizens, the inability to pass on traditional knowledge and then some travel restrictions.

281
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:08,060
They can be restricted to one area,

282
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:16,219
and that causes boredom and other mental health issues for some members of these groups and then loss of sense of place,

283
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:21,860
which ties into the relocation, ties into the changes that they're experiencing in their landscapes.

284
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:28,640
So this is just an overview of the mental health and wellbeing issues. There were a lot in the literature that I looked at.

285
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:38,480
So some of them are loss of self-worth, anxiety, depression, PTSD, especially after extreme natural disasters.

286
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:43,370
Sadness, hopelessness and fear for a future, especially among younger people,

287
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:51,649
general worry and emotional distress, substance abuse, food insecurity, limited employment opportunities,

288
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:56,090
especially if they're losing a traditional livelihood and they don't have other skills to get a different job,

289
00:28:56,870 --> 00:29:01,970
or there just aren't jobs in the area and lifestyle changes and grief.

290
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:09,200
So going into an example, the Saami people are in the northern part of Scandinavia.

291
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,040
They're the only indigenous group in the European Union.

292
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:18,200
So some of the reindeer herding is like their traditional livelihood.

293
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,640
It's how most of them are employed. How they get by.

294
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:27,819
So the physical changes. There have been warmer winters and changes in the landscape which have led to some parasite

295
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:33,940
outbreaks among reindeer leading to reindeer mortalities and negative impacts on reindeer grazing,

296
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:36,310
which has led to decreased production for them.

297
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:42,550
So this has led to loss of their traditional livelihoods and diet, as reindeer is also a food for them.

298
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:47,830
And this has led to this great fear for future and other mental health issues.

299
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:55,540
I should mention that this group seems to have been relatively well insulated from some of the experiences that other indigenous people have had.

300
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:58,750
So they've been able to maintain their traditional livelihood for so long.

301
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:05,440
So fear for future and other mental health issues is not as extreme as it is for other groups.

302
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:10,040
And this is an example from New South Wales, Australia.

303
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:18,830
So chronic drought led to deterioration in crops and livestock in Australia, which is a loss of traditional livelihoods for these people.

304
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:23,120
And this led to people in the community experiencing increased substance use,

305
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:28,370
interpersonal conflict, suicidality, and decreased social and emotional well-being overall.

306
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:35,470
And some other key findings from the literature search.

307
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:43,750
The cumulative impacts of many different physical disruptions and the mental health issues that people are experiencing are not well studied.

308
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:50,290
It's hard for studies to find links in cumulative impact to the usually study like one thing at a time.

309
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:55,480
So it's important to keep in mind, but it's not well-studied.

310
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:00,370
It probably is an issue. And concerned about displacement, as I've already mentioned,

311
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:09,760
is a growing concern for many groups because some groups can see the threat in the future, even though it hasn't yet arrived to them.

312
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:18,640
And then potential increase in chronic disease burden, as we've seen in the US, as people were being displaced,

313
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:26,680
they lost their traditional foods, they lost their traditional lifestyles, which led to a lot of them developing chronic illnesses,

314
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:30,760
which is something that they can see in the Saami people that we talked about earlier,

315
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:39,220
because usually their health is better in the general population, but they can see it start to be about the same, which is.

316
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:44,419
That. So conclusions.

317
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:51,980
Climate change is likely to be one of the main factors influencing mental health in coming years, and especially for indigenous groups worldwide.

318
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:56,979
And again, the fiscal impasse contributes to cultural disruptions,

319
00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:01,840
which lead to a variety of mental health and wellbeing issues in indigenous communities.

320
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:09,340
And future research in this area should focus on gathering information from indigenous groups in South America.

321
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:13,290
That was an area that was not well represented in the studies.

322
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:18,240
It was mostly in the Arctic, in the North America, in Europe.

323
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:23,090
So they need to expand the research scope and include more voices.

324
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:32,020
And they need to do more research to understand the cumulative impacts of all these disruptions that these people are facing.

325
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:41,620
And as for what I learned this semester. I learned a lot about how the work environments influence how you had a path that

326
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:47,649
focused mostly on physical hazards like physical and chemical biological hazards.

327
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:54,250
So this was more in on the issues like stress and other social factors, which I feel like are more relevant.

328
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:58,770
I don't know. Silly people who are not industrial hygiene, I.

329
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:09,760
I also kind of change my perspective on workplace interventions because I kind of I felt like employee wellness programs.

330
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:14,490
I felt like they were misplaced in the way that I've experienced them.

331
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:21,200
So like about the prior interventions that like more well, I was thinking of like our health department that I worked at.

332
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:28,510
So like learning about like the interventions that places that are more well funded to prevent issues was really interesting.

333
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:35,439
And also our conversations about stress work and its impact on the body were very

334
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,520
interesting and I will continue to think about them moving forward in my career.

335
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:48,010
And that is it. Sections for grandchildren.

336
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:53,990
Every a simple one. But why did you choose this topic or are you just interested in it or.

337
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:59,340
Well, I kind of tried to talk about it, but like I was I do like all my projects on climate change.

338
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:05,840
It's just like a major area of interest. But then I was thinking of like psychosocial factors and I was like,

339
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:09,950
climate change is kind of the psychosocial factor for indigenous people like that

340
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:14,509
almost was the title of the presentation was like opinion does a psychosocial factor.

341
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:17,710
But then I was like. Not super sure on that. So.

342
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:24,250
Yeah. And there's also like I remember before I started my undergrad degree, I read an article on.

343
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:28,940
Indigenous people in Greenland and their lake.

344
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:37,160
They have a high suicide rate due to a lot of these things, like their loss of their traditional way of life due to climate change.

345
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:43,970
And each of the indigenous health class or indigenous.

346
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,070
Yeah. Sustainability. Yes.

347
00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:49,050
Lots to think about here.

348
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:57,200
Gosh, aren't we just the worst and just burning the earth for indigenous people, which I think is like the allegory that they try to convey and.

349
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:01,840
Avatar, James Cameron and movie English.

350
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:04,870
I've seen a trailer with the new ones. No, thank you.

351
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:07,420
But I've seen some of the things that you're talking about.

352
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:17,800
Like I think with the Aboriginals in Australia as well, they're starting to get like a surge in type two diabetes that wasn't there before.

353
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:21,460
Again, like the changes to your environment.

354
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:28,210
So what do you think? You know, we have these future direction recommendations.

355
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:35,169
Do you think it's that not like people aren't doing research on this because they don't

356
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:40,270
know or they don't care or they don't have the tools to do it or like all of the.

357
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:48,800
I think it might be all that. I was also thinking and this was like an issue in the Indigenous sustainability class.

358
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:55,380
Generally Indigenous groups want to do research with Indigenous researchers.

359
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:59,940
And so when you think about South America, I was literally just think about this earlier today.

360
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:07,410
You think about South America almost those groups are either Spanish speaking or they speak their indigenous languages.

361
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:11,280
So that's not going to get translated necessarily.

362
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:15,980
So I think part of the reason why a lot of it's focused on the North is that all

363
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:19,500
of that gets translated into English or is written in English to start with.

364
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:26,010
So I was thinking about that. But also like people aren't necessarily researching it or.

365
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:31,549
Good. So I just had a question and I know you said you simplified some of it,

366
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:37,270
but I guess in terms of like combination model, I don't have the right term compounding.

367
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:44,930
Yeah. And like the the physical description, but like and then it has a functional impact.

368
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:48,880
But I mean, is there any I guess maybe that's easier to study it?

369
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:53,190
I mean, is there any impact on mental health or just the knowledge of the physical disruption?

370
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:59,930
Because like, I feel like that in of itself is also a positive development, let alone that like, oh, now I can't go vision.

371
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:04,620
That sucks. But just knowing that still they could ruin doesn't I guess.

372
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:13,010
Yeah, this model shows that more. I just kind of skipped over that part because I was like, I want the more simple, like, linear.

373
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:17,260
Was easier for me to explain in the short version.

374
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:23,930
But yeah, this you can see like the physical impacts do go directly into the mental health impacts of the health effects.

375
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:30,000
What about that? I would say good times before.

376
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:36,459
In this class I did a study with Lebanese refugees and in their language vocabulary.

377
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:45,400
They don't have words for depression. They just have a word for sadness, which is equal to the sadness someone feels when someone else dies.

378
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:54,190
But there isn't like that nuance of like, Oh, I feel depressed or I feel like agitated or I feel lethargic or I feel like hopeless.

379
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:57,950
So I don't. But every language is different, right?

380
00:37:57,970 --> 00:38:08,620
So I just don't know what the rest of the vocabulary is to be able to like verbalize these research findings as well.

381
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:16,900
Like if it was translated. But I was saying I do know another Indigenous scholar and she teach,

382
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:29,860
she tries to eat this robot and it is indigenous language from the San Diego area alive and she is an assistant professor at Georgetown.

383
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:35,320
But a lot of Indigenous scholars, actually, all the Indigenous scholars I know, which are less than a handful,

384
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:47,050
are always seated in philosophy departments or like LSA kind of departments rather than one climate change or public health or something like that.

385
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:56,210
So they have the capability to like. Communicate with these populations that that is of their research expertise or foci.

386
00:38:56,450 --> 00:39:02,270
So there's a potential in the future just kind of like collaborate with these indigenous scholars.

387
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:11,089
Then get more into this area. So actually the professor that teaches the Indigenous sustainability class,

388
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:18,350
he actually started as a philosophy like his pages in philosophy, but now he's in seas, obviously doing like environmental research.

389
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:21,440
He's like the head of the environmental justice track.

390
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:29,320
Oh, yeah. So. Yeah. There's this one person that made the jump from philosophy to environmental science.

391
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:33,080
So, yeah, we'll see in the future.

392
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:39,230
Very important. Thank you again. Who's next?

393
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:48,080
Okay, then. Just by themselves is. I preference.

394
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:57,639
I don't know if I understood the assignment correctly. I did a literature review behind my survey in that survey development.

395
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:01,920
So it's a literature review, but we also have topics on my survey in here.

396
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:07,750
So, you know, just be nice. Where was their willingness to go with the.

397
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:16,310
That's okay. Now I'll forgive you. All right.

398
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:25,919
So my survey and literature review both for going behind living experiences or living environments

399
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,700
or your neighborhood and your experiences around that impacts on one's perceived stress levels.

400
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:38,670
So we're going to this is kind of our immediate to me mixture format to get messed up or good that always worries me.

401
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:48,060
So this is we're going to abstract background methods for my survey that I use applications based on my literature review and survey.

402
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:53,730
I have like twice, but this is supposed to be learning outcomes, things I've learned this semester.

403
00:40:54,900 --> 00:41:02,880
So that's back. So certain enough. So millions of people across the United States live in poor quality or just lack of a good built environment.

404
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:08,400
This means improper access to quality, greenspace or water, air quality,

405
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:13,470
even energy sustainability, and then increased violence and health and safety issues.

406
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:21,480
So this has an increased burden on people with low income or in within a minority of racial ethnicity backgrounds,

407
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:25,049
and they even face an increased burden of poor built environment.

408
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:31,090
And kind of with these areas kind of living within those with that, as we're in the process,

409
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:38,310
as more minority populations are often led to living in environments they haven't, leading to increased risk of numerous negative health outcomes.

410
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:46,080
So into that negative health outcomes and no one in unknowingly the built environment has had many impacts on one's physical and mental health,

411
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:53,520
such as physical, like increased diabetes, increased risk of cardiovascular issues, mental health issues,

412
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:57,000
feeling hopelessness and kind of just kind of being stuck with the news.

413
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:02,430
So this is specific looking, specifically looking at the relationship between ones,

414
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:07,739
how they conditions their living environment or neighborhood and different aspects of the built environment,

415
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:12,060
how all of those kind of relate to each other and how they relate to one's stress level.

416
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:19,860
Okay. So our background system, the background of the literature review I did, it was based on like four different articles.

417
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:25,200
So those environments characterize human health features or modify human health activities.

418
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:30,879
This can impact or this really kind of examples of it is like their road your housing.

419
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:36,990
And I like to describe it as kind of like anything you can touch within in your living environment and kind of come and interact with.

420
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:42,090
So this can impact individuals and the community itself and how people interact

421
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:47,370
with the built environment and how the built environment reacts with them. So a shift between the environment.

422
00:42:47,370 --> 00:42:52,410
One cycle, slight psychological stress and mental health have been shown for many years that they are related.

423
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:57,389
But there are many confounding variables that kind of like seeing how directly that's

424
00:42:57,390 --> 00:43:01,260
related to each other and kind of like what is a fundamental driver for these issues.

425
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:07,560
So kind of going, for example, neighborhood attributes such as crowding and social disorder,

426
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:15,420
inadequate housing violence may cause increased stress over time, which then can be to other meaning negative health impacts.

427
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:22,769
So in addition to this kind of feeling of social connectedness, social support, having low and low,

428
00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:28,890
those are those can have increased or create impact on these stressors up here.

429
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:35,250
And specifically, looking at the pathways of a built environment and mental health outcomes can often be very

430
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:41,340
complex and hard to differentiate from one another and how those kind of impacted communities and

431
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:45,990
different people must be kind of something is kind of interesting thought that within each

432
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:51,420
community they are different and kind of have different views on the environment around them.

433
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:56,939
So within each community, native health outcomes maybe mitigated by one sense of community,

434
00:43:56,940 --> 00:44:00,420
sense of power, social security and individual perspectives on the environment.

435
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:05,510
Kind of, for example, if one perceives environment as just really little poor quality,

436
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:10,139
then they're going to be kind of always feeling that stress of living in a poor quality environment

437
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:14,700
without being able to do anything compared to communities that may really love where they're living.

438
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:18,810
You know, it really contributes to their well-being and mental health.

439
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:27,659
So how those differentiate from each other then? Unfortunately, a city above many minority populations and individual flow,

440
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:32,640
economic status or kind of forest and have very little access to get out of these poor,

441
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:38,310
poor built environments that can contribute negatively to their health and worse mental health outcomes.

442
00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:43,800
So the method of my survey development, really,

443
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:51,959
this is a conceptual model that I kind of use I that it from these articles will go over in a second but I

444
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:57,870
stated above I was interested and interested looking into the reasons shift between your housing conditions,

445
00:44:58,230 --> 00:45:03,510
your living living conditions or your in your neighborhood, and then different aspects of the built environment,

446
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:10,650
how those relate to each other, and then also how those can kind of lead to worse or better stress levels.

447
00:45:12,730 --> 00:45:17,130
I mean, this first article, kind of the first part of my message.

448
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:21,290
It was creating these two aspects here. You're living conditions in your housing conditions.

449
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:30,050
And I did this off of an article and what they were measuring the housing pitch and housing characteristics and built environment, mental health.

450
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:36,230
So they were more interested in more of like densely populated areas of high rise residential areas.

451
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:40,849
And how well not many space. Not large rooms.

452
00:45:40,850 --> 00:45:43,970
And not really having good access to outside and fresh air.

453
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:47,089
Now, what you talk about, Josh, you know, not much ventilation can impact them.

454
00:45:47,090 --> 00:45:53,570
So I is understanding how that is different and I think they're doing it in Hong Kong and to different neighborhoods and comparing each other.

455
00:45:54,470 --> 00:45:57,020
So this is their living environment, the scale that they used.

456
00:45:57,350 --> 00:46:01,310
They were looking at satisfaction of neighborhood, air quality, noise level and sense of community.

457
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:06,230
And I really liked these, but I did adapt them a little bit, some of the questions they had.

458
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:12,769
So for air quality noise level, I also added to how do you rate your air quality,

459
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:18,310
such noise level in your neighborhood from not very good to excellent?

460
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:24,860
And then on top of this and in the last months that air quality and noise level made neighborhoods made difficult me difficult

461
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:33,649
for me to do daily tasks if I'm just looking really at these two things that people see in it that is getting in some way.

462
00:46:33,650 --> 00:46:39,530
If it's having health outcomes such as asthma, making it hard or noise level where you just can't concentrate.

463
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:47,060
And this next part of the living environment was looking at the sense of community.

464
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:55,639
And I really love the theory of sense of community. It's the membership you have within your community, the influence you have on it's an influence.

465
00:46:55,640 --> 00:47:02,990
It has a new shared emotional connection between everyone there and the fulfillment of needs within what's among all the members there.

466
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:06,590
So they were using that also in the article,

467
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:15,620
and then I just kind of adapted a different article I was able to find about them kind of looking directly into this in Detroit.

468
00:47:15,890 --> 00:47:23,090
It's developed by shows at all, and they just had some really good questions, looking into a sense of community within Detroit specifically.

469
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:28,520
Okay. And then their housing conditions, this is their again, their scale,

470
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:33,860
the questions they kind of used within their article, the housing tenure or kind of rents and your monthly payment.

471
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:40,310
How what is it like housing affordability type of housing and size of home or just housing in general?

472
00:47:40,730 --> 00:47:43,910
So I made some changes to that. So how long have you lived in your current home?

473
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:48,520
And I had like a scale of 1 to 10 years, I believe, in the last year.

474
00:47:48,530 --> 00:47:52,190
How many months did it take? Did you start make your rent or mortgage payments?

475
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:58,580
So as I was kind of seeing that the housing affordability, is that an extra stress level on the families living their.

476
00:47:59,590 --> 00:48:04,600
Okay. The next construct within the conceptual model I used was measuring the built environment.

477
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:12,130
I based part of it on this that you are able to count his residential perspectives on a built environment and social capacity.

478
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:13,600
Within this,

479
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:21,340
they were kind of looking at the same thing how the built environment around them and people's views on it can impact social capacity or capital.

480
00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:27,950
So we wouldn't have that organism. So I looked at the to measure their built environment.

481
00:48:27,970 --> 00:48:35,400
They had these two skills, local amenities, neighborhood walkability that I use to kind of use as a proxy to measure the built environment.

482
00:48:35,410 --> 00:48:41,860
And then I had that really focused on their social capacity since I had that address in the other constructs.

483
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:51,249
Okay. So local amenities is just kind of within. I think I was a five minute drive, a ten minute walk within outside your neighborhood.

484
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:57,190
Are these kind of there? So some ones that they had was an open space community newsletter.

485
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:03,190
Crime Prevention Program. Health. Family Health or Mental Health Services and Banking Center.

486
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:07,239
So I didn't really know what they meant by community newsletter.

487
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:14,850
So we took that one out and then I added some other ones that were kind of just local amenities that are common in neighborhoods,

488
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:22,570
places of worship, libraries, farmer's market or community recreational center, or just kind of a shopping center in general.

489
00:49:24,970 --> 00:49:29,560
The next kind of thing to measure the built environment was the neighborhood walkability scale.

490
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:34,400
So within the last month has an individual in the household kind of walk to these areas.

491
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:44,920
So a friend's home, retail store, not really grocery store, parks, place for recreation, restaurant club, public transport stop.

492
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:48,510
So I made two minor changes.

493
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:56,440
I kind of added instead of just a club, a bar slash coffee shop, and then I added a grocery store since they excluded that one within their scale.

494
00:49:57,850 --> 00:50:02,679
Lastly, these are just general built environment qualities that I was able to kind of see.

495
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:05,920
These were just general things that are associated with the built environment.

496
00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:10,710
So kind of looking into the quality of the roads or sidewalks I lit up at night.

497
00:50:11,470 --> 00:50:18,910
Utilities such as lighting, lighting, water, air, and just measuring those contributing to your health.

498
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:24,460
How would you rate them access to green space and the quality of green space and that overall consequence in this.

499
00:50:25,950 --> 00:50:31,169
Okay. And then lastly, to kind of bring that all together into the stress, I just use the tried and true.

500
00:50:31,170 --> 00:50:39,810
This is a perceived stress scale. And then we had had that in the survey to measure it how those all impact stress and how we measure each other.

501
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:46,230
Okay. And then say the literature review that I did develop the survey, these are complications,

502
00:50:46,230 --> 00:50:52,290
recommendations I will pull out and ones that kind of stood at me the indication so within this is better

503
00:50:52,290 --> 00:50:56,340
understanding the complex nature of the built environment and its impacts on human health as a whole.

504
00:50:56,910 --> 00:50:59,610
Like I said earlier, measuring the built environment,

505
00:50:59,610 --> 00:51:06,870
its impacts on individuals is hard to really define and kind of have solid as the statistics to support it.

506
00:51:08,130 --> 00:51:12,180
And then another one is to advocacy resources for resources,

507
00:51:12,190 --> 00:51:19,930
resource to support built environment of quality is showing that people are living within poor built environment have worse health outcomes.

508
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:23,130
So this is more tools to use to allocate resources.

509
00:51:24,270 --> 00:51:30,420
Recommendations. Use research to understand the fundamental disparities of the quality of a built environment and its impacts on human health.

510
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:34,830
So it's just more workstation to understanding those different pathways.

511
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:42,930
And then one that really stood out to me and article control that I always like create partnerships with committed residents and community,

512
00:51:43,470 --> 00:51:44,910
community based organizations.

513
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:52,980
They have a platform to get voices out and to bring attention to some of these issues and just really to bring their their life stories into research,

514
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:58,120
because that's what really good way to bring out advocacy change. Okay.

515
00:51:58,230 --> 00:52:03,890
And what I learned coming into this class, I did have much understanding about occupational health.

516
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:07,170
And also I was really looking for a kind of broadening my knowledge around that area.

517
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:11,790
And along with Britta said, my understanding is this kind of physical health issues,

518
00:52:12,030 --> 00:52:18,489
but not as much as psychosocial factors that impact it then throughout this an occupational environment.

519
00:52:18,490 --> 00:52:21,760
So that's how we can use conceptual models to understand really complex issues,

520
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:27,900
kind of break them down, down into plain language and specifically using those to bring out themes.

521
00:52:28,950 --> 00:52:36,240
LESLIE Best part is this the survey development and survey research analysis that we were able to kind of practice those skills in the introduction.

522
00:52:36,930 --> 00:52:40,170
I think they were really valuable skills to build on them.

523
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:49,070
That's it. Meaning that stands for skiing and.

524
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:59,940
Here. It was your pollster based on survey development.

525
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:08,660
I had the literature in the poster. So you're so you're poster initiated by the same topic.

526
00:53:09,410 --> 00:53:13,129
I thought we had to do that. Okay. So, all right.

527
00:53:13,130 --> 00:53:17,930
I have one students. I will think about how to grade this.

528
00:53:18,410 --> 00:53:21,889
Yes, that's right. Unified. Unified.

529
00:53:21,890 --> 00:53:27,590
I just thought. Well, so far, so I'm not too worried. But yeah, I don't need slides.

530
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:31,720
You also put noise as an.

531
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:35,270
Oh, I see. Is that a slowing down?

532
00:53:35,270 --> 00:53:39,020
That's a plain typo. Okay. Okay. All right.

533
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:44,450
Sorry. I made it clear that they were different topics.

534
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:48,210
I think me looking at the assignments realized that they were different.

535
00:53:48,230 --> 00:53:51,950
Okay. Yeah, I did. I didn't have the. The first part of this.

536
00:53:51,970 --> 00:53:56,660
I actually thought it was on the same thing, but I eventually figured it out.

537
00:53:56,660 --> 00:53:59,989
I read the sign at the time to make sure I was like, okay, this is good. Same assignment.

538
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:06,000
But then see, Josh was like, okay, this is based on the assignment and spelling.

539
00:54:07,070 --> 00:54:10,219
So it was the weekend. It was yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

540
00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:16,250
But if you toggle into the files section, it's, it's like it's own folder as well.

541
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:20,700
I mean some students did do similar topics, so just say like the,

542
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:28,400
I think I the example of like contra drug testing like the two sides of that example poster.

543
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:35,080
Actually, no, she did a survey and and psychosocial factors this hasn't happened before,

544
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:39,280
but this is absolutely by the way, we're not learning and we're all just learning to go.

545
00:54:39,310 --> 00:54:42,320
Yeah, learning. But you know what you did?

546
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:45,800
It doesn't really matter. That's okay. It's okay.

547
00:54:47,090 --> 00:54:51,170
All right. Yeah. Did you do the same? Okay.

548
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:57,380
All right. Made it easy for me and I didn't have to do a whole lot of extra research.

549
00:54:57,770 --> 00:55:01,690
But that. Yeah.

550
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:04,760
Because yours is is Josh GROSS.

551
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:08,740
Your survey is great. Great, great.

552
00:55:09,610 --> 00:55:13,150
Yeah. And then, Bridget, yours is not an indigenous population.

553
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:17,710
I'm all for greenspace. Okay, that's good. I thought it was green space.

554
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:29,790
Okay. All right. Go ahead. Okay. The research I looked into is about the psychosocial factors and workplace violence among health care workers.

555
00:55:30,870 --> 00:55:34,229
As defined by the W.H.O.

556
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:44,550
The workplace violence is incidences, incidents where staff are abused, threatened or assaulted in circumstances related to their work,

557
00:55:44,910 --> 00:55:52,110
including commuting to and from work involving an explicit and with a challenge to their safety,

558
00:55:52,110 --> 00:56:01,410
well-being and health, which implies this workplace violence could be physical or psychosocial.

559
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:12,720
There's four types of workplace violence, and so this table shows the description and example.

560
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,920
Actually, in the health care setting,

561
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:26,070
the most common one is tied to the type two as perpetrator is the customer or patient of the workplace or employees.

562
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:33,150
The example is like, for example, the intoxicated patient punches and there's a.

563
00:56:36,910 --> 00:56:45,810
So this psychosocial factors serves as the risk factors and the consequences.

564
00:56:45,850 --> 00:56:52,209
At the same time, the workplace violence, the violence, for example,

565
00:56:52,210 --> 00:57:02,350
the specific and psychosocial characteristics of a patients and health care workers are risk factors for workplace violence events.

566
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:10,930
And also since workplace violence incidents are stressful and can be traumatic on many occasions.

567
00:57:11,830 --> 00:57:22,150
So these can results in psychosocial consequences like anxiety, post traumatic stress disorder and depression.

568
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:31,640
So I, I would introduce the psychosocial factors as risk factors and the consequences.

569
00:57:33,270 --> 00:57:40,650
For the risk factors. It can be divided into patient related factors and.

570
00:57:42,570 --> 00:57:52,450
And health care related factors. And at the same time it could be divided it as proximal factors and the distal factors,

571
00:57:52,450 --> 00:57:59,510
the proximal factors means that they could directly impact on the individual's presence.

572
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:17,290
PSI, psychological state and distal factors are the factors that could impact the the workplace violence through the impact of proximal factors.

573
00:58:18,850 --> 00:58:27,730
So the patient related proximal factors, including like the patient's clinical conditions like delirium,

574
00:58:28,090 --> 00:58:33,639
substance intoxication, brain injury and anxiety.

575
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:45,640
Due to the threat of major ailment, patients may be proceed to long waiting time and end the psychiatric illness.

576
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:55,690
And patient related distal factors, including like social isolation and deprivation.

577
00:58:57,010 --> 00:59:09,940
Born may be viewed in violent acts displayed through all kinds of electronic media or just viewing aggressive acts and in their family or society.

578
00:59:12,530 --> 00:59:25,970
For the health care related factors. Like the proximal factors such as the work load in the acute and emergency setting crowded environments

579
00:59:26,510 --> 00:59:33,590
inflicting converted painful experiences on the patients and your staff delay in treatment response.

580
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:42,020
Actually, I have a personal experience about inflicting confirmed painful experiences on the patients.

581
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:50,810
That's when I was doing what I was doing a nursing internship in the hospital and the last year of my undergraduate.

582
00:59:51,330 --> 00:59:59,120
And so like I had to test the blood glucose that the patients I need to use the little device

583
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:05,990
like there is a needle inside it and then you use your push that device on the patient's finger.

584
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:10,160
It would break that skin and then you collect the blood.

585
01:00:10,430 --> 01:00:24,020
And there's is one patient who who is very afraid of the needle, and he thinks that's too much pain and I just need to do the job.

586
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:27,169
But the end is near.

587
01:00:27,170 --> 01:00:34,700
Relatives think that this shows them they show a sense of hostility to me.

588
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:45,310
There's this kind of experience. And another is health care related distal factors like for.

589
01:00:48,490 --> 01:00:54,810
Past experience of violence in the workplace and a sense of both vulnerability and a lack of training.

590
01:00:54,900 --> 01:01:10,309
Aggression management. This is a hypothetical integrated model raised by one of the study and explained the

591
01:01:10,310 --> 01:01:17,630
change I mentioned about like the distal factors could impact on the proximal factors

592
01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:25,010
and then modified by some modifying factors like for coping scale was the lack of

593
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:31,570
proper security in more place and then finally result in workplace violence events.

594
01:01:33,450 --> 01:01:37,410
So. But there's social and psychosocial consequences.

595
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:51,840
There's three major populations. I learned from all those articles they are emergency medical service responders and nurses and doctors.

596
01:01:52,290 --> 01:02:03,330
So for the emergency medical service responders, they found they found out that violence exposure is associated with increased levels of both stress.

597
01:02:03,930 --> 01:02:17,220
And their stress can also be caused by exposure to monotonous operational characteristics like longer working hours or lower wages.

598
01:02:18,150 --> 01:02:30,150
And finally together, the chronic organizes organizational stressors and the cumulative exposure to the violence could.

599
01:02:32,270 --> 01:02:45,860
Together lead to a higher risk of negative psycho logical outcomes to like PTSD for nurses.

600
01:02:47,210 --> 01:02:57,080
The nurses are frequently reported experiencing sadness, shock, confusion, anger and embarrassment following the violence incidents.

601
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:03,080
And this rate is extremely high in emergency departments.

602
01:03:05,330 --> 01:03:15,200
And there's also some longer term impacts as loss of confidence, absences from work,

603
01:03:15,590 --> 01:03:20,450
loss of a good working relationship with colleagues and avoidance of the workplace.

604
01:03:21,350 --> 01:03:24,890
And they are reported to be as high as 60%.

605
01:03:26,270 --> 01:03:32,870
And there's also nurses would also experience the verbal abuse from a physician.

606
01:03:33,140 --> 01:03:37,250
And these are commonly reported in the operating room environment.

607
01:03:38,770 --> 01:03:50,349
Dissuaded by the effects, including the feeling of having no respect and no support from colleagues feeling at the whole place.

608
01:03:50,350 --> 01:04:02,870
Regret and isolation. And for the doctors, doctors like experienced aggression events would also show the signs of.

609
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:15,170
PTSD. I'm the post post-traumatic stress, mental exhaustion and emotional distress after this episode.

610
01:04:18,460 --> 01:04:23,420
And this distress could be constant, maybe noticeable.

611
01:04:23,570 --> 01:04:33,850
A depressed private tivity and a job satisfaction which could cause early burnout and loss of the working days,

612
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:40,360
have collectively impact on the entire health care system.

613
01:04:42,620 --> 01:04:55,040
And there's various preventions raised by several studies like the policies maybe at Target and

614
01:04:55,310 --> 01:05:02,090
minimizing the health care gaps by fostering the primary health care or regular training programs,

615
01:05:02,660 --> 01:05:10,040
focusing on how to deal with the stress of a patient's communication to the patients with respect, empathy and the confidence.

616
01:05:11,130 --> 01:05:20,850
And also appropriate and administrative measures like fostering environment, teaching patients how to cope with stress.

617
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:23,820
And the fact that the verbal and the non-verbal skills.

618
01:05:25,060 --> 01:05:35,530
And also they suggested the find violence assessment tool to predict aggressive acts and find a good

619
01:05:35,530 --> 01:05:42,520
quality and and performance of the security personnel and reduce the exposure to potential aggressors.

620
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:54,020
But all these preventions, they suggested are not evaluated in terms of their effectiveness.

621
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:57,580
So that's the limitation.

622
01:05:58,190 --> 01:06:05,979
But what I learned at this master is first, as various theories,

623
01:06:05,980 --> 01:06:12,580
concepts and the conceptual frameworks, psychosocial factors relating to the occupational health.

624
01:06:12,910 --> 01:06:19,360
And based on these knowledge, I learned the methods of establishing the questionnaire for survey.

625
01:06:19,420 --> 01:06:24,610
And then I carried out a specific practice with all of these experiences.

626
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:34,330
It gave me the initial ability to discover and to measure the psychosocial factors related to occupational health,

627
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:42,520
which allow me to see more humanistic side of occupational health through the lens of psychosocial factors.

628
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:54,080
And as a future occupational health researcher, this will prepare me to analyze and evaluate occupational health issues more comprehensively.

629
01:06:55,820 --> 01:07:04,420
And this is my references. Thank you. Question to the viewer now.

630
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:11,360
I hope I was really interested in my dad as a nurse, and he had an experience one time of two patients in the E.R. who were wielded together.

631
01:07:11,370 --> 01:07:15,780
He didn't know it. They got like sedatives and stuff, but they woke up and they started fighting.

632
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:19,740
And so there's a lot more planes in the air. And I'm curious.

633
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:28,230
Did this like I know because it covered, I think violence or at least threats to medical professionals have increased.

634
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:33,510
Is that kind of what spurred your interest in this or are you just because of your background?

635
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:36,390
It sounds like you worked as a nurse or.

636
01:07:37,110 --> 01:07:46,229
Yeah, I think there at first I tried to work something, some research about substance abuse and social factors.

637
01:07:46,230 --> 01:07:50,010
And then I found there a paper regarding workplace violence.

638
01:07:50,310 --> 01:07:56,280
And then it reminds me of all kinds of experience when I was doing my nursing intern.

639
01:07:56,490 --> 01:08:02,010
So I experience. And not me experience.

640
01:08:02,230 --> 01:08:07,980
Like I saw some nurses experiencing all those workplace violence.

641
01:08:08,670 --> 01:08:11,520
The interns there. Yeah, that's the reason.

642
01:08:13,620 --> 01:08:24,359
So with your ship, because your undergrad is nursing your shift from nursing to public health due to getting burned out on the field?

643
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:28,290
Or was it just a change of pace that you're in for?

644
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:34,740
What spurred your transition to go from the public research?

645
01:08:36,090 --> 01:08:48,090
I guess there's there's a lot of limitations if you are if you're wanted to conduct a nursing career in China because.

646
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:56,670
Nursing in China. Nursing China do not have prescription rights like ever.

647
01:08:57,110 --> 01:09:05,210
You cannot. Got that rise through some test or get certificates.

648
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:14,710
So it's like a. It quality.

649
01:09:15,060 --> 01:09:23,510
I'm sorry. No. There's a big gap between nurse and other health care workers inside the same hospital.

650
01:09:23,780 --> 01:09:27,110
So that makes me feel like I was so constrained.

651
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:35,810
So I, I looked the other fairly when I was at my sophomore year.

652
01:09:36,350 --> 01:09:41,470
So the public health building is just the right beside nurses.

653
01:09:42,950 --> 01:09:52,280
So yeah, I think I try to touch on some public health research and I find it's very fascinating and interesting.

654
01:09:52,970 --> 01:09:57,370
Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. My apologies if I was class.

655
01:09:57,380 --> 01:10:02,090
My mom is a nurse in the nursing home, so she's like a tiny lady.

656
01:10:02,090 --> 01:10:06,409
She's like, I don't she's all of our parents shrink as they age.

657
01:10:06,410 --> 01:10:12,620
So she's like 85 to 1 now, very small.

658
01:10:12,620 --> 01:10:18,649
And like residents punch her all the time just because a lot of them have dementia.

659
01:10:18,650 --> 01:10:23,389
And so at that point, like, they have fewer inhibitions.

660
01:10:23,390 --> 01:10:29,300
A lot of them cause that for a lot of them like say inappropriate things during are

661
01:10:29,390 --> 01:10:34,080
some of them even like slap her butt and stuff like that like the men in particular.

662
01:10:34,100 --> 01:10:40,220
So it's ah depending on the like setting in practice nursing in it's.

663
01:10:42,010 --> 01:10:45,190
It's very challenging, though, my mom, she says.

664
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:49,900
She's tiny, but she's scrappy. Never underestimate a Vietnamese lady.

665
01:10:50,710 --> 01:10:59,350
But I think for a lot of people in particular, like it can definitely cause all those psychosocial factors that you mentioned.

666
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:03,659
So thank you. Okay.

667
01:11:03,660 --> 01:11:07,620
So thank you, Joe, for joining us.

668
01:11:07,650 --> 01:11:13,590
You can contact me and you and I will arrange a time where you can get your presentation.

669
01:11:14,220 --> 01:11:17,580
And then for the rest of you, there is no presenters.

670
01:11:17,580 --> 01:11:27,390
They don't show up. And then so this is like our last class together.

671
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:34,050
And then your final survey is due Thursday of next week during finals.

672
01:11:34,890 --> 01:11:38,879
So that should be our clarification, your worker questionnaire.

673
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:40,800
And it's like most beautiful,

674
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:51,300
perfected final form along with a write up that is not the cognitive interview but should include a detailed analysis plan

675
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:59,640
included within that and where you got all your stuff from so you can copy over some of the things from your cognitive interview.

676
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:02,970
But I will expect to see an analysis plan in there.

677
01:12:03,210 --> 01:12:09,290
Do you remember what we went over the analysis. What week we went over to refresh.

678
01:12:10,890 --> 01:12:17,070
We definitely went over it, I think in weeks two through four on survey methodology.

679
01:12:17,610 --> 01:12:19,079
So like I said before,

680
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:26,700
I don't expect to see things more like we're doing more than just like counts and frequencies and percentages and descriptive statistics.

681
01:12:27,270 --> 01:12:31,920
