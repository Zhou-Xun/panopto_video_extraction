00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:15,980
Hi. Peter Jacobsen. We're continuing with our discussion of the U.S. health care delivery system.

2
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:26,190
After looking at how that structured, let's turn to how it financed who paid for medical care.

3
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:32,460
And I guess that during the overview you have multiple payer system.

4
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:41,540
We have commercial insurance companies, we have employer health pay and the federal and state government.

5
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,770
So let's break that down a little.

6
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:56,190
Commercial insurer Blue Cross Blue Shield, Aetna operate by selling inherent directly to patients in pay a premium for coverage.

7
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:07,790
It's really the heart and soul of the fee for service system and know that before you buy your insurance through a managed care company,

8
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,400
it combines the insurance financing with the health care delivery.

9
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:23,020
When you buy from an insurance company, the insurance company will in turn contract with a network of providers, physician and other specialist.

10
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:31,450
And you pay less if you stay within the network and you pay a little more if you know, out of the network of surgeons.

11
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:40,060
We are largely, though, an employer based system for historical reasons, during and after World War Two.

12
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:49,720
Employers began to provide insurance to provide a competitive advantage in the marketplace for employees.

13
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:58,840
Right now, it's mostly large employers who provide insurance for their employees.

14
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:07,780
Smaller and employers will provide some funding for individuals to purchase their own insurance.

15
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:14,420
Others will be on self-pay. That is, they simply pay for themselves.

16
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:19,270
And then both federal and state government provide insurance.

17
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,590
And the federal government provides.

18
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:32,840
As we've seen, Medicare and Medicaid, Medicare for the elderly, and Medicaid for certain categorically own more people.

19
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:37,360
State government provides some funding as well.

20
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:49,700
While this is a bit outdated, we still have about 50% of patients covered by their employer sponsored insurance coverage.

21
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:53,930
Medicaid is probably about 20% now.

22
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:59,090
Medicare about 15% with the largest decline.

23
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:03,290
And we know that earlier in the rate of the uninsured.

24
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:08,880
What types of policies can people buy now?

25
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:13,890
Some insurance plans only cover catastrophic care.

26
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:25,470
These are high deductible plan. So in a high deductible plan, the individual pays for the monthly premium.

27
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:37,350
That's a fairly small amount. But the insurance coverage doesn't come in until the man pays a fairly high deductible.

28
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,660
Could be a higher $10,000.

29
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:53,040
The idea is to encourage people to stay healthy and to pay out of pocket as a co-pay or as an out-of-pocket payment for primary care.

30
00:03:53,310 --> 00:04:04,260
Some types of preventive care are provided now for free under the Affordable Care Act and only to receive care if they're severely injured.

31
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:17,100
That's a heart problem, commercial inherent and provide a fee for service coverage for a range of acute and non acute care minutes.

32
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:23,280
You know, we've already talked about and government plan we will cover in a few minutes.

33
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:35,960
Someone looking at this in a little more detail. Large employers defined normally those with more than 100 employees.

34
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:49,970
Often, employees help ensure that they didn't act a certain amount per month from the employee paycheck and match and apply that to pay for insurance.

35
00:04:50,450 --> 00:05:00,020
What they usually do usually hire a third party administrator to handle all the logistics that the employee have with regard to health care.

36
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:12,740
And then they purchase what we call reinsurance to avoid large numbers of people with really serious illnesses.

37
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:26,660
In this way, they offer group breaks healing community rating because employees tend to be healthier on average than people who aren't working.

38
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:33,500
They can get group rate and everybody pay the same rate as a function of how

39
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:40,280
much coverage they want to pay for and their no preexisting coverage exclusion.

40
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:49,280
Anyone who's in this large group must be given insurance at the rate that everyone else pays.

41
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:55,700
What we've seen over the last 20 years as a movement away from a defined benefit,

42
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:04,070
that a benefit that you get regardless of anything in particular pension to what we call a defined contribution,

43
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:09,079
which simply means you only get what you put in.

44
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:15,320
And that's particularly important for pensions because you only get what you've saved over time.

45
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:24,440
For small employers often to find that under ten you don't get many benefits and the individual may get some

46
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:33,320
money to comply as part of their salary and benefits package to purchase individual commercial insurance.

47
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:45,190
People who aren't covering, let's say, small business or people who are in 3 to 5 person business, who own their own business,

48
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:53,470
can buy insurance in the individual insurance market, but pay a higher cost and for many, simply unaffordable.

49
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:59,200
I'll never see. And second, the health insurance agency now under the Affordable Care Act,

50
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:08,710
mitigate that somewhat here based on the individual health data so that prior to the Affordable Care Act,

51
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:13,630
there could be exclusion for preexisting conditions.

52
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:22,690
You can also buy a medical or health or savings account or contribute to what we call a health savings account.

53
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:27,280
And it's tax free. So it's off the top line of your salary.

54
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:38,620
And you put that into a health savings account, which you can use to pay for any medical costs during the year for a co-pay,

55
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:45,939
for a deductible, to meet the deductible, but then deductible very high in the idea.

56
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:57,910
Again, you know, so encourage people to pay for the small amount of care and the urgent care, the primary care, and not spend money unnecessarily.

57
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:06,910
The big change over the last almost decade in this new session of the health insurance exchanges under the Affordable Care Act,

58
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:15,520
where you have a menu of options. Some states operate their own, while others to fall to the federal government.

59
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:23,290
The important and the health insurance exchange is that inherent compete for business.

60
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:31,480
One of the concerns initially had been that large employers would simply shift their employees to the health insurance exchanges.

61
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:37,750
Remember, no preexisting condition exclusions under the health insurance exchanges.

62
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:42,610
That hasn't happened. Large employers have not shifted.

63
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:53,620
Some small employers have. But the real benefit for individuals who can now purchase better insurance at a lower price.

64
00:08:54,780 --> 00:09:01,739
Granted, over the last couple of years, premiums have gone up considerably, mainly because young,

65
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:11,640
healthy people have not purchased health care on the inherent changes in the amount that had been anticipated,

66
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:16,080
which meant that the pool had a higher risk.

67
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:26,120
So an older, less healthy, sicker pool and insurers had to raise premiums to pay for their care.

68
00:09:26,705 --> 00:09:29,825
As we've alluded to up to now.

69
00:09:30,275 --> 00:09:37,025
And the government is an important provider and payer of health care in the United States.

70
00:09:37,385 --> 00:09:49,565
Medicare is an entitlement program for elderly, disabled and sustained renal disease patients and suicide end stage renal disease,

71
00:09:49,745 --> 00:09:58,115
kidney dialysis, usually only identifiable disease specifically covered under Medicare.

72
00:09:58,685 --> 00:10:04,025
Otherwise, if you're over 65, you're automatically HMO and disabled.

73
00:10:04,025 --> 00:10:12,605
And any age you can participate in Medicare and are responsible for co-payments and deductibles.

74
00:10:13,295 --> 00:10:23,165
And not all needs are covered, for example. And there's no vision care under Medicare, which is kind of surprising, doesn't make much sense,

75
00:10:23,585 --> 00:10:29,675
but that's the way it is, because Medicare doesn't cover all the needs.

76
00:10:30,245 --> 00:10:39,305
Many patients and most who can afford it purchase Medicare, a supplemental plan also known as many gap programs.

77
00:10:40,025 --> 00:10:47,075
And they cover the interstices where Medicare doesn't cover a particular need.

78
00:10:47,585 --> 00:10:59,285
Medicare currently has for part part A in-hospital insurance, part B in outpatient services.

79
00:10:59,645 --> 00:11:13,445
Part C is Medicare Advantage. And part time is really the growing part of Medicare, essentially a private sector alternative to Medicare Part A and B.

80
00:11:14,045 --> 00:11:22,895
And the advantage, you know, and not to me, honey, that plan may provide an additional benefit beyond Medicare.

81
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:31,535
While the additional benefit rarely cover what a medigap or Medicare supplemental plan would cover,

82
00:11:32,015 --> 00:11:38,285
some people could be quite satisfied with a medicare Advantage program.

83
00:11:38,295 --> 00:11:47,764
The government has subsidized Medicare Advantage as an incentive for the private sector to build on this program,

84
00:11:47,765 --> 00:11:54,785
the idea being that the more people who are in the will use less Medicare.

85
00:11:55,355 --> 00:12:08,975
And that's important because the concern that with the baby boomer population, Medicare won't be fiscally stable over the long term.

86
00:12:09,455 --> 00:12:17,315
Part D was enacted under the Bush administration, and it provides pharmaceutical benefits.

87
00:12:17,675 --> 00:12:24,605
Initially, Medicare did not provide for pharmaceutical care at once until about 2005,

88
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:30,875
when Part D was enacted to provide some level of pharmaceutical benefits.

89
00:12:31,445 --> 00:12:35,524
Partly complicated coverage up to a certain point.

90
00:12:35,525 --> 00:12:45,545
Then there's a gap and then it soon again. So a lot of attention in Congress and in part, the Affordable Care Act collapses that gap,

91
00:12:45,615 --> 00:12:56,105
the so-called donut hole in Medicare, Part D, Medicare, and in a highly successful and effective program.

92
00:12:57,125 --> 00:13:04,445
What what's been forgotten is that when Medicare and Medicaid were enacted in 1965,

93
00:13:05,105 --> 00:13:12,405
many elderly were very poor and couldn't afford any health care at all.

94
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:20,675
And Medicare was literally a life saver for a generation of elderly, low income people.

95
00:13:21,925 --> 00:13:26,875
Hey, the second year program, the government funds Medicaid.

96
00:13:27,445 --> 00:13:31,345
Medicare is strictly a federal governmental program.

97
00:13:31,615 --> 00:13:44,565
Medicaid, in contrast, is a combined federal and state program where the federal government set minimum levels of services and civically.

98
00:13:45,055 --> 00:13:49,625
There are certain benefits that must be provided.

99
00:13:49,645 --> 00:14:01,045
They're mandatory, but state can provide additional optional benefits given declining state budget and increasing Medicaid costs.

100
00:14:01,585 --> 00:14:10,675
Only very wealthy states such as New York and California can really any more provide many optional benefits,

101
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:19,165
more optional benefits, and provide the less money available from the expanding Medicaid population.

102
00:14:19,195 --> 00:14:27,685
What happened is that with the Affordable Care Act, one reason the uninsured have gone down,

103
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:35,305
many have gone on to Medicaid that was expanded under the Affordable Care Act.

104
00:14:35,905 --> 00:14:41,725
Medicaid operates on a formula that determines how much federal funding will match.

105
00:14:42,055 --> 00:14:49,375
The minimum is 50%. The government matched 5000 Medicaid under the Medicaid expansion.

106
00:14:49,735 --> 00:14:55,105
The government pays 100% for the expanded population for ten years.

107
00:14:56,005 --> 00:14:59,425
There are strict eligibility and financial requirements.

108
00:14:59,845 --> 00:15:03,115
Not everyone is eligible for Medicaid.

109
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:08,305
The really categorically eligible program, for example,

110
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:17,485
healthy non-working men generally not eligible, but women with children are initially eligible.

111
00:15:18,175 --> 00:15:21,985
Many states are now enacting work requirement.

112
00:15:22,465 --> 00:15:29,785
Then if you go on Medicaid, you have to at least spend a certain number of hours looking for work.

113
00:15:30,415 --> 00:15:37,495
And I mentioned before, Medicaid is the largest funder of long term care.

114
00:15:38,095 --> 00:15:50,725
It's really primarily for lower middle income families who then spend down to meet Medicaid eligibility requirements for long term care.

115
00:15:50,935 --> 00:16:01,555
And the largest user of Medicaid. About 50% of all Medicaid dollars now are allocated to long term care.

116
00:16:02,215 --> 00:16:07,404
One of the most successful federal and state programs is the HAMP or the State

117
00:16:07,405 --> 00:16:13,465
Children's Health Insurance Program that provides care for all needy children.

118
00:16:14,065 --> 00:16:17,215
And that's been very successful.

119
00:16:17,545 --> 00:16:26,575
The main problem has been in some urban area, reaching low income families to have them apply for the program.

120
00:16:26,995 --> 00:16:32,135
There are some additional federal government programs that are very important to women.

121
00:16:32,245 --> 00:16:41,245
And for one, the veteran care, which in recent years has been an incubator for various quality improvement efforts.

122
00:16:41,725 --> 00:16:46,435
And that's really providing actually excellent parent to a large number of veterans.

123
00:16:46,765 --> 00:16:47,235
Right now,

124
00:16:47,245 --> 00:17:00,175
one of the problems that the VA faces is increasing number of psychiatric problems from returning veterans from recent war and Iraq and Afghanistan.

125
00:17:00,445 --> 00:17:07,015
Government also provides care for current service members and their families.

126
00:17:07,055 --> 00:17:11,034
The TRICARE program, one of the main about TRICARE,

127
00:17:11,035 --> 00:17:19,975
is having the government now provide more care through the private sector rather than through any governmental sources.

128
00:17:20,455 --> 00:17:29,215
And then there's the Indian Health Service, which was set up in 1955 to provide care to patients.

129
00:17:29,635 --> 00:17:33,355
And it's been important sort of health care for Native Americans.

130
00:17:33,685 --> 00:17:46,645
In addition to the care and insurance, the government and the larger sponsor of research probably in the world, the National Institutes of Health,

131
00:17:47,005 --> 00:17:59,185
and some of the most important breakthrough drugs, pharmaceuticals and medical device research, and also garnered bipartisan support.

132
00:17:59,575 --> 00:18:08,965
They're in different institutes of health. That's the National Institute of Mental Health, the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.

133
00:18:09,265 --> 00:18:14,585
National Cancer Institute. They all fund different niches of care.

134
00:18:14,605 --> 00:18:21,295
So most important research innovations have come from NIH sources and the.

135
00:18:21,965 --> 00:18:31,395
Hakim Fund Research on quality of care, one of the most endangered funding sources among government agencies.

136
00:18:31,765 --> 00:18:35,715
It's repeatedly on the chopping block for funding.

137
00:18:36,165 --> 00:18:40,365
But in Nick here, while it took a bit of a budget cut.

138
00:18:40,665 --> 00:18:45,915
It survived. And then the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

139
00:18:46,395 --> 00:18:53,925
And it's really our largest public health research and policy institute.

140
00:18:53,955 --> 00:19:05,715
Importance lies in its ability to build preparedness to prevent public health diseases, funds some vaccine research,

141
00:19:06,135 --> 00:19:11,145
and works with state and local health departments to prevent the spread of disease,

142
00:19:11,445 --> 00:19:21,885
to deal with dangerous epidemics such as serious flu varieties, Ebola, SA and other epidemics.

143
00:19:22,515 --> 00:19:34,925
So in the health care enterprise, incorporate all of the structural elements we've talked about so far and structure the workforce and financing,

144
00:19:35,535 --> 00:19:41,355
but also a lot of activity in the private sector.

145
00:19:41,925 --> 00:19:45,675
You have start up health care systems, for example.

146
00:19:45,915 --> 00:19:54,315
One medical is a new start up dealing with primary care here, medicine for primary care.

147
00:19:54,765 --> 00:19:59,205
Then you have venture capital buying up hospitals and managing them.

148
00:19:59,655 --> 00:20:06,765
You have venture capital going into the startups so that you can have new insurance

149
00:20:06,765 --> 00:20:12,495
providers such as Oscar and online insurance started with venture capital,

150
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:23,415
joint venture or private sector arrangement, and we've defined them, combining for profit U.S. and the nonprofit healthcare enterprises.

151
00:20:23,745 --> 00:20:31,065
Pharmaceutical manufacturers are all for profit enterprises conducting research and development

152
00:20:31,395 --> 00:20:39,014
to build and distribute pharmaceutical products for all sorts of diseases oncology,

153
00:20:39,015 --> 00:20:41,865
drugs, drugs to combat arthritis.

154
00:20:42,135 --> 00:20:51,945
Then you have a device maybe that is boning down on the normal medical equipment and again, all for profit companies.

155
00:20:52,335 --> 00:21:00,345
And then you have the entire health care supply chain through private sector vendor and from finance.

156
00:21:01,095 --> 00:21:13,365
One other enterprise had been mentioned and you may read about it, Amazon is now getting into the game in a big way and sharing in a new approach.

157
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:27,055
Hiring Atul Gawande, a famous health care and commentator to build their enterprise, and getting more competition from the private sector.

158
00:21:27,075 --> 00:21:38,955
With the idea being that the private sector operating on a for profit basis will be able to attack the weaknesses of the current system,

159
00:21:38,955 --> 00:21:43,995
particularly to provide higher quality care at lower cost.
