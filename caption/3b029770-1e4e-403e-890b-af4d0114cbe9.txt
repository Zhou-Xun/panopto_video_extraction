1
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:12,120
Okay. All right. So we're we're barreling towards the end of class, which is nuts.

2
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:22,280
So this is the first is sort of the last third or the third third of our software for scoring as we're entering our third module today.

3
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:31,890
And so the the third module is characterized by topics that sort of cut across, you know, sort of different ideas that we've talked about.

4
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:41,580
We're not going to talk really about specific conditions anymore like we did last week, but rather things that are more sharing across today.

5
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:47,790
We're going to talk about the intersection of mental physical health. This is this is an area that I this is most of what I do, my work.

6
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:51,839
And I'm going to tell you mostly about my work today, not because it's the best work out there,

7
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,340
but I think it's at least you can ask me questions about like details. I can tell you the answers to those questions.

8
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,420
I want to tell you, though, at the top that there's lots of ways that mental,

9
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,489
physical health intersect, that we're not going to be able to talk about in this class.

10
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:10,950
But I just want to name them at the top. So the first is I already talked about a couple of examples of this already.

11
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:15,179
So when I told you about Polygram, so like right is a niacin deficiency, right?

12
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:21,360
So it's a nutritional deficiency that one of some of the symptoms of that are physical symptoms like dermatitis,

13
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,389
but some of them are also what's called at the time dementia.

14
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:29,320
But it was essentially these episodes of delusion and people who would be

15
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,469
experiencing hallucinations and delusions that look like psychiatric symptoms,

16
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:38,220
but fundamentally they were caused by a nutritional deficiencies. So that's one example.

17
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:43,470
We also talked about the relationship between celiac disease and schizophrenia.

18
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,260
Right. And the relationship between that.

19
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:51,180
The idea that there is there are probably many, many maybe hundreds of schizophrenia is but at least one part of that.

20
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:59,400
For some, there's a group of that people that we think there's schizophrenia as a result of a essentially an autoimmune reaction,

21
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:03,150
essentially like an immune disorder that's being expressed in the brain.

22
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:09,470
You may have also, if any of you know somebody who's been diagnosed with cancer,

23
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:14,629
like it's very common for people after a diagnosis of cancer to have a lot of symptoms of depression and anxiety.

24
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:22,640
This is a really difficult thing to adjust to. And so there is an even there's a subfield of oncology called psycho oncology specifically

25
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,890
for like helping people manage the emotional experience of a cancer diagnosis of cancer.

26
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:34,730
There is also the fact that many of our medications that were used either to treat

27
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:41,450
physical health problems can cause mental health problems as some sort of side effects.

28
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:44,600
But it's one that's less common, although not uncommon.

29
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:50,959
But for example, our our first line treatment for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder,

30
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54,710
which are atypical antipsychotics, these things are known to cause type two diabetes.

31
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:59,750
So this is a mechanism where it's not the illness, schizophrenia causing diabetes,

32
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:03,680
but that medications that we use to manage schizophrenia themselves.

33
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:10,999
So we don't quite know why that happens, although we know they cause massive weight, but appears even beyond that.

34
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,059
We can abuse these medications, can have this relationship.

35
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:17,660
And so there's lots of ways that work that mental and physical health.

36
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:20,330
And another example is with long COVID, right?

37
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:28,550
So like the symptoms of long COVID look a lot like depression, but it's not we don't know what it is yet, but it's not it's not unreasonable.

38
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:35,090
Or, you know, when you feel sick, like you feel fatigued, you feel run down, etc.

39
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:42,770
And so that's that's of any illness. But then for this experience of long COVID, which is both more common among people of a history of depression.

40
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:47,510
Right. But then also seems to have some symptoms of depression along with other symptoms.

41
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:57,950
You know, again, essentially, we may in the future understand Long-covid as an example of an essentially a recurrence of depression triggered by,

42
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:03,770
in this case, an infectious agent. So there's lots we don't understand, and this is what I'm trying to say.

43
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:11,780
So I'll tell you a little bit about what I do with the understanding that there's lots of ways that this relationship works in the real world.

44
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,549
I want to remind you that your checkpoint number five is due on Wednesday.

45
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:23,070
So some of you have already asked me for an extension. If you think you're in this boat, you need to ask me for this today.

46
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:26,940
Okay. So I'm willing to wrap reasonable extensions on this.

47
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:35,099
This is a very important checkpoint for you. I'm going to give you a lot of feedback on this to help you really do the best with your paper,

48
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,159
which then you sort of that'll be your last sort of time.

49
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,030
That will have at least a formal time. You're always welcome to set up a time to meet with me,

50
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:46,910
but this will be our sort of last formal opportunity for me to give you feedback on how you're thinking about it.

51
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:52,230
About it. Let me ask if there are questions about about that.

52
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:57,810
Yes. So I was example for the abstract.

53
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:02,280
We don't have to cite the source. No, that's a great question.

54
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:05,580
So you do not need to cite any sources even in this.

55
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:12,880
I would like you to kind of tell me, are you thinking about a stakeholder or not like within the within the body of the outline?

56
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,970
I think it's very helpful for. It's helpful for.

57
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:21,420
And these checkpoints are tools for you to communicate with me and for me to communicate with you about how you're thinking about the project.

58
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:28,970
And so so if you sort of realize as you're writing it, like, oh, I don't have a citation that justifies that, right?

59
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:33,660
That can then go help you put that to help guide you to go find an additional citation.

60
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:42,270
But I really want to know sort of where you're using your stakeholders, like how you're how you're potentially using them in in your paper.

61
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:48,480
Right. So that that's but to answer your question, no, you don't need to cite it in that in the abstract.

62
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:52,320
I would like you to indicate in the actual outline, sort of.

63
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:57,480
Is this a paper or is this a stakeholder that you're planning to use to support that point?

64
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,970
Because it helps me imagine what you're going to write to me.

65
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:08,460
You know, I think the other thing that's just about the abstract and the outline and this there is a short video that hopefully you've watched.

66
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:12,110
If you haven't. Please do under under this with me like that.

67
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:22,140
Like read me first. Like there's a short video that kind of talks about the project that that abstract tells me both what your paper is about,

68
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:29,370
but also what it's not about. And so if you've got like a huge topic and you've realized, like, I can't cover that and the amount of papers I have,

69
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,950
you should include something in your a statement in your abstract that says like X, Y and Z are important.

70
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:37,020
They're beyond the scope of this paper. Right.

71
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:41,760
Because that, as a reader tells me that, you know, that that's important, but you're not going to be able to cover that here.

72
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:49,950
Right. So like that it really that that final paragraph in whatever you write that that thesis paragraph, that is the most important paragraph.

73
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,290
It really is.

74
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:57,450
And so I'm going to give you feedback on the most important paragraph of your paper before you actually have to turn it that final paper.

75
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:03,450
Right. So this is sort of don't this is a dress rehearsal, but kind of it's a dress rehearsal for this.

76
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:17,340
Other questions about check point. So Wednesday is we are we have our second visitor.

77
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:22,100
So Patricia Doyle from the Washington chapter of that of NAMI will be with us.

78
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:26,249
So just like we had with Trish Cortez, we will have a conversation.

79
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:31,890
I will post the Google doc after class today for you to write questions if you have for her.

80
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:41,850
So just as a mixture, let's I want to make sure you sort of understood NAMI is a organization that supports the in order to become a member of Naomi.

81
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:48,990
Naomi, you must either yourself self-identify as having a mental illness or be and live in support of someone who has a mental illness.

82
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:58,110
So, Patricia, both is that there is a staffer at the organization but also lives in support of her son who has a serious mental illness.

83
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:01,520
And so she'll tell you about that. But I just want to kind of it's different from Trish, right?

84
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:07,829
So this isn't and this isn't a place that you can kind of go volunteer unless you fall into one of those two, two buckets.

85
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:13,170
Okay. So just kind of I want to make that clear to at the outset because it's it's a

86
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:17,459
it's a broad range of people that are that are involved in this organization,

87
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:21,420
but they are very much and for us by us, like if you're not one of us,

88
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:26,940
we're not really interested in your help type of thing that she can talk about the history of that organization and why it's that way,

89
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:33,650
you know, but we need to like respect their own like self-identify like how they how they identify this.

90
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:37,010
We are. Questions about that.

91
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:42,680
So, again, you're welcome to be here in this room to take that if this is convenient for you to be in this building.

92
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:48,080
You also want to take that call from us. Okay. Questions about this.

93
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:59,330
All right. All right. So today I want to tell you about work I do on depression and type two diabetes

94
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:03,650
and both in terms of the empirical work on trying to understand this relationship,

95
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:11,900
but then also how we've been trying to translate what we do, what we learn in research into the real world, into with a partnership with the YMCA.

96
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:17,600
We'll start with a quote by Huxley.

97
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:24,830
He sort of famously wrote this book called The Doors of Perception, which is about his time on mescaline, I think.

98
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:29,030
And but but that's separating that.

99
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:37,370
He does have like a very thoughtful, I think, comment, which is that part of why this problem persists,

100
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:40,909
despite the fact that we all experience health as a human being,

101
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:44,330
we don't have this experience and then this experience,

102
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:50,510
but it's actually very hard to get training on like how these how mental and physical health are integrated.

103
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:57,739
Everything is sort of pigeonholed. And, and part of what the collaborative care model, which you write about in the readings this week,

104
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:03,559
part of what that does is address this these these sort of problems and different people looking at different

105
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:08,299
parts of the elephant and thinking they're looking at different animals rather than the same animal.

106
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:11,630
So they're working at the same animal by having this team based collaborative care.

107
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:17,780
Right. So so let's let's so I feel like part of this is the way we're trained.

108
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:23,540
And then part of it is rather than the way that the world really is, I guess what I'm trying to say.

109
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:29,450
Okay. So let me tell you about depression and diabetes. So first, I'll tell you what diabetes.

110
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:36,139
So most of what I'm going to talk about today is type two diabetes. So there are two or three there's three three types of diabetes.

111
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:40,070
So there's type one, which is an autoimmune disorder, used to be called juvenile diabetes,

112
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:46,760
but because it tends to onset when people aren't adolescent, but it can it's not just that also type two tender.

113
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:50,629
It used to be called adult onset diabetes, but you can get it when you were a teenager.

114
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:53,630
So now we don't call it that. We have type one, which is an autoimmune disorder.

115
00:10:53,630 --> 00:11:00,020
That is, people don't make insulin because their bodies have destroyed their beta cells in their pancreas,

116
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:05,210
which are the only cells in your body that insulin. So everyone with type one diabetes is what's called insulin dependent.

117
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:11,270
Type two diabetes is 90 to 95% of diabetes in the United States and frankly, the world.

118
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:16,200
So this is still a situation of hypoglycemia, both type one and type two.

119
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,890
You have hypoglycemia, which means you're sure is high sugar,

120
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:23,390
but it's they don't make insulin, but the insulin, they don't they don't make enough insulin.

121
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:28,790
They don't the insulin doesn't work well enough for whatever reason, but it's extraordinarily common.

122
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:34,519
About one in one in ten people in the United States has type two diabetes and over a quarter

123
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:38,600
of people over age 65 like because I'm sure that someone in your life has diabetes.

124
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:44,030
In addition, there's pre-diabetes, which is a basically basically now a third of Americans have pre-diabetes,

125
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:49,040
which is essentially like like and it's ridiculously expensive.

126
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:56,180
And if you just went into the population, if you just went into Ann Arbor and asked people two questions,

127
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:59,420
have you ever had diabetes and have you ever had depression?

128
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,240
I guarantee you this is the graph that you would produce.

129
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:09,499
So you would find that people who have diabetes have about twice the prevalence or about twice as likely to also have

130
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:16,579
elevated symptoms of depression or clinically clinically significant depression compared to people who don't have diabetes.

131
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:21,830
All right. I guarantee you this. You would find this. So why am I why does this graph look this way, do you think?

132
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:31,350
Have involved.

133
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:38,000
This practice comes. So they're not.

134
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:42,250
So they're involved in the health care. So like their depression's diagnosed, you mean?

135
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,670
Kevin McGarry That interaction. Okay. Yeah. So, yeah.

136
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:50,590
So they're like having to show for certain, right? Having type two diabetes that that's an important point, right?

137
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:53,079
Is it requires a lot of self-management.

138
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:59,440
It requires if people with type two also sometimes take insulin or other injectables to control their blood sugar,

139
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,400
they might have to go to the doctor like every corner every three months or so, depending on that.

140
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:07,930
Yeah. So there's like a lot of self management involved in that and yeah.

141
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:18,489
What else might be. Yeah, we like the diagnosis and stuff like we cause we actually think so.

142
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:24,580
So just sort of getting the diagnosis, you know, because diabetes is something that doesn't kill you right away, but it, it still can kill you.

143
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:34,299
Right? So and in fact, people with diabetes often have a lot of impairment, so they can develop microvascular complications where people sort of,

144
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:40,470
they, um, they might lose, they might lose faint feeling in their hands and fingers, etc.

145
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:46,060
So, so it's potentially that, that, but what I'm hearing is like diabetes is depressed, right?

146
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:49,390
Like diabetes. So the idea is that the diabetes came first.

147
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:54,909
Well, there's at least one person who thought that this graph might look this way for another reason.

148
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:59,950
And that person was a guy named Thomas Willis. So he's one of the founders of Modern Physiology.

149
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:04,990
So every one of us has a circulatory structure in our brain called the Circle of Willis, which is named after him.

150
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:15,300
And he wrote in 1679 that he thought that diabetes could be caused by sorry,

151
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:21,189
we said it could be caused by adult men or women drinking too much cider and

152
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:25,329
sometimes periods of sadness and long grief and depressions of the animal spirits.

153
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:29,559
So he's writing at a time that this obviously this is not modern medicine that he's writing,

154
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:39,640
but he was hypothesizing in 1679 that the reason this graph looks the way it does is it may be that different species causes depression,

155
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:44,140
but he is arguing that depression might also cause diabetes like that.

156
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:48,040
That's what he's saying. And this is he's saying this in the 1600s.

157
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:57,340
And so even though we've had this hypothesis that that depression could cause diabetes for a very, very long time,

158
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:02,950
it's only actually been in the last 20 years that we've even been able to test this hypothesis using longitudinal data.

159
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:11,830
And so this is a figure from a meta analysis that I led in 2008, which seems impossible today.

160
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:15,670
But what's important here is that let me orient you to the graph.

161
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:21,609
So the x axis is the odds ratio. The vertical line indicates an odds ratio of one or no effect.

162
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:28,360
That is no difference. Each one of these is a study and every one of these studies is a longitudinal study where

163
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:34,509
you had people at baseline that had some of them had depression and some of them didn't,

164
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:38,920
but none of them had diabetes. All the existing cases of diabetes were excluded.

165
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:47,370
And then you followed people forward. And the question was, did the people who had diabetes at baseline, were they more likely to develop sorry?

166
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:52,600
Did the people have depression at baseline? Were they more likely to develop diabetes in the future?

167
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:56,170
All right. So every one of these studies was trying to ask that question.

168
00:15:57,430 --> 00:16:02,830
Over the course of summing up all these studies, there were almost 7000 incident cases of diabetes identified.

169
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:08,980
And what you found here is that remarkably consistent finding, even though they're not all statistically significant,

170
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:15,639
that that people who have a history of depression are about 60% more likely to develop type

171
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:19,270
two diabetes as they get older compared to people who did not have a history of depression.

172
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:26,170
And this is now but there's been future meta analyzes and this finding has has held up.

173
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:33,780
But it's nice to see how consistently you see how consistent this finding is because sometimes you see meta analyzes and you know,

174
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,020
the numbers are bouncing all over the place. Right. But here it's it's actually remarkably consistent.

175
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:43,390
So you might say like, well, how the [INAUDIBLE] does depression cost? Right.

176
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:48,130
So we we think there's probably a couple of ways.

177
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:54,370
So the first is when people are in a depression, they are not physically active.

178
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:57,850
They are more likely to smoke, they're more likely to eat kind of comfort foods.

179
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:00,100
They're more like, which kind of high fat,

180
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:04,540
high sugar foods they drink a little bit more in their sleep is disturbed or that's like part of depression.

181
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:12,309
Is that having disturbed sleep and all of those things, all of those things are known causes of sleep is a little bit we're not quite sure,

182
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:15,910
but it looks like shift work and some things like this are related to risk of diabetes.

183
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:20,500
But the first four of those things, we we have pretty good evidence cause diabetes.

184
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:27,730
So it could be that what's happening is that when people are in a depression, they're engaging in these poor health behaviors.

185
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:32,200
And those poor health behaviors are a thing driving this later risk of diabetes.

186
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,710
Years later, it's up to us, perhaps of of gotcha.

187
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:42,680
It could also be, though, because depression is not just a psychological condition,

188
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:51,790
but rather depression like every other thing in your body has a biological, and so depression is associated with inflammation.

189
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:56,649
This is indicated by circulating markers of inflammation, kind of nonspecific.

190
00:17:56,650 --> 00:18:03,040
It's not like there's a specific form of inflammation just for depression, but one of the oldest and in addition,

191
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:07,729
one of the oldest findings of related to kind of biological parlance of depression.

192
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:12,730
This is a I guess I should I would say dysregulated cortisol.

193
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:16,510
So we used to call it hyper cortisol ism, but that it was always higher.

194
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:18,700
But now it's not quite sure that it's always higher.

195
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:27,190
But so it's possible that these biological mechanisms so we we know that if you take steroids for a long time,

196
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:31,600
that that that's something that can cause type two diabetes. It can also cause lot of other things.

197
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:39,549
And so steroids are cortisol. And then inflammation is also something that we think is going on with diabetes.

198
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:44,860
So maybe that's what's what's happening here, that there's a that we have a depression,

199
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:50,200
whether through these or health behaviors, mechanisms or these biological changes,

200
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:56,170
that that sort of explains why people in the history of depression are more likely to

201
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:59,170
develop type two diabetes compared to people who don't have a history of depression.

202
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:05,049
But the problem is, and you've learned this in your public health training,

203
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:10,060
is that everything I've just showed you is it you know, these these studies are all.

204
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:13,810
Well, they're longitudinal. They're all just longitudinal. This isn't a trial.

205
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:17,620
This isn't an experiment. I didn't randomize people to get depression or not get depression.

206
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:27,610
And so while it's possible that, you know, the depression is that which is coming first is causing the diabetes,

207
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:31,989
just because something comes first, it doesn't mean it's causing something first, right?

208
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:36,220
Everybody walks before they can run. That doesn't mean that walking causes running type things.

209
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:40,330
So we know we know this.

210
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:47,469
And the question is, what else could explain or actually even be more more conservative?

211
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:54,549
We know this. We know that depression, diabetes are correlated. So but I showed you some data.

212
00:19:54,550 --> 00:20:00,790
It says that because we've talked a little bit about this might cause that diabetes

213
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:05,040
might cause depression through like the diagnosis or the self management,

214
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:15,340
health management. This might be biology or behaviors, but what else could explain why these two things travel together?

215
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:21,610
There could be a third factor that's affecting them.

216
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:29,040
Yeah. So there could be something else that is causing both these things to happen in the same person.

217
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:33,749
And it just so happens that depression is something that happens when you're a teenager in the early

218
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:38,370
twenties and diabetes is just something that happens later and that those both those things are true,

219
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:46,889
right? So depression does typically onset in the twenties and thirties and diabetes especially type two, really only onset in the fifties and sixties.

220
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:53,370
And so it's possible that there's some third variable out there that's driving both of those things.

221
00:20:53,370 --> 00:21:02,970
And if that were the case, what is the implication for what will happen if I treat depression to my later risk of diabetes?

222
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:07,770
So if this is the way the world works, that there's something out here X that's causing both of these,

223
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:11,999
and I say, look, I have a plan for reducing the risk of diabetes in the population.

224
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,460
We're going to give everybody antidepressants in the water. Well, what if this is the way the world works?

225
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:25,570
It's not going to prevent diabetes because nothing should happen.

226
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:40,310
If if this if this is the way. If this is the way the world works, that means that this path doesn't exist and that this path doesn't exist.

227
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:46,549
And what that means is that treating depression should treat depression, which has nothing to do with my later risk of diabetes.

228
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:51,980
Similarly, that managing my diabetes better should have nothing to do with my later risk of depression.

229
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:58,520
So it would be really useful to know whether that's the case, because if the world works like that,

230
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:02,750
then I have a whole different strategy in terms of interventions that if it doesn't work like.

231
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:09,880
So again, we know that depression and diabetes are correlated.

232
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:18,130
We also know that just like every other health condition on the planet, that depression and diabetes each have a genetic component.

233
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,240
So these are type two diabetes in particular is highly heritable.

234
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:25,390
Right. So the heritability of depression is not not that great.

235
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:31,690
We've talked about it's much lower than the heritability of things like schizophrenia and autism.

236
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:36,740
That heritability of type two diabetes is actually quite high, even though it might be environmental factors.

237
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:42,730
And we can talk more about why that is. But the point is that it's possible the world looks like this.

238
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:51,429
Okay. So that and again, what that would mean if is that I can treat depression, but that should do nothing for my diabetes.

239
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:57,040
I can treat diabetes but that you do not suffer from my depression. So how do I know?

240
00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:04,840
How can I determine whether or not the world looks like this? And the way I can determine that is by leveraging a natural experiment which are twins.

241
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:08,470
So I think my guess is before my twins in the room, I must use.

242
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:15,520
Are you identical twins? Yes. If you know, I have a brother.

243
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:19,630
Oh, so, you know. So you also know you're not. So what? Animals are potentially identical.

244
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:23,260
Okay. Statistically, that's unusual. All right. So.

245
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:27,310
But so. So you are both fraternal twins,

246
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:35,620
which means that you are no more similar to your your twin brother and sister relative than any anybody else is to any of their other sister.

247
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:38,920
But have you been identical? That is, you would have been minus.

248
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:44,440
I got it. Because that means that you and your sibling would have shared 100% of their genes identical by descent.

249
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:50,950
This is just mathematically the case. And again, in fraternal or Di's, I got a twin share 50%.

250
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:59,379
We make an assumption that the environments of identical twins and fraternal twins are identical or honor.

251
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:04,240
Psychotic twins or fraternal or guys like other twins are similarly affects them.

252
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,860
Similarly, this is what's called the equal environments assumption in the modeling world.

253
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:16,240
But and so what it means that if I observe that the health, the phenotypic, that all that means is the health correlation.

254
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:24,400
So if I observe that the correlations in depression status or diabetes status are higher for the identical twins compared to the dyes I got in twins,

255
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:33,340
it tells me that this is this is because of genes, because they they grow up in the same house, exposed to the same like early life environment.

256
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:39,350
The thing that makes the thing that they are different is that one set of them as 100% of their genes are identical.

257
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:41,290
On the other side of them, almost 50% of genes.

258
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:47,919
I got I guess you can think about it like a perfectly matched case control design where they're perfectly matched on early

259
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:55,900
life environment and they're 56 and one set of them is 100% matched on genes and the other set is only 50% matched on genes.

260
00:24:56,650 --> 00:25:02,550
This is. I'm not going to. I'll show you. This is the kind of math that's underneath the hood of everything I'm going to show you.

261
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:10,350
But it's sort of it is helpful to kind of just understand is that when people talk about genes and environment,

262
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:19,000
it's on the one hand there's not context, etc. like help us understand, there's not like a firm line in the sand between them.

263
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:25,830
But we can we can make inferences about their role, the relative importance of jeans in environment,

264
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:30,750
just based on sort of like when I have matched on everything else I can make some inferences

265
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:35,340
about do I think this is something that's being driven by genes or driven by the environment?

266
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:44,410
So what we did is we had a large study of twins over age 40 from Sweden because the Scandinavian countries,

267
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:48,670
not only are they the places where we study schizophrenia, but they're also the places where we study twins.

268
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:51,700
Why? Because they have all the data. Remember, they've had their entire lives.

269
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:56,080
All of their health care records are linked to all their other records.

270
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,620
We know of somebody who's a twin, we know where they live, etc.

271
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:03,790
And so we are looking at this large study of twins from Sweden.

272
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:13,180
So we've got 37,000 people, about a quarter of them are identical twins and the others are 75% are fraternal.

273
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:25,840
What's what's important? So about 12% of them had diabetes and 12% had only 5% had diabetes and about 20% had depression.

274
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:31,329
I told you the Swedes had a lot of depression earlier. So this is much lower than it is the United States.

275
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:32,530
That's the first thing to kind of know.

276
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:39,130
This is, you know, at the time the study was done, especially with this population, this population is entirely white.

277
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:42,849
So it's racism even on here. That's also not something to be capture.

278
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:46,240
But if I looked at nationality, it might not really be very different.

279
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:49,899
But what I want to show you here is like this is a correlation. So this is the correlation.

280
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:53,560
Imagine you have a twins, a twin identical twin sibling.

281
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:59,590
So what this is showing you is that your correlation of your identical twin sibling for your diabetes is 8.8.

282
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:06,760
So 8% of the time you have the exact same status as your identical twin for diabetes, for depression, it's only 0.46.

283
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:15,910
This is showing you that the genetic influence on depression is lower, but the genetic influence on diabetes.

284
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:21,040
And then if I compare across here, so I'm showing you, okay, well, this is the correlation.

285
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:27,550
If I share 100% of my genes, this is the correlation. If I only share 50% of my genes, it is almost exactly half.

286
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:33,250
And similarly here, this is the correlation to my depression. If I share 100%, I share 50%.

287
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:40,809
This is a little bit less than half. So what that tells me is that there is a strong genetic influence on diabetes,

288
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:45,400
which I could tell here if I just had this, but this even makes the case even even greater.

289
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,890
And then this also kind of again,

290
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:51,880
helps me understand that like the role of the environment is actually much greater in depression, that is and type two diabetes.

291
00:27:54,190 --> 00:28:00,759
So what we look is we look at both depression, predicting diabetes and diabetes predicting depression.

292
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:04,870
And all of this is accounting for this genetic correlation that I've just told you about.

293
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:10,660
So, again, if it's genetics, then if one side account for genes, in this case,

294
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:17,440
what I'm the way I'm accounting for that is whether your identical twin has depression or diabetes.

295
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:22,900
Once I account for that in this relationship, she could be not. That's the that's the prediction.

296
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:32,550
And what we observe is that when I account for your your genetic risk, there's it's it's close to now, although it's not we we sweep by.

297
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:36,700
Right. But it's more it's less than what it wasn't in the meta analysis.

298
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:45,609
So it was 1.6 and the meta analysis is about 1.3, but it's much more consistent with the idea and sorry, that's depression, predicting diabetes.

299
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:55,659
We also looked at diabetes, predicting depression, which is very similar. So what that means is that we, even after accounting for genetic risk,

300
00:28:55,660 --> 00:29:02,290
depression is still associated with risk of developing diabetes and diabetes is still associated with risk of developing depression.

301
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:11,320
And then the other thing that we can do with this type of model is explore the idea that, well,

302
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:16,900
all the genes that are associated with risk of depression are they associated with risk of diabetes,

303
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,460
and are the environments that are associated with risk of depression are those associated diabetes?

304
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:27,820
And what we learned in the study was that the genes associated with for risk of type

305
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,190
depression are not significantly associated with the risk of developing diabetes.

306
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:38,590
So you can imagine this like what if these are genes that predict like your X or Y control,

307
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:44,340
like some sort of like important hormonal system that kind of is related to diet before and that just depression.

308
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:48,780
And then also as you get older, is it really diabetes? And the answer is that's not the case.

309
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:55,530
That is, if you're twin has depression, that means nothing for your subsequent risk of diabetes.

310
00:29:55,540 --> 00:30:04,430
That's what this means. But the the environments that are associated with risk of depression.

311
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:09,680
In our study there were also weekly so much not as nearly as strongly here,

312
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:13,980
but they were also weakly associated with the likelihood of developing diabetes.

313
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:20,140
So I told you already that we know that health behaviors cause those.

314
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:25,910
But what causes depression? If you have one thing, what's a cause of depression?

315
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:31,000
Major stress.

316
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:39,340
So what this suggests is that so we know that the main thing, one of the main things that causes depression here is major chronic stress.

317
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:44,050
Okay. So and you see that like this, the fact that this is the strong correlation coefficient,

318
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:48,820
significant is positive, is telling us there's something there. And what this much weaker one, though.

319
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,950
So it's weaker than relative to depression.

320
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:58,569
But it suggests that some of the environmental exposures that cause depression are potentially also causing diabetes.

321
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:05,380
And so then if we go back to this model, you say it's not genes.

322
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:14,640
So we had we had jeans before, but it could be that there are some environmental things here and in fact, some of the work I'm doing.

323
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:25,400
So when when Victoria came in, presented to us on stress training because that's the stress and sugar study is directly came out of this idea.

324
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:30,899
When I saw this finding, I'm like, well, how what are the environ, what are the environmental things that cause depression?

325
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:35,760
And the answer is stress. So I said, what I need to know now can stress cause diabetes?

326
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:43,229
And so this is literally the finding that got me thinking about how would I test the question of stress cause type two diabetes.

327
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:46,559
And we wanted to know both like through the biological mechanism.

328
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:54,560
Right. Because this this is. It's not it's not that people don't feel symptoms, although actually sometimes they don't reach that nickname of denial.

329
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:57,750
It becomes because people often don't feel sick when they get diagnosed with diabetes.

330
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:04,500
But the way that you get this is a biological process, but somehow, somehow it's got to get inside of your body.

331
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:08,399
Okay? You don't just wake up one day and you're like, I feel like my sugar's high.

332
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:16,170
Like, that's how it happens. So we knew we had to have biology in it, but we also sort of knew that that biology was being about.

333
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:21,980
So that's that's why we developed. Okay.

334
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:28,879
So so far we learned that even after we account for genetic risk,

335
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:34,100
which again is this sort of potential unmeasured and oftentimes in our studies

336
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:38,660
unmeasured confounder that could be causing both the the exposure and the outcome.

337
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:43,670
We still see a relationship that is consistent with a bi directional relationship.

338
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:47,690
That is, for some people, depression comes first in this and it may cause their diabetes.

339
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:51,050
And for other people, their diabetes comes first. That causes their depression.

340
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:59,630
And while we can't like, you know, I mean, just to be frank, like I can't you can't prove a negative, right is impossible.

341
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:03,170
But our findings suggest it's not really the major thing that's going.

342
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:10,510
And I told you sort of how that informs what we what we went on to do with the structure study.

343
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:20,360
So let me pause here two third questions. Okay.

344
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:26,220
So now I want you to imagine the thought experiment. Let's just say that depression causes diabetes.

345
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,960
I haven't given you, like, definitive proof that depression causes diabetes, but if it does,

346
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:35,960
we should care about it because it's it's very common, as you've learned in this class.

347
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:39,360
So what I'm showing you here are everything in white.

348
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:43,760
These are things that we know are associated with subsequent risk of developing type two diabetes.

349
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:49,450
This is showing you the prevalence of those conditions. This is the associated relative risk, as best as we can tell.

350
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,230
And this is the population attributable risk.

351
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:59,090
That is the estimate of if I could eliminate that thing entirely from the population, what proportion of diabetes cases would be preventable?

352
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:06,530
So if I could just if I could just get rid of smoking, all the kids are gone because it's impossible to smoke.

353
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:12,590
I would eliminate about 77% of the cases of diabetes that are going to happen in the future.

354
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:15,350
Would that happen? That's the argument here. Again, this is a thought experiment.

355
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:18,560
This isn't like we know it's more complicated than that, but that's the idea.

356
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:24,559
And so you can see here that we've got the story of depression because it's so

357
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,800
common and because the associated risk is a little bit higher than smoking,

358
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:33,590
we would eliminate about 9%. That is 9% of people who are going to get diabetes in the future would not get it.

359
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:39,049
If we could figure out how to manage this more appropriately.

360
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:39,260
Right.

361
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:46,940
So then this because you might say like, oh, we need to get everyone an additive presence, although as you've learned to argue, we'll learn more.

362
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:52,370
These are not panacea. All right. But so the argument is, this is, again, why we should take this seriously.

363
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:58,370
If you even if you don't care about depression, if you just care about diabetes, you should care about this relationship.

364
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:05,620
So, again, the suggestion would be like, okay, well, let's either prevent depression or treat depression.

365
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:11,090
And so now we need to talk about like what the majority of people, if they get treated for depression in the United States,

366
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:15,360
which the majority of them don't, but if they did get treated, most of them got to present.

367
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:21,060
So and this is showing you how common antidepressant medication use is.

368
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:28,090
So the state is about a decade old now, but it's still reasonable that this breakdown is going to happen this way.

369
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:35,050
About 10% of all people over age 12 have taken an antidepressant in the past year.

370
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:40,510
And the you can see this increases as people get older.

371
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:45,010
Right. So the older you are, the more likely you are to be taking antidepressants in the United States.

372
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:52,480
Sure. And the concern here is that there was a very large trial.

373
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:56,140
This was a trial that had nothing to do with depression.

374
00:35:56,260 --> 00:36:02,530
It was a trial of called the Diabetes Prevention Trial, and it was a large trial of the three arms.

375
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,850
The first was nothing.

376
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:13,810
The second was a medication called metformin, which is a very cheaply I mean, I think it costs like $4 for like it's like three months supply.

377
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:22,510
An extraordinarily cheap off patent medication that we actually found in this trial definitely prevents diabetes.

378
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:27,310
And the third was this massive lifestyle intervention arm, which may be maybe, you know,

379
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:31,749
your parents may have been asked to participate in this called the Diabetes Prevention Program,

380
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:37,430
which is this year long, you know, physical activity, diet, education type of thing.

381
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:45,220
Right. And so what it showed what what what this don't look at this is what this trial showed.

382
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:50,530
In fact, it was just trials that was stopped early because it was so obvious that the drug arm

383
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:54,819
and the lifestyle modification arm were that were more effective than the placebo.

384
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:58,780
So it actually became unethical to continue the trial because we knew that we

385
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:02,170
could not deny the people in the placebo arm either of these interventions.

386
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:09,170
So so it's a trial to try to prevent diabetes, but it happened to measure procedures.

387
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:17,620
And what this paper found was that people who had been taking antidepressants for sort of multiple,

388
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:21,220
multiple years, that they were in the study, which is the green bar.

389
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:25,660
If they happened to be randomized to the lifestyle arm or the placebo arm,

390
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:32,860
they were more likely to develop diabetes later than if they had not been taking those medications.

391
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:38,740
And so this got us and you can see there was for some reason, there was no effect on the metformin arm.

392
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:43,680
But you can see how this would be really concerning, right?

393
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:50,590
Because like 10% of Americans, 11% of Americans are taking these drugs.

394
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:56,860
Okay. So if these drugs are somehow causing type two diabetes later, we're in trouble.

395
00:37:57,550 --> 00:38:02,620
Okay. So we're nervous.

396
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:10,430
But I will say, like I and this is why we did the study, that ignorance is bliss study, which I think you read this week.

397
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:20,220
Yes. So this is so this paper got me thinking like, gosh, I don't know, like there's not really a mechanism for why antidepressants requires diabetes.

398
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:25,860
It's a little it's it also they also didn't really control for the depression.

399
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:29,640
Right. And so if depression causes diabetes, right.

400
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:40,450
So if that's if this pathway this pathway is true, then there's also, you know, you draw it over here.

401
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:44,140
So the other way you can think about the way because people don't just get antidepressants, right?

402
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:52,660
You don't just like get one. You have to have something specifically that you have to have a clinical indication so the world could work the way.

403
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:58,660
But what that paper suggests is that depression causes people to take pills and then they get their diabetes.

404
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,209
Right. That's what they're suggesting with that.

405
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:11,400
RUBIN But it could also be the case that depression causes people to take pills and that those pills are correlated with diabetes.

406
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:22,720
Right. So it's not a causal relationship here, but it's correlational because diabetes is a condition that for the most part is asymptomatic.

407
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:31,210
And so until it's kind of real severe as people literally don't know, like, how do you know there's somebody that I know asking you to walk?

408
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:38,540
Right. And so what if you don't just pick up an address and over the counter you got to talk to a doctor about it.

409
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:49,970
You got to get evaluated for this. And so what that means is that getting your pills and getting your diagnosis require you to talk to a doctor.

410
00:39:52,360 --> 00:40:00,340
But having depression, having it, having elevated depressive symptoms, you get to have it all on your own.

411
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:06,620
Remember, we did the patient health questionnaire. We did the CSB goes in to ask, how does a doctor told you about your mother?

412
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:12,010
Not you can just have your depressive symptoms all by yourself without a doctor knowing about them.

413
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:17,380
But you cannot get an antidepressant without talking to a doctor, and you can't get a diagnosis without talking to a doctor.

414
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:20,710
And so it's possible that there's some third. This is now the third.

415
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:27,970
Sorry. I know this is like 12 dimensional chess. This is what makes your research amazing is that you can see these actually felt like I

416
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:32,740
really spend this is how I spend my life is I just rhyme things on my points all day.

417
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:36,880
I'm like, I wonder if it could be that way and how would I? How could I find out if it's that way?

418
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:42,400
So let me tell you how I found out that antidepressants don't cause diabetes. Okay?

419
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:50,700
So I guess so. Even though antidepressant use is really common, we still know that most people,

420
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:54,030
about half of people who have depression don't get anything for their drug.

421
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:57,750
Okay. So that means it's under detected and it's undertreated.

422
00:40:57,750 --> 00:41:01,660
And the people who do get fair treatment for their depression are much more severe.

423
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,980
They have we know they have higher socioeconomic status. They have greater access to health care.

424
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:10,930
We also know that pre-diabetes in particular, almost no one who has pre-diabetes knows it.

425
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:18,430
It's not like the screening efforts have been dismal. But even type two diabetes, especially at the time we did the study, was still under 2 seconds.

426
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,889
So we can have two competing hypotheses.

427
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:29,500
The first is what Rubin says, which is that antidepressants increase the risk of diabetes, which is that first idea that depression causes this med.

428
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:38,720
You can get this med and that med. Posits that this is the first hypothesis.

429
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:48,620
The second hypothesis is that dogs who are good at finding depression and giving you a pill for it are also good at finding your diabetes.

430
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:59,780
Okay. All right. So that's this this idea that that doctor sees your depression, gives you the pill, and that doctor also seizure, diabetes.

431
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:07,430
Okay. So that in that this path doesn't exist, but I can get a correlation between this and this.

432
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:13,670
Running through a doctor, identifying my diet, my depression, and giving me an appropriate.

433
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:24,040
And so the way to test this is that well is and a depressive medication use associated with both clinically identified and undiagnosed diabetes.

434
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:33,230
Because if antidepressants cause diabetes if the way the world works is that.

435
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:40,910
Antidepressants, all sides. What would be the mechanism?

436
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:45,020
It has to be proven. By what? Like it's not what?

437
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:47,900
Like this is a biological agent people are ingesting.

438
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:55,390
It has to be a biological mechanism, which means that if this is the way the world works set, this should be the world works.

439
00:42:55,400 --> 00:43:05,300
Whether or not I have clinically identified or undiagnosed diabetes, that is whether or not my I know that I have diabetes.

440
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:11,860
Okay. It should have happened through biology. So and because I can know if you have diabetes, I don't even have to ask you.

441
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:16,130
You just look at your blood and I can tell if you got diabetes. So this is what we do.

442
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:22,580
So here's here's what we're looking at is now we've developed this thought experiment where I'm.

443
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:29,690
What I want to know is I want to know what is the prevalence of depression and

444
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:35,780
antidepressant groups comparing people who don't have diabetes of any type,

445
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:40,470
who have pre-diabetes and don't know what that is.

446
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:42,830
So they their blood tells me they have pre-diabetes.

447
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:48,620
But when I ask them as a doctor, ever told you that pre-diabetes, they say no, or diabetes they say nothing.

448
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:52,600
These are people who have diabetes and don't know it.

449
00:43:52,610 --> 00:44:00,350
So again, their blood level is at a point where it's high enough to be diabetes, but they say no doctors ever told me I've got diabetes.

450
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:07,040
And then these are people who have pre-diabetes and they know it. So they're clinically identified pre-diabetes.

451
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:13,190
So their blood tells me they have pre-diabetes and they know it. And these are people with clinically identified diabetes.

452
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:21,740
So what you can see is that first the blue bars is that the prevalence of depression is indeed higher among people,

453
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:27,760
especially people who have diabetes, whether it's clinically identified diabetes or undiagnosed diabetes.

454
00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:32,350
Okay. So about that's that's these 2 hours. What?

455
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:37,650
The use of antidepressants. Who has the highest use of antidepressants?

456
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:43,950
It's only the clinically identified pre-diabetes and the clinically identified diabetes.

457
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:48,240
That is, if it were the case that antidepressants cause diabetes.

458
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:55,710
These two bars, there's clinically undiagnosed pre-diabetes, undiagnosed prediabetes and undiagnosed IBS.

459
00:44:56,010 --> 00:44:58,030
These two yellow bars should be the same height of space.

460
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:05,760
That's the prediction, because if those antidepressants are causing your blood sugar to rise through some unknown mechanism,

461
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:12,120
it should cause the high blood sugar to be high regardless of whether or not I've been diagnosed with that condition.

462
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:21,450
And this is exactly what we see, that it's having undiagnosed prediabetes or or a diabetes unrelated.

463
00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:25,020
That odds ratio is actually even protective, but it doesn't include one,

464
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:31,080
which means there's no relationship between undiagnosed diabetes status and a.

465
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:38,070
There's only a relationship between 24 identified diabetes status and added depressant use.

466
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:47,279
Again, this is completely consistent with the with the clinical ascertainment idea that the weight the reason these

467
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:52,980
things are traveling together is because a doctor gave you that prescription and a doctor found your diabetes.

468
00:45:58,510 --> 00:46:08,709
So how do we explain what Reuben found? So it's possible that the diabetes prevention program was a very large trial, but it was a very intense trial.

469
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:13,540
And so maybe people were like more likely to kind of talk about their depression over the trial.

470
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:21,610
Maybe it's cause, although I don't think this is true, that antidepressant use risk increases, you know, sort of diabetes risk in certain individuals.

471
00:46:21,850 --> 00:46:28,420
I actually found out later that if you had a history of major depression, you weren't even eligible to be in the trial.

472
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:35,200
So I'm like, which I was like kind of shocked that they that but I went back and actually read the inclusion exclusion criteria for the trial.

473
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:37,840
I don't know how strict they were about that,

474
00:46:38,050 --> 00:46:45,250
but what it means is that the people who are taking antidepressants in this trial were not taking antidepressants for their depression.

475
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:49,870
They were taking antidepressants for something else because depression, if they had depression, they couldn't get in the trial.

476
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:55,330
So they were taking it for pain or like smoking cessation or sleeping problems.

477
00:46:55,330 --> 00:46:59,110
These are other indications that docs can like prescribe in a depression for off label.

478
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:05,690
Okay. So questions about that.

479
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:14,300
So I'm going to close and tell you about. Okay.

480
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:22,710
So what does this mean for outside of the outside of the office?

481
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:30,129
So the you know, in addition to, you know, so the Huxley quote unquote,

482
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:33,790
at the beginning, you know, talked about how we learn about these things separately.

483
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:37,900
Not only do we learn about mental and physical separately, but they're treated in different places.

484
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:42,729
Right? So you see a mental health professional for your mental health, you see a endocrinologist for your diabetes,

485
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:46,930
etc., even though like we all, you know, there's a one human being who's experiencing all these things.

486
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:54,550
And so what we've been working with for the last almost ten years now is a with the YMCA,

487
00:47:54,670 --> 00:47:56,950
where I started this when I was living in Richmond, Virginia.

488
00:47:56,950 --> 00:48:07,899
So we started with the YMCA in Richmond and many YMCA is and although not all, offer some sort of like health management sort of programs.

489
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:12,250
And the one that they offer is the diabetes management program, which is 12 weeks long.

490
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:19,540
It's led by health coaches. It costs like $400 a person to enroll, although the YMCA, because they have a mission of being open to all,

491
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:25,180
are basically subsidized to the tune of people only have to be like $15 to get in this class which is

492
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:30,430
incredible given like so they actually like hemorrhage money out of this class every time they do it.

493
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:33,970
That's why you need to pay for your YMCA, because that's how they that's how they can do it.

494
00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:40,450
So we had a community advisory board just so this is you can see me here in the middle of this is William Thornton.

495
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:47,709
He's branch chief at the time. This is he's like someone she's my project coordinator for the Richmond and Sugar Study.

496
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:48,700
This is Josh Montgomery.

497
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:57,309
I literally had breakfast with him on Friday because I was in Baltimore and he's finishing up his degree in being a physician assistant.

498
00:48:57,310 --> 00:49:00,440
And the other members here are members of our community advisory boards.

499
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:06,909
So we wanted to again, the Y owns this program.

500
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:11,440
So this isn't something I brought to them. They own this program already. They've developed this program on their own.

501
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:17,680
And what our partnership was about, they wanted help in evaluating their program,

502
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:25,240
both in terms of like who it serves and also does it work okay, because they actually don't have resources on hand to be able to do that.

503
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:32,590
This is a community engaged project that we had. We had people in the program fill out.

504
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:37,029
We developed these new surveys for them. They fill out these surveys at the beginning of the program and after the program.

505
00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:41,019
So it's just a pre post sort of evaluation. It's not a it's not an experiment.

506
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:46,450
We didn't randomize people, but we did start assessing questions on stress, depression,

507
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:51,550
health behaviors and social support as part of this, which they weren't assessing before, before we started working together.

508
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:55,080
The only things they were looking at were, does your agency go down?

509
00:49:55,090 --> 00:50:01,900
Does your weight go down? Right. And sort of potentially missing these other impacts they were having on people's mental health.

510
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:08,139
We also did a lot of qualitative work, although I'm not gonna be able to talk about that today, but I if you're interested, I can talk about that.

511
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:13,660
But I feel like this kind of mix methods approach is really important when working with community members is a map of Richmond,

512
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:18,970
Virginia, and it's showing you sort of where people who were served by this program lived.

513
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:22,560
So the areas that are redder are more low socioeconomic status.

514
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:28,360
So you can see the sort of parts that the YMCA indeed does serve in lower US population,

515
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:31,390
although not exclusively, and their definition is their own to.

516
00:50:33,370 --> 00:50:39,400
We had about 200 people who did our proposed survey, the majority there.

517
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:42,879
Most everyone here has type two diabetes, which means they're older, age 54.

518
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:46,330
You can see that most of them have lower socioeconomic status.

519
00:50:46,330 --> 00:50:50,520
Most of them are African-American, and most people had their diabetes for eight years.

520
00:50:50,530 --> 00:50:55,630
I was a little surprised by this. I kind of thought that people might get a referral and as soon as they get their diagnosis.

521
00:50:56,050 --> 00:50:57,400
But when you actually talk to people,

522
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:03,430
they tell you that it's like they're actually not ready to kind of make changes with their health behaviors until they've kind of most

523
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:07,870
people actually get into this program because their doctor wants to start for them on insulin and they don't want to take insulin.

524
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:13,839
So it's it really does kind of show that the need for both understanding,

525
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:20,040
like what is somebody willing to do to manage are able and willing to do to manage their health and like how to actually have those conversations.

526
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:27,669
So here and most people have had it for quite some time. So what I'm showing you is just a few graphs of the impact of this program.

527
00:51:27,670 --> 00:51:31,209
So this is before I see this is when I was just starting the program.

528
00:51:31,210 --> 00:51:35,350
So again, they're not randomized to be in the program. They elected to be there.

529
00:51:35,770 --> 00:51:40,120
But the first question is like if pre post, did it make a difference?

530
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:43,450
And so they're the first thing is they're checking their sugar more often, which is good.

531
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:45,219
That's an effective tool of self-management.

532
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:49,840
If you can check your sugar, then you could change your behaviors accordingly or take more medication accordingly.

533
00:51:50,890 --> 00:51:56,340
A1 C Which is a measure of average blood glucose over the past like 30 to 90 days to decline.

534
00:51:56,390 --> 00:52:01,000
This is great. This is like the main effect of any diabetes self-management intervention is like

535
00:52:01,070 --> 00:52:04,420
you should be doing more self management and your blood sugar should be coming down.

536
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:13,540
So those things happen. So again, this program, what this program is about is simply helping people self-manage their diabetes.

537
00:52:13,550 --> 00:52:17,530
But there's two elements I want you to understand. One, it is group based.

538
00:52:17,530 --> 00:52:23,350
So people are not individually in the room. They're with a group of other people who also have type two diabetes.

539
00:52:23,710 --> 00:52:34,660
And second, it's led by a lay person who's been taught on sort of like how to facilitate conversation and facilitate communication in the group.

540
00:52:35,230 --> 00:52:40,810
And so even though this intervention or this program does not address depression.

541
00:52:41,730 --> 00:52:45,060
This program does not. It is not there. It is not group therapy.

542
00:52:45,270 --> 00:52:50,920
It is not trying to address depression. What we saw was a significant decline in depressive symptoms.

543
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:55,110
Tell each one of these lines as a group. So the YMCA.

544
00:52:55,230 --> 00:52:58,620
Each one of these. Each one of these represents the average group.

545
00:52:58,930 --> 00:53:06,389
So this red group had no change, for example. Okay. So it's showing you the heterogeneity and what they interested in is like, okay, well,

546
00:53:06,390 --> 00:53:10,230
are there some coaches or are there some groups where, like, you saw this really big effect?

547
00:53:10,290 --> 00:53:13,940
Some groups are like this one. We had a little bit of an increase in depression.

548
00:53:13,950 --> 00:53:21,850
Right. But it kind of shows the idea that like it's you know, while the collaborative care model is incredible because it provides that,

549
00:53:21,870 --> 00:53:24,990
you know, it's got a psychiatrist, it's got a family medicine doctor, it's got a nurse.

550
00:53:25,290 --> 00:53:32,189
And all together they're working together. What these types of findings show, I think, is that you actually don't need a huge team.

551
00:53:32,190 --> 00:53:37,620
You just sort of need to be thinking about the whole person in your intervention and you can get positive effects.

552
00:53:39,210 --> 00:53:44,880
We also have this is consistent with our commitment to community engage research.

553
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:48,810
We worked with the YMCA to create these beautiful fact sheets about describing our

554
00:53:48,810 --> 00:53:53,400
research results in addition to these things being published in peer review journals.

555
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:58,919
And we've been looking at people who finish the program and bring them back to help support this.

556
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:04,530
We are literally in the field to try to start this trial of an alumni peer support program.

557
00:54:05,130 --> 00:54:10,600
In March 2020, we had to pull the plug on everything and so like, I'll never know if we should sell that.

558
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:17,519
I don't really like developed this specifically to try to try to see if we can actually build this.

559
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:24,300
And in the last couple of things I'll say are just about the fact that like diabetes,

560
00:54:24,510 --> 00:54:32,729
researchers understand generally that depression and certain what they call psychosocial factors matter for diabetes.

561
00:54:32,730 --> 00:54:35,300
And in fact, a few years ago they had this physician statement.

562
00:54:35,310 --> 00:54:40,740
It's kind of a big deal to have a big organization like the ACA produce physician statements.

563
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:47,520
And so this thing talked about stress and it talked about food insecurity and it talked about social determinants of health,

564
00:54:47,610 --> 00:54:56,310
etc. But what it didn't do in that language is it didn't even once have the word disparity or inequality anywhere in that.

565
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:02,310
They're talking about food insecurity and not talking about race and they're talking about,

566
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:06,900
you know, stress and they're not talking about socioeconomic status.

567
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:15,600
And so the idea so the and don't in France power who's a there's a lot of work he's a psychologist who does a lot

568
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:20,940
of work on this in Denmark depression diabetes in Denmark wrote this letter to the editor basically saying like,

569
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:26,519
look, you know, you can't talk about psychosocial factors without positioning that within the

570
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:29,970
other like the positioning that within who people are and where they live.

571
00:55:30,750 --> 00:55:35,070
Because otherwise it basically was like a color blind statement, which really doesn't help anybody.

572
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:41,459
And in fact, probably it's going to make things worse. So, you know, we we kind of called them out on this.

573
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:46,170
And I'm very happy to say, because I don't have a slide on this, but like 2020.

574
00:55:46,650 --> 00:55:54,150
Felicia Hill Briggs, who you can see here, is one of the authors of this paper in 2020 releases not a position statement,

575
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:58,200
but a scientific summary of social determinants of health,

576
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:04,260
and basically says like, yes, we have to like focus on how social care, like basically everything we're doing, we have to shift gears.

577
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:11,280
And it's also not about screening for like food insecurity, it's about fixing food deserts, etc.

578
00:56:11,290 --> 00:56:20,340
So again, it's amazing how quickly this field of diabetes has, kind of how we've got amazing because it's probably been obvious from the beginning.

579
00:56:20,670 --> 00:56:25,320
But I have all to feel. I feel I feel like relative to the field of psychiatry,

580
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:30,719
diabetes is like on board with social determinants and on board with like understanding those things,

581
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:38,610
how they relate to care versus like talk to a psychiatrist. They're still there, still trying to figure out, okay, so this is my last slide.

582
00:56:38,610 --> 00:56:48,500
I always and every talk I give on this topic with this slide because it's so, so important that the idea that it's not just about, you know.

583
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:56,950
It's not like when when we just talk about depression or just talk about schizophrenia or just talk about autism was almost

584
00:56:56,950 --> 00:57:03,400
certainly underestimating the impact of those conditions on our broader population health and on the health of the person.

585
00:57:03,730 --> 00:57:09,380
Because these conditions, these are these fundamental interactions and there is no health without them.

586
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:15,370
Okay. So that is my last slide. We have 5 minutes for questions, if you have any.

587
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:31,610
No, you're not. All right, well, I'll stay for.

588
00:57:32,090 --> 00:57:37,850
I'll stay. I got once this class is on Zoom, so you're welcome to come here, but you don't need to come here.

589
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:43,340
On Wednesday, if you need an extension on that. I need to know today about that.

590
00:57:43,630 --> 00:57:46,910
Okay. Thank you, everybody. I'm pretty sure it was.
