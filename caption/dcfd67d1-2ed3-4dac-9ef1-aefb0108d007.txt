1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:15,190
On the eye of the storm. The one thing I just want to tell you, I'm just really tired and I was lucky enough to actually be in the city.

2
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:23,390
But I think we'll go ahead and get started. But first of all, thank you for you came on Monday for Kendrick's talk.

3
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,430
I think he's always such a really exciting speaker.

4
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:35,280
He's got a lot of really great policy experience to share about what he's been through, what he's been doing.

5
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:45,840
And I think he's. I like him because, of course, he has earned praise for, you know, the value of various services inside a lot of interesting ideas.

6
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,540
The general feedback I've been hearing is that you might as well be here.

7
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:55,739
So I'm happy that I was not here on Monday.

8
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:59,879
I was at the conference called the Society for Medical Decision Making Annual Conference.

9
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:04,800
That's in one of the major professional organizations that does things around the cost of veterans houses, other ones,

10
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:13,410
if you're interested in this kind of thing of our for they used to be called the International Society for Pharmaceutical Outcomes Research.

11
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:20,250
But before and then internationally too, there's this one called International Health Economics Association here,

12
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,950
and they'll certainly do a lot of cost of this kind of stuff as well.

13
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:33,059
But God, the former friend was able to to talk to you guys today.

14
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:41,310
I want to talk about policy impact and how cost effectiveness analysis might actually be used in the real world.

15
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:48,929
That's kind of what you're what you're you're all I'm here for is you want to go into the real world and make some change.

16
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:54,330
And so I'll talk about how this is or maybe is not used in the real world.

17
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:58,740
And we'll talk first of all, time high cost interventions.

18
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:08,910
Edu helme ab zolgensma on a sandwich in the gene of exile.

19
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:18,720
And then Soraya and as we talk a little about some of these before, but I wanted to just review them a little bit about, you know,

20
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:27,210
transplantations of them and controversies surrounding these medications and how cost effectiveness fits into all of this as well.

21
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:35,819
So the first is, and you can imagine and we'll talk about out of Alzheimer's disease in general trial results,

22
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,559
FDA approvals and that kind of an impact.

23
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:43,889
So you've seen some of those earlier and you already kind of know what Alzheimer's disease is, skip through this year.

24
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:52,500
But I think the key thing, though, in this whole thing is that Alzheimer's disease is really bad and there aren't many treatments out there for it.

25
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:56,820
And the ones that are there are not effective.

26
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:00,360
And it's been decades really since. So we've had amazing.

27
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:07,049
And also another key thing that I think is important when you're thinking about these types of interventions,

28
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:12,930
are they designed this trial to look at some of the things in this trial.

29
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:18,030
They really focused on looking at reductions in these beta amyloid plaques, which, you know,

30
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:22,020
there's there are a lot of think that that's an important contributor to Alzheimer's disease.

31
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:27,180
But I will say it's really controversial whether that really is the cause of this.

32
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:33,300
And they also looked at clinical dementia rating scales and I think, you know, in my opinion.

33
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:39,140
It's really important for these trials to look at outcomes and outcomes and really do care about.

34
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:45,210
It's nice to see that amyloid plaques are changing, but if grandma's dementia is not getting better.

35
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:50,629
We're not slowing down, then who cares about these beta amyloid plaques?

36
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:55,610
Really? What you really care about are, you know, is that is the dementia outcomes in the end.

37
00:03:55,910 --> 00:04:04,590
And actually we've seen that and sometimes we don't really know what the causes of these these places like Alzheimer's disease.

38
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,210
And actually, just recently, when we see of news of depression, you know,

39
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,570
we're not sure, you know, precisely what's going on in people's brains with depression.

40
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:19,219
And and, you know, maybe we can't look at certain biomarkers and say, aha,

41
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:25,490
this drug will help depression if it changes certain biomarkers, because we're really not sure what the precise biomarkers are.

42
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:32,989
I was just hearing something about someone talking about anesthesia and actually

43
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:37,010
doctors don't really know how the anesthesia drugs kind of knock you out.

44
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:41,270
They know they work, but they're not precisely sure what's going on in there.

45
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:48,110
And so, you know, we if we don't have a really strong understanding of the kind of biological mechanisms, it's nice to look for bad amyloid plaque.

46
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:51,750
But in the end, we really what we really care about, again, is dementia.

47
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:58,260
And the critical thing in this trial here is the the dementia scale outcomes really didn't change much.

48
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:04,910
In fact, trials were terminated for three parts of the way through.

49
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:10,930
And then, you know, one of the concerns here is that perhaps, you know,

50
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:14,980
they were kind of slicing and dicing the data in certain ways to get the outcomes they wanted.

51
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:17,300
So if we look at the clinical results here,

52
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:28,760
there are the two trials engaged emerge and only in one of the kind of cases here in Emerge and in the high dose group,

53
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:35,660
did they actually see a reduction in that clinical dementia rating scale on lower numbers on that?

54
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,290
So this is better technically, it is statistically significant,

55
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:46,940
but that's also another important thing to think about is not just is it statistically significant, but is that clinically significant?

56
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:53,300
And, you know, I'm not a psychologist and not a psychiatrist, not a neurobiologist or anything like that.

57
00:05:53,510 --> 00:06:01,310
My understanding is that it's a reduction of 0.39 is not a super huge meaningful difference as well.

58
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:14,010
And then, of course, they they did another kind of post-hoc analysis after they did a protocol change and did find did find a reduction again -2.51.

59
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:18,140
Not a huge change, but it is statistically significant. It's winning.

60
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:22,549
The one concern from kind of academics and out there in the world is, you know,

61
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:26,840
they're kind of cherry picking the numbers from different studies or different

62
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:31,549
scenarios here that post the protocol change to get the kind of results they want.

63
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:39,110
And it's not a not a very big result as well. You know, this is a postdoc now is without their kind of original intended analysis,

64
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:43,280
you know, presumably they could run in a trial or something like that and and look for that.

65
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:47,690
But that is what they found. You know, they're kind of doing this post hoc analysis.

66
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:54,020
Well, and again, not a very big effect size. Another concern, of course, is adverse events.

67
00:06:54,500 --> 00:07:00,460
These drugs do have some serious adverse events, as well as brain swelling and bleeding.

68
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:11,770
When the FDA advisory committee voted, Tanner said no to the question is it reasonable to consider engage?

69
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,130
Is the primary evidence of in fact this matter have contributed to Alzheimer's disease?

70
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,890
20 But then in June 2021, the FDA approved it through an accelerated growth.

71
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:32,360
Now the FDA does not have to follow the advisory committee recommendations, and then most of the time they do, but in this case, they didn't.

72
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:40,100
And again, I think it's because there was such a concern that there really have been no medications for Alzheimer's in decades.

73
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:45,799
They decided to increase. One reason we're talking about another reason to talk about this class is cost.

74
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:52,070
Of course, it's really expensive over a year, and that's not the only cost.

75
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:59,270
Of course, there are some additional diagnostics. You know, people would have Medicare patients would have co-pays of over $10,000 a year.

76
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:06,080
And the Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that the budget impact would be close to

77
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,280
$30 billion a year because there are a lot of Medicare patients with Alzheimer's.

78
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:20,360
So one of the organizations that you probably hear about and that maybe already have is the Institute for Political and Economic Review,

79
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:30,830
an acronym, ICER. They do a lot of cost effectiveness analysis and they I guess they're kind of nonprofit,

80
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:36,230
independent organization, but they do receive a lot of funding from payers.

81
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:45,170
And so they do these analysis to try to get information payers to private payers in the U.S. And so they did an analysis here.

82
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:54,830
I'll let you guys tell me. So what are their what's their finding here from their this analysis is a bit small to to see here on the slide so.

83
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:18,290
They say, Hey, CVS, cross, pay for this.

84
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:34,060
Don't pay for it. They have to reduce provide 85 to 95, discard a third of discard to make this drug cost effective.

85
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:43,630
Yeah. So the initial price of $26,000, they say, hey, actually, if you want this to be cost effective, it needs to be in this kind of range of price.

86
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:50,560
So that's about 90% discount from the lowest price if you're if you want to consider to be cost effective.

87
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,950
By the way, keep in mind also that's there that's the list price.

88
00:09:53,950 --> 00:10:00,730
It's like the sticker price on a used car. These companies insurance companies are can negotiate with the.

89
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:08,350
With the drug manufacturer. But, you know, clearly this would be a, you know, a very, very steep discount.

90
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:15,879
Now in the in Issa's analysis, you mentioned I mentioned earlier here, you know,

91
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:22,330
this this data isn't super compelling, but, you know, assuming that you do get a reduction of,

92
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:31,180
you know, 0.5 in the form of question rating scale and weighing into the effect these side effects,

93
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:35,260
you know, they they decided, hey, yes, there is a net health benefit.

94
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:40,389
There's no health benefit. Then you couldn't. And even if it was free, you wouldn't want to take it.

95
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:50,770
Right. But they're saying, look, there might be some health benefit here, but it's only worth, let's say, 3000, $5,000 for you.

96
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:59,740
For that level of benefits. Any questions?

97
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:11,290
So yeah lots of concerns. And there's been you know, and I would argue that, you know, next question is,

98
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:16,660
does anyone listen to these people talk about cost effectiveness or even just kind of general effectiveness?

99
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:19,420
Well, there has been a lot of news media coverage on this.

100
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:27,640
In the first quarter that it was really launched, there was only about 300000 hours of revenue.

101
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:32,320
And Medicare is kind of considered limiting coverage to clinical trial participants.

102
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:39,010
And so it really has not been very successful for the company as well.

103
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:44,889
And that's that's also something to think about here, is that, you know, this is you know,

104
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:49,990
the payers are going to be reluctant to pay for something if it's too expensive.

105
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:56,320
And and in the end, that's just going to hurt the drug company, too, is they're going to they think they're going to launch this great drug.

106
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:00,790
I think the Wall Street expectations were that they were going to sell, you know,

107
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:04,690
billion dollars worth of drugs in the first year or something like that.

108
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:10,890
And they only sold $3,000 in the first quarter. So, you know, massively below what their expectations are.

109
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:20,020
I think the the CEO of the drug company stepped down because of of lack of sales and so forth and that sort of things.

110
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:27,700
So, you know, if you if you want to go work for a drug company, great, they do wonderful things.

111
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,990
But, you know, be careful about releasing products that are not very cost effective.

112
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:41,440
It's not going to help the market. So, gentlemen, I think we briefly talk about this as well.

113
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:46,160
This is a gene therapy that combats spinal muscular atrophy.

114
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:52,580
So if people have normal muscle atrophy, atrophies the muscle, it's of the neurons.

115
00:12:53,210 --> 00:13:02,000
And there are some proteins that are not. It's a genetic disorder where certain proteins are not created in the nerve cells.

116
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:08,810
And one of the treatments is called spinraza.

117
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:12,830
They inject the kids with the right proteins.

118
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:14,450
That helps their neurons.

119
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:24,620
So, gentlemen, it's just novel and interesting in that they introduce this adeno vector which introduces the correct gene into the nerve cells.

120
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:31,430
And then so the nerve cells themselves will produce the proper proteins, which in some ways may be similar to the RNA vaccines.

121
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:35,110
I think probably it's probably a thousand different reasons.

122
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:40,460
But, you know, the general idea here is that, you know, they use the cellular mechanisms to create the right proteins.

123
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:51,300
And, you know, presumably those genes stay in the nerve cells for the rest of your life and producing the proper proteins that would reduce efficacy.

124
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:55,580
And with that said, you know, this therapy is only 5 to 10 years old.

125
00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:07,680
And so we don't really know, of course, the long term effects. But so it's very expensive, but it's compared to a very expensive alternative here.

126
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:16,010
So the Nusinersen or Spinraza, the other monthly injection or other injection here is $125,000 per injection.

127
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:21,710
So about $2 million. But Spinraza is also very expensive.

128
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:26,569
Yes. What are these companies like, legally liable if the drug comes out?

129
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:30,750
And it's actually super damaging to human health because they're the ones providing it

130
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:36,350
to us that makes them liable or the actual drug company themselves or is no one liable?

131
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:40,040
I don't really know how the liability thing works. I was curious. So that's a good question.

132
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,160
And I'm not a drug legal expert either.

133
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:53,360
I will say. So I know for vaccines, certain vaccines, there is some legal liability that's provided to them.

134
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:01,229
And that was designed particularly because there were concerns that there could

135
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:04,320
be a lot of legal liability for certain vaccines which are given to many, many people.

136
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:07,830
So the US government basically kind of took on that liability.

137
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:16,770
And so you'll hear there's a vaccine injury fund that the US government has for vaccines and these are not vaccines.

138
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:22,380
And I guess, you know, drug companies are liable for for their their products.

139
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:28,760
You know, you will hear about lawsuits against drug companies if they if they have some some

140
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,700
bad side effects that are that are discovered after the trials and so forth,

141
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:42,510
I think. I'm blanking on the the pain medications for like ten years ago that they got in a lot of trouble for.

142
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:47,670
So drug companies certainly can be can be sued for, you know, providing bad drugs.

143
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:54,090
And I you know, maybe one way to think about this is, hey, maybe 2002 sorry, $2 million is a good price.

144
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:59,010
So the drug company has a big, big money.

145
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:06,540
I keep a stack of cash in their bank account to pay in case something crazy happens in ten years.

146
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:11,130
That's bad. And then they come back with pay off lawsuits like that. You know, I suppose you can make that argument.

147
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:23,459
But anyway, so Xeljanz about $2 million in price, but it's a one time cost and it's compared to this other drug here,

148
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:30,690
Nusinersen or Spinraza, which is $700,000 in the first year, $335,000 annually thereafter.

149
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:38,250
So cheaper in the first year. But of course, it does take many years of spinraza to ever nusinersen to be more expensive and zolgensma.

150
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:49,440
By the way, just an exercise for you guys. So spinal muscular atrophy is is quite severe.

151
00:16:50,550 --> 00:17:00,720
And but people can live with that, although their device deteriorate, deteriorates rapidly, and typically they don't have very long length of life.

152
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:08,100
But if we're if we're following the kind of norms of cost effectiveness analysis

153
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:16,470
and let's say we're willing to spend $100,000 per quality adjusted life year,

154
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:22,350
would nusinersen or spinraza be considered cost effective?

155
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:37,540
Compared to known news. Let's, let's, let's, let's think about the world before it pre zolgensma when you only had spinraza as your treatment option.

156
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:46,330
How might Spinraza be considered cost effective, or is there no way it would be considered cost?

157
00:17:54,320 --> 00:18:03,620
So cost $125 each projection. You get six in the first year and then three of them each year thereafter for the rest of your life.

158
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:18,890
Why? No. Oh, because you said the the minimum that they're willing to spend $400 is beyond them.

159
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:23,030
Well, I would say 100,000 might be the maximum we're willing to spend.

160
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:27,830
And hey, look, you couldn't even say 150, $200,000 per party, just the life here.

161
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:37,790
So just the way cost effectiveness dialysis works here is if you're paying $375,000 every year to have someone alive.

162
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:44,710
The best you could do was prevent them from being dead and give them perfect health.

163
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:50,750
Although this people are not dead without this, or while not not guaranteed to be dead without this drug.

164
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:58,490
And they don't get perfect health with this drug. So the best I mean, the best you could get per year of life is one quality.

165
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:08,030
But we're paying $375,000 every year. So just kind of by definition, there is no way this drug could be considered cost effective,

166
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:17,300
adding willingness to pay threshold of $100,000 or even 200,000 or 250,000 or 300,000 or $350,000 per following.

167
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:26,620
So just keep that in mind when we're thinking about cost effectiveness analysis, know this, this would not be considered cost effective.

168
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:30,819
Now, with that said, there are other things we care about more than just cost effectiveness.

169
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:33,390
And I think, you know, people do make, you know,

170
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:42,190
arguments that we should we should pay for things like spin spinraza or reduced niacin because it is a very vulnerable population.

171
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:46,390
After all, there are alternatives. So there are some other arguments you can make.

172
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:52,840
But with that said, from a cost effectiveness perspective, you know, this drug would not be considered cost effective.

173
00:19:53,080 --> 00:20:00,640
Let's go back here to two zolgensma. In what ways might Zolgensma be better than Spinraza?

174
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:08,090
Or worse than sprinkles. What kind of pros and cons?

175
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:15,480
Zolgensma versus nusinersen here. Spinraza. I think that's a lifetime.

176
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:22,380
Cause this is. Yeah, this is life. I mean, people are alive, and so they have, you know, to break their leg, you know, they're going to happen.

177
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:25,760
But this is pretty close to the lifetime cost. Yeah.

178
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:30,510
Is $2 million. You're not paying that again every year after year after year.

179
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:37,050
And so the initial cost is higher, but the lifetime cost is lower if you live more than a few years.

180
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:49,979
Right. So $700,000 to here, 25,000. So, you know, after three years, I think, or four years, nusinersen will be more expensive than Zolgensma.

181
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:56,280
And this is these are these are interventions given to very, very young kids, you know, maybe two years old or something like that.

182
00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:06,270
And so hopefully they're going to live past the age of six. And so zolgensma actually would be cheaper than Nusinersen.

183
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:14,130
In terms of the medication cost. So but then much less consider zolgensma versus nothing.

184
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,780
Could you make an argument that Zolgensma would be cost effective?

185
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:20,880
There's no way. So that's going to be cost effective.

186
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:32,020
It's probably argued that as a result of Zolgensma that some patients will have at least 20 years.

187
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:37,540
Yeah. So if a patient lives, we're kind of ignoring discounting and things like that.

188
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:42,609
But yeah, if the patient goes to 20 years and we're willing to spend 100000 hours or really do,

189
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:44,950
they're thinking of 20 more years than they otherwise would.

190
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:52,930
Now, I will say without any treatment for spinal muscular atrophy, you know, children do probably die before they get to the age of ten.

191
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:59,590
And hopefully with this therapy, the kids would get to be 50 or 60 or 70 or something like that.

192
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:05,110
And so you can I think you could make a really compelling argument that you gain more than 20 qualities,

193
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:09,520
even a discount in quality over the lifetime of giving someone zolgensma.

194
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,200
So I think you can you know,

195
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:17,770
there is it is possible to make an argument that suggests what might be cost effective or would be cost effective compared to,

196
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:22,029
you know, no therapy at all. And so that's something to think about.

197
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:27,130
Here is some a few things here. One is even something that looks really, really expensive.

198
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:34,930
$2 million treatment actually could be cost effective because, you know, children with spinal muscular atrophy,

199
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:39,430
you know, you know, most of them might not live to be ten years old, let's say.

200
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:48,970
And here you might be giving them a normal lifespan. And so that that's an incredibly valuable outcome in terms of healthcare, of course.

201
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:55,580
So even though something's really expensive, it might be highly cost effective if it gives you a lot of quality adjusted life years,

202
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:03,489
which this, you know, potentially is promising to do. Also consider waiting.

203
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:08,740
You're preparing to, of course, the health outcomes if you don't don't do this, are quite severe.

204
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:12,390
And then in this case, the the alternative medication is very, very expensive.

205
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:22,990
And we talk. Well, actually, one thing we haven't really talked about in this class is how many of you have heard of CAR-T therapy?

206
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:29,610
Could you? Well, maybe I'll ask you guys.

207
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:34,400
So, what is car t therapy? What is it supposed to do?

208
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:42,150
First stop to your age.

209
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:50,700
Now you see the word cancer in here. It's a cancer treatment.

210
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:55,770
Yeah. So, I mean, is it commonly referred to as just t cell therapy rather than CAR-T?

211
00:23:56,430 --> 00:24:05,310
Yeah, I think maybe. Yeah. So, like, is in t cell idea of like, changing your cells to reprograming your cells.

212
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:15,790
Especially in a situation of cancer. But reprograming. So I think yeah, I think the idea here is that you're going to get the body,

213
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:19,639
you're going to try to get the body's own immune system to to fight the cancers that you might have heard of.

214
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:23,770
It is kind of immune, I think. I mean, you guys can correct me if I'm wrong here.

215
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:32,440
I'm not necessarily you're not online colleges either. So, yeah, the idea here is that but it's quite intense here.

216
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:34,300
Again, removing the T cells of the patients,

217
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:43,990
genetically modifying them to kind of attack cancer cells and then they re infuse them into the patient's body.

218
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:47,920
So this isn't just oh, I just give you one little injection. You're done.

219
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:54,900
This is, you know, again, removing t cells genetically modified in them and then re infusing them into the patient.

220
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:02,559
It's again a quite intense thing now because you're kind of doing a major reset of the immune system.

221
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:11,469
All of you can have cytokine storm, which is your body kind of attacking itself, an era of being really aggressive, also very expensive here,

222
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:16,270
half a million dollars because this is kind of customized to each patient and their

223
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:20,800
cancers to they're they're kind of modifying them to respond to sort of target.

224
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:24,700
So this is this is this is individualized therapy for each patient, too.

225
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:32,620
It's not just just kind of pull this off the shelf and infuse it, but it's quite, quite an involved process.

226
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:40,180
And actually, you know, for sometimes sometimes we you only say sorry if you are concerned that you're a drug profit.

227
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:42,040
That's a drug company. Profits are too high.

228
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:48,310
They can produce these pills for, you know, $0.10 a pill and sell them for a thousand or something like that, I would argue.

229
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:54,820
And that might be true, but I would argue in this case here, you know, this is you know, they're creating a customized therapy for each patient.

230
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,310
And so this isn't just $0.10 a pill kind of thing.

231
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:04,180
But but yeah, it's very expensive here, but of course, has the potential to improve health and avoid expensive chemotherapy.

232
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:10,120
So here are some results of cost effectiveness analysis here.

233
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:13,869
And let me zoom in here. So again, very, very expensive.

234
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:20,379
So half million dollars, I will say oftentimes for for cancer medications, for many,

235
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:26,560
many cancer medications, you know, the initial prognosis is not very good.

236
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:35,170
And and so often and even with therapy, it's not that great as well.

237
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:39,370
So here's just a few and results of a trial here.

238
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:43,750
What that might look like. Hopefully you're often there with kind of survival curves.

239
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:51,910
We have a graph here. Survival is on y axis months on the.

240
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:59,240
X-axis here. And so here, I guess we have we have two lines here.

241
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:03,410
And I guess the thing to keep in mind is this is kind of one year, two years,

242
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:09,020
everyone starts out alive, 100% alive, and then we've got two lines kind of coming down.

243
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:16,520
The bottom line here is kind of standard care. And then the top line here is the car t therapy setting.

244
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:21,900
You know, unfortunately, these are two kind of single arm studies that are not from the same area.

245
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:25,220
There are two different trials. Ideally, you'd have the same trial, what you had had.

246
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:30,230
But still, this is what they're estimating and simulating here.

247
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:35,900
So the first thing is, I guess for you is, is there a survival benefit with this car t therapy?

248
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:43,890
So it seems sort of heads nodding yes. Yeah.

249
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:47,420
This isn't something we have to put the microscope through the magnifying glass to see the difference here.

250
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:49,920
We can clearly see a difference between these two lines. Right.

251
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:57,750
And, you know, fortunately, the cartoon line is the one on top, meaning, you know, better survival here.

252
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:05,430
So. It's better here.

253
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:15,690
And they in a cost effective analysis, they've got this this nice graph here you guys have seen we finally had the sensitivity analysis.

254
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:22,140
Class. So what is this graph telling us?

255
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:43,140
The probability. An intervention would be cost effective, giving a certain willingness to pay.

256
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:52,940
So it's just a function based on that $100,000 party is very likely to be cost effective and safe.

257
00:28:55,910 --> 00:29:00,660
Yeah. And so this is the the result of a probabilistic sensitivity analysis.

258
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:07,459
As you recall, that's when the researchers simulate basically uncertainty and all the different parameters,

259
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:14,630
drawing different parameter values from different distributions. And this gives you the probability that the intervention will be cost effective.

260
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:19,610
That's the Y axis here and for various willingness to pay levels.

261
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:27,559
Now, if you're only willing to pay $50,000 for quality adjusted life year and maybe there's only a less than 10% chance that CAR-T therapy,

262
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:34,040
which is the data by the CAR-T therapy, would be the preferred solution that you'd that you'd better be cost effective.

263
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:38,870
However, if you're willing to spend $100,000 for quality, which I guess I would argue for in the US,

264
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:43,660
is probably a more reasonable threshold, or even maybe 150,000.

265
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:48,769
Oftentimes for cancer, we are willing to spend a lot of money per quality just to buy your game here.

266
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:53,570
When you look at our willingness to pay $100,000 here, it's.

267
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:59,060
You know, over 90% likely to be cost effective up here.

268
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:07,570
So the way I kind of read these here again is I look at the willingness to pay for quality.

269
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:11,320
Take what you think is reasonable and let's say we think that's $100,000.

270
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:16,390
We go up this line here and then we find the grass and we see a hot car.

271
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:22,750
Therapy is you're 95% likely to be considered cost effective if you're willing to spend that much money for.

272
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,530
So again, even though something looks really, really expensive. Half a million dollars.

273
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:35,610
That's very expensive. And and actually, there is there certainly is benefit here,

274
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:40,820
although people are not living for decades at least at least that you as we can see at this trial here.

275
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:47,880
But there is some sort of benefit at the end of two years. I think in this in this analysis, they they assumed that that benefit would would remain.

276
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:51,930
And I think this is for childhood cancer.

277
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:56,580
So if you can survive that, you might actually get a lot of benefit from this.

278
00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:02,450
Of course, it's a provocative word once it becomes. Yes.

279
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:09,900
And so if you're willing to spend even more $150,000 per family, then it's 99% likely to be cost effective.

280
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:15,690
Exactly. So and the other thing you look at here is at zero.

281
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:19,350
So let's say, hey, I'm not willing to spend anything for a property really miserly.

282
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:23,490
I'm not willing to spend anything for equality, but I still care about money.

283
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:29,970
And so at this point, it's just you're just asking the question, does this save money?

284
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:34,470
And this answer, the answer is no. There's a 0% chance it will save money.

285
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:42,030
But that's also interesting to look at, is where this intersects at zero is the probability that you actually save money with this intervention.

286
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:56,610
Other questions. Okay.

287
00:31:56,910 --> 00:32:02,010
And then PCSK9 inhibitors, we've talked about those in one of our previous classes.

288
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:10,020
We talked about, you know, the kind of Blue Cross example here. I just want to recap there was that we did think there was a net benefit of PCSK9

289
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:23,130
inhibitors and then also to use some of the more kind of personal questions here.

290
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:30,090
So as we talk about the PCSK9 inhibitors, just recall they were you know, they're pretty expensive.

291
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:40,980
The the cost to the physician at a Hooters is about $15,000 per year.

292
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:50,880
These researchers say, hey, look, maybe they should be 3000, 4000, $5,000 for a year in order to be considered cost effective.

293
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:59,130
And so so they do have some sort of health benefit in terms of reducing cholesterol and reducing bad cardiac outcomes.

294
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:06,240
They don't care for themselves. You'd probably want to give these inhibitor if you want them to be cost effective,

295
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:11,940
probably should give that to people with a high risk, maybe a high benefit of getting PCSK9 inhibitors.

296
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,020
And the price probably needs to drop substantially for them to be considered cost effective.

297
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:22,770
I mean, I guess I would argue organizations like Blue Cross should look at this.

298
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:30,930
And and it is it turns out the the companies selling using PCSK9 inhibitors did drop their prices up.

299
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:37,589
But there are you know, these are kind of general kind of health policy questions about,

300
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:40,760
you know, what should a large, impersonal kind of organization?

301
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:46,620
Medicare, Medicaid, Blue Cross, you know, what should they what should they do?

302
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:53,100
How should they put these in various tiers in their formularies and and have prior authorization and things like that?

303
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:58,060
But, you know, there are I think it's good to ask yourself the question here is,

304
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:01,200
is, you know, what will you want for your parents or your grandparents?

305
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:06,120
And when would you if you had, you know, familiar high cholesterol?

306
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:10,500
I mean, would you pay $50,000 out of pocket for these medications?

307
00:34:11,970 --> 00:34:18,360
And I think that's it. If there's a disconnect there between what we think the policy answer is and what you would want to do,

308
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:24,659
then I think we need to ask ourselves questions, you know, are the are the you know, the mechanisms that we're using to evaluate these policies.

309
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:32,490
Are they are they appropriate and reasonable? Or is there something else that we're missing in our policy analysis approaches?

310
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:48,390
It's important. And then I think we briefly talk about this here, too, that Institute for Global Economic Review, they evaluated the PCSK9 inhibitors.

311
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:56,010
They said, hey, these things need to be a lot cheaper. And and the VA used that to negotiate better prices.

312
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:03,690
If you talk to your earlier two parallel, MAB is the one that was negotiated a better price.

313
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:07,800
Evolocumab was not negotiated to have better prices for the VA.

314
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:12,840
And this is the VA VA number of prescriptions.

315
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:22,530
And the VA definitely encouraged people to use the cheaper drug here, which is kind of standard economics,

316
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:29,310
and that if you offer something for lower price, presumably you'll get higher market share.

317
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:34,140
And that's certainly happened kind of within the VA system.

318
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:42,030
So again, I think, you know, not every organization the U.S. uses cost effective dialysis.

319
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:44,340
The VA is one, especially for the pharmaceuticals.

320
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:53,009
And and it definitely has had an impact in this in this case here in driving volume to the lower cost drug.

321
00:35:53,010 --> 00:36:00,130
And again, the price that was set was kind of based on cost effectiveness, what they thought the fair price of that truck.

322
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:06,430
Any questions or other comments about the PCSK9 inhibitors?

323
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:19,189
So maybe what I'd like to do is spend the rest of our class.

324
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:25,640
You're kind of talking about some just general discussion about cost effective dialysis, how it's used.

325
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:31,010
I'm happy to answer any questions about how it's used and and and how it should be used.

326
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:37,040
And we get we have some examples here of how it's used, and I'm happy to go through it.

327
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:44,180
Maybe I'll go through these first. But I do want to kind of get your perspectives maybe before we get into that.

328
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:51,170
Yeah, maybe I'll just walk through this and see if you have questions about how you cost sales.

329
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:52,850
This is used internationally in the US,

330
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:59,149
but then I'd like to hear you're going to be kind of thinking about how do you think cost Pakistan should be it should be used.

331
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:05,240
I mean, you guys are the ones who are going to be going out into the world in in a year or so and,

332
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:11,510
you know, change the world the next year for your careers. Now, I'm telling you how these methods work.

333
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:16,489
I think they're useful. I don't think they're the only thing that you want to consider in policy making.

334
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:20,389
But I'm happy to learn otherwise.

335
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:27,230
And you? Find better ways to do this or not to hear your thoughts on this.

336
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:30,170
But first of all, maybe I'll talk about, you know,

337
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:38,490
Costa Ricans also from around the world and the W.H.O. is is a proponent of the use of cost effective analysis.

338
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:50,030
They have the WTO choice. System or initiative, and they're using that to kind of advocate for the use of cost effectiveness analysis.

339
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:53,300
I've kind of personally seen that firsthand.

340
00:37:53,540 --> 00:38:00,470
I've worked with people, so they're very interested in cost effective analysis and these kind of areas where I have expertize in hepatitis B policy.

341
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:02,480
They're definitely interested in that.

342
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:11,329
They had a as part of workshop that they held, they brought in 100 people from the Southeast Asian region to use cost effectiveness,

343
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:16,640
analyzes to help them advocate for hepatitis B treatment, hepatitis C treatment in their home countries.

344
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:26,750
And so the WTO, I think, views cost as a as a way to advocate for for spending or focus on certain health priorities.

345
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:35,659
So, you know, if you if you think if you're working in the Ministry of Health just like that and you want to advocate for more funding for A,

346
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:42,590
B or C, I think it's helpful to, you know, do the cost effective policies or find cost effective evidence in the literature

347
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:47,210
to use that to advocate for for better spending and prioritizing certain things.

348
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:52,040
The United Kingdom National Institute for Clinical Excellence,

349
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:58,650
probably the premier organization in the world that they run, I should say the organization,

350
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:03,889
the world is most explicit and has kind of the most formalized process for evaluating cost

351
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:08,110
effectiveness and using that in their decision making for the National Health Service.

352
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:11,060
As you know, the U.K. has their national health service.

353
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:18,830
It's what a lot of people, maybe some of you think is is a good model for universal health care.

354
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:23,550
But when you have something like that, they have to decide, are we going to pay for this or not pay for that?

355
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:30,860
Certain things. And again, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence, or Nice, is the organization that does that evaluation.

356
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:37,129
They call it technology assessment. And sometimes it's people within that organization.

357
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:40,730
But oftentimes they kind of farmed out that analysis to academic institutions.

358
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:48,320
But anyway. And they also get the manufacturers to produce a cost effective analysis that they give them.

359
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:53,800
And they kind of go back and forth. They do their own analysis, review what the manufacturers submitted and then, you know,

360
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:57,680
kind of create their own estimate of what they think the cost effectiveness of this drug is.

361
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:03,680
And if it is less than £20,000 per poorly, grade two thumbs up, they'd happily pay for it.

362
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:07,610
If it's more than £30,000 for quality, they say No, that's too expensive.

363
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:13,969
Generally, they do have a few other things that they that they care about and look at besides cost effectiveness.

364
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:20,600
But cost effectiveness is very important. Part of their decision making process about whether to pay for something or not.

365
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:24,290
Any any questions about that process or comments?

366
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:39,040
And then just there are some other countries that that are these are this is next in complete an exhaustive list.

367
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:44,470
But, you know, Germany has private health insurance companies,

368
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:49,329
but they have this organization which would quality and efficiency in health

369
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:52,630
care that does use cost effective policies to kind of make recommendations.

370
00:40:53,350 --> 00:41:00,130
Australia focuses on this for pharmaceuticals. Now this Pharmaceutical Benefit Advisory Committee, Medical Services Advisory Committee.

371
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:05,530
And they like to pay they would like to pay less than $50 Australian dollars per point.

372
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:14,910
That's kind of their their threshold. Canada has Canada's third Canadian agency for drugs and technology health.

373
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:22,659
They also look at cost effectiveness. And I don't think they make binding recommendations, but they certainly are interested in cost effectiveness.

374
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:27,040
And as you know, Canada has kind of universal health care as well.

375
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:28,330
Province by province.

376
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:37,660
So each province runs it differently and separately, but is giving them some cost effective information to help make their decisions on things.

377
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:42,580
Norway also has this Norwegian Medicines Agency that does cost effective analysis.

378
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:48,610
They I think they have a higher threshold, closer to 100,000 or maybe a little more per point that they're going to spend.

379
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:53,110
Norway's a relatively wealthy country, so that maybe tracks.

380
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:57,310
Any questions about. Yeah.

381
00:41:57,490 --> 00:42:07,580
Professor, if there's any possibilities for like in the UK for manufacturers to argue they have the capability to produce a very low cost.

382
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:17,080
But they set the higher drug price, but the price is still within the cost effectiveness threshold.

383
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:23,260
Is there any possibility for them to argue that the price is reasonable and to maintain the high price?

384
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:26,250
Yeah. So the drug companies. Yeah, so it's a good question.

385
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:31,569
So the drug companies, you know, they'll manufacture their you create a new product and of course they have to show safety and efficacy,

386
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:33,640
kind of like we do with the FDA here in the US.

387
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:39,579
So they don't, you know, create their drug, make sure, you know, have the clinical trials that show that it's,

388
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:44,110
um, that it's effective and doesn't have really bad side effects.

389
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:51,070
Yeah, I'm not sure with Brexit how this all works, but the European Medicines Agency or EMA will have kind of approved drugs.

390
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:55,180
EMA does not look at costs as far as I as far as I know.

391
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:59,709
But anyway, the manufacturer then, you know, says, hey, we've got a drug that works,

392
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:04,330
it doesn't kill you or hurt you and actually improves the health condition we're talking about here.

393
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:07,360
But then they in order for the NHS to pay for it,

394
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:14,679
they have to submit that cost effectiveness analysis and the cost effectiveness analysis is based on whatever they set the price to be.

395
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:23,050
And so that's that's a choice the manufacturers have is what do they set their price to be when they submit their cost effectiveness analysis.

396
00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:30,610
Now, they don't have to tell anyone what the true cost is to manufacture those pills or injections or whatever is so they can set the price,

397
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:35,980
whatever they want to be. And so typically when they're doing their when they're setting their price,

398
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:41,290
they're also, you know, interested in understanding how cost effective will be.

399
00:43:41,530 --> 00:43:43,390
And so they don't want to price there.

400
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:50,230
They don't want to price their product so that it's going to be, you know, £2 per poly because then they price their product too low.

401
00:43:50,890 --> 00:43:59,100
And so they're going to want to try to price their product so that it's £90,999 for quality so that they get the,

402
00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:01,960
you know, the highest price they can while still being cost effective.

403
00:44:02,350 --> 00:44:12,130
Now, with that said, when they submit their proposal, their their cost analysis to Nice, it isn't always $19,999 per poly.

404
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:20,830
They typically set it simply to be something lower than that, even because invariably the UK,

405
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:24,670
when they look at their analysis, they'll say, I disagree with this assumption or the way you did this and this.

406
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:36,520
And so they're going to they're going to say, yes, you said your drug was £15,000 per poly, but we think it's actually 25,000 sorry, pounds per poly.

407
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:43,060
And so they want to they want to price it such that it's likely to get kind of approved,

408
00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:48,939
but yet still has a high enough price that they get a good price. And so, again,

409
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:56,350
they don't have to they don't have to justify their price in terms of the cost that it takes to make their pills or injections or whatever.

410
00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:01,180
They just have to justify it based on the value that it provides to the population.

411
00:45:01,510 --> 00:45:04,990
And when I say value to progress population, that's, you know, the qualities that are gained.

412
00:45:05,230 --> 00:45:13,810
The cost effectiveness ratio, basically in the way you can think about it is for every every quality it gives the UK population,

413
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:28,009
they can charge up to £20,000 for that. But they might price a little bit lower in the UK scheme and that if they want to reduce the risk of that,

414
00:45:28,010 --> 00:45:34,220
they would it would not be improved, although there can be, there can be a kind of back and forth too.

415
00:45:34,430 --> 00:45:43,249
They can submit the the cost effective policies to nice and nice can say we disagree so we're not going to approve it.

416
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:46,730
And then they can come back and say, Oh, wait, did we say the price of this? It's actually this.

417
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:51,770
And actually, times they'll have and actually the what's submitted by the manufacturer is not public.

418
00:45:52,400 --> 00:46:01,040
It's only seen by nice. And so the actually, you know, the prices are kind of hidden from the international community.

419
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:07,159
So these are kind of negotiated prices with nice about what that what the price of that drop will be.

420
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:12,710
It's it's confidential. So, you know, the rest of us don't know what the UK pays for their difference.

421
00:46:15,170 --> 00:46:20,899
So the UK presumably can be getting good prices and not make the Germans and the Americans or the French and whatever else.

422
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:27,610
Johnson The depressed sticker, although it's unclear exactly how good the prices are because knorr-bremse it could be worse than.

423
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:37,870
Other questions or comments. Yeah, I just I did it in this class that we really talk about perspectives, analysis,

424
00:46:38,050 --> 00:46:41,140
always kind of in relation to like medical and pharmaceutical interventions.

425
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:47,620
So I guess I'm just curious if it's also used as often and like at the scale of

426
00:46:47,830 --> 00:46:53,230
creating these institutions to like evaluate social policy and social interventions.

427
00:46:54,070 --> 00:46:57,219
So that's a great question. Yeah. And, and historically,

428
00:46:57,220 --> 00:47:03,730
a lot of cost of sales has really has been focused on very medical interventions and in particular pharmaceutical interventions.

429
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:12,820
But I think the theory is that this really should be applied to a broader set of health interventions and that if you you know,

430
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:16,060
if we're going to say we're willing to spend $50,000 on a drug,

431
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:23,830
we should also be use that threshold for thinking about spending certainly $50,000 probably on a device for a medical

432
00:47:23,830 --> 00:47:27,730
procedure or surgery that where we have to have surgery and spend too much time in an operating room and so forth,

433
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:31,120
because those are so dollars that we're investing in health and we want to get the maximum health,

434
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:34,600
but also for public health type interventions like vaccination campaigns.

435
00:47:35,530 --> 00:47:37,450
But also, we can think about for other things, too.

436
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:43,940
You know, should we go the park in this community where we are going to encourage people to, you know,

437
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:49,660
get outside and exercise and breathe clean air or whatever it is, improve their mental health.

438
00:47:50,350 --> 00:47:57,610
You know, you could look at it that way as well. I will say, you know, and part of this is just kind of maybe historical accident,

439
00:47:57,610 --> 00:48:04,510
almost like environmental health interventions could be evaluated in terms of cost effectiveness, in terms of cost per policy.

440
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:17,260
Typically, I guess historically they've been evaluated, evaluated in a kind of kind of net net benefit framework in terms of,

441
00:48:17,950 --> 00:48:24,490
you know, putting a dollar value kind of in a cost benefit analysis, putting a dollar value on health outcomes.

442
00:48:24,850 --> 00:48:30,130
So say, oh, if this if this stream is at its current level, pollution, ten people will die.

443
00:48:30,370 --> 00:48:33,370
And it's like $10 million per death.

444
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:37,630
That is $100 million problem of ten people dying with this level of pollution.

445
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:43,420
And if and we're going to if we clean up the pollution, only five people die from this dirty river.

446
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:47,470
And so that's $50 Million problem.

447
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:53,860
And so the difference between that is between $50 million with the clean water and $100 million with the dirty water.

448
00:48:54,340 --> 00:49:00,910
It's a $50 million benefit. So we should be willing to spend up to $50 million to clean up the water to that level.

449
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:07,600
So that's typically how, I guess historically EPA has evaluated the environmental impact.

450
00:49:07,610 --> 00:49:10,149
So when they're saying, you know, once the you know,

451
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:17,049
when when Congress says we should clean up these dirty coal plants that are putting toxins in the air, the EPA, EPA.

452
00:49:17,050 --> 00:49:23,710
Well, we'll do a cost benefit analysis to say here's the cost of air pollution and here's the cost of cleaner air.

453
00:49:23,830 --> 00:49:28,450
And is it worth spending that money on these scrubbers on coal power plant stacks or whatever it is?

454
00:49:29,590 --> 00:49:34,360
So typically they've looked at things in terms of a cost benefit analysis of the Department of Transportation,

455
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:38,980
whether they think about highway safety. They're also thinking about that in a cost benefit framework.

456
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:43,780
Should we should we put an overpass instead of a traffic light?

457
00:49:44,050 --> 00:49:50,250
Because that will reduce accidents and fatal accidents typically don't do that also in a cost benefit framework, saying, okay,

458
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:57,700
you know, on average, you know, two people die every ten years in this intersection and zero people die in China in this intersection.

459
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:01,990
If we put an overpass, you know, they'll do that in terms of a net benefit framework.

460
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:13,000
And so anyway, I think those are the two. Well, I guess and the final framework is one where there's been $0 or zero benefit put on health.

461
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,180
And just a pure cost analysis saying, you know, what's that?

462
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:23,530
What's the cost of this net? I would argue that's not a good way to do it is is to value the health at zero or not, but look at the value of health.

463
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:28,570
But I think the two most common ways of kind of these economic policies will be a pure

464
00:50:28,570 --> 00:50:32,230
kind of cost benefit analysis where we put a dollar value on all those health outcomes.

465
00:50:32,590 --> 00:50:37,870
And again, historically in like transportation, environmental, health, those have been that's been a more common way of doing things.

466
00:50:38,230 --> 00:50:41,830
And then for medical interventions, it's been cost effectiveness analysis.

467
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:50,950
And I think more and more kind of public health interventions have been have been seen in a cost effectiveness lens, you know,

468
00:50:50,950 --> 00:50:57,970
other kind of social policy things like improving education, oftentimes the health benefits of that are completely ignored.

469
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:05,500
I mean, just saying, oh, so we we just some sort of a social policy thing where we give kids better graduation rates in elementary school,

470
00:51:06,250 --> 00:51:10,239
they look at benefits in terms of maybe lifetime earnings and things like that.

471
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:13,780
But typically the health benefits are often ignored in those analyzes.

472
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:19,720
So that's something where maybe there are opportunities to to some in one way or another

473
00:51:21,130 --> 00:51:27,490
value the health outcomes either in a cost benefit framework or net or in cost benefit,

474
00:51:27,490 --> 00:51:31,920
frankly. Does that answer your question? I think you. Yeah.

475
00:51:33,270 --> 00:51:39,570
With regard to the idea that people might have a higher willingness to pay for qualities for themselves or for their family members,

476
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:45,929
do you know if there's any if there's been any proposals about potentially

477
00:51:45,930 --> 00:51:50,850
the pay to pay up to the the willingness to pay that the payroll system has,

478
00:51:50,850 --> 00:51:56,190
and then allowing the individuals to sort of top up on top of that if there's an extra amount.

479
00:51:57,540 --> 00:52:00,780
So. Well, in some ways, that's kind of what happens in the UK.

480
00:52:01,230 --> 00:52:08,940
So in the UK, National Health Service will pay up to, you know, basically 20 or £30,000 for performing for the health you get.

481
00:52:09,330 --> 00:52:18,510
But not everyone but many people in the UK purchase private health insurance on top of that so they can get access to better care or,

482
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:25,739
you know, some more expensive drugs. They might pay for surgeries at different centers so they can get their near place

483
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:31,800
in surgery within three months instead of three years or whatever it might be. So in some ways that's kind of what's happening in the UK.

484
00:52:32,610 --> 00:52:38,820
But yeah, I think, I mean I think that that isn't a bad idea is to have something where you kind of have a, if you will, kind of a safety net.

485
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:47,420
And so you say, okay, the, the government, whatever will pay for up to maybe $50,000 for quality interventions.

486
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:53,610
And if you want something better, actually, one of the problems is it isn't kind of topping up it.

487
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:57,780
You're kind of starting from zero, I think. So let's say.

488
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:07,799
Let's say they're there, then there's a standard intervention that costs $10,000 and there's and made me think about this here.

489
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:13,820
So let's say we have something. Well, let's say. Yeah.

490
00:53:13,850 --> 00:53:17,930
Let's say we have intervention. A $50,000 and you get.

491
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:28,150
One quality. And a hypothetical medical insurance system is is going to pay $50 or so to pay for intervention.

492
00:53:28,810 --> 00:53:34,090
Now, instead of an intervention, hey, maybe you can get your insured be where it costs $60,000.

493
00:53:37,870 --> 00:53:47,140
Let's say it costs $100,000 and you get.

494
00:53:51,030 --> 00:53:56,060
One point. Well, yeah, 1.5 points.

495
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:02,350
Okay. And let's say these are mutually exclusive, you know, only eight or be.

496
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:11,150
You can't get a combination of A and B, so. And then there were I guess intervention acts here is $0 but you didn't insert so as your points.

497
00:54:16,070 --> 00:54:19,820
Okay. So the aid is $50 dollars per poly, right?

498
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:26,840
If you choose B instead of A, you're paying an extra $50,000, which are only getting half of quality.

499
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:31,970
So this is basically, if you want to be, you have to be willing to spend $100,000, four point.

500
00:54:33,490 --> 00:54:37,030
Okay. So let's, let's, let's think about this hypothetical.

501
00:54:37,810 --> 00:54:43,840
Let's say Medicare. Let's say Medicare now pays for everything. For everyone, for up to $30 points on Medicare will pay for it,

502
00:54:44,410 --> 00:54:49,420
but won't pay for me because this is 100 choosing B instead of paying $100,000 per party.

503
00:54:51,550 --> 00:54:56,870
Now, if you wanted to pay out of pocket. You would pay.

504
00:54:57,740 --> 00:55:01,820
So you would pay $100,000. But you did.

505
00:55:02,870 --> 00:55:07,070
So you could if you could stick with the Medicare plan and get your one quality.

506
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:13,069
And basically it would be free to you because Medicare was paying that $50,000 or

507
00:55:13,070 --> 00:55:17,150
you could pull $100,000 out of your own pocket and get one and a half bodies.

508
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:22,610
So now to you, you're paying $100,000.

509
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:26,150
For half equality.

510
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:35,149
So for you now, it looks like $200,000 per quarter is what you're paying because Medicare is not you're not paying an extra $50,000.

511
00:55:35,150 --> 00:55:41,630
You're paying the full, you know, $100,000. So that's kind of one wrinkle in it.

512
00:55:41,810 --> 00:55:47,030
You know, I suppose you could you could design a system where Medicare says, I'm only going to pay $50,000 of this.

513
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:54,030
You pay the additional 50,000, and then you would be you'd be paying at a rate of 100,000 a year.

514
00:55:54,230 --> 00:55:58,309
But the mechanism for this would be it would be tricky because I think I mean,

515
00:55:58,310 --> 00:56:02,660
first of all, you'd have to have a generalized list of basically all that, you know,

516
00:56:03,170 --> 00:56:07,159
and that is one of the tricky things about cost for themselves is you have to actually

517
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:10,250
do the cost various analyzes to figure out is something cost effective or not?

518
00:56:10,550 --> 00:56:15,080
And not only is it as a technology, but it's a technology applied to a specific population.

519
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:20,270
So, you know, this might be these might be the results for a 35 year old.

520
00:56:20,270 --> 00:56:28,249
But for 25 year old, the results might be slightly different. For a 55 year old, it was slightly different, you know, so it is I will admit,

521
00:56:28,250 --> 00:56:34,549
it is difficult to to set up it would be difficult to set up an insurance system that is based on I mean,

522
00:56:34,550 --> 00:56:38,180
the UK does it of course, but it is it is tricky.

523
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:45,610
But then I like the idea, the general idea that, you know, you have some sort of baseline,

524
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:50,380
if you will, kind of safety net baseline level of of coverage that's provided.

525
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:55,000
And then if you want more, you can you can pay for it in some ways.

526
00:56:55,090 --> 00:56:59,139
Maybe also the U.S. Medicare system is like that, you know, Medicare Advantage or something like that.

527
00:56:59,140 --> 00:57:03,940
You can add supplemental somewhat of insurance and things like that for Medicare.

528
00:57:09,970 --> 00:57:17,510
Other questions are comments. So this is kind of international.

529
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:26,300
And then I think the U.S. here just a recap of what happens in the U.S.

530
00:57:28,470 --> 00:57:32,370
FDA is just looking at safety and efficacy. They're not looking at cost.

531
00:57:32,850 --> 00:57:38,399
So they don't look because sometimes people say they should, but right now, at least, their mandate is just cost.

532
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:41,760
They're just looking at effectiveness, safety and efficacy.

533
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:47,970
Medicare really also is not supposed to look at cost when they're looking at.

534
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:58,549
When they're paid for something. I will say there were some kind of corner cases where like paying for devices, typically if they're,

535
00:57:58,550 --> 00:58:02,140
you know, putting in like a knee replacement or something like that, Medicare pays for that.

536
00:58:02,510 --> 00:58:07,130
The whole procedure, including the the device that's put in you.

537
00:58:07,430 --> 00:58:10,340
And so Medicare just says, oh, we'll pay $30,000 for your knee replacement.

538
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:15,350
And and they leave it up to the hospital to select what kind of device to put in you.

539
00:58:16,190 --> 00:58:19,819
And so if the hospital wants to put a $40,000 device on you, that's Medicare says fine,

540
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:23,300
we're still only paying $30,000 for that knee replacement procedure.

541
00:58:24,350 --> 00:58:33,920
And so there is some ways in there where Medicare maybe can in some ways make decisions or decisions that that would exclude,

542
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:39,680
you know, expensive interventions. CDC How in you know,

543
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:46,729
in my experience when working with topics related to vaccine economics and actually some things you

544
00:58:46,730 --> 00:58:51,650
better not really to vaccines they are they have been interested in cost effectiveness analysis.

545
00:58:53,510 --> 00:58:57,799
Certainly the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices typically does look at

546
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:03,860
cost effectiveness when deciding which populations to make recommendations for.

547
00:59:04,430 --> 00:59:09,709
And they they didn't have a chance to do that for the COVID vaccination decision spent working on some of the

548
00:59:09,710 --> 00:59:15,590
things where they're they're actually currently making some decisions about interventions for this virus.

549
00:59:15,590 --> 00:59:21,979
And we're working directly with them to evaluate cost effectiveness for specific populations and specific recommendations about,

550
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:29,270
you know, babies when they're newborns, once they get vaccinated or adults should they get vaccinated age 60 or 65 or 70, etc.

551
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:34,930
They definitely are interested in cost factors. It's not the only thing they look at, but it's one of the important things they do.

552
00:59:35,270 --> 00:59:40,579
They're making decisions about vaccine recommendations, and in my experience too,

553
00:59:40,580 --> 00:59:46,670
they they find a cost also to be kind of compelling to advocate for other interventions as well.

554
00:59:46,970 --> 00:59:56,360
Public health interventions. We saw the example of the VA using cost effectiveness analysis for for that PCSK9 inhibitors,

555
00:59:56,360 --> 01:00:03,210
and they certainly use it for other pharmaceutical decisions or for pharmacy pharmacy formulations,

556
01:00:03,230 --> 01:00:07,190
formulary management, they don't necessarily use it for other things,

557
01:00:07,190 --> 01:00:12,430
like deciding which surgical procedure to use, but they certainly do it using for pharmacy assistant.

558
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:18,710
Actually, the VA is the largest health system in the U.S., so that isn't something to do.

559
01:00:18,830 --> 01:00:26,750
One that we may have talked about, that PCORI Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute.

560
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:32,030
When that issue was created, they were explicitly told that they could not.

561
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:41,030
Well, technically, they were told they could not use a dollars per quality metric for evaluating whether interventions were good or bad,

562
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:49,970
which basically has has had our researchers kind of stay away from even mentioning quality, just like when they're talking to you.

563
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:56,240
Yeah. Then Medicaid has had some experiments which I think you may have read about,

564
01:00:57,950 --> 01:01:03,319
but they rarely use cost effectiveness analysis and private insurance companies very rarely on here,

565
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:07,400
at least very rarely is it explicit that they're using cost effective sentences.

566
01:01:08,930 --> 01:01:15,259
CVS, I think, was actually explicit that they were going to offer a plan that did explicitly

567
01:01:15,260 --> 01:01:18,440
look at cost effectiveness and think about pharmaceutical interventions.

568
01:01:19,250 --> 01:01:23,970
And my understanding is other insurance companies want to see cost increases,

569
01:01:24,110 --> 01:01:29,570
some submitted from a manufacturer before they decide how to pay for their drugs.

570
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:34,010
But that's but they're very rarely explicit about that.

571
01:01:34,010 --> 01:01:40,729
And they're very cagey about what thresholds might be considered cost effective or not the least.

572
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:46,970
From what I've heard, the manufacturers think that the insurance companies want to see something cost less than $50,000 per policy.

573
01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:53,000
But again, the insurance companies don't say that. And this gets back what to what Dan Wei had mentioned earlier.

574
01:01:53,450 --> 01:01:57,680
Like the UK, when they're explicit and say our threshold is £20,000 per poly,

575
01:01:58,190 --> 01:02:01,610
then that means the manufacturers know they can set their prices to try to get right up,

576
01:02:01,770 --> 01:02:08,120
right up under that, if you're Blue Cross and you say, Dear Merc, please give me a cost of 5003 drug.

577
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:10,700
But Merck doesn't know what my threshold is.

578
01:02:11,630 --> 01:02:24,550
Then the idea is then maybe Merck will keep their price lower because they have uncertainty about what my real willingness to pay and that,

579
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:30,170
you know, do. The thing I guess I want to mention in this letter, too, is physician organizations and other kind of professional organizations.

580
01:02:32,630 --> 01:02:37,340
Not all of them, but many of them do think about cost effectiveness analysis when making recommendations.

581
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:43,459
So I, I'm actually doing some work with in the world of hepatitis B and we reading some

582
01:02:43,460 --> 01:02:49,150
guidelines about liver cancer screening and the American Association for the study.

583
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:55,110
Liver diseases. Has some recommendations about who should be screened for liver cancer and when to have hepatitis

584
01:02:55,110 --> 01:03:01,140
B and other other liver diseases that make them at higher elevated risk for liver cancer.

585
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:10,560
And they said, oh, these populations should get screened because it's it's been deemed it as cost effective to screen these populations.

586
01:03:11,310 --> 01:03:16,139
So, again, physician organizations, other organizations do not always,

587
01:03:16,140 --> 01:03:21,150
but sometimes they will look at cost effectiveness in order to make recommendations about who should get the screening test,

588
01:03:21,150 --> 01:03:23,550
who should get that intervention and so forth,

589
01:03:23,910 --> 01:03:28,170
especially for something like a screening test where you're saying potentially it could be very expensive.

590
01:03:28,170 --> 01:03:33,420
If you say, hey, everyone in this room needs a screening test, it's a liver, ultrasound or something like that to look for liver cancer.

591
01:03:33,650 --> 01:03:37,080
You know, that could get very expensive if you've just got to give it to everyone.

592
01:03:37,350 --> 01:03:41,160
And so I think I think it's reasonable to say let's look at cost effectiveness to see,

593
01:03:41,430 --> 01:03:45,960
you know, precisely which population should be given certain screening tests, etc., etc.

594
01:03:49,590 --> 01:04:00,210
Any questions? So customer resources, I think, can be influential, but but only in kind of the right contexts.

595
01:04:01,950 --> 01:04:08,040
So maybe for you guys here. So what should the CDC do, if anything?

596
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:11,480
Regarding the use of cost analysis.

597
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:20,560
Should they have at the cost effectiveness of the coronavirus vaccine recommendations for different age groups or populations,

598
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:22,300
or booster vaccination recommendations,

599
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:31,810
or the new Bivalent vaccination recommendations or recommendations for diet and exercise for to reduce obesity.

600
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:36,350
Or should they say screw this cost effective stuff? This is terrible.

601
01:04:40,790 --> 01:04:45,260
We don't want money intruding in our pure commitment to the glorious public health.

602
01:04:48,170 --> 01:04:51,620
I think in the sake of like transparency and like I guess respect to that,

603
01:04:51,630 --> 01:04:55,520
like maybe focusing on like more of like the messaging like understanding and helping folks like,

604
01:04:55,820 --> 01:05:01,090
for example, like understand health literacy, but also the economic implications that factor into those decisions.

605
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:05,150
I think it's appropriate slash responsible for the CDC maybe to do that.

606
01:05:08,340 --> 01:05:14,430
And we'll say one seed. What? In my experience with CDC, they're interested in kind of a societal perspective analysis.

607
01:05:14,430 --> 01:05:21,020
And the people I've been working with, many of whom have health that I'm studying and,

608
01:05:21,350 --> 01:05:25,170
you know, but they they say, hey, look, if we're going to make a recommendation that,

609
01:05:26,010 --> 01:05:33,450
you know, health plans should do X, we want to make sure that it's a good use of their resources, even if it's not CDC dollars spending on this.

610
01:05:33,750 --> 01:05:38,400
You know, they want to make recommendations that are, you know, economically valuable for society.

611
01:05:39,330 --> 01:05:45,570
So I don't know. I mean, I think this could be also applied to the CDC, but kind of also in general,

612
01:05:46,380 --> 01:05:54,390
I feel like when it comes to cost effective analysis, one element that's left out is a political cost.

613
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:58,920
So we often depend like kind of what Bruce had brought up.

614
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:08,520
When it comes to social policy, we depend on legislators and elected officials to support or not support some sort of intervention.

615
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:13,650
And so it seems like there's not really a way to factor in.

616
01:06:14,790 --> 01:06:21,990
What these people are actually thinking about, like what the political cost could be to their constituents and how to.

617
01:06:22,620 --> 01:06:23,550
I feel like the right.

618
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:35,650
Solution or analysis would factor that in and kind of think about the economy of ideas and beliefs more so than monetary benefit.

619
01:06:37,340 --> 01:06:43,399
So I guess one thing with, you know, political maybe am misinterpreting your your comment, but I think,

620
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:47,420
yeah, there are certainly are political implications for a lot of these decisions as well.

621
01:06:47,810 --> 01:06:55,100
So it might be really cost effective to treat prisoners with hepatitis C, but they're not a very politically popular population.

622
01:06:55,100 --> 01:07:02,250
And so, you know, you could get, you know, take a political hit for advocating for that or something like that.

623
01:07:02,270 --> 01:07:08,360
Is that kind of what you're doing? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think that also goes as well to the second point that I want to raise is that like,

624
01:07:08,690 --> 01:07:12,679
how is this information being disseminated and how is that messaging being impacted?

625
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:17,630
Like different stakeholders, like policymakers, decision makers, clinicians, and like importantly, my patients as well.

626
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:23,180
Like, who is the onus on for that? Like, who exactly is like communicating that information?

627
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:27,520
And how is that information being, you know, communicated? Yeah.

628
01:07:27,530 --> 01:07:29,359
I think the communication is, is important.

629
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:36,010
And I will say really anything with cost effectiveness allies as often oftentimes and also when you're talking to physicians,

630
01:07:36,250 --> 01:07:41,260
you know, they are trained, you know, first do more harm. My my obligation is to the patient in front of me.

631
01:07:41,740 --> 01:07:47,200
And it's hard to think about, well, why should I think about the dollars that I'm spending on this?

632
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:53,260
I'm going to take care of this patient in front of me. And I really shouldn't care about whether that's a thousand hour MRI or whatever.

633
01:07:54,490 --> 01:08:00,969
And so and they're kind of taught to think that what they're doing is pure and right for the health of this patient,

634
01:08:00,970 --> 01:08:06,790
and money should not be part of it. And so that is challenging.

635
01:08:06,790 --> 01:08:10,510
And I had a conversation with someone in Health and Human Services a couple of years ago.

636
01:08:10,810 --> 01:08:17,650
I would say, hey, you know, cost benefit analysis where you're putting a dollar value based on your are we willing to spend X amount of dollars or,

637
01:08:17,980 --> 01:08:22,540
you know, that cost benefit analysis, we actually put a dollar value on some of these health outcomes.

638
01:08:22,780 --> 01:08:30,280
And she was really, really averse to kind of mixing money with health and saying,

639
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:35,499
you know, no, we don't want to put a dollar value on kind of human lives, you know?

640
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:38,140
And that's a very powerful sentiment and argument.

641
01:08:39,430 --> 01:08:46,809
You know, I guess my my understanding and thought is, you know, other things, too, is that, you know,

642
01:08:46,810 --> 01:08:51,340
you have to be careful because if you don't put a dollar value on someone's health outcomes, then maybe they just don't even measured.

643
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:59,500
And then and then they might get devalued again when thinking if we just present some sort of result and just show the economics but don't show that,

644
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:06,070
you know, health outcomes, then maybe people get overly focused on the economics of just the pure dollars and

645
01:09:06,070 --> 01:09:10,540
cents and don't see the kind of health benefits as well if they're not quantified.

646
01:09:10,540 --> 01:09:14,050
Yeah. Yeah. And I kind of hear that argument a lot from.

647
01:09:15,570 --> 01:09:20,910
Sometimes, you know, from people in the medical field like doctors about how you get the dollar value on this care and,

648
01:09:20,910 --> 01:09:26,550
you know, you should just get the best care regardless. And I think that those sometimes leave out the consideration like, you know,

649
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:30,830
doctors aren't aware of the cost of the procedures and medications they're prescribing.

650
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:38,250
I mean, it's affecting your patient's health. If you prescribe something that's going to bankrupt them, what you know, that's going to, you know,

651
01:09:38,580 --> 01:09:42,100
your lower income, that affects your health in other ways and, you know, ruins your mental health and things.

652
01:09:42,100 --> 01:09:46,950
So I think to just say, oh, it doesn't matter, you know, the costs, what the cost is,

653
01:09:46,950 --> 01:09:50,760
that's kind of not taking into account the full spectrum of the patients.

654
01:09:51,030 --> 01:09:56,470
Yeah. I actually think more and more I think physicians are aware of two things.

655
01:09:56,710 --> 01:10:04,420
One is, hey, when I if I prescribe this, there are going to be big co-pays that maybe my patients can't pay.

656
01:10:04,420 --> 01:10:07,360
And if they can't pay for it, they're not going to get it. So they're not going to get the benefit anyway.

657
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:11,919
If I'm prescribing this really expensive medication, if they have high co-pays,

658
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:19,360
they won't get it anyway or it'll bankrupt them, which will add a lot of stress and you know, and things like that as well.

659
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:26,110
And that just kind of systemically, if you're a physician and you keep on ordering really expensive,

660
01:10:26,110 --> 01:10:31,960
not very effective tests and treatments and so forth, you're adding costs to the system.

661
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:38,470
And the health care costs of the system have been, you know, exponentially increasing over the last 40 years.

662
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:45,520
And when when that gets expensive, it makes insurance costs higher.

663
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:49,960
It reduces access to insurance because then people say, I can't pay for this private insurance or something like that.

664
01:10:50,620 --> 01:10:54,430
So they don't have insurance or they.

665
01:10:55,940 --> 01:11:00,790
Anyway, so there are all kinds of problems, a challenge with having high, high costs of medical care.

666
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:06,420
And but I think I think more and more there are physicians that are, you know,

667
01:11:06,460 --> 01:11:18,970
interested in thinking about the kind of big picture impact of their decisions on costs writ large.

668
01:11:18,970 --> 01:11:25,480
And then also on an individual level of, you know, if I prescribe a $10,000 treatment to someone and he has,

669
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:31,569
you know, Medicare typically Medicare is going to pay for 80% of that, but that means 20% is his responsibility.

670
01:11:31,570 --> 01:11:37,810
And now I've given him a, you know, $2,000 bill every month or whatever it is, if it's a 10,000 hour treatment per month.

671
01:11:38,530 --> 01:11:41,560
And so that's that's a burden I'm placing on plantation.

672
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:49,990
If I if I give them a, you know, high cost medication and for Medicare patients to,

673
01:11:50,140 --> 01:11:53,680
again, you know, Medicare pays for 80% of the drug costs, but not the other 20%.

674
01:11:53,680 --> 01:11:58,839
If it's if it's a physician administered drug and if they don't have supplemental insurance and if you're if you're low income,

675
01:11:58,840 --> 01:12:04,030
you probably haven't paid for supplemental medical insurance. You know, sometimes those costs can be really expensive.

676
01:12:04,030 --> 01:12:11,200
And and yeah. And so it can be, you know, devastating for someone to get prescribed the expensive medication.

677
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:21,810
Other thoughts on how Medicare or Medicaid or private health insurance.

678
01:12:23,310 --> 01:12:33,060
Should or should not use cost. So with Medicare, like so you mentioned, they rarely use cost effective cost effectiveness analysis,

679
01:12:33,060 --> 01:12:39,840
but with the ability to negotiate drug prices, do you think they will start to use those analysis more?

680
01:12:40,140 --> 01:12:41,940
So that's a that's a great comment here.

681
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:49,620
And I think, you know, yeah, historically, I think saying anything related to cost with Medicare was kind of toxic politically.

682
01:12:49,620 --> 01:12:54,510
If you said, hey, Medicare is going to look at cost that you get and seniors, you know,

683
01:12:54,570 --> 01:12:59,760
marching through to pitchforks saying, hey, what are you trying to do, limit my Medicare access?

684
01:13:00,510 --> 01:13:06,059
And I think I think there are you hear that a little bit with with the Medicare price negotiations,

685
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:12,030
as is you heard from pharmaceutical advocates saying, hey, look, this is going to reduce access to care and it might.

686
01:13:13,290 --> 01:13:17,130
But I think yeah, I think cost effective analysis would be likely part of that.

687
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:18,989
I will say the Medicare price negotiation,

688
01:13:18,990 --> 01:13:26,370
it's it's it's it's quite complex in terms of which drugs are allowed to be negotiated and unclear exactly precisely how that will work out.

689
01:13:26,730 --> 01:13:33,840
But yeah, I think cost effectiveness analysis probably will be part of that and determining,

690
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:37,550
you know, what they think is is a fair price that ought to be negotiated. Yeah.

691
01:13:39,370 --> 01:13:44,800
So anyway, it might be crossed out in this house. It might be sneaking its way into into Medicare with that.

692
01:13:45,820 --> 01:13:50,710
But again, I think I have a feeling it'll be kind of a small, small part of it.

693
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:54,540
Again because but with that said, I mean,

694
01:13:54,600 --> 01:14:01,620
it's designed to be used only for kind of certain medications that are really expensive and the prices have been increasing.

695
01:14:02,330 --> 01:14:09,569
With that said, though, if you mean you know, if you think about the difference because, you know,

696
01:14:09,570 --> 01:14:13,720
sometimes there are there are a small number of drugs that account for a large fraction of spending.

697
01:14:13,980 --> 01:14:20,490
And so if you can if you can negotiate some of those high cost drugs, you could you can maybe make a dent in some parts of.

698
01:14:24,130 --> 01:14:32,740
Yeah. It'll be interesting to see how that works out and how many drugs actually are negotiated with prison for the price of them.

699
01:14:32,950 --> 01:14:34,930
We'll see how it goes. You know what?

700
01:14:35,390 --> 01:14:42,610
I still get caught up in courts about, well, you can't negotiate with us because of this technicality and so forth.

701
01:14:43,420 --> 01:14:49,530
Yeah, I think Medicare like really reimburses the full price for the drug, too, though.

702
01:14:50,530 --> 01:14:56,830
Like, you know, like let's say if the price of a drug on an individual, it's like 3000 and they would just think if it was 2000 or something.

703
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:01,009
So it kind of depends. I mean, and Medicare is is complex.

704
01:15:01,010 --> 01:15:06,640
So there's Medicare Part A, which is hospitalization, Medicare Part B, which is physician services.

705
01:15:07,180 --> 01:15:12,430
But it's also that also includes drugs administered by a physician. So if basically if it's injected, it's usually that kind of stuff.

706
01:15:12,730 --> 01:15:18,790
It's going to be administered by physicians not to be under Part B, and that is basically Medicare paid 80% of that.

707
01:15:19,750 --> 01:15:24,430
And so the patient's responsibility, 20%, Medicare Part C is basically Medicare Advantage.

708
01:15:24,940 --> 01:15:31,479
And they can they can they can kind of make up their own rules to their so except and then there's Medicare Part D,

709
01:15:31,480 --> 01:15:39,240
which is that the drugs that you kind of buy at the pharmacy and and that is yeah there are the rules for you know,

710
01:15:39,250 --> 01:15:42,720
what the patient co-pays are for that are kind of complicated as well. Yeah.

711
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:47,440
And there was like the donut hole anyway, all kinds of complex rules.

712
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:51,610
So it's hard to say precisely what a particular patient would pay for this.

713
01:15:51,610 --> 01:15:55,870
Co-pays for for drugs. But it it varies again from different system.

714
01:15:56,140 --> 01:16:02,650
I will say that Medicare well, a lot of people are getting their, you know, pills, the pharmacy.

715
01:16:02,650 --> 01:16:09,400
And so there are a lot of people who are facing Medicare Part D drugs, but generally speaking, they're not too expensive.

716
01:16:09,770 --> 01:16:15,880
You can get some of the benefits of them. Actually, I was at the airport yesterday and a guy was giving stuff out at the security line.

717
01:16:16,150 --> 01:16:21,850
He pulled out a zipper, gallons of like bag and he had like 15 different co bottles and they're like, oh, my God.

718
01:16:23,110 --> 01:16:24,590
Yeah, sorry for you. That's a lot of pain.

719
01:16:25,270 --> 01:16:33,190
But so, I mean, if you're like that and you do have high medical expenses and you're, you know, I'm a doctor, you pick a pharmacy,

720
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:39,310
but Medicare Part B, the ones that are a physician, administered infusions, stuff like that, those ones often are really expensive.

721
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:45,220
They're like the the Cambria, the PCSK9 inhibitors and stuff like that.

722
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:49,630
Well, sorry, Xeljanz, but I mean, this is something you're not going to just give yourself at home.

723
01:16:49,990 --> 01:16:54,190
Spinraza You're not just going to give us your stuff at home anyway.

724
01:16:54,190 --> 01:16:58,630
So there are a lot a lot of the really, really expensive ones are going to be just administrative property,

725
01:16:58,930 --> 01:17:02,860
but it's a very complex system, so it's hard to say precisely what it will pay.

726
01:17:02,860 --> 01:17:06,909
But you're right, though, in general, you know, there are co-pays that people have to pay as well.

727
01:17:06,910 --> 01:17:10,660
And so typically they're based off the list price, too, which can be quite expensive.

728
01:17:14,570 --> 01:17:21,530
Other questions you come to. Yeah. So we have talk about a lot of the drugs are intervention.

729
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:27,860
I was speaking about what about a diagnosed testing like because it's kind of part

730
01:17:27,860 --> 01:17:33,740
of patient journey like I have so many patients are lung cancer patients who

731
01:17:34,130 --> 01:17:39,650
because of the high price of PCR or and so they didn't even have the chance to

732
01:17:39,650 --> 01:17:44,370
see which is better for them because the diagnosis is too expensive for them.

733
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:49,820
Yeah. And I will say, yeah, we in this class and cost resources in general,

734
01:17:50,300 --> 01:17:58,740
we do focus a lot on pharmaceuticals and probably overly so and partially that's historically that that you know a lot of

735
01:17:58,820 --> 01:18:07,910
the pharmaceutical benefits of the and we talk with the VA their pharmacy formulary management but but it should be applied.

736
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:12,710
Yeah. For for testing and diagnostics as well. And you know, your MRI can be very expensive.

737
01:18:12,770 --> 01:18:18,649
CT scans can be very expensive. And some genetic tests new genetic tests can be very expensive, you know,

738
01:18:18,650 --> 01:18:22,010
for for a lot of some other tests that are like 30 hours test, that's probably not a big deal.

739
01:18:22,220 --> 01:18:26,290
But but yeah, there are, there are growing number of diagnostics that are quite expensive.

740
01:18:26,300 --> 01:18:30,620
And you right the patient co-pays can be expensive as well and and you should.

741
01:18:30,620 --> 01:18:37,900
And for any diagnostic you want to think about, not only what's the cost of the diagnostic, but what are the cost of the results of that diagnostic.

742
01:18:37,910 --> 01:18:42,320
So if you give me some sort of test and then it says, Oh, you've got to go in for a follow up test,

743
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:49,580
it's a CT scan that's going to be thousands of dollars or that's going to be some sort of invasive test where they cut you open.

744
01:18:49,580 --> 01:18:55,639
And, you know, we go on in your intestines and, you know, whatever they're doing there, there could be side effects.

745
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:59,240
You know, you could die on the table from a severe accident.

746
01:18:59,270 --> 01:19:06,380
You could get a massive infection and die. So, you know, there are kind of health effects of of this, you know, subsequent events.

747
01:19:07,340 --> 01:19:11,780
And there could be other costs of that, too. So now you gave me an expensive surgery that that I pay for.

748
01:19:12,290 --> 01:19:16,639
So there are kind of the downstream costs and benefits, of course, of of that diagnostics.

749
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:22,790
So you don't want to think about not just what's the cost of the diagnostic, but what are all the downstream impacts of that diagnostics.

750
01:19:22,910 --> 01:19:24,620
Does that answer your question?

751
01:19:26,060 --> 01:19:32,120
Oh, but that is something to think about, too, is there are a lot of new novel, novel diagnostics that are, you know, very interesting,

752
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:40,069
very innovative, but also can be much more expensive than than the simple, you know, what's the age of your blood kind of test?

753
01:19:40,070 --> 01:19:44,990
It's very, very simple, introduced for thousands of years. But, you know, this is more complex.

754
01:19:44,990 --> 01:19:51,860
You know, genetic genomic tests. They can be, you know, much more complex and expensive.

755
01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:58,890
And and actually, again, also complex to interpret because it's not just the cost of that task, but it's the cost of all.
