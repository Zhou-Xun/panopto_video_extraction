1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:09,210
According. Well the recordings start with me saying I in a recording from.

2
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,470
All right. So all right.

3
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:33,930
So this is my first announcement is make sure to just watch in a rubric as you put your paper together and let me know if you have questions.

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,910
Second announcement homework to do today. Turn it in imminently, please.

5
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:47,480
And if you need more time somewhere, uh, next week.

6
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:51,980
Next week we have we're going to be going over modes of transport.

7
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:59,750
We're doing some examples of modes of transmission studies. We'll be talking about respiratory transmission on Monday.

8
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:04,160
Monday is is going to be student presentations and lecture.

9
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,130
We will not be having a workshop. I'm going to walk you through.

10
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:18,320
I might be taking the time to walk you through a lot of the historical transmission studies that happened in the late 1800s, types of stuff that,

11
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:25,010
you know, a lot of like human challenge transmission studies and think things are involved infecting people with things and seeing what happens.

12
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:33,890
And so we're going to be discussing those on Monday and then have some presentations, but we will not have a workshop on Wednesday.

13
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:37,370
We will have a workshop on one paper, one paper only.

14
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:39,080
So we have one reading for next week.

15
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:53,480
And yeah, so some lectures, some supervised lectures will be a little bit longer than they've been previously for book related to this,

16
00:01:55,580 --> 00:02:03,590
I've been I've been reflecting a little bit, so I really think the class has been really interactive and I really appreciate it.

17
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:08,540
All that kind of work and attention everybody's bringing in to the workshops.

18
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:12,620
I want to be a little bit more supportive as people are starting to get sick.

19
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:18,950
It is respiratory season and I'm sure if fall break is in two weeks and I know

20
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:23,270
everybody's going to go to that party in Las Vegas where there's all the viruses.

21
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:30,470
So after the party in Las Vegas, I want to make sure that I'm being like really supportive of feeling comfortable staying home if you have symptoms.

22
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:36,410
So along those lines, I am offering a credit opportunity.

23
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:45,110
I'm going to call that credit opportunity. So I'm going to put this on the announcements as well so everybody can see this.

24
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:54,349
But starting next week, well, yeah, starting next week, I will be giving out.

25
00:02:54,350 --> 00:03:04,850
Where did I put my rubric book? So you have the opportunity to bring one hot topic discussion question to class or I will be awarding two

26
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:12,440
points for each question that you ask a student presenter and you can use that in place of workshop points.

27
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:17,780
If you miss a workshop rather than having to do the workshop that you miss at home individually.

28
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:22,790
Because I think for people who start to develop symptoms up to miss class, it's going to be a lot of work.

29
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:31,790
So you can replace up to one workshop credit points with some of this other stuff and I will do a good job of keeping track of things.

30
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:36,820
I will ask you to state your name before you ask a question to make sure that I'm I'm

31
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:42,470
telling points so you can use that to offset some of your workshop points if needed,

32
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:45,650
especially in cases of absence, any initial.

33
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,580
Are we happy with that? And I'm happy with that. Okay. Okay.

34
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:59,090
All right. There are always there's always unintended consequences and complications with points that we as faculty never anticipate.

35
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:03,140
When we start doing stuff like this, let me know if this is working or not working,

36
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:11,870
but I want to offer just another opportunity to cover workshop points, you know, given that, give people as much flexibility as we can.

37
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:20,990
Last thing about today's workshop. We have assigned groups for today's workshop.

38
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:27,140
So today we're going to experiment with doing this as an official canvas sanctioned group activity.

39
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,759
I will throw up on the screen who the groups are. You should be able to see who your group is.

40
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:36,770
I think in canvas, if you can, I can pull it up on the screen when we're ready to do workshops.

41
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:41,210
So you guys are all making new friends today. It's very exciting for everybody.

42
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:47,630
Okay, with that, I'm going to start talking and we'll have our student presentation for the day.

43
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:58,150
Yeah. I sound a little bit tired.

44
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:02,720
I can just hold your paper.

45
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,700
The present another no on PowerPoint.

46
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:25,050
All the way to the bottom is a little like that.

47
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,680
Yeah. Perfect. All right.

48
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,809
Um, okay. So I'm Hayley,

49
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:38,660
and today I'm going to be presenting on behalf of my colleagues on an investigation

50
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:43,910
of long COVID prevalence and its relationship to Epstein-Barr virus reactivation.

51
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:52,130
So to start off, long COVID infection happens in about 30% of all COVID 19 cases.

52
00:05:52,490 --> 00:06:01,280
And we can define long COVID as having one or more persistent symptoms 30 or more days after your first positive COVID 19 test.

53
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:11,900
So to go over a bit more of the Epstein-Barr virus biology, Epstein-Barr virus is our herpes gamma virus or a gamma herpes virus,

54
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:17,690
and it's infected and latent in about 90% of the global population.

55
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:24,890
And that infection normally happens before someone is about 20 years old.

56
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:32,420
So it's unsurprising that it is, in fact, in in about 95% of all healthy adults.

57
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:38,359
And then a characteristic of that that contributes to that high prevalence is a lifelong

58
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:44,720
persistence and intermittent reactivation or chronic infection with Epstein-Barr virus.

59
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:55,010
So it tends to infect the epithelial cells in the B cells, and then throughout late and lytic phases,

60
00:06:55,010 --> 00:07:02,000
it can reactivate to either infect other people or you can get some chronic symptoms of reactivation.

61
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:13,820
Now, some of those symptoms include fatigue, brain fog, sleep difficulties, or that one is just joint pain pharyngitis,

62
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:21,470
which is a sore throat, myalgia, headaches, fever, gastrointestinal upset and skin rashes.

63
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:27,200
And it's important to just make a note that those are very similar and overlap

64
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:32,270
completely with the long COVID symptoms that we are studying in this paper.

65
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:41,240
So the objectives of the paper were to determine the prevalence of cold or of long COVID following acute COVID 19 infection,

66
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:50,120
and then to determine if there is any relationship between long COVID symptoms and the Epstein-Barr virus reactivation.

67
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:58,100
So from methods, we used an online ad to get people to apply to our study.

68
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:02,630
We ended up having 357 applicants, which is the top box.

69
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:08,330
And then we excluded some of them if they weren't able to provide a full online questionnaire

70
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:14,330
or if they were unable to provide documentation of their COVID 19 positive test result.

71
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:24,740
And then from there, we ended up with 185 applicants who made up our study pool for studying long COVID prevalence.

72
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:34,190
And then from there, we had secondary exclusion criteria, which meant we were looking only at people who were between the ages of 21 and 74.

73
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:42,140
And we were excluding some people based on other health conditions, such as pregnancy and COVID 19 vaccination.

74
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:47,360
And then from there, we chose four groups of people.

75
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:55,370
So we had a long term or primary participant group and then a short term or secondary group.

76
00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:00,920
And then each of those groups was broken down into a case group and a control group.

77
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:05,240
And those groups were chosen randomly, not by the study team.

78
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:13,040
So for serology, we looked at antibodies and we tested all the blood samples of the cases and controls

79
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:18,380
for each of these four types of antibodies we tested for viral capsid antigen.

80
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:26,690
So if you're thinking about like the biology of a virus, that's like the capsid that encloses the virus,

81
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:35,420
and we tested for both AGM and IGG for that one, but we mainly use the AGM in our results, as you'll see later.

82
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:48,350
And then we also looked at Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen one IgG as well as Epstein-Barr early antigen diffuse IgG.

83
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:57,649
And then for that we used a liaison analyzer and we measured the chemo luminescence from CLEA,

84
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:04,130
which is a commercially available immuno assay that binds magnetically to the antibodies.

85
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:13,070
So for interpretation, this kind of just gives us an idea of what we're looking for when we're talking about reactivation.

86
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:17,180
But we mainly ended up using the vaccine.

87
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:28,440
And that you do need to define a reactivation event, which that is based mostly on because they're different at different levels.

88
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:41,300
During any phase of reactivation, we needed multiple measures, but we used all four to be able to detect who could possibly have a reactivation event.

89
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:44,700
We just didn't end up using all four of them in the end.

90
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:50,820
So for our results, for long COVID prevalence,

91
00:10:50,820 --> 00:11:04,920
we found that about 30.3% of all of the 185 participants included after primary exclusion criteria had at least one continuing long COVID symptom.

92
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:11,640
And so that result was very consistent with other studies, including one from the University of Washington.

93
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:21,180
And we minimized bias by not including any information about what our study goals were in the actual survey itself.

94
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:31,440
So the the participants didn't know that we were interested in looking at long COVID prevalence to try to tease out who actually has long COVID.

95
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:36,219
So the results for the two different groups.

96
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:45,090
So the long term is the primary and we found that about two thirds of cases and 10% of controls had Epstein-Barr virus reactivation.

97
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:49,920
And those numbers were different with a P level of less than 0.01.

98
00:11:50,880 --> 00:12:01,140
And then it's also worth noting that two of our controls so they never had any long COVID symptoms, but they were also asymptomatic initially.

99
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:07,320
So they never had COVID symptoms like at all in the whole course of their disease.

100
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:13,830
And they did still have Epstein-Barr virus reactivation, which is an interesting finding.

101
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:20,250
And then our secondary participant analysis or our short term group was very similar,

102
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:28,920
and about 67% of cases versus 11% of controls had a Epstein-Barr virus reactivation.

103
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:35,760
And then that was also a significant finding. So just a couple more results.

104
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:42,870
We did also look at antibody titer versus the number of reported long COVID symptoms,

105
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:50,610
but the only significant result that we found was in that 80 or the early antigen diffuse IGG.

106
00:12:51,480 --> 00:13:02,880
And so we saw that as the number of COVID symptom or long COVID symptoms increased, it tended to have an increase in that antibody titer as well.

107
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:10,770
And then this bar chart is just showing some of the most common symptoms that people reported for long COVID.

108
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:17,700
And again, you see that they overlap quite a bit with what we would expect for Epstein-Barr virus reactivation.

109
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:28,770
So some limitations of our study. We could not pinpoint the exact timing of when I've seen bar virus was reactivated in our subject study,

110
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:35,610
which I'll talk a bit about in the discussion panel, but we can infer some things based on our results still.

111
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:39,090
And then this one wasn't explicitly mentioned in the paper,

112
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:48,809
but the fact that the Epstein-Barr virus reactivation symptoms are so similar to the long COVID symptoms just kind of convalesce the

113
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:58,680
results a bit and makes it difficult to tell what is due to potential reactivation events and what is also just due to long COVID.

114
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:08,520
So obviously in our study pool we saw that there are people who have long COVID and have long COVID symptoms who don't have a reactivation event.

115
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:19,140
And we also know that even before COVID was a thing, people who have Epstein-Barr virus reactivation tend to have those similar symptoms.

116
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:27,749
So to conclude, we found that the prevalence of long COVID was estimated to be about 30.3%,

117
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:32,670
which is consistent with all of the other studies that we mentioned in our paper.

118
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:40,350
And then Epstein-Barr virus react or reactivation happens early in COVID 19 primary infection.

119
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:52,410
So based on our results in between the two study groups, we can infer that because reactivation was so similar between the two groups,

120
00:14:52,710 --> 00:15:00,780
it is likely happening very early because one of them was 21 to 90 days and one of them was 90 or more days.

121
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:12,120
It's just continuing. That reactivation event throughout the literature also suggests that stress may cause some Epstein-Barr virus reactivation.

122
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:17,180
So it would be interesting to see if the if COVID 19 infection and.

123
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:29,050
Like in the acute phase is a stressful enough situation for the body to reactivate that other the Epstein-Barr virus infection.

124
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:39,700
And then we can also consider that maybe some of the long COVID symptoms might result from COVID inflammation induced reactivation.

125
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:47,260
Kind of like I mentioned in the limitation slide, it's confusing because the symptoms are pretty much the same.

126
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,530
So it can be really difficult to understand,

127
00:15:50,530 --> 00:16:01,209
like what is being caused by which mechanism and then a potential application for our research is that one thing that previous studies have found

128
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:10,600
is that I've seen bar virus reactivation may be higher in hospitalized patients and in patients who are having more severe COVID reactions.

129
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:19,389
And so there's a potential application for treatment or management of severe cases if we can start to

130
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:28,090
use some of the antivirals that we use for Epstein-Barr virus reactivation and then for further study.

131
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:33,100
Seidl Cytomegalovirus has a very similar reactivation pathway.

132
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:40,150
So it could be interesting to study that with long COVID and also like all three of them combined.

133
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:48,130
And then also there are some more serious, but also more rare Epstein-Barr reactivation symptoms,

134
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:53,500
including cardiovascular liver and kidney functional problems.

135
00:16:53,800 --> 00:17:02,830
And so it could be interesting to look at those, but we would need a much larger scale of study participants to test that.

136
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:10,180
And then just the last thing I have is a way that we could possibly test for a mechanism.

137
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:23,409
So one thing that we are interested in in further study is does the byproducts of a COVID 19 immune response cause that reactivation?

138
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:28,330
And is that what's causing the information that can lead to the reactivation?

139
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:32,470
And that's all I have. Do you guys have question?

140
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:46,180
The question. This could be the last day of not many questions that I think would suffice.

141
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:53,210
Yeah. Do you any thoughts on how you may try and do you calculate the overlap between symptoms of long COVID?

142
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:59,950
Yeah, that's a good question. Um, I'm not totally sure,

143
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:09,070
but one option could be to maybe look at people who have long COVID symptoms and see if their symptoms are different

144
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:16,360
from or like someone who only has long COVID versus people who have long COVID and Epstein-Barr reactivation,

145
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,630
and see if those two things differ at all.

146
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:26,860
So kind of a different type of case control study just to try to tease out what ones might be more common.

147
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:40,800
Anybody else? I was going to ask you what the next.

148
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:44,670
Yes, I am. I am a independently rich philanthropist.

149
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:49,220
And I was going to ask you like what the next step was. But I think that is a really good.

150
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:59,760
Thank you very much. So on the other side of the chief.

151
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:01,620
Is it okay if I. Yeah, go for it.

152
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:15,380
There are two kind of teaching points about this that I wanted to point out that I thought this is a good example of first, it's the.

153
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:19,380
All right, first issue.

154
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:32,670
Remember how I said that DNA viruses have a very like orderly, predictable, orderly progression and we haven't done a lot on DNA viruses.

155
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:38,640
We're going to do much more coming up soon. But they have this orderly progression of their replication pattern.

156
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:50,640
And so with studies, especially serologic studies that look at DNA viruses and herpes viruses, we get these,

157
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:58,500
we get we can start to see things like this where we have serologic assays that are

158
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:03,390
detecting an antigen that is produced during a particular point in the replication cycle.

159
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,980
And that specificity helps you think about this.

160
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:12,480
If this protein, if this antigen is being produced and is available,

161
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:17,400
then we can assume that the virus is at a particular point in the replication cycle.

162
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:26,370
So if we see this with you know, we see this with human papillomavirus to other DNA viruses where you can actually use that

163
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:30,900
to your benefit as an epidemiologist by understanding when in the replication cycle,

164
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:36,780
a virus is going to be producing particular antigens that are available to the immune system after recognition.

165
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,639
So this is a that's actually a really good example.

166
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:47,220
That's the other other thing I want to oh, I just wanted to point out and set the sidebar for this.

167
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:53,250
But as good epidemiologists, it's actually a great question.

168
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:02,880
So I ask an epidemiologist like this, you've got this cluster of symptoms, if you think about it this way,

169
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,320
if you don't think about the outcome as long COVID, if you think about it as this cluster of symptoms,

170
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:11,070
and then you've got these possible exposures here.

171
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:26,400
You've got all sorts of epidemiologic problems in trying to figure out which of these exposures you've got to potential exposures you really have.

172
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,750
You have COVID. You have UVB.

173
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:39,930
You know, one way to sort of I really liked your suggestion that instead of thinking about this as one person's endeavors,

174
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:46,260
you could actually do a case control study that's kind of like profile one, you know,

175
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:55,990
kind of symptom group one versus symptom group two and look backwards and see what their exposures look like,

176
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:04,060
you know, and have this sense would it be kind of your cases and this would be like other cases are controls.

177
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:14,860
There is a design that has been used a little bit in health care epidemiology, not so much in the broader world.

178
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:19,000
Is the design called the case case control design?

179
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:27,219
It was it was developed for multidrug resistant infections because it's this idea that if

180
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:31,480
you've got a resistant infection and you've got a susceptible infection and then you have some,

181
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:36,970
you know, infections that there's this kind of second case group that needs to be treated independently,

182
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:42,880
kind of would be similar to that, like a case case design and then look backwards to see exposures.

183
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:48,190
So tell me like what are the issues that are happening with this guy here?

184
00:22:51,440 --> 00:23:01,910
Like if I put it exposure, if I had exposure here, if I put COVID 19 here because it's like the syndrome of the hour,

185
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:10,610
where am I going to put EBV in the day the first year students don't get sick.

186
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:16,880
Am I creating trauma and helping us study for our midterm?

187
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:23,840
When is your next move? We're really going to create this Wednesday.

188
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:29,880
Okay. By day we're reviewing study design. So here is what I write.

189
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:33,290
So where do I put EBV on this? Like, where do my areas go?

190
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:37,460
Also to the symptoms. So yeah, EBV is going to go to the symptoms.

191
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:45,440
Let's go back to this. Let's go back to this original idea. I have this cluster of.

192
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:58,620
Okay. So maybe the is going there and then what's going on right here?

193
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:05,580
And do we think that the study that Hillary presented gives us a direction to figure out?

194
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:16,200
So anybody who thinks that the era should go this direction.

195
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:24,550
Not sure. Okay. Who thinks that era should go this direction?

196
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:32,200
That's a clarification. Yeah. Is it like EBV or EBV reactivation?

197
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,970
They're like, Oh, yeah. Like, cause there's an initial interaction.

198
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:42,000
Uh huh. Yeah. So there's a specificity issue here about what he really means.

199
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:45,760
Does it mean that you're just seropositive for EBV, EBV at any point?

200
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:54,099
Well, 95% of people are seropositive. So it is a reactivation issue or is it a we're going to get into this.

201
00:24:54,100 --> 00:25:00,190
When you talk about I wanted to go through later in the term EBV in that recent paper.

202
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:04,840
Is there a cofactor issue? Could happen. Right.

203
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:09,750
If EBV causes mass, why don't 90, 95% of people that match that.

204
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:16,690
So it's is it is it a reactivation element or is it.

205
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:25,350
Or is there a cofactor that's needed? But then there's a specificity issue also with COVID 19.

206
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:32,820
So is it is this is this a proxy for infection versus no exposure?

207
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:38,790
Or is this a proxy for something else like syndromic disease or severe disease or whatever?

208
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:47,980
And you can see a situation where a good epidemiologist can meet the arrow, go in any direction, and come up with the hypothesis criteria.

209
00:25:48,600 --> 00:26:00,330
So so EBV, you can see a situation where somebody is either having a reactivation event or maybe there is this cofactor that causes SARS-CoV-2.

210
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:09,090
To to lead to kind of the difference between asymptomatic disease versus a more severe disease.

211
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,860
Right. To look up this after the symptom presentation that's happening here.

212
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:17,410
Interesting, right?

213
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:25,920
Because we don't really what answers this question, sort of one kind of critical piece of this that that would really start to answer this question.

214
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:36,490
If you can't do it with a case control study. There is nothing. There's an unknown temporality thing that's happening here.

215
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:39,460
If you bring people into the study when they have less,

216
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:48,370
you don't know really if there's a temporality to these arrows that go this direction because you can't really determine if they had

217
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:56,409
a cool factor ahead of time or if they really were already having a reactivation before they got exposed to click through this.

218
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:58,600
Funny. So you're looking at this. It's funny.

219
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:05,920
It's nice that they're defining reactivation, but it's also there's this temporality issue that's kind of woven in there.

220
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:13,450
So it is epidemiologic puzzle. All right.

221
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:22,600
Thanks, Haley, for letting me go on a tangent about the issue of AIDS.

222
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:29,400
So. All right, lecture.

223
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:34,680
So what I'm doing next. Yeah.

224
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:56,370
All right. Maybe the lecture doesn't want to be lectured.

225
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:11,880
Okay, got it. I guess the.

226
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:34,370
But. Okay.

227
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,490
Doesn't do that. Well, I.

228
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:55,880
Hmm. I have to do this thing.

229
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:17,090
Take a second to come up with other hot topics that you guys are going to bring to class for extra points.

230
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:26,870
Okay. All right.

231
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:36,720
So today we are talking about coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 in particular.

232
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:45,690
But I wanted to give an overview on coronaviruses generally as a group of viruses and talk about let's talk about

233
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:52,320
some of the kind of historical patterns in severe coronaviruses that we had leading up to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

234
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:57,629
The last time I gave this lecture was in fall 2019, which my students have told me.

235
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:02,250
I apparently said, if there's going to be a pandemic, it will be a coronavirus pandemic.

236
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:07,930
And this is why. And they've continually come to my office and blame me for that.

237
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,760
But you'll think of it as you sort of talk to see why.

238
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:18,240
So coronaviruses one and in fact you may not know this or really you know it's it's this is a chance to teach about

239
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:24,120
a virus that you've all been learning about in many different spheres from many different sources of information.

240
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:29,100
And B, there may be good or bad sources of information over the last couple of years, so going to do my best.

241
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:37,110
But in fact, coronaviruses are named as such because when you look at them under an electron microscope, they have a crown.

242
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:43,590
So Corona, that's where it comes from. It doesn't come from the beer. So the crown is right there.

243
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:49,290
And that's why these are named coronaviruses. Coronaviruses are all enveloped viruses.

244
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:54,660
They are non segmented viruses and they have a single strand positive RNA genome.

245
00:30:56,340 --> 00:31:00,329
So a few things should initially start to tell us about, you know,

246
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:05,940
when somebody says there is a pandemic, it is a coronavirus, here are the aspects of it.

247
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:12,209
It sort of initially start telling us different things. For instance, it should tell us with an Amazon developed virus,

248
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:23,190
they are much less hearty in the general, out into the general world than a non enveloped virus then.

249
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:29,639
So, you know, kind of speaks to the washing groceries, debate that like,

250
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:35,160
you know in terms of we tend to see enveloped viruses have much less for instance

251
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:39,930
fomite transmission if there is no kind of accompanying media whatsoever,

252
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:43,290
you know, sort of a dried and dried format transmission.

253
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:49,290
However, we can see that happen with viruses without an envelope, with a really sturdy outer capsid.

254
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:51,210
We do see that more often.

255
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:58,530
For instance, adult virus as an example, you know, adenovirus dried all over a military bearing, still able to infect people.

256
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:07,290
So here and we can talk more about that if you're interested, a single straight positive RNA genome.

257
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:16,530
So from the very beginning, we know that this is a virus that has the ability to have a lot of change during its replication process.

258
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:20,430
And so it has a faster molecular clock and the ability to evolve.

259
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:28,890
Just a few kind of things to think about with the life cycle it has.

260
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,050
Entry through fusion transcription.

261
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:38,020
Transcription and replication occurs in a replication transcriptase complex called RTC.

262
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:42,550
It's these double membrane de vesicles where this happens.

263
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:54,040
It then has it basically and has a spreading function from the endoplasmic reticulum and the old Golgi intermediate compartment.

264
00:32:55,330 --> 00:33:03,880
And then it has a vesicle release. So the there's a vesicle created around the final virion and it's released that way.

265
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:12,950
So we've sort of seen some different examples for how virions acquire their proteins, their surface proteins, as they grow.

266
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:17,830
And you see here the glycoproteins are not lodged on the outer surface of the cell

267
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:22,390
like we've seen with some viruses that are lodged here on the endoplasmic reticulum.

268
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:30,849
And so that is what's used to create that host lipid membrane that has the proteins lodged in it and then comes out from there.

269
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:38,580
It's coming from inside the cell right there. It would be cool if it wasn't such an infectious virus.

270
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:41,670
So the seasonal are human coronaviruses.

271
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:53,370
So there are four main coronaviruses that were already circulating in the human population very regularly and they are grouped for one or two.

272
00:33:54,630 --> 00:34:04,920
Two of these viruses, HQ one and 63 were identified as part of the sort of wave of new virus identifications

273
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:09,360
that happened in the early 2000s as molecular techniques started to grow.

274
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:16,920
Now 63 was actually kind of similar to HIV, where there were two people that isolated it at the same time.

275
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:23,430
They both named it different things. And one person, one or one person lost quite a battle to what.

276
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:32,190
So syndrome is typically for these viruses that have been around for a very long time, the syndrome is similar to rhinoviruses.

277
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:36,450
They are oftentimes found asymptomatically.

278
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:40,950
They're oftentimes found in co-infections. Reinfection is really common.

279
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:47,909
And we have a study here where we saw reinfection on average about every two years or so within a group.

280
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:49,740
So re-infection with the original ones were common.

281
00:34:51,990 --> 00:35:02,820
Fun fact One of the first studies to describe the epidemiology of to 29 e in an outbreak were in the 1960s was Arnold Monto.

282
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:10,020
So I'm a faculty member in every.

283
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:19,970
All right. So for a long time, those viruses were considered just I mean, they still are getting they're not routinely detected in clinical settings.

284
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:23,700
There's not a whole lot of people that pay attention to them other than epidemiologists.

285
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:35,010
For however, there has been this history over time of coronaviruses having very severe, um, the kind of severe presentations.

286
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:42,780
And one of the reasons why coronaviruses sort of identified as having a lot of pandemic painted potential were a lot of those,

287
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:49,380
you know, that kind of ability to mutate and replicate very quickly because of the single stranded positive RNA genome,

288
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:53,880
but then also because there is a massive host range for coronaviruses,

289
00:35:54,150 --> 00:36:04,380
they have huge animal reservoirs and the animal reservoirs and you can have the same coronaviruses take advantage of multiple animal reservoirs.

290
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:15,090
And so those those two things put together kind of created this level of concern around SARS-CoV-2, so of our own coronaviruses in general.

291
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:20,670
So here is a can of a few things. I'm going to I'm going to walk through two examples of stars, one in mirrors,

292
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:24,150
so you can sort of see where the field left off before SARS-CoV-2 started.

293
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:31,170
So Sars-Cov-1 was a group to coronavirus is spread between 22 and 23.

294
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:40,140
The case fatality rate is reported to be up to 50% in high risk individuals, including elderly individuals.

295
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:46,380
The mortality was seen in adults only. There were 8000 cases.

296
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:49,530
There were 750 deaths total.

297
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:55,620
Now, remember, I'm going to give you these case fatality rate numbers that when you have the emergence of a severe virus,

298
00:36:55,620 --> 00:37:00,299
the case fatality rate always starts out a bit higher. And some of that is because of our ascertainment bias.

299
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:05,940
Right. We're finding severely ill people with really advanced pneumonia and trying to figure out what they have.

300
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:14,610
Those people are going to have a higher mortality rate than testing a whole city and getting a whole bunch of asymptomatic positives.

301
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:20,520
Right. So early on in a in a epidemic or a pandemic, in an outbreak, you tend to have a higher case fatality rate.

302
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:30,570
So and this is most of you world that really this huge concentration of cases that Emily Biden's black EPA.

303
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:34,230
We see everybody kind of going into that.

304
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:38,250
So this is this all happened in Hong Kong.

305
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:47,550
And if you watch a lot of what's going on in Hong Kong, both sort of politically in response wise for SARS-CoV-2,

306
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:54,600
a lot of it is directly following from the fact that they went through SARS one so that there are as one policies kind of set

307
00:37:54,600 --> 00:38:02,430
up their plan for SARS-CoV-2 to the rest of the world was working off of in the influenza based pandemic planning Hong Kong,

308
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:06,900
Hong Kong and South Korea, for reasons I'll show you in a minute.

309
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:10,170
We're working off of coronavirus pandemic planning.

310
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:15,299
So there is a famous paper, and I think it's still it's you know,

311
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:20,660
there is still a fair amount of debate about this paper that talks about what happened in the Yellow Gardens block eve.

312
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:26,010
And I wanted to walk through just the sort of interesting to think about it from a transmission perspective, and you're going to learn a new term.

313
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:34,200
But there were so you see these different apartment blocks and the number of cases are here.

314
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:38,850
You got six, seven, four, 21, 25, 20, 99 cases here.

315
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:44,490
So there seems to be this huge concentration of cases right here.

316
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:57,720
And the you know, at the time there was there's a lot of there was a lot of guy presentation of people that were sick as well,

317
00:38:57,930 --> 00:39:01,290
GI illness as well as respiratory illness in these people.

318
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:07,620
And they were finding sarwan viruses in fecal samples.

319
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:10,380
They were finding it in sewage and waste and different types.

320
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:18,570
And the thinking was that there was such a concentration of virus moving through the GI tract of residence of the

321
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:26,310
building that the the toilet system and the flushing of the toilets was creating aerosolization of the virus.

322
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:34,410
But the virus that was excreted, not virus that was airborne transmitted and that was what led to the concentration of the cases.

323
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:41,520
And if you look at this paper, they do a lot of like mapping inside the building to see what the pattern was, to try to to support that.

324
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:49,620
But then the question is, you know, they very quickly locked down this whole area and told everybody to stay in their apartments.

325
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:53,810
How did we get all of these cases, for instance, these these cases over here?

326
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:57,240
Then why do we only have six cases here? But we have 99 cases there.

327
00:39:58,590 --> 00:40:01,680
This is, by the way, you know, obviously a huge superspreading event.

328
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:08,640
And so what this paper did is they sort of modeled the wind patterns throughout that time.

329
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:17,340
Did this aerodynamic modeling of the wind patterns and how it would have traveled to these differ from in a way, from these different infected blocks.

330
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:22,499
And there's this interference in the wind from this construction site right here that caused

331
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:28,110
this dip in wind and potentially created this cluster of cases that maps to right here.

332
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:33,240
All right. So here's your new terminology. This is called this paper and this concept.

333
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:37,829
It's called the fecal plume at the so called plume,

334
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:43,830
being that there was some of virus viruses being excreted through the GI tract, then aerosolized by the sewer system,

335
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:48,209
the way the sewer system was operating and the doubling and then was able to be carried,

336
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:52,400
that viruses are carried by the air through to other other buildings.

337
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:57,000
And it's an idea that comes up a lot.

338
00:40:57,030 --> 00:41:05,130
It's it's not, you know, not a widespread you know, it's still it's still controversial.

339
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:08,399
And it's interesting to think about this.

340
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:15,240
As, you know, wastewater, there is there are sectors that once we knew as a coronavirus were like, oh, yeah, wastewater.

341
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:20,370
We already know that you can get SARS-CoV-2 detection out of fecal material.

342
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:24,660
And so looking at wastewater and so that, you know, the question is,

343
00:41:27,330 --> 00:41:32,730
does wastewater the fact that to take over wastewater for fecal material mean that it is actually a GI virus?

344
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:40,540
We now know from animal models and from, you know, human studies that it really isn't either.

345
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:45,810
There's a lot of respiratory viruses that once we get our viral load high enough, we swallow the virus.

346
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:48,780
Does it mean that there's pathogenesis happening in the GI tract?

347
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:53,700
It means that we're swallowing all of the virus from the pathogen that's happening in the upper respiratory system.

348
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,320
That is likely what was happening here as well as people were just swallowing big quantities of virus.

349
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:10,409
Just a second. I want to talk about was beers. And so this is this had a 35% fatality rate.

350
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:14,460
It's thought of cases in 27 countries.

351
00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:21,780
All of the cases have some sort of connection to the Middle East, either first or second levels of transmission.

352
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:23,940
Most cases were in Saudi Arabia.

353
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:32,430
Notice it is the Middle Eastern Respiratory Centers named after a place we don't like to name viruses after places anymore.

354
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:36,650
But this virus has not been renamed. Who knows?

355
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:40,690
I mean, they're still trying to rename monkeypox as they could have picked a name by now.

356
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:45,390
They had a contest. They had all sorts of things like that named at number three or something in a book.

357
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:50,430
So but we don't have a great history of renaming viruses or waiting for this very name.

358
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:59,130
There was some you know, there was a lot of animal reservoir to human transmission that was happening.

359
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:05,730
There were some sustain person to person transmission in very limited settings, but didn't really take off.

360
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:15,120
So we looked at it was see actually went yesterday and to make sure that my epi curves and slides were updated.

361
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:18,990
I don't think I think they stopped surveillance for a year in 2018.

362
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:22,950
So there's no new data in the last three years. I think they were like, we're busy.

363
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:28,950
So I actually have no idea what happened through the pandemic.

364
00:43:29,730 --> 00:43:32,790
So we see these various transmission patterns in their color.

365
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:35,820
This, the W.H.O. website has this and it's color coded by region,

366
00:43:36,090 --> 00:43:42,060
depending on whether it's been just an animal reservoir based transmission or whether we've seen evidence of

367
00:43:42,330 --> 00:43:48,900
humans to animal kind of interactions or we've seen human to human like limited human to human transmission here.

368
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:54,540
Now, notice the second one, the red one, the the camel and human.

369
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:56,700
Notice that euro is bidirectional.

370
00:43:57,150 --> 00:44:03,210
When we talk about animal reservoirs and we've seen this with coronaviruses, they bring this up in the papers that we read for today.

371
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:08,160
Coronaviruses can have bidirectional transmission between humans and the animal reservoir.

372
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:11,400
It's not just in animals to us. We can infect animals as well.

373
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:22,290
Reference the deer coronavirus outbreaks. It is likely some sort of human human introduction that have it that way, but we don't know for sure.

374
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:30,760
So this is what the rollout of the curve looked like for four years.

375
00:44:32,530 --> 00:44:35,889
You've got the dark blue Saudi Arabia.

376
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:42,250
The light blue are other countries. The red right here is the Republic of Korea, South Korea.

377
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:46,360
And here I'm going to show you some data actually from this outbreak.

378
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:49,720
We used to do that paper as a workshop in this class. I'm not going to do it this year.

379
00:44:50,890 --> 00:44:57,370
But notice that it really like it does not create a pandemic.

380
00:44:57,580 --> 00:44:59,620
Right. It has pretty limited spread.

381
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:07,299
So in the early days of SARS-CoV-2, a lot of people who were involved in the mirrors response in the SA's one response were watching this and saying,

382
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:08,920
well, yeah, but it eventually went away.

383
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:16,840
It doesn't these viruses, there was a belief that these viruses don't have staying power and can't do sustained human to human transmission.

384
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:20,590
Those people are now wrong. I've talked to them. They have admitted their mistakes.

385
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,909
But there was this very like, oh, okay, we've seen this before.

386
00:45:24,910 --> 00:45:27,969
And the first two pandemics didn't turn into Big Bang.

387
00:45:27,970 --> 00:45:33,190
So there you have it. So it's just kind of interesting context to sort of think about what we knew at the

388
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:38,620
time and what pieces of information carried forward and which didn't carry forward.

389
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:44,350
Right. So during these South Korea.

390
00:45:47,550 --> 00:45:53,340
Outbreak. So what happened was there was a there was a patient.

391
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:58,800
There was basically a single patient exposure. So there was a patient that traveled to South Korea.

392
00:45:58,830 --> 00:46:10,080
Patient 14, patient 14 was sick and went to the emergency room at at Samsung Medical Center to see a medical center in South Korea is like this huge,

393
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:18,480
beautiful new state of the art medical center. And they went to and they were basically you can see they've sort of mapped where they went.

394
00:46:19,530 --> 00:46:27,600
They were in they waited in the room in here. And then they waited across the down in a bed across from the nurse's station here.

395
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:32,070
And then they were moved to a second bed for some period of time.

396
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:37,770
And, you know, they actually they moved they were here in two different beds.

397
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:40,800
But you can actually see that.

398
00:46:40,810 --> 00:46:48,750
So them that these are infected patients or visitors here, you can see the different patients at different times as well.

399
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:52,910
And there were there was not kind of very close treatment.

400
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:58,110
There wasn't close contact transmission. During this, we seem to sort of see this wider range of transmission.

401
00:46:58,110 --> 00:47:03,750
Obviously, you know, this patient is here, this bed, this patient right here, you can understand that these patients would be infected.

402
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:10,649
But, you know, you've got 25 visitors that were infected, a patient's visitors in the emergency room.

403
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:19,230
They were infected. And it's this incredible Superspreading event. And we have such good data on where the movements in this hospital,

404
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:24,620
because of all of the like infection controls, the infection control and the senior author.

405
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:28,950
This is an expert in respiratory virus infection control.

406
00:47:28,950 --> 00:47:32,430
So they already had so much kind of monitoring and understanding of where people were going.

407
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:37,620
And we know that there was transmissions happening outside of close contact situations.

408
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:48,420
So interesting paper, if you want to take a look at that. But definitely evidence for kind of longer range aerosol transmission.

409
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:53,610
They also did a lot of like looking at where their air conditioners were, where their HEPA filters were, things like that.

410
00:47:56,130 --> 00:48:05,940
So that sort of ended that. That was the biggest I mean, that was the biggest coronavirus based single we understood outbreak.

411
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:13,320
That brings us to where we are today in all the information that we had was sort of based on that South Korean study.

412
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:20,400
You can understand now that, you know, so I just showed you one example from Hong Kong, one example from South Korea.

413
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:26,130
They approached things very, very differently than the rest of a lot of other places in the world when things started to happen,

414
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:33,150
because they had already done this kind of dry run of an outbreak situation.

415
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:38,730
So with that, any comments or questions?

416
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:50,370
Yeah, well, I was coordinating some sort using this problem that they don't know and I don't know that we know.

417
00:48:50,910 --> 00:48:58,860
Yeah. So the remember is that when we talked about influenza emergence,

418
00:48:58,860 --> 00:49:03,060
that there's a difference between human to human transmission and sustained human to human transmission.

419
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:07,979
Some viruses do not have its you know,

420
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:16,200
I think the the hypotheses usually revolve around things like cell receptor affinity that they

421
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:19,649
attach to the cells well enough that you can have sustained human to human transmission,

422
00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:27,930
which really means that you have transmission even when viral loads are lower or there are sort of other mitigating factors reducing the viral loads.

423
00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:32,849
In this scenario, Patient 14 had an incredibly high viral load.

424
00:49:32,850 --> 00:49:38,400
So there are some viruses that aren't great transmitters, but if you breathe in enough of it, you're going to get sick.

425
00:49:38,610 --> 00:49:44,190
So we see that with avian influenza infecting humans, we see that with sex, like with mirrors.

426
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:53,460
Coronaviruses is can be very surprising in that some people have incredibly, incredibly high viral loads.

427
00:49:55,200 --> 00:50:01,500
I mean, some of the cats we see with mirrors and with SARS-CoV-2 are just like incredibly low, which means tons and tons of virus.

428
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:05,190
So it was likely a viral load issue with this one.

429
00:50:05,370 --> 00:50:11,820
But then SARS-CoV-2 has the ability to spread out lower mammals is one of the that's one of the prevailing hypotheses.

430
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:23,140
Yeah. Just sort of policies that like with mayors, the virus sort of killed people too quickly or it isn't very high quality.

431
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:26,280
Right. Or whatever. So yes. Yes.

432
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:35,680
Or that you get sick so fast that you isolate quickly, you know, because you are symptomatic really quick.

433
00:50:38,170 --> 00:50:45,250
Yes. That is a pain. I personally I think that some of this comes from a lack of understanding of, you know,

434
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:49,300
is just like really outbreak driven understanding of coronaviruses before this.

435
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:55,810
So, you know, in the respiratory virus world, we had this understanding that there was this very long asymptomatic.

436
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:02,710
Is this the big there is this really big asymptomatic fraction for respiratory viruses that you could have asymptomatic spread?

437
00:51:03,550 --> 00:51:06,970
And I think it wasn't really recognized in these outbreak models quite the same.

438
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:09,610
And so I think it's a little bit maybe it's a little bit of both.

439
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:15,550
You know, search committee does have like unique asymptomatic patterns compared to mirrors in SARS-CoV-2, one versus one.

440
00:51:16,090 --> 00:51:19,690
But at the same time, I'm not sure that we fully understand, you know,

441
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:23,980
how much because we we were doing it in we were only surveying the really severe people.

442
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:32,060
Good point. That's. All right.

443
00:51:32,070 --> 00:51:39,540
So for the rest of the time, I'm going to have you work your way through the two papers for today.

444
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:42,920
I'm going to put up the groups on here.

445
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:49,640
And as you kind of make your way into your groups, I'm going to put on the board.

446
00:51:50,030 --> 00:51:56,960
Have you covered in AP 600? Did you cover the Bradford Hill criteria from the sixties?

447
00:51:57,230 --> 00:52:04,100
Okay. So it's trying to think about how how what how can we structure our thinking in terms of do we think,

448
00:52:04,370 --> 00:52:06,860
you know, do we think this hypothesis is plausible?

449
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:21,590
And so Bradford Hill was a person that I think is like 19, 1965, Sir Austin Bradford, who published nine criteria to use to decide.

450
00:52:21,710 --> 00:52:25,010
I think four is a framework to think through whether an exposure causes an outcome.

451
00:52:26,090 --> 00:52:31,520
I'm going to write them on the board and I'm going to kind of talk through them quickly while you get into your groups.

452
00:52:32,330 --> 00:52:39,320
But first, does everybody see their groups on canvas or do you want me to put them up on the screen?

453
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:45,970
Okay. Marginalized groups.

454
00:52:53,030 --> 00:53:00,590
So if I can get them all in here at once, and then you should be able to submit your answers as a group.

455
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:11,130
If I didn't, if I set up the technology correctly, we'll see. Okay.

456
00:53:13,170 --> 00:53:19,379
All right, here are half of the groups. And then I will I mean, I can kind of scroll in a second.

457
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:25,230
I'll scroll the second half of the groups. So go ahead and start recording. All right.

458
00:53:25,530 --> 00:53:29,610
While you're getting organized, just kind of listen in.

459
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:33,510
Okay. Ready to for me to scroll. All right.

460
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:38,640
If I get to the second half and you're still not on the second half right now, because I think it's gone horribly wrong.

461
00:53:38,990 --> 00:53:47,260
I know. Go back to the first half of the second half.

462
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:53,020
People that are sitting in on the class, you can choose any group from the creative writing class.

463
00:53:54,190 --> 00:54:01,360
I don't think I've seen that on film yet.

464
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:24,070
Jack. Yes, we have. Now.

465
00:54:27,810 --> 00:54:35,970
Yeah. I go back there and.

466
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:50,700
Yeah. I don't know.

467
00:54:50,910 --> 00:55:03,900
I'm just here to you on the side and not elements in any of the groups.

468
00:55:03,930 --> 00:55:07,230
Okay. Let's see what happens.

469
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:11,090
Well, just pick a group for now. Okay.

470
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:20,730
And then let me turn this off of the screen. I guess let's make sure you're on my main roster.

471
00:55:22,350 --> 00:55:26,050
I'm sure she.

472
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:38,700
Yeah. Next year. Yeah. I want to say that.

473
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:43,550
Oh. Right.

474
00:55:45,810 --> 00:55:58,200
Well, I guess, you know, I think you know, I think that this is this is really okay.

475
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:05,950
There was I think still I think these.

476
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:17,540
Yeah. So go ahead and work with your house or you can split up and each join a group and make a group of three group for you.

477
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:20,890
It's your it's your choice. If you want to work as a pair. If you want to put.

478
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,959
All right. So I'm looking at the time.

479
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:37,520
If we know if you don't feel like we've gotten through these papers, we may be able to do a little bit of discussion on Monday as well.

480
00:56:37,910 --> 00:56:43,760
So these papers have two big questions.

481
00:56:44,330 --> 00:56:52,400
This week, did the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 happen at the Hunan wet market?

482
00:56:52,850 --> 00:57:01,310
That's the big question of this paper, yes or no? This paper question number two is,

483
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:13,460
were there actually multiple coincident emergencies of the SARS-CoV-2 virus from the animal reservoir to the human population?

484
00:57:13,790 --> 00:57:19,400
And so there are two circulating lineages per person who have been identified.

485
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:24,320
And remember when we have remember the Zika virus paper with the different difference.

486
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:27,740
Think about this very much the same way your actions are.

487
00:57:27,770 --> 00:57:35,600
You've got an animal draw that. Yeah.

488
00:57:36,670 --> 00:57:40,160
Okay. So you have an animal.

489
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:44,120
The animal can produce and don't answer to I pangolin.

490
00:57:45,770 --> 00:57:54,410
So if you have a very bad day, go to the building and go to unit.

491
00:57:56,420 --> 00:58:02,300
Or you can have a go from the animal to B to A to man.

492
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:10,610
Or you can have the animal produces a which goes to the human.

493
00:58:13,430 --> 00:58:22,790
B which goes to the human. For either of these situations to be true, the basis of the molecular clock needs to match the timing.

494
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:31,940
And so that's what this paper is about. So is there evidence for two separate introductions or two microclimates, the timing?

495
00:58:32,630 --> 00:58:36,140
Why is this important? Because micro clocks take time.

496
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:39,080
Kind of like the Zika virus paper. This takes time.

497
00:58:39,110 --> 00:58:49,880
So if this happens or it happened in humans in a way that like human days turned into a bee infecting a human,

498
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:54,590
that means that there's a very long period of cryptic transmission that happens.

499
00:58:54,720 --> 00:59:03,020
It means that it's been circulating for a very long time to get for this to these two lineages to develop within the human population.

500
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:14,029
Does that make sense? So the so the hypothesis they're really working under is do you have co circulation of A and B in the animal reservoir?

501
00:59:14,030 --> 00:59:20,060
See if that's a very definite. Okay.

502
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:29,270
So keep that in mind when you were doing this paper as well for to structure your thinking as you go through this.

503
00:59:29,270 --> 00:59:35,060
And really, I think we're going to like we're going to start today and we may finish up on Monday as well.

504
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:40,100
But I'm going to talk through a few of the key principles of the health criteria.

505
00:59:41,180 --> 00:59:45,350
So one is strength of association.

506
00:59:48,790 --> 00:59:52,420
So how strong is how strong is the effective measure?

507
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:59,560
Basically, the association setting criteria is consistency of the association.

508
00:59:59,650 --> 01:00:07,620
Does it apply as you to different settings? Three.

509
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:15,950
Specificity of the association. Do you not see if you go to something that should not be following with your hypothesis?

510
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:19,640
Do you not see evidence of the relationship?

511
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:26,110
Four. And we just talked about this with Phoebe Temporality.

512
01:00:32,330 --> 01:00:36,050
Five biological gradients. This is dose response.

513
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:47,299
Which is it's kind of you think about this is a very like pathogen toxin type of way of thinking,

514
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:51,680
but all exposure is you can think about a dose response as more of the exposure leading to

515
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:57,320
more of the outcome or a higher rate or a higher frequency of occurrence of the outcome.

516
01:00:59,630 --> 01:01:13,840
Six Plausibility. Seven Coherence is a little bit like doesn't make sense.

517
01:01:14,230 --> 01:01:25,030
Then the accumulation of the evidence all kind of align. There's an experimental piece which we are obviously not going to have evidence on.

518
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:30,640
So, you know, if you put a whole bunch of virus in the human market, doesn't really get infected.

519
01:01:31,930 --> 01:01:36,330
And then the analogy is similar. You know, a similar situation happened in different ways.

520
01:01:36,340 --> 01:01:44,350
This was sort of a caveat that was like, you know, does a related pathogen act similarly your standard of evidence changes?

521
01:01:44,590 --> 01:01:51,340
So these, you know, coherence experimental in analogy, this is sort of less of a focus for today.

522
01:01:52,210 --> 01:01:55,930
They're going to focus on these ones in your in your your conversations.

523
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:03,960
So you can kind of use that if you're struggling with sort of how to synthesize the arguments in the paper,

524
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:11,100
try to back them up like this has this show specificity that shows temporality and it shows consistent figures for each.

525
01:02:12,830 --> 01:02:16,340
Sound good? All right. Go ahead. Start discussing the facts.

526
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:27,830
We're going to discuss more on Monday as well. So maybe focus on the market figure first from the speaker first.

527
01:02:30,670 --> 01:02:37,780
Is there an opportunity for behavior that you recognize any favors and at the same time that.

528
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:54,110
Know. So the questions for this party request those questions are you did.

529
01:02:54,740 --> 01:02:59,930
The question is did the outbreak start at the Hunan supermarket yesterday?

530
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:03,530
What is based on this figure?

531
01:03:04,220 --> 01:03:08,200
Thinking about these then, do you believe this paper?

532
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:12,880
Yes or no? Yeah. Why don't you get through that?

533
01:03:12,890 --> 01:03:15,980
We're going to say, do you believe this paper? This paper is a lot more technical.

534
01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:22,490
I'm not going to expect you to, like, understand. So there's some there's some issues with flexible clock and reversions in these

535
01:03:22,490 --> 01:03:26,150
different proposed pathways in this paper from that and expect you to understand that.

536
01:03:27,410 --> 01:03:30,530
But yes. So were there multiple introductions?

537
01:03:30,650 --> 01:03:34,990
Yes or no? Sorry, I should have written a question.

538
01:03:35,970 --> 01:03:38,110
Oh, we have some numbers.

539
01:03:39,380 --> 01:03:45,980
I'm going to I'm going to extend the I mean, I extend the date because it took a little longer in the beginning of the expressway.

540
01:03:45,990 --> 01:04:02,540
So I'd said that we may work on it more on Monday. So especially because you're just getting to know each other even.

541
01:04:11,610 --> 01:04:33,790
I am. You're very much looking for the no indications from this environment that you're going to be able to have the traps so far as we can see them.

542
01:04:34,130 --> 01:04:41,200
And it looks like it's going to be just.

543
01:04:56,590 --> 01:05:16,270
Yeah. You know, I guess I just I think, I mean, I think that's part of it.

544
01:05:18,430 --> 01:05:22,900
And you guys are right, but I don't really, really know.

545
01:05:24,100 --> 01:05:36,110
Yeah, there is definitely compromise with the amount of data, I think.

546
01:05:42,620 --> 01:05:48,330
There was an individual, a secretary.

547
01:05:55,520 --> 01:06:01,840
But I just. Even strategy disappearing is.

548
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:14,300
Yeah. That's a fair observation. I've done some.

549
01:06:17,030 --> 01:06:26,980
Mean. Yeah.

550
01:06:27,430 --> 01:06:33,990
Yeah, well, I think. Very.

551
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:39,870
Yes. You know, he didn't like these things. Yeah.

552
01:06:40,190 --> 01:06:54,470
Because, like. I think maybe there is speculation that that originated in other markets.

553
01:06:54,770 --> 01:07:22,770
I mean, the thing that I heard at the beginning of the year, I'm not sure this is a library or something that I was.

554
01:07:27,970 --> 01:07:33,700
Yes. Right from. Yeah, I think I.

555
01:07:38,820 --> 01:07:45,290
You know, the Associated Press. I know. I know there's a business and what they do here in the city.

556
01:07:46,230 --> 01:07:49,480
And they are. You.

557
01:07:54,590 --> 01:07:57,840
Know. Know. I know.

558
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:34,159
I know. And so I believe that Facebook and various companies are encouraged to feel like these are

559
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:48,490
things that would be largely undervalued and that the have not done a lot of things like this.

560
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:56,630
And, you know, a lot of people who.

561
01:09:00,060 --> 01:09:20,730
That would be great. I was like, Yeah, there's nothing I can do about it.

562
01:09:25,380 --> 01:09:32,700
So you think of like recommendations?

563
01:09:33,070 --> 01:09:45,960
No. I mean, I think there are some things that.

564
01:09:47,300 --> 01:09:54,690
I like. Yeah.

565
01:09:58,620 --> 01:10:18,170
Yeah. You know, you've heard about those things over the years and they probably.

566
01:10:29,670 --> 01:10:38,530
I've got three figures. Yeah.

567
01:10:39,610 --> 01:11:02,550
Yeah. I mean, if you are I mean, I think that's a pretty good.

568
01:11:09,110 --> 01:11:16,300
I'm happy for you.

569
01:11:19,820 --> 01:11:43,370
I think that there were other instances where, you know, you're not going to because you were.

570
01:11:51,310 --> 01:12:01,790
Yes, Amy. With your hard work and.

571
01:12:05,810 --> 01:12:15,310
Would you like? That's exactly what happens.

572
01:12:17,410 --> 01:12:28,300
Yeah, that's true. Yes. I can't believe that the markets shut down like always.

573
01:12:28,780 --> 01:12:38,470
Yeah, I think I was struck with a very funny, you know.

574
01:12:39,170 --> 01:12:47,470
Yeah. Yes. It was very, very bad.

575
01:12:47,510 --> 01:13:13,820
But right now I'm thankful for something like that.

576
01:13:14,670 --> 01:13:21,220
When I was growing up, you know, morality together.

577
01:13:21,740 --> 01:13:40,060
Forget. And I know that there are people that have like, oh, yeah, there are like all of these things that,

578
01:13:40,790 --> 01:13:52,430
you know, there are always like, I don't know, I just love the opinion.

579
01:13:53,250 --> 01:13:56,590
Yeah, there's nothing like that in my.

580
01:13:58,750 --> 01:14:10,860
It was like a child who had a hearing that. I think he might be stronger.

581
01:14:10,970 --> 01:14:15,780
And China? No, like this.

582
01:14:17,140 --> 01:14:27,600
But that's how you react to something like how that training and everything like anything else.

583
01:14:27,610 --> 01:14:35,900
I mean, yeah, maybe I'm like, Yeah, girl, but I'm not sure.

584
01:14:36,030 --> 01:14:45,570
I mean, I think before. So they're going to do something right.

585
01:14:45,780 --> 01:14:48,780
You know, so you do a lot of that. Yeah. Yeah. Right.

586
01:14:49,890 --> 01:15:05,760
So I'm very happy for the fact that you're going to have something that happens in their household in general.

587
01:15:09,510 --> 01:15:20,310
And they have this idea that they were having some kind of security for the body construction.

588
01:15:20,670 --> 01:15:32,950
And I think that also I think what that but the reason I was not doing that was complete.

589
01:15:33,060 --> 01:15:46,090
But I tell you. For better understanding of what I think.

590
01:15:46,100 --> 01:15:54,890
What I said was. I think. It doesn't hurt and it's not like that.

591
01:15:54,900 --> 01:15:59,820
But because you don't know.

592
01:16:00,150 --> 01:16:18,440
Right. And you know, you've really got to do something. Oh, yeah.

593
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:28,470
Yeah, he brought me. I hope you better.

594
01:16:32,250 --> 01:16:37,770
All right. We're at the end of our time. Go ahead and start wrapping up and we can pick it back up on Monday.

595
01:16:40,990 --> 01:16:46,800
So I think that nobody started in Twitter arguments over the weekend, but.

596
01:16:49,980 --> 01:17:00,100
No. I think that this particular think that.

597
01:17:14,140 --> 01:17:26,640
I began with finding a way for her.

598
01:17:28,290 --> 01:17:30,320
So what do you.
