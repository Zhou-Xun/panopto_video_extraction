1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:06,479
I'm going to start recording now. How is everybody's winter break or not?

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,810
Winter? Oh, it feels like winter, right? It's snowing yesterday.

3
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,850
Do you have a good break? I'm good.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:25,750
So? So, yeah. I really didn't feel like it was any different than any other other time, just because I said it's such a busy time of year.

5
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:29,190
But hopefully you got to do a little bit of relaxation.

6
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,610
So today we have four people giving lightning talks.

7
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:45,990
And so that's all that's on today's schedule. Just just so you know, in the module for today, I put the pure evaluation form.

8
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:52,830
And again, I also just wanted to briefly highlight this article on minimizing language.

9
00:00:54,060 --> 00:01:01,230
This is something that every single person probably does to some extent some of the time.

10
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:07,170
And I think it's just important if you if you look this over this article over

11
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:12,239
and think about the ways in which you use minimizing language in your emails,

12
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,080
in your communications, when you're talking to somebody, when you're giving a talk,

13
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:20,819
it's kind of a nice way to just bring bring that to your attention.

14
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:26,700
And that's there, you know, try and find some ways to minimize minimizing language.

15
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:35,220
One of the things that they talk about in here is if I can pop it up really quickly,

16
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:43,920
using using the words just or I feel, you know, like if you're if you're talking to somebody and you say,

17
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:50,070
I would just like to say that I may not know some as much as some of the communication experts out there,

18
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:53,640
but I feel that people undermine their credibility from time to time.

19
00:01:54,900 --> 00:02:02,340
This is geared towards this is geared towards women because women and some research has shown that

20
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:07,890
women and people from underrepresented to other underrepresented groups tend to do this more often.

21
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:12,680
But it happens to all of us. We all do this from time to time.

22
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:20,940
And so just try and catch yourself. If you if you find yourself writing an email and you say, I just want to check in and see this X,

23
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,419
Y and Z, take out the just and see what the email looks like.

24
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:33,330
You'll find that it doesn't really adding that just in there really doesn't add anything and it kind of minimizes your message a lot of the time.

25
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:41,280
The other thing I wanted to mention was also there's there's some really good examples in here,

26
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,160
but one of the things they don't talk about are things like using upspeak when you give a presentation.

27
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:53,860
So if you enter and end every sentence with a question at your at the end of your presentation.

28
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:57,330
So we saw this in ourselves when we did.

29
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:05,190
We had a chemical sort of sounds like, but I'm not sure if I'm I don't really know what I'm talking about.

30
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:13,800
So these are just the types of things to to think about when you're when you're, you know, writing, doing any sort of communication, really.

31
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:18,480
So I'll let you read that if you want to on your own time.

32
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:24,450
But in the interest of time, I will stop talking now and we'll go ahead and go with the lightning talks.

33
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:33,479
So this order is not in any you know, I don't care who goes first or second or third.

34
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:46,500
Fourth, does anybody have any preferences? You go first. Okay. So I have so I have we have Chloe on upon Maggie and Velma here.

35
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:50,160
And so everybody is is already pulled up.

36
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:57,719
And the evaluations I shared on email and there's also a link on the canvas page please.

37
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:07,980
If you can turn those in by like Tuesday at the very latest, then I can share the Google drive with those comments with each of the speakers.

38
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:16,380
So and I'll do the same thing as we did a couple of weeks ago where I'll raise my hand and get you about a minute left.

39
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:22,049
I'll turn it over to me. All right. Hi, everyone.

40
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:26,160
My name's Maggie Robotnik. I'm a second year Ph.D. student in toxicology.

41
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:30,960
I'm going to talk a little about what my research is and basically the first part of my in my dissertation today.

42
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:35,280
So it's titled Altered Lipid Metabolism and a mechanistic understanding of Per and

43
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,620
polyfluoroalkyl substances and their induction and adverse pregnancy related health effects.

44
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:46,570
So I'm talking about what, Professor, some of you have heard of it, how well most of you have, but there a class of men,

45
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:52,590
manmade surfactant chemicals that can be up to 9000 varieties of these chemicals currently in use.

46
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:59,460
They're characterized by linear or branched carbon chains. So instead of your typical carbon with hydrogens, you actually have for years there.

47
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:07,100
They're used primarily because they have hydrophobic and lipophilic properties which make them really ideal for water stain repellents.

48
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:13,670
So you'll find them in things like nonstick cookware, aqueous film forming foams, which are firefighting foams,

49
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:19,310
water resistant clothing, even food and drink containers as well as products that would have like stain resistant treatment to them.

50
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:25,940
And they were originally manufactured in the 1940s and fifties and commonly go by the name of Teflon, which is manufactured by DuPont.

51
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:31,549
So we actually have a substantial amount of epidemiological evidence so far that there is

52
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:36,680
developmental reproductive effects associated with some of the long term legacy PAFS,

53
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:41,840
which are PFOA and PFOS, which I will be talking about throughout this presentation.

54
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:47,510
And we're interested because we know that they transfer through a placenta to a fetus.

55
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:55,460
And so we've also observed these major health effects associated with pregnancy, which include low birth weight, preterm birth pre-eclampsia,

56
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:02,390
delayed puberty in the child after in-utero exposure, as well as ADHD and immune response suppression in children who were exposed in utero.

57
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:04,519
And so we're really wondering what's going on here.

58
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:09,440
Like, why are we observing these health effects and what could explain the development of these pathologies?

59
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:14,629
So this is how we started thinking about how we were going to approach this question so fast,

60
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:19,700
which are the ones that you see on your left are really similar to fatty acid structures.

61
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:26,280
They have really similar chain length. And as you see, the really major difference here is the fact that the hydrogens have been swapped for NS,

62
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,860
which actually makes them really, really stable.

63
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:33,500
So the fact that they look like fatty acids may just made us question like could they be acting like fatty acids?

64
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:38,270
So that led us to M one, which was looking at the Michigan mother infant Purple Heart,

65
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:42,230
which is a small core of women that had births here at Michigan Spangler Hospital.

66
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:47,690
What we did is we tested p fast in maternal blood at the very beginning of their pregnancy in first trimester.

67
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:51,319
And then we measured it again and not p fast,

68
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:58,280
but we measured lipid profiles scuse me in first trimester plasma and in at term delivery and then in the cord blood of the infants.

69
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:02,600
And what we're looking for is how these lipids might have changed throughout pregnancy and

70
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,780
how that might be associated with the amount of P force that they had in their blood.

71
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:12,020
So I'm going to show you the most notable finding, because the other ones were not as kind of shiny and sparkly.

72
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:17,240
So this one was PFA access, which is the Hexa No IC version of PBS.

73
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:23,149
And this one in first trimester blood was actually associated with an upregulation of single myelin,

74
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:28,700
which is one specific class of lipids to a degree that we didn't really expect given our small sample size.

75
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,930
We also saw an inverse association or decreased ISO glycerol with M1 and PFA access, which was kind of interesting.

76
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:39,940
Again, not really unexpected finding given our small sample size, but here we are.

77
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:44,660
There was a Q value of less than 0.1, which is after correction. There was still really strong significance there.

78
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:49,040
So why do we care? What does it matter that there is these altered lipid concentrations?

79
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,850
So it turns out that plasma single lipids, especially single islands,

80
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:57,350
are known to be associated with vascular injury in endothelial cellular membranes.

81
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:01,820
And I actually might point to a potential pathology related to pre-eclampsia.

82
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:08,629
Now, none of these women had pre-eclampsia, but it's kind of pointing to maybe early clinical biomarker that there actually might have been some

83
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:12,860
women who would have eventually developed preeclampsia or just had some to incorporate cramps here.

84
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:18,560
And there's a bunch of evidence kind of noted here as to how that might be related to the signal maintenance being increased.

85
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:26,690
So future directions of my study involve looking at how exactly this might be occurring, what's the mechanism of action here?

86
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:34,579
And so my future aims are actually looking at what might be important notification of alteration in lipid metabolism,

87
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,710
which is the activation of pepper, alpha and gamma.

88
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:43,999
There are also like known studies out there that talk about activation of people are alpha and gamma with pufas already.

89
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,500
So that is one interested mechanism that we're looking at in placental cell models.

90
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:54,740
So two different placental. So models. We're also going to look at lipid peroxidation and other markers that might relate to unhealthy oil damage.

91
00:08:55,130 --> 00:09:00,920
And also my third aim is going to look at how P fast might be associated with alterations in lipid metabolism in the cell model,

92
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:06,049
comparing that back to what we see in the maternal blood. So thank you so much.

93
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:16,890
I'll take any questions. 2 minutes for questions.

94
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:32,069
What is pre-eclampsia? That's a good question. So pre-eclampsia is a clinical definition of women who have been diagnosed after

95
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:36,570
20 weeks of gestation with hypertension and proteinuria or protein in the urine.

96
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:45,030
It's a very, very specific clinical indication. We don't diagnose that earlier than 20 weeks because we don't really think that changes

97
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:49,510
in the blood pressure are related to adverse pregnancy outcomes like pre-eclampsia.

98
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:56,820
But pre-eclampsia is a very, very serious diagnosis once you do get diagnosed with it and you end up with potentially uncontrollable hypertension.

99
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:02,370
The outcomes tend to be either like early term delivery, like they'll do a C-section very early on.

100
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,010
And it's also highly related to eclampsia, which happens if you get if your preeclampsia is uncontrolled,

101
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,720
which is which what causes an uncontrollable seizure like activity in the mother?

102
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,980
And that actually at that point has a 50% mortality rate for the for the woman.

103
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:21,180
So we actually have a pretty high rate of pre-eclampsia still in the United States,

104
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:24,540
and it's something that we don't quite understand the pathology about.

105
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:28,440
So hence the understanding, the mechanism here with environmental exposure.

106
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:37,710
You might have mentioned this, but which peppers are you interested in, and are you interested in any of the newer alternatives like genetics?

107
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:45,120
Yeah. So we definitely are going to look at the data associated with the existing like long term P FAS,

108
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,200
which are PFOA, PFOA s because I saw significance with H access.

109
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:58,200
I am adding that to my future aims. I did want to choose like Gen X or potentially like a fluoro telomere polymerase version of P fast.

110
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:03,269
Those are actually really hard to get. And so I'm I think it would make more sense,

111
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:10,350
especially given what we know about the distribution of P fast that exist in like people's blood just in Michigan or in the country.

112
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:16,769
It's actually is a mixture, which is what I'm going to do for my third part is PFOA and PFOS and PFOA excess

113
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:19,990
and a mixture that's representative of what we see in Michigan projections.

114
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:32,720
Yeah. Yeah. So there was a paper that came out that looked at this person last year and it was like any kind of stuff.

115
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:44,330
They separated from their parent and said that because they were going to be perfectly honest, I didn't listen to you looking at the I haven't quite.

116
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:50,390
So the models that I'm using are actually targeted more to early indications of pre-eclampsia

117
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:56,570
because the cells are involved in the invasion process from the fetal and maternal side in the very,

118
00:11:56,570 --> 00:12:01,129
very early stages of pregnancy. And I think it's tricky because we have such a stringent,

119
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:07,130
like clinical definition of pre-eclampsia that the early manifestation of it is just not well identified or studied.

120
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:12,530
But a previous postdoctoral fellow and previous doctoral student, Owen Elkin,

121
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:19,010
did a lot of work on using these two cell models as indications of early signs of pre-eclampsia.

122
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:27,469
So, yeah. Mm hmm. Yeah. So you said that you found significant with p features as I'm sorry if I missed this,

123
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:33,500
if you put it in there, but did you look at the acidic homolog 56 as well?

124
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:40,130
That was actually. Yeah. Thanks for that question. Yeah, it was actually not measured as detected in our sample.

125
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:45,240
So we did have a four I'm sorry, nine different measured p values.

126
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:49,909
P.F. H was not one of them. It was measured below the limit of detection.

127
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:54,379
And then we ended up only having seven that we ended up doing analysis on because two of

128
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:58,520
those nine didn't even have a significant amount of detections in the sample either.

129
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:04,650
Interesting. Thank you.

130
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:10,470
Yep. What makes Jackson those four qualified he spoke of so difficult to get?

131
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:18,710
So my best guess this is my opinion is that because they're there now, the currently used version of us,

132
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,230
the manufacturers don't want us getting our hands on them to test them in the first place.

133
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:28,410
They are more expensive and they don't want us to know what the health effects are of the currently used version of us.

134
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:32,160
That's my best guess. But yeah, they don't disclose prices online.

135
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:35,969
They're usually out of stock, they're on back order.

136
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:41,250
And so it's like, I don't know what we have to do in order to twist their arms into letting us study it.

137
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:44,370
But we're slowly getting getting the ability to see them in.

138
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:48,449
There are more more research, more research going around about the polymerase versions.

139
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:56,730
It's just slow going. And the evidence right now suggests that those polymerase versions break down into these known versions of PASS anyways.

140
00:13:57,390 --> 00:14:03,970
So yeah, good question. Cool.

141
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:26,510
Thank. You know, next year, we'll give you one word.

142
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:32,230
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

143
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:41,780
That's interesting to me.

144
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:46,270
Your time. Yeah. Okay. Hello, everybody.

145
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:51,589
I am unemployed. And today I'm going to talk about occupational hazard identification and risk

146
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:56,990
assessment for academic research researcher and student at the University of Michigan.

147
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:02,810
This one is my potential research topic for my study.

148
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:12,370
I would start with the why. I want to. Why has that need to be identified?

149
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:21,760
These figures used to be called a safety pyramid where the base is the unsafe actions and has that list here on staff.

150
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:26,709
If we found a ten thousands case of I mean,

151
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:32,590
if we found ten thousands of unsafe action or has that it can lead to a thousands of Miami's

152
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:40,569
and a thousands of near that may lead to the first Ave injury 130 and 100 officers eventually

153
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:50,320
may lead to the accident but that you have to last time and these ten case of injury may lead

154
00:15:50,320 --> 00:16:01,800
to one serious injury on that is different ratio of pyramid represented difference severely.

155
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:11,500
I want to identify the hazard which is undocumented, which is the base of this pyramid.

156
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:18,250
And by item there is that in the researcher because the researcher can be exposed to physical has that

157
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:27,610
all logical has that in chemical has has another hazard which is important because they call it hazards.

158
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,660
For example, it is stress from your birth place.

159
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:43,200
Currently there are 83% of the U.S. workers suffer from Berkeley Industries and that 1 million of us work their

160
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:51,500
absence from work each day and treat both of them reporting that workplace is worse than their personal relationship.

161
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:56,710
That's why stress is important to be investigated.

162
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:08,159
I have no current information about a number of researcher in this year, but in 2013 there were 7.8 million fatalities.

163
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:14,309
The share whereby and it tend to increase every year despite a large number of

164
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:18,510
this workforce that health and safety have never been adequately addressed.

165
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:30,870
So I'm interested and in doing this, I try to combine all of my proteins here, put it into a single slide so it's easy for you to follow up.

166
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:43,050
So we have to take it properly. I mean, the population is you and researcher and the number that I can find that there are 18,004 hundred.

167
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:52,980
And I use the power calculation, which is the method that we use to find a number of target sample size, which is 377.

168
00:17:53,220 --> 00:18:03,180
And this is the minimum number of the participant I need to include in my study to be a representative of the human researcher.

169
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:08,249
So I have to aim of my study. The first one is to investigate health and safety,

170
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:15,060
including stress of the researcher and how can we and so equation I want to conduct ourselves through Quranic

171
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:21,870
websites and the type of patient you'll be open and close in questions because we want to get more information,

172
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,760
more detail about what we are exposed to.

173
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:29,310
And the equation consists of the current and past.

174
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:40,470
They all report exposure, also related morbidity, demographic, lifetime and perceived stress using the perceived stress scale.

175
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:48,719
And another one is the occupational health and safety perspective you're seeing the work safety skill for and

176
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:58,950
abuses are running out of money that the instrument that used to investigate stress and safety respectively.

177
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:07,200
For the new item that I developed, I will will be validated through the method called Expert Review Airport.

178
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:17,430
And then a new pretest just there will be a by using volunteer to give me feedback

179
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:22,559
and then I will distribute a survey through an email and I plan to follow

180
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:32,610
up periodically and then I will collect the data for the aim to I want to conduct a risk assessment and also prioritize the risk for the first step.

181
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:38,159
I built this, this and will use the data from the Environ first.

182
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,240
Have you ever defined a hazard that we can get the results from the survey?

183
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,920
And the second step is to conduct the hazard characterization.

184
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:50,130
This step is to review the adverse health effects.

185
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:54,240
And the third one is important. It is the exposure assessment.

186
00:19:54,840 --> 00:20:00,360
It is not only required the information about frequency and duration of exposure,

187
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:06,000
but we also want to know the magnitude of the dose that they're exposed to.

188
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:09,570
But since I conduct myself bear it is difficult.

189
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:17,430
I mean, if it is challenging to to know what how concentration that they are exposed to.

190
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:24,590
So I found another paper that they talk about how can be know the magnitude but by using the survey

191
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:32,340
we use the become expert just mean of something but I have to learn about this how to do this.

192
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:39,900
And the last one is the risk characterizations after we done all of four states have obtained the risk from

193
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:50,220
low and very high area and history of Bellevue be given the recommendation about how to prevent those hazard.

194
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:59,280
And the last one I want to compare to a health and safety perspective between professional researcher and student for professional

195
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:12,180
researcher mean the faculty staff on the research staff in the in this department compared to the student like ours like graduate student.

196
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:22,739
I do use the W essays report. I mean w if so, where this will be imposed, they will ask about a safety coworker,

197
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:27,479
safety supervisor, safety management, safety practice and safety program.

198
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:32,880
And then I will analyze and get in at that and have you compare the score between.

199
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:42,800
Official researcher and student. This work is very helpful for all of you as the researcher because you,

200
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:48,350
after the finding of this study, will allow you to understand what are you exposed to?

201
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:55,100
What and how? How can you avoid to expose to that?

202
00:21:55,700 --> 00:22:04,970
And this fighting also can be used as the data to develop the safety guideline for the researchers in the in the future.

203
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:23,550
Thank you. And. And so since you've been studying research, does how do you define who qualifies for anything in your study?

204
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:34,980
It's just people who will often laugh. Oh, at the first time I had a first interesting thought a female researcher.

205
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:39,780
But I think it would be better if we can investigate.

206
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:50,850
I mean, if we can still be on our researcher, because everybody have I think they've been exposed to the difference.

207
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:54,679
How's that? So I've been the researcher in this case.

208
00:22:54,680 --> 00:23:04,760
I de. But few researchers and at least those here in the laboratory can have them.

209
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:16,180
And also because this is a survey, how do you plan on validating the recipes that you did to make sure what you are getting is correct?

210
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:30,580
Okay. First, I, I think that the better that we can validate this so we first we have to expert leave your effort to validate our so.

211
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:39,970
The second we have the pretest by volunteer and then we also have, I think, a plan to have double cross equations,

212
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:46,750
for example, to, to, to check if they answered correctly, you know, is the way to validate this.

213
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:52,620
So. Vacations.

214
00:23:56,670 --> 00:24:10,490
No. How do you think that the university will use the results of your research?

215
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:16,790
I think I expect to. I think that they will use my back.

216
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:22,100
I think it's very helpful if they use that information here because I try to find

217
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:31,070
the interrelate on the accident report in our university if I couldn't find them.

218
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:36,650
But I think it's very beneficial for the university.

219
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:47,660
Go on. Just my personal experience, going through graduate school and post-doc and everything at the university.

220
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:53,710
I know there are a lot of very stressed out. People affect your judgment in your ability to deliver.

221
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:59,760
To do your work. So. I. I guess I would wonder.

222
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,329
Like, so within the scope of this house alone,

223
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:12,210
there's a lot of difference in like the age of the equipment that people are using and how that might affect the risk of for yourself potentially.

224
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:21,980
Examples like between the stage two and on the sixth floor and at stage two on the seventh floor or stage on seventh floor,

225
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:23,069
just like all of your blood,

226
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:29,970
you put that in of the space so different that I can see someone them so much more easily if they're using old or damaged equipment.

227
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:37,530
Is that like the question you're putting off also asking what are you working with that might increase your risk of injury?

228
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:50,010
I am trying to investigate all pay off risk maybe from the dangerous environment like that broke down or if it may not to.

229
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:54,030
And also from the behavior from the lab, the researcher.

230
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:20,770
Was a time. Well.

231
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:29,560
With her last day of class. Okay.

232
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:34,270
You want me to just act out of this? Yeah, that's right.

233
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:50,500
I'm Chloe Wilkinson, and my master's thesis project is on the oral health related quality of life among health tribe adolescents.

234
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:55,900
So I first will just go over the quick timeline of my research.

235
00:26:55,900 --> 00:27:04,750
So this past January, I was paired with my faculty advisor, Dr. Brozak, and started brainstorming what I wanted to do for my project,

236
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:11,550
and then February to March as applying for research funding and made it June applied for IRP approval.

237
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:19,330
And then July is when I went to Thailand to collect the data, and now I'm just in the process of inputting the data and analyzing it.

238
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:26,319
So when I was paired with Dr. Rose actually connected me with me a follow on university

239
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:31,480
in northern Thailand with their Center of excellence for the Hill Tribe Health Research.

240
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:38,710
And I was super excited about this opportunity to do global research, but I wasn't really sure what the project would be.

241
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:45,090
And you might be wondering what the Hill Tribes are their ethnic minority groups that migrated from China,

242
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:49,599
Myanmar and Laos and settled in the northern mountainous regions of Thailand.

243
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:56,680
So where those arrows are pointing, that's where the villages are primarily located, and that's where I did most of my work.

244
00:27:57,790 --> 00:28:00,759
So when I was exploring my interests, I have many passions.

245
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:07,240
I'm interested in environmental health, global studies, mental wellbeing, rural health and dentistry.

246
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:12,520
So I was really like confused. How should I intersect all of these passions into one thesis project?

247
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:17,350
But thankfully I came across this concept the oral health related quality of life,

248
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:25,630
and this refers to the extent that oral diseases negatively impacts one's being their quality of life and aspects of their everyday life.

249
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:33,610
And it really encompasses that oral disease affects like critical functions like eating, swallowing,

250
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:38,770
talking, but it also has impacts on your mental well-being and how you interact with others.

251
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:43,600
Because if you have oral diseases, it might lower your self-esteem and your confidence.

252
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:51,850
So it's important to understand that oral diseases not only impacts your physical health, but also your mental health and other aspects.

253
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:58,780
So I connected with various experts in the field at U of M and also across the world,

254
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:04,210
and they taught me more about this concept and the right way to measure it.

255
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:11,890
And after a literature review, I found that there are many gaps in knowledge for rural oral health in Thailand,

256
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:16,480
and especially how oral disease plays into one's mental well-being as well.

257
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:26,860
So my aims for working with the whole tribe adolescents in the province of Chiang Rai were to measure their oral health related quality of life,

258
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:33,490
examine how oral and mental health outcomes are impacted by various environmental factors,

259
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,700
and understand the challenges of dental health care in rural areas like the whole tribe communities.

260
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:49,600
So going back to the time line, I applied for and submitted applications for grants to do this international research

261
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:55,240
and also had to apply to the U of M IAB and also the Thailand Ethics Review Committee.

262
00:29:57,430 --> 00:30:02,770
And then I went to Thailand in July and I did survey research.

263
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:12,249
So the various people I talked to that were experts in the field showed or told me about the Child Perceptions questionnaire,

264
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:17,290
which is the validated survey to use for the specific population I was studying.

265
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:24,910
And this questionnaire has four domains in all symptoms functional limitations, social well-being and emotional well-being.

266
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:30,760
And then I also added additional questions just on socio demographics, oral health perceptions,

267
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:35,680
limitations, accessing care, oral hygiene practices and sugar consumption.

268
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:45,340
And we distributed the survey to 393 students, ages 13 to 18 year olds across three schools in the Chiang Rai province.

269
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:54,100
And then once they were finished, we distributed oral health kits to the participants with toothbrushes, toothpaste cups, towels and a bag.

270
00:30:56,050 --> 00:31:01,180
So the significance of this research is that there are many oral health disparities in the

271
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:07,870
rural communities of Thailand as they struggle with accessing health care and research.

272
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:13,840
Past research has shown adverse oral oral health outcomes among this population.

273
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:24,429
And it's very important, as I said, because oral health is central to one's overall health and the oral health related quality of life can measure the

274
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:30,730
impact that oral health disparities or health disparities have on one's oral health and their overall health.

275
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:37,960
So this research ultimately can enhance our understanding of the population's health needs, inform public policy.

276
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:39,940
We can develop recommendation.

277
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:47,520
Commendations for Hill Tribe adolescents at risk of adverse dental health outcomes and reduced oral health disparities that exist.

278
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,860
Is that right? At the time and I'm done. I'm into like, no, it's okay.

279
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:58,920
Yeah. Here, just us distributing the health kits to the students.

280
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:03,330
But these are the teachers that helped us in distributing the surveys.

281
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:14,250
So that's it. Yes, that's about it.

282
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:21,720
You talked about this is so interesting even with oral health and mental health.

283
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:31,680
Yeah. There's, you know, the connection that's that established between the microbiome and inflammation and mental health.

284
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,989
And then also the obvious,

285
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:41,240
like if your teeth are horrible and you're embarrassed about how you're how you feel when you look like that's going to impact your mental health.

286
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:45,870
So just curious, how are you? What angle are you looking at that? I was so interested in that actually.

287
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:50,640
And originally when I was brainstorming, I wanted to have that like microbiology aspect,

288
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:55,950
but that would have involved taking DNA sample or saliva samples from each of the participants,

289
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:59,819
which is a heftier process in applying for A or B approval.

290
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:07,590
And I didn't really know. Like there's a lot of challenges with global research and communicating and communicating

291
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:11,850
across different languages and timezones is like difficult in the planning process.

292
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:15,450
So I wasn't really sure of the resources that they had.

293
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:23,040
So I just went with the survey research, but I thought it would have been off how to survey additionally with saliva samples to see the

294
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:29,920
associations between like the microbiome and the other health outcomes that they have personally.

295
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:34,290
So that would be an interesting take for future research.

296
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:37,620
So yeah, yeah.

297
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:43,589
I think a lot of times at these interventions wonder like what happens afterwards?

298
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:47,969
So have you had any discussion about the sustainability of this intervention in

299
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:51,950
terms of what will happen after these this X number of people get together?

300
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:56,999
Yeah. So I think like once we're done analyzing the data and drawing on associations,

301
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:03,900
like I plan to continue collaborating with the Hill Tribe Research Center and kind of discuss how this can

302
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:09,929
play into their current efforts because they do go to the communities quite often and do like for example,

303
00:34:09,930 --> 00:34:18,419
like trainings with community members on like how they can educate their community and promote better outcomes, health outcomes.

304
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:24,300
So I think it'll just involve having good communication with them and see where it can go.

305
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:28,090
Yeah. Yeah. Hi. Hi.

306
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:31,710
Did you find the people there? Young people.

307
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:37,350
From the tribes where worry about their health.

308
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:44,040
From what I've seen, just I haven't gone through all the surveys yet because I'm still inputting the data.

309
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:48,390
But it does seem like there are significant impacts in their mental well-being.

310
00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:56,100
But there is somewhat of a disconnect in like how oral health can play into your overall health,

311
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:59,700
which is like the lack of awareness in the communities.

312
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:07,440
Because like I said, I did ask about different like oral hygiene practices and how often they see

313
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,380
a dentist and it seems like those are lacking from the surveys I have seen.

314
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,650
But like I said, I'm still in the process of looking through and inputting all the data.

315
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:31,950
So we'll see. Yeah. And how I mean, how was the the the economic the other issue that they have.

316
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:38,189
I mean, they were just struggling to survive or they were having in some profit so they

317
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:45,299
can be lax and having the all their health care attend and worry about that.

318
00:35:45,300 --> 00:36:00,090
Because in in that kind of population, especially in the countryside and after, I mean, they don't have enough money to to be worry about some things.

319
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:04,740
You can see, for example, they grow people. They all say they don't have teeth.

320
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:10,379
Yeah. Did you see that? Yeah. So I interacted.

321
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:17,820
I actually was surprised with how data collection went because I actually didn't really get to distribute the surveys myself to the participants.

322
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:21,720
It was the Hill Tribe Research Center that did it and the teachers.

323
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:25,830
But I did interact with like the school faculty there.

324
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:29,520
And also [INAUDIBLE] try and members just be spending time in Thailand.

325
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:33,540
I was able to talk with a few and it seems like, like I said,

326
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:42,270
there is a lack of awareness with how your oral health can play into your overall health and less of like less weight put on it.

327
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:46,350
And one man I was talking to, I was asking him, like,

328
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:55,379
it's so it's impossible for them to go see a doctor if they need one from like the terrible roads to get to the cities.

329
00:36:55,380 --> 00:37:00,180
And a lot of them don't have cars to get to where they need to go.

330
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:11,280
So they just use usually like natural therapy, like they'll use herbs or natural remedies to fix their problems.

331
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:17,400
And he didn't seem too worried from our conversation about his oral health or his overall health,

332
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:24,329
because I think they have a lot more to worry about or just like trying to get day by day and provide food for their family.

333
00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:30,510
And but it'll be interesting to see from my survey because I do ask about their,

334
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:43,350
like their financial struggles and like the limitations that they face, seeing dentists and also their parents background and their financial status.

335
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:47,130
So it'll just be interesting to see what comes of it. Thank you.

336
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:56,000
Yeah. Sorry, that was a long answer. Yeah.

337
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,900
How did you go about selecting the Hill tracks? Because there's a lot of them, right?

338
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:09,110
Yeah. So we didn't really focus. There's seven main ones we didn't really focus on selecting is one or the other.

339
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:18,830
So in my survey to ask which hill tribe you're from and I'll be able to see which ones the majority on site input all the data.

340
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:29,160
Yeah. You know.

341
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:36,270
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to sugar eaten by your.

342
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:54,860
I spent some time, 3 hours and read emails and. Where do I have to go now?

343
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:59,860
What should be the power play? I kind of at the bottom used to be in power.

344
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:04,160
Okay. Could you go down right there?

345
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:16,950
The speaker is right. Hi.

346
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:27,300
My name is Velma. Velma Lopez. I'm an industrial engineer and I'm doing my my services in an industrial hygiene and first year.

347
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:30,390
So I don't have my my research topic yet.

348
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:37,560
But I'm going to talk to you about a job that I did in a company in Texas.

349
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:42,390
This company was a consulting company in Byron.

350
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:51,690
And the the job that I did was an environmental assessment and cleanup and remediation of petrochemical plant.

351
00:39:53,130 --> 00:40:01,380
Uh, you know, Texas, as we all know, that is, or a petroleum industry and everything.

352
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:09,240
So my company was, was hired to do the environmental assessment for an open source building of a plant,

353
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:14,909
how it works when when a plant is a petrochemical plant.

354
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:30,209
So you, you can imagine that there is contamination generally, but uh, one plant is being, is, is sell and another owners can come and say,

355
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:38,730
well, I'm going to buy the plant and I want to, I have to know that there is no contamination left.

356
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:45,900
But sometimes it's very difficult because the first owners are just they just want to just help.

357
00:40:46,530 --> 00:41:02,520
So they sell the plant and and have some amount of money stored just in case there is a contamination load in the in the plant.

358
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:14,910
So the new owners came and made the assessment for especially, for example, for some sites that they believe is is more mostly contaminated.

359
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:19,770
And we did the the environmental assessment.

360
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:29,280
How we did there is there was a building with many tanks like 12 or 14.

361
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:33,540
And we need the to clean of the storage tanks.

362
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:43,230
There were chemicals inside removal and disposal of a storage tanks, concrete floor environmental assessment and soil environmental assessment.

363
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:48,569
How we do the cleaning of the storage tanks.

364
00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:56,190
The tanks were mostly empty, but there were some shredder in the bottom, so we needed to clean.

365
00:41:56,190 --> 00:42:09,479
Just take this law out. Sampling this lower deposit in another tank for later disposal washed it tanks with water,

366
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:23,580
high pressure water and remove the tanks after we did that, this is this is the place we were removing all the tanks and load into our truck.

367
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:34,980
There were they were going to a disposal site and the tanks were already clean wash and without any content.

368
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:42,210
And there weren't huge tanks. And we uploaded to to our truck.

369
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,290
This is the site where the tanks were.

370
00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:56,910
This is the the the building their their fundamental fundament and there the concrete floor on all the piping and everything.

371
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:03,300
This is the with all the tanks facility. And as you can see here, there are more tanks.

372
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:10,260
There were like 12 or 14. I don't remember it well how we did the concrete floor environmental assessment.

373
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:19,650
First, we need to well, we have all day building without the tanks everything and we where we have to some place.

374
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:32,040
We had this sampling of the floor. It was concrete so we took some from different parts went there we we suspected where it contamination so they

375
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:40,140
the sampling send it to a lab they say well is okay or not and we removed all the concrete from the floor,

376
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:45,600
everything that there were parts that weren't contaminated.

377
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:49,710
We upload to another truck and they were to a disposal.

378
00:43:49,830 --> 00:44:02,580
Generally this concrete is milled and use in roads and where they they they use I don't know if you saw in the in the highways

379
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:13,890
in the roads in the in the size there are some kind of thing like not the concrete or no the asphalt and they put to that.

380
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:17,820
But if you. This contaminated. They can't do that.

381
00:44:17,850 --> 00:44:28,230
They can't put the concrete there. That's why we we needed to to to do the assessment on the environmental decontamination assessment.

382
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:39,570
Then after that, all the concrete was removed and we have the soil and we needed to sample the soil as well.

383
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:48,000
Send it to a lab. And if there was contaminated, we needed to replace this oil.

384
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:58,620
More or less 30 to 40 centimeter centimeters depth that we have to remove and then put another soil after that.

385
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:08,550
Well, then we have to build it again, the concrete and put new tanks for a new installation.

386
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:12,780
The new installation of tanks for. And for the new company.

387
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:19,230
What was important in this environmental assessment guarantee.

388
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:27,059
The buying company that the plant purchased is free of pollution load guarantee that if there were soil

389
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:33,840
contamination it was remediated and assured that there is no active contamination to the environment.

390
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:43,840
And that was it. Thank you. Any questions?

391
00:45:45,730 --> 00:45:55,840
So how much of the soil was contaminated? I would say like 10% because the concrete protect it.

392
00:45:56,810 --> 00:46:08,470
Yes. Some some places where there were like channels and especially one place was a kind of channel there, the concrete, but it was cracked.

393
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:12,880
So there we had some contamination, but it was minimal.

394
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:16,450
So we didn't have to replace all this oil there.

395
00:46:16,510 --> 00:46:24,750
Just just a few plant. Yeah.

396
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:32,870
What chemicals were maybe in this in there and what chemicals were they manufacturing at this plant.

397
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:47,780
Yeah, mostly this, this chemical plant produced, um, you know, the, the crude oil mostly are filled with a part of things,

398
00:46:48,170 --> 00:46:55,880
and it's this paraffin cloud in the tubes and is difficult to clean.

399
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:02,990
And if you don't clean regularly, it is built up and then you have to, to throw it everything.

400
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:17,330
So this plant made components to dilute these paraffin and in the in the oil production and these

401
00:47:17,330 --> 00:47:23,810
is that that these were a mine spins on IEDs overnight and that that was the contamination.

402
00:47:28,850 --> 00:47:33,410
Sure. Did you have to find out anything? What?

403
00:47:33,530 --> 00:47:38,930
Did you get to climb in any tanks? No, I worked.

404
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:45,919
I worked in insulin manufacturing and some of the process engineers. When they shut down the plant and clean and, you know, whatever they.

405
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:49,670
Whatever work they had to do on the equipment, they would get to climb in some of the tanks.

406
00:47:49,850 --> 00:47:53,790
So they have like the full bodies. Oh, yeah.

407
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:54,230
Yeah.

408
00:47:54,530 --> 00:48:10,100
Well, we we really didn't because it was almost empty tanks and the cleaning was well, the workers did, but they had the appropriate PPE to do that.

409
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:21,730
And every morning we have to do a summary meeting with safety procedures that we were going to have that day.

410
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:32,930
For example, if they were going to to work with the high pressure water and it was cold, we needed to say, well, be equip it.

411
00:48:34,970 --> 00:48:38,959
You have to have all your equipment there. Don't get wet.

412
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:46,250
And if you do that, you have to go and change and wear your masks and everything.

413
00:48:46,250 --> 00:49:00,200
And if we have some some of what is called when and where, you have to enter a tank, uh, confined space.

414
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:07,400
Yes. We had to do all the preparedness to do the confined space and the workers that they were going to do that task.

415
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:12,350
They needed to be certified. It had to be to have they confined in space entry.

416
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:22,090
And no, the the hospital that we have closed, they they needed to know that they were going to have a confined space entry.

417
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:26,930
So all all that matters. Everything that has to be done with that.

418
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:42,290
Look. Thank you. It was perfect timing.

419
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:50,640
So how did we get. Thank you to all the speakers.

420
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:57,880
Got it done pretty well.

421
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:07,709
Yeah. Again, if you can, please dump those out and send those evaluations in in the next few days,

422
00:50:07,710 --> 00:50:11,550
I'll share the results or I'll share the evaluations on the Tuesday.

423
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:14,830
Yeah, I have one more. Right.

424
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:16,140
It's a biopsy.
