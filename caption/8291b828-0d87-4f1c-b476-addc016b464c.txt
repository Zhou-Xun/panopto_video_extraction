00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Hi everyone welcome back to epidemiology 512. Today I'm really excited we're going to talk about the hepatic system we're going to focus all about the liver.

2
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We are currently recording excellent. Just a programming notice that your scores for a quiz to for most folks to forever on the took the quiz on time are released where we're grading a couple of late submissions, and we're going to wait to release the

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:51,000
correct answers in the rubric until until everybody's fully wrapped up with the quiz, but those will be those will be available shortly there any logistics questions that folks have.

4
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:08,000
In general, the scores were really excellent Well, we'll share distribution directly to

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:22,000
other some really exciting gastrointestinal research questions that have been produced, people are curious about what are the effects of different types of diet styles, people are curious about the effects of covert 19.

6
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
People are

7
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:45,000
a visitor today. Part of me. But yeah, really, really excellent questions have been brought to the front, through this unit and others. Let's recap quickly and talk about the farmer co toxicology unit that we did and and try to bring some of those ideas

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
together.

9
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So we learned what a Xena biotic was this term for us is any substance which is foreign to our body.

10
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
This can include pharmaceutical drugs. This can include environmental chemicals.

11
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And we saw that these are really prevalent exposures in our society, and they can be associated with relatively high rates of morbidity both, both on the pharmaceutical side and on the toxic inside.

12
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:20,000
We talked about the regulation of these two types of substances and how currently in the United States we have taken a different approach.

13
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:30,000
More of a precautionary principle with pharmaceuticals, and a different approach with environmental chemicals were

14
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:43,000
issues with safety have to be shown after the fact. And so we can think about how this can impact our epidemiology, the ways in which we can interact with these types of fields.

15
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
The first major principle of pharmacology and toxicology we talked about is absorption.

16
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:55,000
This is the principle of how we get these substances into the body so we have excellent defense mechanisms for our body.

17
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And for Xena biotic to enter our body, it has to be absorbed through some mechanism. These are primarily through inhalation, with ties to our respiratory unit through ingestion with ties to our gastrointestinal unit.

18
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:26,000
We saw injection can also occur and dermal absorption so passing through the skin and different as you know biotics have different structures and physical or chemical properties that might make them more or less likely to be absorbed through different

19
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
pathways.

20
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:39,000
There can also be inter individual differences and how that absorption takes place. So not everyone in our epidemiology study will absorb the same amount of compound,

21
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:54,000
it also talks about distribution so once absorption takes place this is how you know biotics are transported throughout the body. And it generally includes movement along the bloodstream or the lymphatic system depending on the chemical properties.

22
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And we talked about how something biotics can be stored, or sequestered in various places in our body. For example, some are stored in bone somewhere stored in adipose tissue.

23
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:13,000
And then those substances can be released later, resulting in a second wave of exposure.

24
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:29,000
We also talked about excretion or elimination. This is the process that we clear as you know biotics from our body primarily happening through our kidneys which will do next week, and through our feces so happening through our gastrointestinal tract and

25
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:45,000
linking to last week, so this this topic is really touching on many of our organ systems, and we're seeing a connection across across our organ systems will wrap up the dose response aspect of this.

26
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And that's, that's where we'll start at the beginning of class today. Are there any outstanding comments or questions that we should address before, before going forward.

27
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Alright, let's jump back into dose response so we learned that the term dose refers to an amount of a substance that were exposed to a dosage ads in the amount of time.

28
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So that's linking the dose with unit time, when we're thinking about the dose response relationship, the dose, being the amount of Xena biotics someone's exposed to and the response being some kind of physiologic response so how the body is reacting to

29
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
that amount of dose.

30
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:47,000
This could be cellular Lee this could be on a tissue an organism level but any kind of biologic response that we can monitor, that's happening as a result of that dose.

31
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:58,000
So, these are these are assumed to be causal relationships. So our assumptions here are that the response is due to the chemical so we've got a causal relationship.

32
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:11,000
We're also assuming that the magnitude of that response is related to the dose, and that there's a way to somehow precisely measure that outcome. So, this connects to our research questions where we want to be able to measure those responses quantitatively

33
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:24,000
generally, and those those response curves can take different shapes. This is a classic sigmoid L shape, where there's low responses at low levels of the dose.

34
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:42,000
And then there's some kind of threshold effect and we're seeing high levels of responses, and then a plateau, so we're exceeding the maximum capacity to respond to that other dose response relationships are more of a linear so we have incremental increase

35
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
and responses to increasing doses.

36
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:57,000
This these can happen at different slow breaths. So these are these are factors we want to monitor and our study and try to estimate what's the shape of this dose response curve.

37
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:12,000
And we could do this, both within one person over various doses or if we're thinking epidemiological we could think about this on a population level, and try to monitor the responses over large groups of people.

38
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:19,000
So this is our typical population level dose response curve this is what might be what we would measure in an epi study.

39
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
So we've got our frequency our first responders now.

40
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:31,000
So the relative proportion of people in our study population who are responding to that dose of responding over a threshold level.

41
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:47,000
With this signal shape and what we see is that at these early low doses there's some amount of participants who are susceptible. So some participants in our study population are having that threshold response very early on at low doses.

42
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:59,000
We have this this main segment in the middle where most people are responding at this dose. And then we also have these like highly resistant people so folks who are

43
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:16,000
not able to respond to that dose until they get higher levels. So, these principles of variability between people in a population, apply here, when we're thinking about this as an ad for a toxic and we're worried about a different phase of the curve so

44
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:32,000
for the toxic camp we're worried about those susceptible people. We want to know what's the lowest observed adverse effect level so how, where should we set our regulations so that we're protecting the most susceptible people, and then Noel is the know

45
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:50,000
observed adverse effect level so these are these levels down here. We're running to try to really protect the most susceptible people. So we want to set our regulatory threshold our exposure levels to protect these most vulnerable people.

46
00:08:50,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I'm a toxic response wouldn't be the response at which, there's a toxic effect and 50% of the people so that would be going across the the response of 50% of the people.

47
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:20,000
So we can be could be considering different different types of outcomes are different levels of risk that is acceptable in different scenarios, so toxic it's we're really focused on this lowest part of the curve protecting most people.

48
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
And we traditionally for when we're setting risk we emphasize.

49
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
No, no harm to anyone.

50
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:36,000
For pharmaceuticals, we want to focus on the other side of the curve because we want people to be responding if somebody is taking a medicine they need it.

51
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
We want them to be having the intended pharmaceutical response.

52
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:52,000
So, still looking at the 50 percentile now instead of considering that the toxic dose we consider that the effective dose. So you can see how these are the same principles but two sides of the same coin.

53
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,000
So we're not considering the response as harmful. Now we're considering the response as the intended response.

54
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:10,000
So this is the dose of drugs that your participants need to be administered, and in order to produce the really for the intended pharmaceutical benefit.

55
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:24,000
That's helpful. You might also want to produce the benefit and all of the people who are taking the drug, so you might consider the maximum efficacy so what does do you need to provide to folks in order to make sure everybody is getting that health benefit.

56
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:39,000
So you can see how within different scenarios we can emphasize different aspects, and consider different population ranges of responses.

57
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
We often see a lot of heterogeneity and dose response

58
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
A curse.

59
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:57,000
So for example, there might be a cluster of folks who respond to low doses of drug there might be a cluster of folks who respond, I mean high doses to respond.

60
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:14,000
We can see heterogeneity like this, if, if there's genetic variability and how people respond to a drug or a toxic and it can anyone brainstorm Can anyone think of another reason besides genetics, why there might be differences in an entire population

61
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
and how they respond to a drug or a chemical why my there'll be.

62
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:33,000
So, so much difference in how people are responding.

63
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:52,000
My we want to capture the whole population. Why might folks be having different levels. Yeah, there's ideas about age so one of the principles we saw is that different absorption rates can be can differ by age so our blood brain barrier, our intestinal

64
00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:00,000
barrier these type of junctions are incomplete and children so they might be absorbing things much faster than adults.

65
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:20,000
So, age might be related with respect to rates of absorption distribution and excretion gender might be different if people have different, a different hormone levels, different responses that might help might modify how somebody responds to one of these

66
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
compounds.

67
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:30,000
If you've taken another medication frequently you might have exhausted the metabolic capacity of that pathway.

68
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
If you have different nutritional status.

69
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:43,000
If you have other exposures so we can think of all of our classic ideas about epidemiology about why there might be differences within people and apply those here to pharmacology and toxicology.

70
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
So let's walk through.

71
00:12:46,000 --> 00:13:02,000
One example so you may have heard in your toxicology in your epidemiology studies that these dose response curves are really important for establishing causality and one of the criteria for establishing causality one of our studies.

72
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
So this, this is a

73
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:28,000
famous study that was building evidence or showing a meta analysis across 20 of the largest United States cities from the 80s and 90s. Looking at the potential associations between particulate matter, less than 10 micrograms in diameter of air pollution

74
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:41,000
and health effects. So looking at these large particles and air pollution and seeing if there's health effects here. And so what they're showing on the x axis is exactly one of these plots so on the x axis we have various doses of the air pollution and

75
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:49,000
the y axis is a response we've got the rate of change of mortality so the mortality is that's occurring in those cities.

76
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:59,000
And what we see here is that in the solid line that we have, we have this increasing curve, where there's higher rates of mortality with higher exposure.

77
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:13,000
And when they start to consider a time lag, as you might imagine that there's a little bit of time in between the exposure and when mortality occurs, the shape of the curve is is a little bit different.

78
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:31,000
So this is monitoring the response is a very serious one the relative risk of death, but they did similar studies with other outcomes. So for example, here was mortality specifically due to cardiovascular respiratory features, and what they're seeing

79
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:37,000
is that across these levels of exposure, there was no threshold z.

80
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:50,000
So, maybe, maybe at much higher, higher levels of air pollution exposure there would be a threshold but at the levels which were observed in the study, there was no threshold observed.

81
00:14:50,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Really indicating that I'm down here for these chemical toxic cans and we want to be protecting the most people, we want to be setting our safety standards at low levels to protect the most folks here they looked at other causes of death outside of respiratory

82
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:14,000
and cardiovascular and it's an exponential curve.

83
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Let's check in, why do we use these dose response curves How are these useful are we using them can they can they be tools to assess short term toxicity, can they be tools to assess long term toxicity.

84
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Can we use them to estimate the no effect level, or all of the above. what are some of the useful tools for these.

85
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:56,000
socks are on their game today Yes, thank you. So these, these could be used for all of these scenarios so dose response curves would be helpful in all these settings.

86
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
All right, let's talk about bio transformation.

87
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:18,000
So this is also called metabolism, or the way in which we break down, you know biotics in our body and transform them into a different state that might be easier to excrete metabolism of these compounds is going to primarily be conducted by the liver

88
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:26,000
and the kidneys so this is going to have a very strong connection to the second half of our lecture today and deliver and our lecture next week on the kidney.

89
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:35,000
The these organ systems the liver and the kidney are exposed to the highest levels of zero biotics in our body, because they play these key roles and metabolism and excretion.

90
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:53,000
They're also playing a role in concentrating the chemical exposures. So they have higher levels of exposure themselves compounds like cadmium and Mercury, their lip affiliate compounds are coming through these organ systems in higher doses.

91
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:09,000
So bio transformation. This is the metabolic conversion of a Xena biotic to a more water soluble version that's easier to excrete primarily most of our excretion is going to happen through our kidneys through our urine.

92
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:15,000
So compounds need to be comfortable residing in water in order to excrete through the urine.

93
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:25,000
So bio transformation is this process where we're trying to make chemicals more water soluble and this is going to happen in several phases. So the first phase is this priming.

94
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:32,000
This is where we're activating the compound and this is where we sometimes make things, our body makes things worse before it gets better.

95
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:43,000
So we tend to add a reactive component to, to these you know biotics to set the stage for the second phase.

96
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:54,000
So phase one doesn't tend to really increase, how hydrophobic it is yet, but it's getting things ready. And in the process, it's making the compound more reactive.

97
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:01,000
So sometimes these phase one intermediate stages of bio transformation can make things worse with a with a compound.

98
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Once phase two is happening.

99
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:16,000
This is when typically we're adding a large hydrophobic group to the compound making it. Now it's making it much more likely to be excluded, in, in, in, in water.

100
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
So this is adding large compounds.

101
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:25,000
To make it more hydrophobic. These are some examples of these types of compounds that can get at it.

102
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:35,000
So phase two is when the compound actually becomes more hydrophobic and phase one is this preparation getting ready phase where the compound is getting more reactive.

103
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:44,000
And we can look at this as kind of a image or a picture so if we're starting with a pharmaceutical or a toxic and during phase one.

104
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:51,000
We might be making things worse but what we're doing is we're making the drug more reactive.

105
00:18:51,000 --> 00:19:04,000
So this toxic intermediate might actually be this intermediate might actually be toxic and causing some degree of damage. So we want these processes to be couple, we want them to happen.

106
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Close in time and space. Because once phase two is able to happen, then that drug is able to be executed so we need those two steps in order to be able to excrete that drug.

107
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:26,000
So you can see how interruptions in this process might result in damage to the tissues.

108
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:33,000
We have in several tissues in our body cells that specialize in these types of processes.

109
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:43,000
So we'll talk specifically about hepatocytes the key functional cells of the liver today proximal to view ourselves and the kidney we'll talk about next week.

110
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:49,000
There's, there's types of cells in our lung which can have some of this function as well.

111
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:58,000
cells of our intestine cells of our skin, various, various other cells in our body have have these types of enzymes to some degree.

112
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:13,000
So we said phase one has this goal to make the compound more reactive more bioactive, the cell, the enzymes which typically do this are large family of enzymes called cider chrome p for 50 enzymes.

113
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:28,000
They're highly conserved across all mammals and there are a ton of these and they all start with this CYP for cider chrome p for 50 and then they have this combinations of letters and numbers after them so you can see there's a ton of different flavors

114
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:34,000
of this, this enzyme, and sometimes.

115
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Sometimes they make things worse before they get better, and the,

116
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:58,000
the specifics of this, these type of chemical reactions are not necessarily important, but for those of you that are familiar with organic chemistry you'll see notice some of these oxides are relatively unstable compounds.

117
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:14,000
A POC sides are relatively unstable. So here you can see that these unstable pieces are getting added to the pharmaceutical or intoxicant, which can make this become very sticky and want to attach to and appropriately two things in ourselves and that's

118
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,000
how this kind of damage could occur.

119
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:50,000
And, for example, these toxins can react with DNA so then we end up with a drug or a toxic count like stuck to our DNA and how do we get that off of their that's not where we want.

120
00:21:50,000 --> 00:22:08,000
up so you can see how different drugs are toxic hands can raise the amount of this phase one enzymes, other compounds can inhibit them so if you're on the pharmaceutical erythromycin that will drive down the levels of sidecar mp4 50, a certain type, grapefruit

121
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:22,000
juice inhibits a different type. So we start to see how there might be interactions if people are exposed to more than one of these things, or if they need, they have a pharmaceutical that needs processing through one of these pipelines.

122
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:32,000
We want to try to modify or make sure that you have the proper proper levels that are that are available.

123
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Yeah. So for example, I experienced gastric reflux sometimes I take a map Rizal. So I would want to avoid compounds which are either inducing or inhibiting levels of the site or compete for 50 that I need to be able to process, my results so we see that

124
00:22:49,000 --> 00:23:02,000
there might be interactions between exposures here, face to. Now that the compound is highly reactive we want to add something on to it to make it more hydrophobic.

125
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:12,000
So here for example we're adding a large blue color on a date molecule we're adding a large sulfur group we're adding a methyl group we're adding in a seal group.

126
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,000
One of our favorite ones and toxicology his dad flew to file.

127
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,000
All various things that are helping make these compounds more hydrophobic.

128
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:30,000
We can be limited. Because to be able to add something to these compounds, you need to have

129
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:38,000
available co factors are available substances to be able to be added. So in some cases we can run out of these.

130
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:49,000
So if we're trying to add Gloop you're added to a compound if we just run out of these then we can't do this reaction anymore and we get stuck with a phase one metabolite we're not able to go forward with phase two.

131
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:56,000
So we, we want to make sure we have enough of the building blocks to be able to make these reactions out.

132
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:16,000
There's all kinds of population variability in these enzymes so participants in your study might have single nucleotide polymorphous isms in various versions of these enzymes, which can have effects on those enzyme activity so again further support for

133
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:28,000
the fact that not everybody in our study population is going to react the same way to the same level of exposure to a drug or pharmaceutical or up toxic can.

134
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:36,000
And these can influence their particular susceptibility to two different compounds that are all listed over here.

135
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:55,000
So, example warfarin is a drug given for two to help prevent clotting in the bloodstream and somebody with the these types of genetic mutations would have reduced ability to metabolize warfarin.

136
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:10,000
There's also age variation which which Scarlett suggested earlier in the chat about this might be a, resulting in some heterogeneity in our population.

137
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Here's the activity levels, we see that it during the fetal period fetus is typically relying on the maternal compartment for metabolism I was using antibiotics.

138
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:34,000
So the levels of fetal enzyme activity for these are quite low. And then we can see steadily postnatal either. There's some growth in the activity of some of these enzymes.

139
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:53,000
so age is absolutely a factor in influencing our ability to handles you know biotic factors and and the. Here's a table summarizing when it's believed that some of these enzymes start to come online.

140
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Right.

141
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:08,000
So that's a wrap up of our pharmacology toxicology So thinking about these ideas of dose response in populations what makes people more vulnerable, what makes people potentially more resistant.

142
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,000
How do we optimize the dose of a pharmaceutical that people are given.

143
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:26,000
How do we set protective regulations to take care of the most number of people, and then thinking about how do we metabolize these compounds to remove them from our body.

144
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Are there, what kind of questions, comments, do we have here to help us processes information.

145
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Good question.

146
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:50,000
With regard to the population dose response curve on slide seven. I just want to confirm, so people who are susceptible have a low response, low levels of the dose and then the threshold responses were like, the majority of people fall, and then if you're

147
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
resistant. It's a high response to high levels of the dose.

148
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Excellent question. I just want to understand the the signal achievement and how that goes with it with the curve. Yeah, let me make sure I, I'm

149
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:25,000
accurately as I possibly can. So down here would be people who are responding to low doses. So the susceptible folks are the ones who have a response to low doses.

150
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:40,000
So if the response is something serious like mortality. So the frequency of the responses low down here we only have maybe 1% of the population is experiencing mortality.

151
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:57,000
But that's a very serious outcome for these 1% of people, these are people who are experiencing mortality at low doses. So the susceptible folks are experiencing that response at low doses, and the resistant people are not experiencing the response until

152
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
they get to a high higher dose.

153
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:09,000
So these folks would be not experiencing the this proportion of the population will be experiencing mortality at a higher dose.

154
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Yeah.

155
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Are there any important points. I'm glad you're having us

156
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Yeah, I think that's an interesting one I

157
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,000
think about

158
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:51,000
these data and early developmental period, how there's this this unusual peak happening in the less than 24 hours postnatal.

159
00:28:51,000 --> 00:29:06,000
And then we see it go back down here in the later postnatal period, I would want to dig into the raw data and see maybe something kind of unusual happened here how many replicates do they actually have supporting this value.

160
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:22,000
This, this appears to be, this was kind of piqued my interest to want to follow this up. There's something, a shift in in these types of toxicology studies over time to start showing the actual data points on there so you could see maybe some of the data

161
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:36,000
points are down here and there's just an extreme value or something like this. Those, the type of variability in the data can get obscured when we're just using boxes which can imply a lot more consistency and response.

162
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:51,000
So, in general, I would say, what we're going to focus on in this class is this general trend where a child's ability to metabolize or transform. so you know biotics increases over time.

163
00:29:51,000 --> 00:30:06,000
And maybe put less emphasis or weight on that, that one value point I'm glad I'm glad that also kind of you were you were skeptical of that data point as well it was too.

164
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Well it's our folks curious about.

165
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:25,000
All right, well I think we'll see that there are ton of connections in the liver the hepatic system to to these principles of

166
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:40,000
pharmacology and toxicology. We're going to in the liver section we're going to link the structure and function of the liver we'll see how those two concepts are connected here in this tissue will do our epidemiology work will be able to list and interpret

167
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:52,000
measures of liver function. We're going to talk about several hepatic diseases including hepatitis, talk about some of the risk factors and we'll talk about some of the mechanisms.

168
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:58,000
By way of motivating. Some folks haven't really thought about their livers before.

169
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,000
But we can think about the prevalence of liver diseases in the US.

170
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:09,000
There's over 3 million folks who are currently diagnosed with liver disease.

171
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:16,000
This is a relatively high proportion of cause of death.

172
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:24,000
We see that the deaths attributed to chronic liver disease or cirrhosis or non randomly distributed throughout the US.

173
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
So there's different regional factors.

174
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:41,000
And as we think about different types of liver diseases, both in the US and globally, we see that the most prevalent types of liver diseases very regionally.

175
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:51,000
So for example, hepatitis B virus infection is, is prevalent worldwide.

176
00:31:51,000 --> 00:32:00,000
These additional disorders that we'll talk about, including alcoholic liver disease and non alcoholic fatty liver disease.

177
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:10,000
What we'll get into what are the physiology of each of these different types of liver diseases. But really, globally, quite quite prevalent.

178
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:19,000
So it's helpful to understand what's happening in the tissues of something that is affecting such a broad number of people.

179
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Liver cancer is especially prevalent type of cancer in China.

180
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
All right, let's talk about the structure and function.

181
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:44,000
So the liver functions are several and varied, our liver is primarily involved in the uptake so the acquisition, the storage, and the distribution of nutrients.

182
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:51,000
We learned in the gastrointestinal system lecture that our primary nutrients are glucose, lipids and proteins.

183
00:32:51,000 --> 00:33:04,000
So the liver is going to help regulate the circulating levels of glucose lipids and proteins, the liver is also going to help with our levels of vitamins and our levels of plasma proteins.

184
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:22,000
The liver has a primary function in the production of bile and in the processing of Billy Rubin we'll talk about these two substances, going forward, bile is a compound which helps us digest fat in our gastrointestinal system and Billy Rubin, is how we

185
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:32,000
break down our process, red blood cells. So these are two specific functions a little of our to help help maintain processing.

186
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:45,000
And then as we just saw the liver has a primary role in the bio transformation degradation and elimination of zbiotics including drugs and toxic events and deliver also helps with the processing of steroid hormones.

187
00:33:45,000 --> 00:34:05,000
So those are the types of hormones which are made from cholesterol, and you'll often see that as a consequence of someone experiencing liver failure liver disease or maybe a disruption and they're steroid hormone processing.

188
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
So here's a diagram from your book of the liver.

189
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:27,000
The liver is the largest visceral Oregon the largest organ in our, in our abdomen It weighs in at around three pounds and an adult, we see that it's non symmetric, it's situated just under our diaphragm, here's our diaphragm the diaphragm is the muscle

190
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
that controls the our breathing.

191
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:43,000
So our lung expansion and contraction and deliver says just below there. It has a large right lobe has a slightly smaller left lobe.

192
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:59,000
And it's positioned here the stomach would be over on this side on the left hand side, we see that the liver also is in has a bile duct coming out of here this hepatic ducks.

193
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:11,000
This is where the liver produces bile that bile will exit the liver down the paddock duck. If we're not using that bile right away will store it in the gallbladder.

194
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:20,000
And these ducks come together and get released that bio will get released into the duodenum the top of the small intestine so here's the duodenum.

195
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:36,000
The top of the small intestine and our liver has a direct pipeline or pathway connecting it, its products into the duodenum. So in this way the liver is able to produce compounds that get released into our gastrointestinal tract for immediate function,

196
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,000
we see here's our pancreas which has come up in several lectures.

197
00:35:41,000 --> 00:36:00,000
The pancreas is also going to be producing extra current compounds. So these are those compounds that aid in digestion that come in through the same channel, the spleen is a related accessory organ in the system will see how blood flow to the system can

198
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:09,000
have consequences for the spleen so if the liver gets backed up that can often claws cosplayed omega three so enlargement of the spleen.

199
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:14,000
So these, these are connected here.

200
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:31,000
here's, here's another view of the liver from the netter book. And what I appreciate about this, we can still see the asymmetric liver focus here, but we see how the liver kind of is nestled with the stomach so that helps us visually make more sense about

201
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:50,000
the positioning of the liver there, and it also shows us very large portal vein. So there's a large blood supply coming into the liver, and we'll see how that central to the distribution of nutrients and the functioning of the liver.

202
00:36:50,000 --> 00:37:01,000
So here's our liver here. Now it's featured in blue and purple to reflect the relative oxygenation status of the blood which is supplied to the liver.

203
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:18,000
So, the portal circulation or the circulation that's coming into the liver, primarily this blood is coming from the gut. So you're seeing that all of the nutrients that are absorbed in the small intestine are entering into capillaries, that aren't being

204
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:27,000
collected and now they're channeling and they're going up here and they're funneling into the liver so that's why this blood is already deoxygenated.

205
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:38,000
It's already left the capillaries in the gastrointestinal system. So this blood has no more oxygen in it and now it's coming and making its way back into the liver.

206
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Here's some partially oxygenated blood coming in, supplying the capillaries from the large intestine and the spleen, so we've got blood flow coming up into the liver from the bottom and largely blood is coming into the liver from the gastrointestinal

207
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
tract from the spleen from the pancreas.

208
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:06,000
And all of that blood is collecting and coming into the liver through this portal vein. This large V and that's at the base of the liver.

209
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:23,000
And then eventually once the liver processes that blood, adjust the nutrient levels adjust the hormone levels is you know biotic levels that blood is returned to the heart into the vena cava.

210
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:34,000
If we look a little bit more into that portal circulation if we zoom in so here and yellow This is that a liver tissue. And here's, Here's the vein coming in.

211
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Here's the hepatic ducks coming out in green, because uh we typically depict bile as green so this is the pipe that's leaving the liver, the liver is made this bile and that another files leaving the liver.

212
00:38:48,000 --> 00:39:00,000
And then we have our portal

213
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:10,000
We also have a hepatic artery, which is going to supply the oxygen needs of the tissue so the cells of the liver need oxygen, just like any other cells of our body.

214
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:17,000
So these hepatic artery. This have had an artery is going to supply supply that mean.

215
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:23,000
So we've got a blood coming into the hepatic the hepatic portal vein.

216
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:29,000
From the gastrointestinal system. And then we have blood leaving to go into the heart.

217
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:37,000
So we've got this flow, it's going up up our abdomen and it'll go ahead towards into the heart.

218
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:43,000
If we zoom in even further, and we start to see the liver is really the system of pipes.

219
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:51,000
So we've got these central beans piping blood from our gastrointestinal system.

220
00:39:51,000 --> 00:40:05,000
We are there and they're forming largely these clusters so the bile is going out the central been blood from the gastrointestinal systems coming in. we've got an artery supplying and we see that there's a lot of surface area so all of these little channels

221
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:18,000
with our vessels here, and in brown, are these hepatocytes so these are the cells primary functional cells of the liver, and most of the cells are not very far away from a blood vessel.

222
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:25,000
So there's a lot of contacts between the liver cells and the blood vessels.

223
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Sign new stories are these specialized types of capillaries these tiny vessels in the liver which help increase the amount of contacts between liver cells and the blood vessels.

224
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:48,000
So these liver sign your slides are these types of capillaries, that are helping bring that blood from them hepatic portal name and that paddock artery and helping helping mix the two.

225
00:40:48,000 --> 00:41:00,000
So we've got blood coming in through our portal vein nutrient rich but oxygen poor from our gut. And then we have normal hepatic artery coming from the heart.

226
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:11,000
So these two blood sources start mixing, so that our liver cells get access to both the nutrients and the oxygen, and we see that there's these like one self six channels.

227
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Here's our little sign you saw the the tiny capillaries in the liver and our hepatocytes our liver cells are lined up a little in little lines and channels.

228
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:37,000
There's also these tiny bio canals, that are making their way towards the bile duct. So we've got all these branch points and then everything starts collecting together.

229
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:43,000
So the world is coming in our hepatic arteries coming in, they're mixing.

230
00:41:43,000 --> 00:42:02,000
They're coming down the sign you so I channel. And then once all these liver cells have had a chance to interact with this blood, the blood from the side besides collect in another central dance so there's this flow towards the middle of of liver labial

231
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,226
sign you saw either emptying into the central bands that are going to send the blood back to the heart

232
00:42:14,284 --> 00:42:28,284
right next to the sign your slaves and the function of these cells of the liver or to modify the Bloods composition, they're going to be involved in adjusting the nutrient levels breaking down Xena biotics adjusting hormone levels.

233
00:42:28,284 --> 00:42:35,284
Here for example is a, is a tissue each any standard of what this looks like.

234
00:42:35,284 --> 00:42:41,284
So we can see these signing slides here these little channels full of blood, blood cells.

235
00:42:41,284 --> 00:42:51,284
All these tiny little pink ones without nuclei, these are red blood cells, traveling through these little channels, collecting and this large Central Maine.

236
00:42:51,284 --> 00:43:07,284
And then these larger cells out here are hepatocytes our liver cells. So you can really see how there's this collection it's like almost like spokes on a wheel everything coming towards the central been lots of surface area lots of contacts for these

237
00:43:07,284 --> 00:43:13,284
hepatic cells to get involved with the bloodstream.

238
00:43:13,284 --> 00:43:21,284
There's, there's additional cells present in the liver beyond hepatocytes so beyond those functional cells, a little over.

239
00:43:21,284 --> 00:43:33,284
These include Cooper cells. Cooper cells are the primary immune cells in the liver. They're macrophages so those facts acidic cells that are going to engulf something that's problematic.

240
00:43:33,284 --> 00:43:40,284
If a liver gets injured for example through ethanol exposure those Cooper cells are going to get extra activated.

241
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:49,284
We also have these still it sells the help regulate the blood flow through the liver.

242
00:43:49,284 --> 00:43:58,284
So they have the ability to contract, they can wrap around the endothelial walls of the sign you soil and modified blood flow.

243
00:43:58,284 --> 00:44:10,284
They also function as antigen presenting cells. So they help with the immune response and they can get activated with liver damage, such as in fibrosis.

244
00:44:10,284 --> 00:44:21,284
Here's an additional view of this where we can kind of see everything and channel by hearing gray or hepatocytes lined up along the side to side. Here's our side to side, and we see that these Cooper sells these factors affect acidic macrophage cells

245
00:44:21,284 --> 00:44:37,284
These factors affect acidic macrophage cells have these long projections, and they're hanging out in in this in the soil, so they're, they're monitoring the blood, and they're checking out if if any actions are needed.

246
00:44:37,284 --> 00:44:46,284
And then that blood is flowing into that central beam,

247
00:44:46,284 --> 00:45:00,284
many sides are going to come together and empty into one vein so we've got this circular structure where all of these signings so I channels are coming together and pulling in one central team.

248
00:45:00,284 --> 00:45:15,284
These liberal globules form almost cylinders, where there's a repeating functional units of these all the way throughout the liver so you have tons and tons of these 50,000 to 100,000 of these liberal globules.

249
00:45:15,284 --> 00:45:22,284
And they all have a similar structure and they're doing similar work.

250
00:45:22,284 --> 00:45:30,284
And a section of a whole of the liver empty into one Venus called love you.

251
00:45:30,284 --> 00:45:53,284
These bio channels are bio Canada look you like these are these little tracks where the liver cells the parasites are producing bile and that gets excluded from the hepatocytes into these bio channels for collection and remove all through the bile duct

252
00:45:53,284 --> 00:46:08,284
bio gets carried into the bile duct and then stored in the gallbladder for release into the gastrointestinal system, anytime we eat a meal that contains fast.

253
00:46:08,284 --> 00:46:18,284
So we remember from our gastrointestinal lecture that our diet consists primarily of these large macronutrients including carbohydrates, fats and proteins.

254
00:46:18,284 --> 00:46:24,284
But we need to break those down in order to be able to circulate them and use them.

255
00:46:24,284 --> 00:46:34,284
So there's this process of breaking them down into glucose fatty acids and amino acids. And then if we need to store them for later we build them back up into these larger structures.

256
00:46:34,284 --> 00:46:48,284
So the liver is going to play a huge role in this breakdown into nutrients and building them back up into storage components. So the liver is is really involved in the, in the metabolism of several these cycles.

257
00:46:48,284 --> 00:47:05,284
We also remember that for cellular respiration. And we saw this, this image during our gastrointestinal lecture that fatty acids that glucose that amino acids can all enter into this cycle.

258
00:47:05,284 --> 00:47:11,284
So really, when we're talking about the liver influencing nutrient levels we're talking about the liver.

259
00:47:11,284 --> 00:47:16,284
Adjusting the amount of fuel that cells in our body have.

260
00:47:16,284 --> 00:47:23,284
So one of the major functions of the liver is to influence glucose metabolism.

261
00:47:23,284 --> 00:47:35,284
Which, which involves levels of all of these other different types of nutrients can funnel into and be converted into glucose.

262
00:47:35,284 --> 00:47:52,284
So for example from all these various input nutrients we can we can make the liver can make glucose, and then it can either release glucose directly into the bloodstream or release other nutrients that our products with that.

263
00:47:52,284 --> 00:48:06,284
We need to store carbohydrates in this way if we need a source sugars, the liver can convert that to glycogen. So here's just an example of these different conversions related to glucose that the liver can make regularly in response to energy demands

264
00:48:06,284 --> 00:48:08,284
from the body.

265
00:48:08,284 --> 00:48:13,284
The liver can also function and the metabolism of limits.

266
00:48:13,284 --> 00:48:18,284
So we're bringing our dietary fats, the liver can convert those two fatty acids.

267
00:48:18,284 --> 00:48:36,284
Then our body can use them for cellular structures, or can store these. So our liver can be highly active in the processing of lipids and the release of lipids into our bloodstream, for use in energy production, or in the US and production of other compounds

268
00:48:36,284 --> 00:48:45,284
so we'll see how the liver can produce cholesterol delivered can produce bile salts and deliver it can be active producer of steroid hormones.

269
00:48:45,284 --> 00:48:56,284
So, fats, beyond just being useful for energy storage, we can see that there are additional compounds able to me.

270
00:48:56,284 --> 00:49:11,284
The liver also functions and protein metabolism so we've seen it functions and glucose limit and now protein metabolism. So this is a process of taking dietary proteins into amino acids, those can get us directly to build up proteins and our tissues.

271
00:49:11,284 --> 00:49:16,284
It can be converted into plasma proteins which are these transport proteins in our bloodstream.

272
00:49:16,284 --> 00:49:30,284
Or we can you do more complex metabolism there for use of proteins for energy production, or for the release of nitrogen compounds in urine.

273
00:49:30,284 --> 00:49:37,284
If we remember from our gastrointestinal lecture that different cell types in our body require different types of tissue.

274
00:49:37,284 --> 00:49:52,284
So our livers not just specializing in one of these processes, we see the liver here is evolved in the processing of glucose, the processing of fatty acids, the processing of protein so the liver is really key or Oregon which is helping regulate levels

275
00:49:52,284 --> 00:49:57,284
of all these necessary nutrients for different tissues in our body.

276
00:49:57,284 --> 00:50:12,284
The last couple of metabolic functions will mention today are the bio production which will will have a section all about bile and bilirubin excretion, and then this topic of drug and hormone metabolism so if we got a hormone coming in here.

277
00:50:12,284 --> 00:50:46,988
Our livers going to play a key role in in those phase one and phase two metabolism that we just that we just discussed.
