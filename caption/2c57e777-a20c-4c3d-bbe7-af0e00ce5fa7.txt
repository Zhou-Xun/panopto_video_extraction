1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:14,050
That one. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,230
No, no, no. Yeah, yeah.

3
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,550
I definitely looked into it a little bit. Yeah.

4
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:37,920
So this weekend, what's going on is that they were very happy that they had a method.

5
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:42,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

6
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:49,310
I. That was like we were all together at the same time.

7
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:56,930
You know, we're sort of carried out there and I think that was pretty much the appropriate.

8
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:03,270
Yeah. I mean, obviously everybody has a paragraph from her showing like, things that people will be like.

9
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:11,020
She'd be people don't use the just. Yeah, you do want it to come from the stuff that you've already found or like more and more.

10
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:22,420
And if there is more DCI knowing that going with the system or anything like that,

11
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:26,580
sort of like yeah, I got some the restrictions that I could use totally.

12
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:33,210
I'm gonna look into it. Elvis Presley, by the way, I think.

13
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:40,230
Oh, yeah. I thought I was going to think.

14
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:53,910
I'm glad you brought this. By doing so in general, I try to keep it clean and then.

15
00:01:55,990 --> 00:02:01,080
Yes, yes, I know, I know. I've done a lot of things.

16
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:12,930
I do things that I was like, you know, I, I, I don't.

17
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:19,780
The traffic is intense and.

18
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:34,160
But they go to their case. I don't know.

19
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,400
Oh. Okay. I'm.

20
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:56,010
All right. Cool.

21
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:59,740
Okay. Okay.

22
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:09,650
Welcome, everybody. I wanted to just put in a plug before we talk about incarceration and families today.

23
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:16,790
A few things. First, a reminder that we don't have class at all in this class.

24
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:19,489
On the week of Thanksgiving. So not Tuesday or Thursday.

25
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:29,060
So use the time to travel or whatever, but also work on your papers and cook whatever you're doing.

26
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:36,830
I wish people luck if they are traveling because I know it's going to just be a brutal travel situation.

27
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:46,560
And the other thing is, I just wanted to put in an additional plug for writing constitutions if people, you know, want to do that.

28
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:53,250
I think it's just a good excuse to to to do that,

29
00:03:53,420 --> 00:04:00,739
because I think it's always helpful to just have other people look at your writing like no matter what you can on either of these sites,

30
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:05,270
so that each one is really for speech enrolled students.

31
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:12,110
And then the sweet land is for, you know, broad Michigan students,

32
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:21,780
but they do have like a grab writing like line that's not only for undergraduates and you can just like click in and make an appointment.

33
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:35,150
So I would say if people have the time, it's a fun thing to do and it's just kind of like free help, free with the cost of Michigan education.

34
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:44,720
So be that as it may. So, okay, so today we're going to talk about incarceration.

35
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:50,210
And I've done some work in this area, so I'll talk about one particular program that I've worked with before.

36
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:58,190
And I think one of the things to consider about this issue is that it's a huge systemic issue.

37
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:06,349
There's so many social determinants, of course, of mass incarceration and lots of different systems involved because of the focus of this class.

38
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:15,649
But I will zoom in on is child and family kind of considerations and programs that are developed and

39
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:22,070
delivered in different settings around incarceration so and improving outcomes for kids and families.

40
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:28,040
So but just knowing like this is sort of to represent like there's so many areas to work

41
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:34,070
on this issue because it is influenced by lots and lots of these different big systems.

42
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:39,110
So but we'll talk about incarceration kind of as a family challenge.

43
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,729
And I know that I have this in the mini lecture, too,

44
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:48,770
but I always like to kind of start with this Bill of Rights for children of incarcerated parents,

45
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:55,700
because I look at those like items or rights,

46
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:04,370
and I think those are some very reasonable and those are actually not things that happen for all kids whose parents are incarcerated.

47
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:12,320
And so these are actually relatively I forget the year that they were developed, but not they haven't always existed.

48
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:17,750
And so looking at those and using your guy's developmental knowledge,

49
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:25,400
what kinds of things do you think we kind of pop out to you in terms of developmental themes of these these rights?

50
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:38,790
Of kids. Just other themes that we've talked about in class.

51
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:53,020
I'll shut the door for just. He has a microphone.

52
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,270
People think about what we've talked about before.

53
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:08,350
Jennifer, I'm just looking at the first one about like the child being informed of the parent's arrest.

54
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:14,920
Maybe like not maybe the specifics, but like we were talking about week with like separation and how like being prepared for that

55
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:18,790
can help a lot with like the trauma that can come with being separated from the parent.

56
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:25,540
So like maybe the separation is inevitable, but like having the child kind of be aware to some extent that they're going to be away for a long time,

57
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:29,410
can prevent a lot of that anxiety that come from of not being there for for a long time.

58
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:33,399
Yeah. Yeah. So that seems like really good, like basic information.

59
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:39,630
And that's something that thinking about, you know, the range of kids ages at which they might this might happen.

60
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:43,330
That's going to have to be done in a developmentally sensitive fashion.

61
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:50,950
But that's certainly important, that sort of basic information, knowledge and other things around.

62
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:59,710
Yeah. Um, what I'm looking at like speak with see and touch reference that makes me think of like attachment for sure.

63
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:05,320
Yeah. Attachment. And just that keeping the relationship going.

64
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:17,409
And I think that this idea of also speaking of relationships, alternate caregivers are really important to consider,

65
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:21,100
like who are the people who are going to step in if a parent is not there?

66
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:25,809
And I've done most of the work that I have done with incarceration is actually

67
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:29,440
with incarcerated mothers or families who have experienced incarcerated mothers.

68
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:38,950
And so often, not always, but often if a mother is incarcerated, they can be the sole caregiver of that child.

69
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:46,510
And so that sort of places a family really into deep crisis when the mother when the mother is incarcerated.

70
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:53,920
I think I think some of the other things to to contemplate in this kind of was in the mini lecture, too.

71
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,240
But just like how this looks at different child ages, right?

72
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:03,100
It's really something that is very dramatically different across age ranges.

73
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:07,419
And so kind of what we're considering in our like interventions with kids and

74
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:12,399
families who are experiencing this issue are are really developmentally driven,

75
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,970
I think, in some somewhat unique way.

76
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:19,090
I mean, very similar to our session on the separation.

77
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:22,990
Obviously, this is a very specific type of separation.

78
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:28,810
Um, so this is just sort of a, you know, really broad overview.

79
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:34,360
There are a lot of programs and resources available for families experiencing parent incarceration.

80
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:45,520
They kind of vary in a few key ways. Some things take place kind of inside the institutions or inside the correctional facility,

81
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:50,049
and there are depending on the facility and resources and all kinds of things.

82
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:56,530
But there are various levels of innovation across different in different facilities.

83
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:05,320
And again, some of these are relatively rare. There are a growing number of parenting programs, sort of parent support programs,

84
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:10,929
some prison nurseries actually more globally than in the US in terms of prison nurseries,

85
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:19,389
meaning like if a mom has a baby and while incarcerated, they can actually stay with the baby.

86
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:23,560
And sort of if you guys are thinking about attachment like across that first year of life,

87
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:33,399
promoting the bond between mother and child and developing an attachment relationship could happen even in that context across the first year of life.

88
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:42,549
So that's sort of the goal of some of these prison nurseries. Another big area for and for intervention and programing is around visitation.

89
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:49,630
So making sure that children can visit the parent that is incarcerated.

90
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,610
And there's a lot of considerations with with visitation programs,

91
00:10:54,610 --> 00:11:02,290
how to make them better and how to kind of make them accessible is a big issue because of the distance,

92
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:07,119
often between where families living and where that parent would be incarcerated.

93
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:17,170
So there's a lot of issues with like proximity. Um, what else do you guys think might be issues around visitation type programs for thinking about?

94
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:28,069
People visiting. What to what to consider around visitation.

95
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:36,560
Yeah. So, like, environment for like loneliness to or environment because, like, there's a lot of people that they don't know.

96
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:44,149
It's like a space where like, you don't know other, like inmates like that interaction.

97
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:48,050
They're around a lot of like influential things for sure.

98
00:11:48,500 --> 00:12:00,220
And then, like, also like. You don't know how that youth queen as a child like touch is because they're getting around crawling.

99
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,730
Right. Right.

100
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:10,600
A lot around like is it an environmentally is like a child friendly environmental space and child friendly environment to actually go and visit?

101
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:16,600
Absolutely. And I don't think I was saying this on the little mini lecture video,

102
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:22,419
but some some colleagues that I have worked with worked with prison guards

103
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:27,670
just to sort of make them aware that certain prisoners were parents and that,

104
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:31,570
you know, this is how they would interact, especially with young children.

105
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:37,450
And so they were sort of just gathering data on like the type of interaction between parents and children during visitation.

106
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:41,679
And they said that it wasn't even trying to be an intervention with the guards,

107
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:46,089
but just sort of like bringing that to like to mind for the guards really kind

108
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:49,960
of changed the behavior of the guards who are running the visitation sessions.

109
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:54,640
And so I think absolutely that sort of physical context where you're going in.

110
00:12:55,420 --> 00:13:01,300
What is that like? There's. Opportunity for improvement there, for sure.

111
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:02,950
Lots of settings.

112
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:11,200
What other considerations that that person were getting and getting children to the visitation sessions and like who's bringing them?

113
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:22,059
Well, we just like proximity like that. It's like a grandparent or a caregiver who might have their own feelings about the parent being in prison

114
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:27,080
and their own like stigma around that may not want to bring the child if they're now the caregiver,

115
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:33,430
caregiver or may not want to go. So so I see that as a barrier for kids.

116
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,940
Yeah. That's a lot. That's like a huge issue. Right.

117
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:47,019
So the resentment may be like caregiver toward parent parents, toward caregiver, you know, all directions.

118
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:55,810
And then as the child ages and develops, it's very different to sort of manage this with a four year old compared to a 13 year old.

119
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,890
Right. Yeah, I've see kind of going off that, um,

120
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:07,450
like a lot of times prisons only manage a certain amount of like people comment doesn't sound like it may have a big

121
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:13,660
family where you have to pick and choose what your children are bearing and then which family members can come in.

122
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:21,840
Could be really hard to kind of automate that and. Again, she seemed apparent without mixing some of the kids.

123
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:25,780
And I mean, you don't take multiple trips. Yeah. Yeah.

124
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:31,680
And like a long day. A long day with, again, like four year olds who might want to fall on the floor.

125
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:35,670
Yeah. I would also say, to add on to that,

126
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:39,299
like people were their kids weren't just seeing their parents who might might not want to

127
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:44,160
leave them and them because that might be one of the great foundation in the long term.

128
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:49,980
Or like some parents, like, don't want their kids to see it like that so they don't bring them over.

129
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:54,630
All right. Yeah, absolutely. I'll communicate in a different way.

130
00:14:54,870 --> 00:15:00,740
I'll give the child something. And then you're you're also bringing up that issue, like, what is the child's like?

131
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:04,319
The child's going to be stirred up probably at some way.

132
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,360
And like we've talked about that lots of different trauma,

133
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:14,729
things like it may be hard to link whatever behavior's coming out later to that visit or you may be like looking for something and you're like,

134
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:18,540
They seem fine, they seem fine. But then like a week later, some big event happens.

135
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:23,220
And so for the caregiver to kind of contain all that, especially if they have,

136
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:29,760
you know, resentment or upset with the parent or about the situation, it's a lot.

137
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:34,589
Yeah. Thinking about that. And then I was also thinking about like the opposite actually happening,

138
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:40,500
especially like depending on the age, like thinking about, like younger children.

139
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:43,590
Like, depending on the frequency of the visits.

140
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:48,840
Like they may not no longer have that like attachment or bond or have trouble developing that.

141
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:53,060
So it may actually be like a fear response for them instead of like that.

142
00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:01,290
Yeah. So just thinking about yeah. Now it seems like frequency and like length of the time of the visit and like I don't really know,

143
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:05,790
but like the process, the time waiting to even before the visit actually happens.

144
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:11,040
I'm thinking about like logistics and also like the age of the child.

145
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:24,450
Absolutely. Like logistics, emotional prep a lot around what's the context of where you're seeing that person child memory and you know,

146
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:32,760
how much contact has been sort of, you know, been able to be kept going and even.

147
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:42,540
Yeah, I mean, then as the child gets older, I think we see this a lot that more sort of resentment of the whole situation and a greater understanding.

148
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:48,540
You know, and so I think a lot of these things around visitation can be really,

149
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:58,110
really challenging to kind of think through and also just contain and a developmentally appropriate and family sensitive way.

150
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:10,979
Absolutely. A lot of the programs that are sort of child focused, I would say, are kind of on the outside of the correctional facility.

151
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:15,389
And so, again, lots of lots of room for improvement in visitation.

152
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:25,410
But, um, an area that has been kind of a great focus of a lot of intervention in this space is our mentoring programs.

153
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:32,370
And so, you know, I don't know if anybody has participated in mentoring programs of any type, but, you know,

154
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:39,270
there's wonderful things about mentoring programs, but there are also some challenges in terms of just being able to have a consistent,

155
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:46,260
you know, person relationship mentor for the child can be a challenge because, you know, for example,

156
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:52,889
a lot of mentors can be college students or other kinds of students, and they're in a place for a while and then they can move on.

157
00:17:52,890 --> 00:18:00,900
And it's not to say that that's necessarily bad, but in this population that's had a lot of relationship disruption already,

158
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:08,940
maybe that can actually be maybe I after genic per hour like discussion last time so it's a it's one of those things

159
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:15,179
like from the program side really important to think through like who are the mentors can they stay you know,

160
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:21,150
is there a way to, you know, have that happen but have it be more of a consistent relationship?

161
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:25,770
Yeah. Do you feel okay just pondering this?

162
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:33,959
I think one of the things to also to point out just in general about sort of programing in this space is that

163
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:39,480
there aren't that many programs that really are family focused for the for those like caregivers on the outside.

164
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:50,549
And one thing that we haven't noted yet, but some of the caregivers, not always but often can be older and can, you know, have less job flexibility.

165
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:59,160
And when they can, like, drop everything and spend an entire day going to visit a family member or, you know, it's expense.

166
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:06,800
There are a lot of, um, kind of programs that do actually provide transportation.

167
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:14,219
Like that's their focus of transporting like grandma has to go see their child in a correctional facility.

168
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:17,340
But in general, I think this.

169
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:28,530
There's also an important space. There are a number of programs that sort of like focus on reentry and preventing recidivism.

170
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:38,850
And some of the issues there to think through are like, again, context, like what's the context that the person's going back to?

171
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:49,320
What are the relationships that the person who's getting out of prison or jail, you know, is what what is the nature of those relationships?

172
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:57,590
Are they supportive? Aren't they resentful? Lots of things come up here around housing and who can live in the house if you have a criminal record.

173
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:03,210
So there's lots of that's why that that picture you hear about like all the interacting systems, like there's many, many things.

174
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:11,350
But this is an area for like support for families that is needed, I would say, because there's so many of these sort of systems,

175
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:16,500
systemic things to work through even after maybe even especially after people get out.

176
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:22,470
So that's really important to keep in mind from the children side.

177
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,150
See if my little video will work.

178
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:31,320
I don't know if you guys are familiar with this, but Sesame Street has done a lot of work in lots of different places,

179
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:39,389
but they have done some videos on incarceration and have, you know, developed characters that have an incarcerated parent.

180
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:43,440
And so that's always, again, when we're talking about little kids can be effective.

181
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:52,829
I wanted to play this little video and see what your guys thoughts were and any areas for improvement.

182
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:56,790
So let's see if it plays. Oh, yes, let's see.

183
00:20:56,790 --> 00:21:00,419
Hopefully show. This is my favorite picture.

184
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:10,139
Me and my daddy used to take me to the park all the time, but he can't right now because my dad is in prison today.

185
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:15,030
We're going to visit him. Me and my mom and my little brother Michael are going to take a bus.

186
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:24,500
So already there we've got transportation as an issue away from the walls of this prison.

187
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:28,730
We can talk to Danny exam, but we're not allowed to touch.

188
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:32,060
You just can't wait to see him already.

189
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,750
The walls are top of the prison with lots of gates and wires everywhere.

190
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:44,420
I hold Mom's hand a little tighter as we walk in and she lets me know it's okay.

191
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:50,950
Sometimes we have to wait on line a long time before we can see my daddy.

192
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:55,510
He passed through lab gates that opened and closed behind us.

193
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:02,090
Then we go on to another room where we have to wait again.

194
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:11,870
I know. So even before they see Dad, what are some of the things that are kind of noticeable there?

195
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:17,930
Yeah. And we touch on like a lot of the sensory overload that probably happens when a kid is in prison.

196
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:21,480
Like they're seeing scary things or weird noises.

197
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:26,360
They have to, like, wait in line to sit still, which I thought was really great.

198
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:35,240
Yeah, I think they kind of point out and like, person's point, like this is sort of a context that maybe it's big, it's unfamiliar, lots of noise.

199
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:40,190
That was a very calm little two year old at the moment, like strolling in.

200
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:49,519
But yeah, yeah. And two kids, which is which was also not, you know, maybe not as many kids as could sometimes people.

201
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:57,390
Maybe that's all that's out there and. They did note the transportation.

202
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:08,620
Many weren't allowed to touch three dogs, which I was looking at.

203
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:17,740
And I. But yeah, the fact that they can get enough that they can encourage them to do little things like having a hunger.

204
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:21,060
Yeah. Just things like that they can experience.

205
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:23,720
Yeah. And such a natural reaction.

206
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:31,190
And again, like with the little, you know, maybe this kid seems maybe around seven or eight maybe or something like that.

207
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:41,629
And the littler one that's going to be really hard to describe and I'll say it again if you want to type at the program.

208
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:49,790
But one of the the person that I have worked with on this on this work in Flint, they talk about full body contact visits.

209
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:58,280
And so specially for little kids having a visit that's not contact is it is really, really difficult.

210
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:02,600
So there's a lot of like video visitation and sometimes, again, we worry about like,

211
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:06,889
would it be better, I forget who are saying like, maybe I'll just send a card, you know,

212
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:09,200
or maybe I'll send my picture or you know, there's,

213
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:16,100
there's some ways that littler kids that don't have that sort of object permanence and real sense of attachment relationship.

214
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:22,030
But it may not it may be more problematic than not to have a physical visitation.

215
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:26,870
So. Feel like those are the main things.

216
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,810
Okay, so let's see what happens when dad comes in. My daddy comes in.

217
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:35,790
His hair is a little longer than last time. It's good to see him.

218
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:42,690
At first I forget everything I want to tell him. But then we start talking and it gets easier.

219
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:48,930
Daddy says how proud he is of us for helping Mom at home and for all the things we're learning.

220
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:54,570
It's hard not to be able to touch her, hug each other. But Daddy blows me a kiss.

221
00:24:55,470 --> 00:25:00,110
I tell him we'll save it for later. Before we know it.

222
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:04,040
It's time to go already. I don't want to say goodbye.

223
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:09,740
I wish Daddy would come with us. But this is where he has to be.

224
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:14,810
Because he broke a lot. But we all look forward to the next time we can come and visit again.

225
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:21,540
As we take the bus back home, I think about daddy going back to what he does in prison.

226
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:29,160
And I know [INAUDIBLE] be thinking about me, just like I'm thinking about him.

227
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:40,329
So I know. It's like, um. What what else?

228
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:49,390
About. What about, like, the actual interaction, sort of interaction behind a behind a plexiglass with a question what's going on?

229
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:56,520
Like the technicalities with, like, everything that have, like the, like the one where they're like sitting across the table.

230
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:04,810
It's sort of a combination of the level of security and the sort of facilities of the prison.

231
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:13,350
So there's not necessarily a hard and fast rule about that facility set up.

232
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:18,509
And there also there wasn't like a phone and it wasn't via video.

233
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:24,299
So video is increasingly common because the technology has gotten more accessible.

234
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:31,740
And I think it's easy. It is easier to monitor that compared to a in person that's sitting across the table.

235
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:35,790
But. I think it's it's tricky.

236
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:40,950
Yeah, I thought about that time, especially specifically for the parents,

237
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:45,270
that that they had to take public transportation to get to the heart of the matter and

238
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:51,839
won't even get a room with them once they're in the room for the parent to come out.

239
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:57,930
And then it seems like it was just like a short visit for them to take public transportation all the way back.

240
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:04,319
So just like the time that the primary caregiver has to take a good day in this process,

241
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:09,690
even though it's worth it, but like just like it might not be for everybody and they might do work.

242
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:14,610
Or like you said, there could be other kids that aren't allowed to constantly be going to prison has been a

243
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:19,979
rule about how many different kinds of people or someone to take care of the other kids.

244
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:24,360
And it just seems like a lot is so.

245
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:31,170
And then it's usually like Saturdays too. So it also is one of these things where like if you're trying to do things like.

246
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:37,139
You know, sports or other things that might fill your time in a really positive way.

247
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:43,140
But it sort of is interfering with that time frame and just the length of time.

248
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:47,670
Right. Because she said, I think, you know, it felt like a short visit.

249
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:52,379
And also there was a little bit of that warm up period was like, I felt a little uncomfortable.

250
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:55,650
But then I started talking and it was good and then it ended.

251
00:27:55,750 --> 00:28:05,220
And so, you know, that that sort of time factor and we know that children's conceptions of time develop rapidly,

252
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:13,170
but really aren't are very kind of not like adult conceptions of time until sort of like early adolescence or later.

253
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:21,480
So that's important to just kind of keep in mind as well that janika the mother was really cool.

254
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:25,080
Yeah, it was really cool. What my mom said, it's great.

255
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:29,939
Yeah. Like. I like them all.

256
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:34,360
They're. Yeah.

257
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:42,610
Yeah. And, like, maybe as the mother, you'd want to, like, go by yourself the first time so you can get it, you know, together, too.

258
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:45,790
Then when you bring your kids there, you know. Yeah.

259
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:49,749
I'm also thinking of like, if this is the other parents, only time to see their parents,

260
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:54,940
like whether they're, like still in relationship or just trying to like get parent updated,

261
00:28:54,940 --> 00:29:02,650
like how you balance like adult conversations that may need to happen about like family updates and everything else that's going on.

262
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:07,780
Or do you just let like the kids talk and like, tell me about school sports.

263
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:13,450
Do you make a kid, like, sit through all that adult conversation? And I imagine that's really difficult to balance.

264
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:18,159
Yeah. And that actually we did a little it wasn't even an evaluation.

265
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:24,460
I got like we did like a little many, many, many assessment of some of these full body contact visits in the jail.

266
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:31,959
And that was a huge issue. So like the parent who wanted to brought the kid in to see or the caregiver,

267
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:43,150
in most cases the incarcerated other parent like really needed to get some business talk done with the with the parent who was there and the kids.

268
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:54,700
I mean, that was just such a tough balance between like having it be a kid oriented activity and like a lot of key information needed to like pass.

269
00:29:54,700 --> 00:30:03,600
And so that was really, really a big challenge, I think, for these visits and even more so if they're sort of behind barriers and that kind of thing.

270
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:10,870
So and I think, you know, I think in general, I think Sesame Street does tend to do a good job about many things.

271
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:15,249
And so they do have a whole sort of toolkit on incarceration.

272
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:21,159
And they also have one that we'll talk about later, too, on kids, you know, who are unhoused.

273
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:29,889
And they just it's a good resource for anybody who's working in spaces like what particular populations that might need these.

274
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:35,469
And I will say overall, like the last ten years, there's been a lot more done in this space.

275
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:43,780
And Sesame Street has really been like leading the charge on a lot of it, a lot of great like kid's books and literature as well.

276
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:51,430
So you guys have that sort of talked about what we kind of video.

277
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:55,750
So thinking through some of this stuff,

278
00:30:56,870 --> 00:31:03,519
I thought we'd do a little break out and just sort of ponder this question and come up with some considerations that

279
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:14,290
seem like that would be important and think about ways to support children and families experience incarceration.

280
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:22,119
So we can just take a few minutes, some of the things we've talked about a little bit, but what do we need to think about?

281
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:26,859
Like if we were talking about programs that we would put in place,

282
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:30,219
where might it be important to put those in place and what would we want to

283
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:36,490
think through if we were trying to develop ways to support kids and families?

284
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:45,730
So it looks like we could actually even just do a quick pairing because we are sort of low numbers today.

285
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:50,910
Yeah. So what else can we pair up? Thank you, guys.

286
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:56,540
Three and two here. I just want people to go by their side.

287
00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:05,670
Obviously, that's going to. You know, something that can happen.

288
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:14,600
However, you know, it's groups of two and three and then I can kind of float around.

289
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:23,549
But if you guys want to like jot down or, you know, come up with like two key considerations to support kids and families experiencing incarceration.

290
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:28,600
If you're a program developer, what would be like important to.

291
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:38,650
To put in your program. And people have paper they don't.

292
00:32:45,990 --> 00:33:02,420
Right. And they are supporting these folks.

293
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:09,760
You seem like you're just looking at.

294
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:39,360
I feel like since life that it's like your support during a lot of years has gone.

295
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:48,090
That seems pretty profound.

296
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:52,270
And I guess we I can see something as.

297
00:33:56,070 --> 00:34:15,500
I don't know. I think that it was wonderful to know that you're going to know everything about.

298
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:31,810
It's a different. I feel like I know a lot about the.

299
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:41,700
So, like, maybe, like, crazy, like, yeah, yeah.

300
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:50,410
Like those kind of things, like other things.

301
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:54,280
And I'm like, we're fine.

302
00:34:55,920 --> 00:35:03,080
We're not going to be like.

303
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:25,580
Another funny thing is like that was so much and I was like, Oh, I could.

304
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:33,660
You know.

305
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:46,939
Have they were. That is what I have been talking about.

306
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:50,090
That. Said.

307
00:35:53,810 --> 00:36:15,640
What does? You know, it's kind of like I don't know if you really want to put it like that, but also like, oh.

308
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:24,190
So I like I really like girls.

309
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:37,080
So I don't know how to shut down.

310
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:50,510
I can. I.

311
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:04,920
Very. You guys are busy.

312
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:12,040
I know a thing or two about the music industry.

313
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:41,100
Because, you know, I think one thing I would like to know about what we're talking about is that I don't really think.

314
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:50,440
I would like to spend. Hey.

315
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:59,740
We need to have something to report out on what recommendations are.

316
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:07,470
And I don't mean to hamper discussion we don't like.

317
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:15,420
It's like instant quiet. Sorry. Yeah.

318
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:22,330
Okay. So just thinking about again, broad key considerations for programs.

319
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:27,560
What did people come up with? And things to consider. So see?

320
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:32,050
So I can't remember. Yeah.

321
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:39,760
So over there, we talked about a support group, especially for, like, younger kids.

322
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:44,280
Mm hmm. But a and. And what's going on?

323
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:48,970
Understanding about, like, how actions have consequences.

324
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:55,360
Preparing them for events that they are visiting.

325
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:06,010
Okay. Good. So like a child focused like arm of programing that was with peers.

326
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:11,540
Support group. Absolutely. And that actually brings up something else that she said in the video about like because he broke the law.

327
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:15,200
So like, there's that whole element of understanding what's what's that about? Yeah.

328
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:29,510
We talked about like, maybe if there's a program for for offering like weekend like supervised daycare hours so that if they're still married,

329
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:38,140
can have visits with their partner without their child and still, importantly, have that balance between the two.

330
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:42,490
So easing the burden of like not having to find childcare, you know,

331
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:48,380
something to watch their kid during those times that they don't want to bring that up that they be okay.

332
00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:51,510
Yeah, that could be important, like a respite care kind of thing.

333
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:55,340
And especially if they're then all of a sudden doing it on their own if they hadn't been before.

334
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:59,359
Absolutely. Great idea, Carly. We talked about something similar to that.

335
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:05,989
We're having like child friendly visitation and terms instead of just going in, sitting behind glass.

336
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:07,940
If the parent is exhibiting,

337
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:17,180
exhibiting good behavior and present or maybe establish a program that would promote good behavior for the parents to be able to be with their kids,

338
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:23,660
with age appropriate activities for the child and let them have that bonding time.

339
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:33,680
Of course, probably supervised, supervised and with the caveat that the parent is exhibiting good behavior present,

340
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:40,760
but to allow them to sit on the floor and play cards with their child or something during that time instead of through the glass.

341
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:44,900
Yeah. So kind of like a naturalistic interaction kind of setup.

342
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:47,360
Absolutely. That's that's great. Yeah.

343
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:58,160
We've got to talk more about the transition out of incarceration and how that can be a very precarious time for, you know, the parent and the child.

344
00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:04,040
So we talk about like financial support because it's hard to get a job after maybe prison or jail.

345
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:10,100
We talked about like emotional and social support for both the child and the parent because the parent's been in the,

346
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:15,590
you know, the jail for who knows how long. And it can be very emotionally taxing.

347
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:21,830
And it's just how do you then connect with the child once you get out? Some parents are like, I don't even know my child anymore, you know?

348
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:28,310
So and then we also talked about custody and how that could, you know, affect the whole thing to like, cool.

349
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:37,700
How does that even work? Like who gets custody if they get if one parent gets sole custody, one man, one parent is incarcerated.

350
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:41,000
How do you reconcile that, you know, once you get out?

351
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:47,450
Absolutely. All those transitions and remember, like everywhere from like the still face experiment, you know,

352
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:52,160
the babies to the all the separation stuff, like it's this process and it is not simple.

353
00:41:52,170 --> 00:42:02,180
So absolutely on that back end, you need a lot of creativity, support and like systems knowledge because all of those things just weigh heavily.

354
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:10,129
Yeah. You know, so we've talked a little bit about like racism and I think it was the fact she was saying like I think it's like one in

355
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:19,530
nine black children have a parent that's incarcerated and has been a for him it was like 3115 or something like that.

356
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:19,820
Um,

357
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:31,040
so coupling like programs for children and families with like policy advocacy around like overpolicing of like black and brown communities and like,

358
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:34,700
or advocating like on behalf of children like these are the,

359
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:41,410
the Department of Rights of like a child being separated from parent because they're in prison and like do really need to be doing that.

360
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:45,229
Like many people really even need to be in prison.

361
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:52,880
Is that the best like kind of as a broad topic, like are prisons even in the right approach?

362
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:55,490
Right, right. Absolutely.

363
00:42:55,490 --> 00:43:04,700
So I think that bigger like top down policy level, bigger discussion by amplifying some of these like child factors and family stressors.

364
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:10,419
Absolutely. And sort of marrying those approaches. Yeah. And actually have more of the questions.

365
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:20,930
So how do like to look for is more of a background of intervention but right parents like the caregiver and parent and the

366
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:30,680
gravity of the situation by the other parents in jail and that communication with other kids like how do you like approach that.

367
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:35,540
Yeah you talk to them without confusing them in like changing their perspective of their pain.

368
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:43,920
Would that peer right in terms of how much like information to share with the child whose parent is incarcerated?

369
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:47,560
Yeah, I mean, I think that is a it's a great question.

370
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:54,590
It's a hard issue and it is really sort of individual family vary varies by individual family circumstance.

371
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:59,520
But that is certainly like if we're talking. About like family based interventions.

372
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:04,670
That's like a module of the intervention that one wouldn't want to address.

373
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:13,170
You know, how are you going to represent this parents condition or current experience to the child?

374
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:18,750
Considering their development, considering how long it might be like it may not be that long.

375
00:44:18,810 --> 00:44:27,750
If it's jail, it has to be under a year. If it's prison, it's probably longer and it's probably more distant from the child's life or geography.

376
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:31,350
QUESTION And so all of those things really weigh in.

377
00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:38,310
And what is the relationship between the person and the child and the person I met incarcerated the caregiver in incarcerated parents?

378
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:43,979
And what was the child's relationship? What the like would be incarcerated parent earlier like?

379
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:48,670
Did they have much of a relationship with that parent? It may be that the child didn't have much of a relationship.

380
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:52,830
Relations with the parent. Parent might have been not resident with the child.

381
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:57,149
You know, the parent is incarcerated. The child has no idea.

382
00:44:57,150 --> 00:45:01,620
And it doesn't really matter to the child because they never saw the parent anyway.

383
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:07,230
That's so different from having your mom as your primary caregiver arrested in front of you and taken away.

384
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:11,400
Those are not comparable situations and yet it's all kind of lumped together.

385
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:16,780
So it's a really good question and there's so much individual variability and it's kind of

386
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:23,700
again thinking about the programs that are not necessarily like change the big system.

387
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:30,840
Yeah. What are the other other thoughts or comments from other groups?

388
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:35,730
Good suggestions. Yeah.

389
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:42,150
So they are. There are some, again, big kind of reports around this.

390
00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:44,969
So this idea of engaging caregivers who are not incarcerated.

391
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:50,280
So that's sort of one of those issues like how to work with the caregivers and give the caregivers support.

392
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:57,990
Considered children's ages. Consider the parent's role in the child's life so that those are all through this family.

393
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:07,049
Family issues collaborate across systems, which is what we're talking about, and addressing barriers to engagement.

394
00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:15,210
Because one thing that hasn't come up so far is stigma, because that's a big thing potentially.

395
00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:19,890
And so that might be a case where like the caregivers, like, you know what,

396
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:25,680
there might be like a peer group for, you know, you kid that are not taking care of.

397
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:30,359
But I don't want to go to that peer group like I don't want you to go to that peer group.

398
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:34,020
Like, I don't want anybody to know that your parent is incarcerated.

399
00:46:34,290 --> 00:46:37,920
And that's related also to like how you represent the experience to the child.

400
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:44,520
So all like I used to live in Rhode Island and there's this town Cranston there.

401
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:50,190
And, you know, I and my fellow trainees didn't know that, but there was a big prison there.

402
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:58,260
And so some of the moms we would interview would say, oh, you know, my you know, the fathers at the College of Cranston, which really was the prison.

403
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:03,510
And the first time I heard that, I was like, Oh, that's great contrast and like getting, you know, further in education.

404
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:08,280
But that was like the shorthand for what that prison was known as.

405
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:14,219
And so how do you represent those two kids, you know, and how do you change that representation?

406
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:16,890
And that matters, you know, and you can do it.

407
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:24,120
Choose to do it differently as the family, if it's a ten year situation or if it's a one year situation, etc.

408
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:35,400
So all of those individual variables change the calculus of what you do, but and then promoting financial stability, which is a huge issue.

409
00:47:37,410 --> 00:47:44,460
So if people are interested, I put a link to that report and then this is some other stuff to consider.

410
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:51,690
Some came up and that the issue between like the caregiver and the parent that's really like this caregiving alliance.

411
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:59,879
We talk about that in a lot of different parenting type things, but this is a very specific context and there's also a lot of gatekeeping, right?

412
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:06,120
So the caregiver has to in order to have that lovely, like calm mom visitation happening,

413
00:48:06,810 --> 00:48:10,660
that mom has to make a lot of effort and decide that that visitation is worth doing.

414
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:16,380
So that's a big a big piece of caregiving alliance. That kind of quality can really drive that.

415
00:48:18,510 --> 00:48:23,280
The other thing to think about effective programing in terms of with the parent

416
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:26,999
or with family members are all these other things that we know are good,

417
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:32,790
right? So communication style is clear. Communication, mental health treatment, addiction treatment.

418
00:48:33,150 --> 00:48:37,250
And then I think it was Joe, you said like, you know,

419
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:42,510
parenting support and parenting education for the parent who is incarcerated as well

420
00:48:42,510 --> 00:48:48,960
as for the for the caregiver can both be helpful and then reentry and visitation.

421
00:48:49,690 --> 00:49:00,510
Okay. So the other thing about interventions is that this because of the kind of context and the restrictive context of correctional facilities is,

422
00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:08,610
you know, some are all women, some are all men. You know, some are programs that can perhaps involve both parents.

423
00:49:08,610 --> 00:49:12,840
But that's pretty rare. And especially if one parent is incarcerated, one parent is not.

424
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:22,200
Think about how to establish co-parenting dynamics with that set up difficult caregivers on the outside, children on the outside.

425
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:28,049
And then I mentioned prison nurseries are like a very specific type of intervention.

426
00:49:28,050 --> 00:49:35,760
So those are all like focal parts of the family where interventions exist.

427
00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:44,100
But you can imagine like it's hard to have sort of whole family interventions because one of the parents is is incarcerated.

428
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:50,820
Some other implementation considerations are I mentioned jail versus prison.

429
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:55,379
So jail is more short term and it's more unpredictable.

430
00:49:55,380 --> 00:50:03,590
So if you're thinking from the from the like side of the implementer and again, this is thinking about like those, you know,

431
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:09,420
intervention papers, these are you know, I don't know if anybody is doing this topic, but these are the other things to consider.

432
00:50:10,950 --> 00:50:13,379
If you're doing an intervention in a jail setting,

433
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:19,350
your population is going to probably turn over a lot more quickly than if you're doing an intervention in a prison setting.

434
00:50:19,830 --> 00:50:23,340
And then I think Carly mentioned also the like good behavior piece, right?

435
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:31,920
So that's certainly an issue for any kind of incarceration, correctional setting based intervention, the tendencies of.

436
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:34,930
Big issue, addiction, mental health.

437
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:44,229
I certainly think we know that prisons right now are like the number one mental health institution in our country.

438
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:50,160
And so that there's a lot to be done in that space giving people choice.

439
00:50:50,170 --> 00:50:55,570
And I think that this question of like good behavior is really interesting and important because,

440
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:02,410
you know, treating parenting programs as a like a reward, it makes sense on a lot of levels.

441
00:51:02,410 --> 00:51:07,930
But at the same time, it's sort of stigmatizing, you know, bad behavior in that context.

442
00:51:07,930 --> 00:51:11,440
And that's already a challenge. So it's it's a little bit tricky.

443
00:51:12,550 --> 00:51:19,420
And then who is the interventionists? And then visitation options there in terms of intervention mean like like as Carly kind of described,

444
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:26,530
like do you have the opportunity to have like practice for your parenting behaviors that you've been talking about in a parenting intervention?

445
00:51:26,830 --> 00:51:35,110
Or is it just all abstract? And the only time you can see your your child is like through the glass, you know, once a month or less.

446
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:44,110
And then the other thing with interventions and correctional settings is that evaluation is really hard because control groups are really difficult,

447
00:51:44,110 --> 00:51:48,700
partly because who gets to go to the intervention? Maybe that's tied to good behavior.

448
00:51:48,910 --> 00:51:56,500
You know, again, using air quotes are good behavior, but are those, you know,

449
00:51:56,500 --> 00:52:00,790
parents who are getting to go to the parenting intervention because of good behavior?

450
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:03,040
Maybe there is less mental health consideration,

451
00:52:03,050 --> 00:52:08,170
maybe there's less substance use or withdrawal considerations going on for those parents than for other parents.

452
00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:18,280
So who's your control group in terms of your intervention and having tried having having done many years of parenting interventions and jail contexts,

453
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:23,829
which again, like there's high turnover, it's really, really hard to get a control group.

454
00:52:23,830 --> 00:52:28,090
And then the follow up for people who have participated in a parenting intervention

455
00:52:28,090 --> 00:52:32,740
in the prison or jail setting is also really hard because after people leave,

456
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:39,640
they don't want to, you know, usually talk about what they did in the prison or jail setting.

457
00:52:39,650 --> 00:52:42,760
So all of these sort of design features can be a little challenging.

458
00:52:43,150 --> 00:52:47,860
Yeah, I threw that door again like her little ghost.

459
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:56,170
So yeah. So there's all sorts of considerations in this space and I think that that Future of Children piece does a good job kind of laying those out.

460
00:52:58,060 --> 00:53:01,480
I'll talk a little bit more about that, I think.

461
00:53:03,510 --> 00:53:09,930
Yeah. At first I got to look at the writing on a board. Yeah, right.

462
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:19,080
Yeah. Well, yeah. So I wanted to just go through a few some quick examples locally.

463
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:26,490
So this mother on her section is a group that I've worked with for a long time, and they're based in Flint.

464
00:53:26,490 --> 00:53:31,440
And then there are a lot of different kinds of programing options that they've developed over time.

465
00:53:32,730 --> 00:53:35,880
And then this is even closer.

466
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:42,930
This called the Staying Closer Touch Program, which is run through the Children's Literacy Network.

467
00:53:42,930 --> 00:53:51,030
And so Children's Literacy Network for people who are interested, are really trying to focus on enhancing literacy for kids in Washtenaw County.

468
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:58,020
So they're involved in lots of different settings. So if people are interested in literacy, talk to me and I can hook you up with them.

469
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:06,509
The Stay In Closer Touch program is not a visitation program, but it's a book reading program so that people,

470
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:12,090
parents who are incarcerated can choose a book for their child, read a book to their child, and then the child gets the book.

471
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:17,070
And so there are a few, few programs that are kind of like this one is called the Messages Project.

472
00:54:17,070 --> 00:54:26,639
It's based out of Virginia. One of the challenges of challenges with these programs is that they all everything that that leaves

473
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:32,790
the correctional setting needs to be vetted and reviewed by correctional staff setting staff.

474
00:54:32,790 --> 00:54:42,180
And so, you know, there's always concern about like, is there a hidden message in this child's book that's kind of going out to the child and family?

475
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:48,660
And so it's there's a whole lot of sort of logistical difficulties with programs like this.

476
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:57,270
At the same time, it's a relatively I don't know, seems effective way to kind of keep that relationship going.

477
00:54:57,270 --> 00:55:03,479
And this one is really focused on also literacy promotion, too. So for the adults as well as the kids.

478
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:08,040
Oh, my gosh. Oh, I'm sorry. Okay.

479
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:13,980
So just to go through a little bit and if people are interested, I can again connect you with these agencies.

480
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:22,709
So this is motherly intercession. I used to have Shirley Cochrane, who's the former director, come and present with me, but she's like,

481
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:27,360
Alison, I do not want to go to Ann Arbor and Park and that's cool, but I understand.

482
00:55:28,410 --> 00:55:33,870
So anyway, she had started this project initially,

483
00:55:33,870 --> 00:55:40,499
like she and her husband were watching TV and it was Christmas and there was like a report on the kids who were in,

484
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:46,559
you know, whose parents were whose moms were in jail and who were not to get Christmas presents.

485
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:53,310
And so she and her husband, like, rallied their friends and like got Christmas presents for everybody and like brought them to the kids.

486
00:55:53,310 --> 00:55:56,280
And so that was sort of the start of this agency.

487
00:55:56,280 --> 00:56:04,019
And I think that one thing that was really great is that they really talked to and knew their population and they were like, What do you guys need?

488
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:11,490
Like what would be helpful? What is, you know, programing that would be, you know, responsive to what you what you need.

489
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:19,469
And so some of these are Shirley slides. So they really focus both on the parents and the alternate caregivers.

490
00:56:19,470 --> 00:56:28,080
So that idea of like the whole family and then we talk about different components of different programs.

491
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:34,319
So I'll just show you examples. So they have a lot of work.

492
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:37,050
I sort of like with the kids directly.

493
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:46,620
So this idea of like building a peer group, trying to reduce stigma, all this programing happens for kids through different connections within Flint,

494
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:54,750
but there are things like field trips, academic support and mentoring that happen, and that's all sort of child focused and directed.

495
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:58,559
And then there is also visitation. There's a visitation component.

496
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:02,760
So that's what talking about this full body visitation and not everybody gets full body visitation.

497
00:57:03,870 --> 00:57:11,849
One reason that this can be can happen and that full body visitation could happen at all is that, you know,

498
00:57:11,850 --> 00:57:20,669
the agency has really close relationships with the sheriff, and the sheriff's office was basically the one to say, okay, we'll let you try this out.

499
00:57:20,670 --> 00:57:27,840
So back to that idea of like you need to sort of build relationships with key stakeholders if you're trying to do an intervention in a setting.

500
00:57:27,870 --> 00:57:31,560
Right. And this is a very particular setting and a hard one to do intervention then.

501
00:57:33,570 --> 00:57:36,090
And then the other component is working with the caregivers.

502
00:57:37,170 --> 00:57:43,950
So that's sort of a, you know, one example of like a community based program that's trying to work on all these fronts.

503
00:57:44,310 --> 00:57:51,959
And that van is there because basically what they did is that they would drive around to, you know,

504
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:58,440
kids and families houses to pick them up and bring them in to the to the setting to sort of reduce that transportation barrier.

505
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:03,120
And so, for example, we would like write grants to different agencies and.

506
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:10,139
Say, like, we need this thousand dollars for the van. And it was like in the grant proposal, because if that hadn't been in the grant proposal,

507
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:14,310
like the program wouldn't happen because the families and kids were not. There's just too much going on.

508
00:58:14,310 --> 00:58:22,350
They couldn't have gotten to the center for the thing and the girl eating there is just a reminder to say, like,

509
00:58:22,350 --> 00:58:27,910
of course we offered food and we offered to child care and all those good things that you do with interventions.

510
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,280
Um, let's see. Oh yeah. The other thing,

511
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:37,860
and actually this is what General 100 were noting is that one of the most recent

512
00:58:37,860 --> 00:58:42,840
things that they've been doing is basically signing up parents when they're in jail,

513
00:58:43,030 --> 00:58:47,069
when they're about to get out for services, for different social services.

514
00:58:47,070 --> 00:59:01,020
And so then they can come to the center and kind of have like seamless, uh, social support or financial supports when they leave jail.

515
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:08,879
So that signing up for like different SNAP programs happens sort of again through

516
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:12,690
this trusted center where all this other program is programing is happening.

517
00:59:12,690 --> 00:59:22,079
So I think it's a good example that has grown over time with a lot of deep relationships in the community to be able to offer all these programs for,

518
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:26,820
for kids and families. Um, let's see, I'll say a word.

519
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:32,280
We also this should look a little bit familiar because we talked about the Strengthening Families program before,

520
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:35,420
but this is one context where we did the Strengthening Families program.

521
00:59:35,430 --> 00:59:44,700
So one of those parenting programs and we did find a debrief on this, but we did find is that in this program,

522
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:52,110
we actually saw sort of a decrease in caregiver reported depression or sort of after doing this family based program.

523
00:59:53,430 --> 01:00:02,669
And some of the reasons I think we're just building a peer group and reducing that feeling of isolation that comes with, you know,

524
01:00:02,670 --> 01:00:10,530
why this child who I'm now responsible for and some of the caregivers had a relationship with the child and were like,

525
01:00:10,530 --> 01:00:14,040
Oh, yes, you're at my house all the time anyway, or you live with me anyway.

526
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:17,370
Some caregivers did not really have that kind of relationship with a child.

527
01:00:17,370 --> 01:00:22,439
And so the child was kind of, you know, brought into the caregivers life, but the caregiver was sort of not ready.

528
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:28,410
So one of the things that came up a lot for these caregivers was school and working with the child's school.

529
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:34,379
Maybe the child had to change schools if it was going to, you know, custody had to change.

530
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:38,670
So there was a lot that these caregivers were sort of managing that they were not used to managing.

531
01:00:38,670 --> 01:00:43,860
And so I think that was a really important piece of these peer groups were like, What's an IEP?

532
01:00:43,860 --> 01:00:50,940
Does your child have that? So there's like all this sort of like peer group discussion with the caregivers that occurred in these groups.

533
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:58,890
Um, another setting where we also did a version of the Strengthening Families program was in the jail.

534
01:00:59,850 --> 01:01:08,579
And so these are some of the issues that we faced in terms of trying to do this as an evaluated intervention.

535
01:01:08,580 --> 01:01:13,890
So like people's attendance was variable. People were out for various different reasons.

536
01:01:14,310 --> 01:01:17,670
Most people got released over the course of our parenting intervention.

537
01:01:17,670 --> 01:01:20,730
So then our follow ups, you know, it's hard to do follow up.

538
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:30,840
Um, a lot of people only attended one session and this was another thing here where we hope to have some child practice sessions.

539
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:35,190
So like talk about parenting, think about your motivations around parenting,

540
01:01:35,190 --> 01:01:42,690
your challenges in parenting, and then practice these things with your child. Those were hard to do in this jail setting at the time.

541
01:01:43,410 --> 01:01:49,739
Another thing is that the women really wanted to do journaling and which was great and it ended up great, but they couldn't.

542
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:52,799
There were a lot of issues of materials and taking things back to their cells,

543
01:01:52,800 --> 01:02:00,030
etc. I will say, having just run a few of these sessions, it's a very overcrowded space.

544
01:02:00,210 --> 01:02:06,540
And so we were kind of in a little room. We had windows all around the room and there was a guard right outside.

545
01:02:06,870 --> 01:02:13,170
And then outside there were just like people roaming constantly because the space was so overcrowded.

546
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:21,089
And so it was very challenging, kind of the getting back to like physical context in which to do a parenting intervention.

547
01:02:21,090 --> 01:02:27,360
And people felt kind of, I think like on display that said they liked it and they kept it going and they,

548
01:02:27,540 --> 01:02:36,690
you know, I think they still do a version of it even now. So that was an interesting experience and positive.

549
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:44,070
And so here just sort of getting some sense of these programs for the different caregivers.

550
01:02:44,550 --> 01:02:52,800
Um, so the yellow is the alternate caregivers feedback and then the white is the PWI are the parents feedback, the incarcerated parent.

551
01:02:52,800 --> 01:03:03,060
And so these were just some of the things that we, you know, covered and you know, again, like some things like this is like basic developmental.

552
01:03:03,650 --> 01:03:06,770
Like this class. We talk about what kids can do, what to expect of kids.

553
01:03:06,770 --> 01:03:11,910
Do you expect a toddler to, like, you know, resolve their negative emotions all the time?

554
01:03:11,930 --> 01:03:15,140
And so that was the kind of stuff we were talking about in some of these parenting interventions.

555
01:03:17,330 --> 01:03:20,840
What did you learn from this class? So this was from the caregivers again.

556
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:27,560
And these are just sort of their responses. And then this is from the parents in the class.

557
01:03:30,170 --> 01:03:34,909
And then what did you like least about the program? So the caregiver said, like it conflicts with your work schedule.

558
01:03:34,910 --> 01:03:38,330
It's hard to get here and hence the van.

559
01:03:39,380 --> 01:03:43,760
And then from the parents, they seemed to, on balance, really enjoy it.

560
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:48,980
But of course, it was really intense and tough sometimes, right, because you're talking about parenting your child.

561
01:03:49,940 --> 01:03:56,450
A lot of the women were not a lot, but some were definitely going through withdrawal during this parenting group.

562
01:03:56,450 --> 01:04:06,580
So like there are competing demands. But in general, I think it was a good model and I guess that they're still kind of keeping some of the going.

563
01:04:09,170 --> 01:04:11,900
I think I just mentioned this, they're keeping the going.

564
01:04:12,230 --> 01:04:18,920
I mentioned meals, transportation, you know, and other challenges, as with other many programs,

565
01:04:19,340 --> 01:04:25,819
other parenting programs, speaking again of like the the reentry stage,

566
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:30,139
there was a lot of requests for like financial support and hooking up with services,

567
01:04:30,140 --> 01:04:37,640
which was one of the reasons why the program did I think, a good responsive way put it in the am I bridges sign up at the agency.

568
01:04:40,910 --> 01:04:45,560
Okay so I could I could talk more about that. But I think we've actually covered a fair bit.

569
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:53,600
I'll say one more thing. So back to the question of what you guys were discussing, like what supports would you need to put in for implementation?

570
01:04:55,130 --> 01:04:58,700
Hold it. And so I mentioned the van.

571
01:04:58,700 --> 01:05:02,269
We have these two vans for a while. One broke down. That was a big problem.

572
01:05:02,270 --> 01:05:08,509
So that really like half the number that we could bring in to sessions there are you know,

573
01:05:08,510 --> 01:05:13,370
this is like this mentoring issue where you're trying to always recruit mentors that will stay and be in the area.

574
01:05:13,370 --> 01:05:21,230
So she really actually made the choice like a number of years ago that she would like recruit adults for the mentor like relationship.

575
01:05:21,830 --> 01:05:26,420
But she works a lot with like college students to kind of do other stuff with the agency.

576
01:05:26,420 --> 01:05:32,780
So people want to volunteer. She's like, Are you going to be around or are you going to be like enthusiastic for like a year?

577
01:05:32,780 --> 01:05:39,110
And then you go, So she really made a sort of choice to to address that mentoring issue as much as possible.

578
01:05:40,970 --> 01:05:49,430
There's a computer lab where kids come after school and get homework support and track track like literacy, what's what's around that.

579
01:05:49,910 --> 01:05:52,729
And then also just, you know, programing. So again,

580
01:05:52,730 --> 01:06:02,060
sort of those ideas of like building in special positive protective factors for kids who are experiencing this is a big focus of the program.

581
01:06:04,670 --> 01:06:10,490
Okay. I think that's just another for a motherly intercession.

582
01:06:13,580 --> 01:06:17,810
This is some of the data. I'll I'll skip through some of this.

583
01:06:18,260 --> 01:06:24,280
Again, happy to talk through more of this. But I wanted to. Get to the jail.

584
01:06:24,410 --> 01:06:31,440
One So this is the Family Research Center where you can sign up for stuff. So this is the all the stuff that's in the jail, just sort of thing again.

585
01:06:31,450 --> 01:06:34,960
So we're focused on this in carceral setting.

586
01:06:36,130 --> 01:06:41,110
These are the kinds of programs that we had. So this and that really are still going on.

587
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:46,840
So this was this bonding from a distance or this full body contact visitation in person.

588
01:06:47,230 --> 01:06:54,820
And again, that took like years to develop like the trust with the sheriff and the willingness to kind of try it out.

589
01:06:55,570 --> 01:06:59,440
But they did get to the point where the sheriff would have a case, for example, because,

590
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:03,759
of course, we have parents who are, you know, have abused their children pretty horribly.

591
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:08,110
And that's why they're in jail. Right. And so there'd be a case like that.

592
01:07:08,110 --> 01:07:13,959
And the sheriff would reach out to this agency and say, you know, what would you suggest?

593
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:21,040
So that, you know, it was kind of building this like cross-sector relationship between the correctional staff and,

594
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:26,199
you know, these agencies who are sort of more child and family focused to say, what should we do in that circumstance?

595
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:31,210
Should the child have visitation with the parent who, you know, has really done these awful things?

596
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:39,970
So parenting while incarcerated is the other program I was talking about that's like parent kind of education, parent training type program,

597
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:47,800
another program that existed and again around the peer support that you guys mentioned for caregivers was like a mom to mom mentoring program.

598
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:54,490
And then both of these are more of that like wraparound, you know, trying to address,

599
01:07:56,020 --> 01:07:59,739
you know, on an indigenous community, individual level, social determinants, right.

600
01:07:59,740 --> 01:08:04,600
And try to get assistance, especially upon release.

601
01:08:06,430 --> 01:08:11,110
And so I'll just say like there's a fairly high number of people who are still participating

602
01:08:11,110 --> 01:08:17,889
in these programs and a lot of children served and this full contact visit was up to one hour.

603
01:08:17,890 --> 01:08:24,850
So again, thinking about like the video short but you know, if you could make it longer,

604
01:08:24,850 --> 01:08:30,340
if you could make it in person, we think that would be probably better for kids.

605
01:08:33,310 --> 01:08:37,959
Okay. Any questions for us about the jail?

606
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:40,210
And that's helpful info and I'll share these slides.

607
01:08:40,210 --> 01:08:45,820
But just to sort of illustrate what it looks like to do programing in this setting, it's like really hard,

608
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:54,340
but it can be rewarding and might make a difference if you can actually sort of shift the culture and provide a little more support.

609
01:08:55,330 --> 01:08:59,860
Of course, during COVID, a lot of this stuff shut down, but it has been coming back.

610
01:09:02,380 --> 01:09:07,360
Okay. So again, if anybody is interested in this population or topic,

611
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:18,220
let me know and then I'll just end to say that was like kids at this dinner who have like a yearly dinner that's this weekend.

612
01:09:20,290 --> 01:09:24,069
But sort of here's this idea of like, here are those rights again.

613
01:09:24,070 --> 01:09:31,390
And here's some more specific, like, ways to operationalize those rights and like what they what they should look like.

614
01:09:31,990 --> 01:09:36,430
And so I would say, like, in this type of programing for this population,

615
01:09:36,430 --> 01:09:41,259
really important to take a developmental perspective, which I say all the time. But I think in this particular case,

616
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:47,770
it's really critical because of some of the things we were talking about earlier and then keep the focus on the whole family.

617
01:09:47,770 --> 01:09:51,700
So the alternate caregiver, that caregiver parent relationship is really,

618
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:59,290
really important and can kind of be like a make or break for how the child manages and the family manages the incarceration.

619
01:09:59,620 --> 01:10:02,889
And then kind of, as Caroline was saying earlier on,

620
01:10:02,890 --> 01:10:12,850
like advocate for policy changes and like use some of this knowledge and data and be able to be, you know, savvy about talking about it.

621
01:10:12,850 --> 01:10:17,560
If you have the opportunity to make a difference for this population, I think it's really important.

622
01:10:19,300 --> 01:10:25,420
Okay. So we can end there. And if anybody wants to do paper check, then I'll be here for the next few minutes.

623
01:10:25,420 --> 01:10:44,180
But that's it. Thank you. Wouldn't it be great if everyone.

624
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:51,650
I mean, my wife.

625
01:11:00,380 --> 01:11:18,180
And I love this kind of thing because this is like.

626
01:11:21,900 --> 01:11:25,820
Euro Africa to Africa.

627
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:57,940
I think at the end of the day, I just don't know if I'm.

628
01:12:02,650 --> 01:12:09,960
He's definitely interested in. I like information.

629
01:12:11,110 --> 01:12:17,560
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

630
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:25,540
Well, you know, like, there's some Shirley who I work with most closely, and so you're tired of.

631
01:12:25,670 --> 01:12:29,890
Yeah, that implies that she was a news reporter and.

632
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:34,030
Yeah, so I'm just gearing up.

633
01:12:34,850 --> 01:12:39,070
Yeah. So it's kind of fun.

634
01:12:39,310 --> 01:12:55,550
Yeah. But I like I actually decided to do that and, and, you know, I think so, yeah.

635
01:12:55,570 --> 01:13:03,940
Like I said, I was responsible for two different stories out in the summer.

636
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:09,030
Right. Look at the time I.

637
01:13:09,700 --> 01:13:14,510
That's great. I definitely have that.

638
01:13:14,540 --> 01:13:16,540
You're not in in recession.

639
01:13:16,690 --> 01:13:26,679
But yeah, I really think that that's like when there was like one in her that that's actually hurting my mother just say like I went in one day,

640
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:33,249
I was thinking, why did you get like she started, you know,

641
01:13:33,250 --> 01:13:46,450
thinking like you're gonna pretend like this summer you got to be like summer camp and never have done a lot of programing like this.

642
01:13:46,480 --> 01:14:00,180
Are you like my grandfather? Well, no matter what I did, I would love that I was a mentor for fifth grade girls who came from different households or,

643
01:14:00,210 --> 01:14:08,610
you know, their parents were incarcerated or during that addiction or even my kind of healing from childhood.

644
01:14:08,710 --> 01:14:16,340
It's like just from all different walks of life. So I definitely whenever there's like an opportunity in my class, I want to help them.

645
01:14:16,770 --> 01:14:22,410
I was just thinking about starting this summer because is it in order for it to be an internship at the start?

646
01:14:22,790 --> 01:14:25,619
Like, do I have to start it after the semester?

647
01:14:25,620 --> 01:14:32,159
But I would even like thinking about like starting in the summer, but then also continuing here throughout the school year.

648
01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:36,480
And I, I moved to Ann Arbor and that certainly has been there for me.

649
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:46,709
Yeah, but I am planning to stay in Michigan in this area like for years after like a lot of I like it so far and I'm like,

650
01:14:46,710 --> 01:14:52,210
yeah, I can stay here after graduation. So even interesting like, even like a long term thing.

651
01:14:52,860 --> 01:15:03,179
I mean, that would be that would be amazing. Yeah, I think it's it's really like showing like she's like a wonderful human and just one of those,

652
01:15:03,180 --> 01:15:08,700
like, you know, as with some agency, just like every now and then.

653
01:15:08,700 --> 01:15:16,020
She also had worked for many years at GM, and so she was like a financial kind of person.

654
01:15:16,030 --> 01:15:21,380
So she's just like good about, you know what I mean?

655
01:15:21,390 --> 01:15:32,060
And her. But she find that not only she has, but she does do emails and stuff for people.

656
01:15:34,430 --> 01:15:41,610
So within the last year there's a new director and I think they're really I think they're

657
01:15:41,610 --> 01:15:47,730
going to be successful in that sort of transition from like the founder something to like.

658
01:15:51,090 --> 01:15:55,840
Pretty average. So. So, yeah, that would be great.

659
01:15:55,860 --> 01:16:02,670
And it's really, it's been a great opportunity to work with a lot of the same people at.

660
01:16:05,730 --> 01:16:11,370
I've done a little. I can do that. I'm going to show it to you now.

661
01:16:11,370 --> 01:16:17,100
And just to sort of. You have to see what happened. Thank you so much.

662
01:16:17,540 --> 01:16:24,820
Yeah, I'm glad that I once had too much of an ad for them out there.

663
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:28,470
I know them. That's right.

664
01:16:28,590 --> 01:16:35,850
Yeah. And how was that? How were you last night when you were doing the mentoring?

665
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:39,990
You were top students or like when.

666
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:49,139
How was that? I was it was actually through our college club, through our college phone sort of graduate.

667
01:16:49,140 --> 01:16:58,260
So they started at the same firms. But then pretty girls within our college often have like for like third or fourth grade or.

668
01:17:15,480 --> 01:18:32,630
But. You know, the.

669
01:19:22,090 --> 01:19:25,370
Right. Has it gone? It's gone.

670
01:19:26,780 --> 01:19:33,800
Sorry. Homework. Rose last year. When the deal expires, then I haven't opened it yet.
