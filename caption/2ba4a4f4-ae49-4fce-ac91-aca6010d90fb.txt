1
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,535
After watching this video,

2
00:00:11,535 --> 00:00:12,810
you will be able to use

3
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:16,935
three such basic procedures
that are very commonly used.

4
00:00:16,935 --> 00:00:20,895
PROC FREQ, PROC MEANS,
and PROC UNIVARIATE.

5
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:22,980
We will use PROC FREQ to get

6
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,595
descriptive statistics of
categorical variables.

7
00:00:26,595 --> 00:00:28,410
We will use PROC MEANS and

8
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,260
PROC UNIVARIATE
descriptive statistics

9
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,855
of continuous variables.

10
00:00:33,855 --> 00:00:36,180
PROC FREQ is used with

11
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:41,250
categorical variables and
with its most basic syntax,

12
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,740
it helps to tabulate

13
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:45,620
the frequencies of any
categorical variable.

14
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:48,119
For example, using the syntax,

15
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:51,815
PROC FREQ, on our own
dataset, br.variation,

16
00:00:51,815 --> 00:00:54,645
and using the statement
table with the variable day,

17
00:00:54,645 --> 00:00:56,660
SAS is going to produce a table

18
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:58,590
with the frequencies
of the day variable,

19
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,100
as you can see below.

20
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,440
By default, SAS will give
you the row frequency,

21
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,065
the percentage, and the
cumulative frequency,

22
00:01:06,065 --> 00:01:08,225
and cumulative percentage.

23
00:01:08,225 --> 00:01:11,810
You can also do cross-tabulation
of two variables.

24
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:13,265
But before doing that,

25
00:01:13,265 --> 00:01:16,100
we are going to create
two binary variables for

26
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:19,625
our continuous variables,
calories and protein.

27
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:21,920
That way, we'll also review how

28
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,050
to create variables
in our data step.

29
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:26,030
We're going to use the median as

30
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:29,605
the cutoff to create
two binary variables.

31
00:01:29,605 --> 00:01:32,030
Calorm will be one for

32
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:35,525
those participants who are
above the median of calories,

33
00:01:35,525 --> 00:01:38,840
which is 1,466 in this study,

34
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,155
and will be zero otherwise.

35
00:01:41,155 --> 00:01:44,300
Similarly protm will be one for

36
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,220
those participants were above

37
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,885
the median of protein intake,

38
00:01:47,885 --> 00:01:50,240
which is 54 in this study,

39
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,750
and will be 0 otherwise.

40
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:56,690
Now, let's do cross-tabulation
with these two variables.

41
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:59,345
We are using PROC
FREQ, same as before,

42
00:01:59,345 --> 00:02:01,280
but now we put the two variables

43
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,665
separated by an asterisk.

44
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:06,770
This is going to create
a two-by-two table,

45
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:08,285
as shown on the right.

46
00:02:08,285 --> 00:02:10,115
SAS is going to give you

47
00:02:10,115 --> 00:02:12,980
the row frequencies
and three percentages;

48
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:15,815
the cell percentage,
the row percentage,

49
00:02:15,815 --> 00:02:17,800
and the column percentage.

50
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,690
We will go back to this
in later videos when

51
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:25,040
deciding which percentage is
most appropriate to report.

52
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,010
You can also add a
chi-square option to

53
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:31,445
this cross-tabulation to
calculate a chi-square test.

54
00:02:31,445 --> 00:02:34,879
As usual, SAS will give
you too much information,

55
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,385
and more tests that
you asked for.

56
00:02:37,385 --> 00:02:38,900
But for now, just focus

57
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,280
on the ones you
are interested in,

58
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,450
which is the chi-square.

59
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:44,660
We will go back to this
in later videos too.

60
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:48,619
Now, for descriptive statistics
of continuous variables,

61
00:02:48,619 --> 00:02:50,570
you're going to use PROC MEANS.

62
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:53,900
You will specify the dataset
you want to use as usual.

63
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,430
The variables you want to

64
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:58,030
explore will be listed in
the various statement.

65
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:02,315
Without specifying any other
options, SAS, by default,

66
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:04,910
will give you the
information on the number of

67
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:08,000
observations useful to
detect missing values.

68
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,880
Like here, you can
see that protein and

69
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,224
vitamin A have one less
observation than calories.

70
00:03:14,224 --> 00:03:16,385
It will also give you the mean,

71
00:03:16,385 --> 00:03:20,345
the standard deviation, and
minimum and maximum values.

72
00:03:20,345 --> 00:03:22,970
You can add many other options,

73
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,500
like the medium, for example.

74
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,565
But for now, let's
just use it this way.

75
00:03:27,565 --> 00:03:29,730
Note that you can also get

76
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:32,000
descriptive statistics
for any variable by

77
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,074
subgroups using the
class statement

78
00:03:35,074 --> 00:03:37,355
and the variable
day for a sample.

79
00:03:37,355 --> 00:03:39,680
SAS will give you the
descriptive statistics

80
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,255
of calories by day,

81
00:03:41,255 --> 00:03:44,680
which is day 1 and day
2 in this example.

82
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,090
Moving on, you can also get

83
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:48,440
descriptive statistics for

84
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,605
continuous variables
using PROC UNIVARIATE.

85
00:03:51,605 --> 00:03:53,780
PROC UNIVARIATE is
going to give you

86
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,880
more information than PROC MEANS.

87
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:59,585
In particular, if you add the
options, plots, and normal,

88
00:03:59,585 --> 00:04:02,270
you can get plots to
check the distribution of

89
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:06,040
the variable and
test for normality.

90
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,810
Here you can see
all the information

91
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:11,105
that you can get from
PROC UNIVARIATE.

92
00:04:11,105 --> 00:04:12,680
You can ignore

93
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,350
most of the information
in the moments part

94
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:16,805
and just look at the end.

95
00:04:16,805 --> 00:04:19,550
The basic statistical
measures will give

96
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:22,070
you the mean and standard
deviation as before,

97
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:24,080
but also the median, the mode,

98
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,275
the variance, the range,
and inter-quartile range.

99
00:04:27,275 --> 00:04:29,910
You can ignore the test
for location for now.

100
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:31,525
We'll go back to that later.

101
00:04:31,525 --> 00:04:34,115
You can see that you
get the test for

102
00:04:34,115 --> 00:04:37,070
normality because you
added the normal option.

103
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,795
You also get three plots,

104
00:04:38,795 --> 00:04:41,165
a histogram, a boxplot,

105
00:04:41,165 --> 00:04:43,190
and a QQ plot that can help you

106
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:45,590
to check for normality
of the variable.

107
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:49,160
We will go back to this
in more detail later on.

108
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,485
In summary, in this video,

109
00:04:51,485 --> 00:04:53,600
we learned how to
use PROC FREQ to get

110
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,890
descriptive statistics of

111
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:58,060
categorical variables and
cross-tabulate variables.

112
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,770
We used PROC MEANS and
PROC UNIVARIATE to

113
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:04,789
get descriptive statistics
of continuous variables.
