1
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:06,640
Okay. Good morning, everybody. We still have some folks trickling in.

2
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:16,090
I am very pleased to say that this morning we have Dr. John Gibbs joining us.

3
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:25,450
Dr. Gibbs is the dean of the School of Public Health. Dean is chair and professor of environmental and occupational health at Texas A&M University.

4
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:35,590
Dr. Gibbs is an industrial hygienist with expertise in the disruption of highly infectious diseases such as COVID 19 and Ebola virus.

5
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:43,930
His research has informed national policies, procedures and best practices for the safe care of patients with highly infectious diseases.

6
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:51,940
He is part of the Prevention, Preparedness and Response Consortium through the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.

7
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:56,740
He's part of the National Emergency Special Pathogens Training and Education Center.

8
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:07,659
He's part of the National Academy of Sciences. He is like the distinguished lecturer for the American Industrial Hygiene Association.

9
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:13,660
So many accomplishments and titles that we could spend all day talking about.

10
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:21,460
But just know that you have one of the experts in infectious disease disruption talking today.

11
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:27,370
And with that, I'll let you take it away. Dr. GIBBS I'm going to do one clarification there.

12
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:34,990
I've done a lot of work with the National Academy of Sciences, most recently on a study on respiratory protection programs,

13
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:38,800
for respiratory protection for people outside of respiratory protection.

14
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:46,410
But I am not a member of the National Academies of Science, although I'm open to it if any of you are on the nominating committee or something.

15
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:52,660
I'm just saying, if you want to nominate me, I'm not going to be upset. So, Dr. Leahy, thank you for that introduction.

16
00:01:53,530 --> 00:02:03,640
So the first thing I want to highlight here is, as Dr. Lay said, this is part of the Prevention, Preparedness and Response Consortium.

17
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:10,060
This is a national consortium that is funded by the National Institutes of Environmental Health Sciences,

18
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,100
that is funded by the National Institutes of Environmental Health Sciences.

19
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,730
And it's a partnership between the University of Utah, University of Michigan,

20
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:23,140
Texas A&M University, as well as University of Texas Health Sciences Center.

21
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:28,060
So those are the people who pay the bills on this. They always going to give the people who pay the bills credits.

22
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:34,180
Here is a link to the Qualtrics survey about this presentation.

23
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:42,010
It should be available in the student packet I sent ahead of time. But also Dr. Alston, this out to you later on as well.

24
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:48,460
So just a little bit about me. So, you know, kind of my background here.

25
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:52,780
I'm a certified industrial hygienist. There's not a whole lot of us in the country.

26
00:02:52,780 --> 00:03:00,489
There's only about 7000 of us. And I'm one of the few certified industrial hygienist who specializes in

27
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:04,840
occupational safety and the disruption of highly hazardous communicable diseases.

28
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:11,770
I think it's fair to say that in my field I'm probably in the top five of this field in regards

29
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:16,240
to people that you would go to for the disruption of highly hazardous communicable diseases.

30
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:22,720
So what does that mean? It means if you're having an infectious disease emergency and you're ill and it's you and me,

31
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:26,020
you're probably going to die, but no one else is going to get sick.

32
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:29,320
You know, I'm not the person who does the clinical response.

33
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:36,730
I'm the person who protects those who are doing the clinical response so that we can then protect the community and so on.

34
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:45,070
What I'm probably best known for is for seven years I led research out of the Nebraska biocontainment unit,

35
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:55,720
which was one of three facilities in the continental United States in 2014, 2016 that was treating Ebola patients in the United States.

36
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:00,730
And I've been part of the treatment team for three Ebola patients domestically.

37
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,910
One of my I have a couple sub areas.

38
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:11,740
One is aeromedical evacuation and isolation, and the other one, unfortunately, is highly hazardous to Steven's remains handling.

39
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:19,480
And of the two individuals who died here in the continental United States from Ebola virus disease.

40
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:27,460
I personally handled the processing of one of them and the other one that utilized the protocols that our team had developed.

41
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:32,790
So that's a little bit about my background here. The photo.

42
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:40,050
Most of the images that you're going to see are either images that I've taken or images from events that I was part of.

43
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:50,070
This image here is from Operation Tranquil Terminus, which was a training exercise moving highly hazardous infectious disease patients out of

44
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:54,420
West Africa and then moving multiple ones of them into the United States for treatment.

45
00:04:55,290 --> 00:05:02,490
If you're taking a look at 747 and thinking back to the early days of the COVID 19 response,

46
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:09,120
that was the same plane that was utilized to repatriate the American citizens from the Diamond Princess Cruise ship.

47
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:13,710
And I was part of the planning team for how to operationalize that.

48
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:25,270
So the other thing that I'll put out there and Dr. Lay has given me very broad guidelines on what I can cover and what I can't cover.

49
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:30,960
So essentially, at any given time, feel free to completely derail the conversation.

50
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:33,970
We can talk about your career. We can talk about life.

51
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:44,140
We can talk about what it's like to be a first generation college graduates going on to graduate school and then entering into academics.

52
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,750
You know, I can give you any tips that you would want.

53
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:54,580
So one important tip I would tell you is this is a still photograph that was taken when we were talking to national news outlets.

54
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:58,659
And this is one of the days we were landing one of the Ebola patients. And I can tell you,

55
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:07,420
an important lesson I learned from this is don't do a national interview next to someone who's Â£100 lighter than me and ten years younger than me.

56
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:11,890
Even my mom was going, Are you okay? You look puffy. Are you all right?

57
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:17,850
So. Little bit of background as to what we're going to be covering.

58
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:23,550
Any time there's any type of outbreak or other events, there's always inevitably an after action.

59
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:28,170
And you you look at what you did not to find fault, not to punish people,

60
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,180
but to find out what can be done better and what can be utilized the next time around.

61
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:44,850
So the reason why this one's up here and this is circled is in October of 2018 in the American Journal of Public Health, myself,

62
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:54,030
Dr. Lay and three other scholars wrote this article where we were pointing out that the next epidemic or the next pandemic,

63
00:06:54,030 --> 00:07:02,130
what we had done in regards to the Ebola virus disease preparations would not be as highly applicable to any other disease.

64
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:07,560
Essentially what we did was we prevented or sorry we predicted the COVID 19 pandemic.

65
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:12,360
Okay. That's a lie. We did not we did not predict this pandemic at all.

66
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:17,010
No one saw the scale of this coming in reality.

67
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:23,040
What we were essentially saying there is for for the normal epidemics, for the normal things that come out.

68
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:33,840
What everything had been put in place was all dependent upon a positive diagnosis of Ebola virus disease.

69
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:39,420
So why is that important when you're talking about highly infectious disease response?

70
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:46,860
So when the legislature, when Congress and when the federal agencies put all of these things in place,

71
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:53,790
they made everything so specific to Ebola virus disease that the health care organizations

72
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:59,610
would not receive compensation unless there was a positive diagnosis for EVD,

73
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:10,680
which means they were less likely to stand up the units which have advanced costs that are normally covered under health insurance.

74
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:15,570
So they were less likely to stand up their units even for someone that they suspected.

75
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:20,909
So essentially what we were talking about was needing to broaden the array and

76
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:25,860
also open it up to patients at what's called wise patients under investigation,

77
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:32,490
because you have to be able to utilize these resources when you suspect someone is infected,

78
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:38,280
because depending on the virus, but pending on the organism, the causal organism,

79
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:44,760
it could take up to 96 plus hours to get confirmation that your patient has what you think they have.

80
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:48,690
And the other thing is, at least in the United States,

81
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:56,970
even if you suspect they have Marburg or Ebola or something else, the vast majority of the time it's going to come out.

82
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:07,800
Not to be that. I can't tell you how many suspected Ebola patients actually had malaria or something else, because everything presents so similar.

83
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:12,750
And when you're looking at travel histories, outbreaks and other things like that, you have to be cautious.

84
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:25,420
But oftentimes it turns out to be something else. So we're what I've been asked to do is just kind of go over and talk a little bit about essentially.

85
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:31,299
Things that we missed or things that we could have done better off the various outbreaks

86
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:36,280
or epidemics that we've seen across the globe and in the United States specifically.

87
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:44,679
So the first one I'll bring up is COVID 19. And when you're talking about the COVID 19 pandemic, you know,

88
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:51,460
we saw the first case of SARS-CoV-2 was identified in Wuhan, China, in late December of 2019.

89
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:57,370
I can tell you the groups that I'm part of, as well as the CDC and others,

90
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:06,939
we started tracking what we're referring to as nonspecific viral pneumonias right around that time and in January.

91
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:10,510
And we're seeing huge upticks in these nonspecific viral pneumonias.

92
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:20,590
By January of 2020, the U.S. government and those who work in this field were aware of this virus and its potential impact.

93
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:30,160
However, without being without being the government, we can only provide as academics so much guidelines and concrete context.

94
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:34,840
And a wait and see approach was taken by the administration at that time.

95
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:39,280
And it was not until essentially the start of community spread here in the

96
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:47,590
U.S. in March of 2020 that we saw large scale responses starting to tick up.

97
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:53,140
I can tell you. So Aurora introduced me as the dean of Texas A&M.

98
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:58,980
If you're unfamiliar with Texas A&M, we have 75,000 total students.

99
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:03,550
The School of Public Health alone here has about 2900 students.

100
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:13,810
But I've only been dean for just under three years. My first day as dean of the A&M School of Public Health was May 1st, 2020.

101
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:22,930
Up until that time, I was at Indiana University, which, like you, is a Big Ten institution, has about 47,000 students.

102
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:27,520
And I was working with them in regards to their COVID 19 response.

103
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:36,370
And one of the things that I was pushing for at that time as part of that response was and I know I'm saying this to a roomful of students,

104
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:45,130
so don't come through the screen at me. But what I had actually suggested was canceling spring break, holding the students arms.

105
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,820
Yeah, Abigail. Abigail's laughing at that when she's like, Yeah, that's not going to go well.

106
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:53,950
Holding the campus are the students on campus not against their will?

107
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:59,890
Because we can't do that. And then allowing dismissal of classes two weeks early in the semester.

108
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:07,570
And my reasoning for that was if all these students, Bloomington, Indiana, is a fairly isolated community,

109
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:13,990
you know, you go to Bloomington, Indiana, primarily because you're you're going to Indiana University.

110
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:18,460
There's not a whole lot of other industry or other things that bring people back and forth.

111
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:24,640
My argument there was if we send 47,000 students out into the world and then bring them back.

112
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:32,260
That's the infrastructure in Bloomington, Indiana, did not have the ability to even process a small number of COVID cases.

113
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:40,350
Now, what ended up happening, like much of the rest of the world, was they opted not to do that,

114
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:47,980
but instead ended up expanding spring break by two weeks and then everyone going fully remote afterwards.

115
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,000
I'm not saying my idea was the right one. Who knows?

116
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:57,400
What I'm saying is that that was the thought process that I was putting into that at that time.

117
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:07,630
So we saw with COVID 19, as you're all abundantly familiar, familiar, a lot of confusion around recommendations.

118
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,710
One of the other things that I do is respiratory protection.

119
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:18,220
I'm an expert in the efficiency of in 95 filtering face piece respirators.

120
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:23,710
I've done research on them going back almost 15 years now.

121
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:28,480
And one of the things that occurred and I remember having this conversation the

122
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:34,720
first week of March and I was having this conversation with OSHA in ETL sorry,

123
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:39,219
National Personal Protective over what does it stand for?

124
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:43,030
Is it training laboratory? National protective.

125
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:49,810
Oh, gosh, yeah. This is embarrassing because I wrote a science blog about personal protective.

126
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,430
Trained at Trovatore Training Laboratory? I think so, yeah.

127
00:13:54,580 --> 00:14:02,110
But essentially they're the go to individuals on all approvals of respiratory protection equipment, and they're lovely people.

128
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:10,810
But in early March, I had been tracking filtering phase piece respirator supplies in the United States.

129
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:18,550
Filtering face piece respirators, as well as surgical masks are all made with a material called Meltblown Fabric.

130
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:26,560
And 99.99% of all Meltblown fabric globally is made in China,

131
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:34,060
as so even domestically assembled filtering face piece respirators use this

132
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:41,240
fabric that is shipped in from China and they had ceased exports of it early on.

133
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:49,690
So we were watching and seeing essentially the collapse of the supply system in regards to filtering face piece respirators.

134
00:14:50,110 --> 00:15:00,519
So on these discussions and back and forth, I was advocating for decontamination of the 95 filtering face piece respirators because at the time

135
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:06,610
we didn't have the information we do now about the coronavirus that that's the causative agent.

136
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:10,900
And I ended up in a bureaucratic, bureaucratic loop.

137
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:16,360
And if you're unfamiliar with decontamination of filtering face piece respirators,

138
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:22,750
I had actually written a grant about ten years ago looking to explore different options

139
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:28,480
for it and was told at the time that got great grant scores with the exception of impact.

140
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:36,830
And the impact scores were very low because the reasoning was filtering face piece respirators are less than $2 a piece.

141
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:44,270
Why would anyone want to ever decontaminate these? Turns out when you have no other options, it pops up.

142
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:56,360
So what we did at that time was we entered into a discussion with those groups, and the circular discussion I kept getting over and over again was,

143
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:01,190
if you decontaminate in 95 filtering, face, piece, respirator,

144
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:08,390
it voids its naoc approval and therefore you're out of compliance with your respiratory protection program.

145
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:12,290
And that was essentially we kept going back and forth.

146
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:21,620
And I remember at one point saying on a call like this, All right, what's better for our respiratory protection program?

147
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:32,540
Giving nurses in 95 filtering face piece respirators that have been decontaminated and their nice certification is now voided or giving them none,

148
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:36,680
because the facilities I'm working with have about 96 hours to make this decision.

149
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:47,650
And the response that I got back was. If you decontaminate your 95 filter face piece respirator, you will avoid it's nai ash approval.

150
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:53,530
So the team I was working for. Now, I'm assuming since you're all staring at me.

151
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:59,620
Well, at least Chloe and Abigail are. And Dr. Legg. And you're all on this computer on the zoom.

152
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,810
You have access to your computers.

153
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:14,170
So if you Google my name New York Times in 95, you'll find what we did, which is we interact, injured a protocol for decontamination of these.

154
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:18,339
And then we went public with it and we went public with it because we weren't

155
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:22,630
sure what the governmental response would be around this decontamination.

156
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:31,510
And what ended up happening was after we went public with this, I lost control of my email for about a week.

157
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:37,630
And when I say I did, I mean everyone involved in the team lost control of our email for about a week.

158
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:46,750
And why and how we lost control of our email is instead of the the governmental regulating agencies coming after us,

159
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:56,920
we were swamped with every institution in the country emailing us for our protocol and saying We're in the exact same situation.

160
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,420
Help us do what you're doing.

161
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:08,600
So we then put that protocol out very quickly so that others can have it and just put it out on the University of Nebraska Medical Center's website,

162
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:16,610
which was the group that I was working with on there. So we also started seeing a lot of conflicting information in regards to masking,

163
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:25,690
which is early on and what turned out to be a miscommunication by a sorry.

164
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:35,460
Realized I hadn't changed my screen there. What what turned out to be a miscommunication by the federal government put out.

165
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:39,900
Essentially basically saying not to wear masks.

166
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:48,390
This wasn't in an effort to conserve masks for individuals who were actively treating these patients.

167
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:53,430
Now, I can tell you, I consulted with a number of health care systems.

168
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,400
I consulted with a number of state and city governments.

169
00:18:56,730 --> 00:19:03,480
I was on one call with a city government that has a population of almost 10 million here in the United States.

170
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:11,700
And we were talking about what to do with their groups. And I said, well, if you can give each person three of these respirators,

171
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:21,120
we can put together essentially a swap out system where where you can allow these to essentially sit and allow the virus to start decaying.

172
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:27,390
And the response I got back from that individual was, Sean, I'm not sure we can even give everyone one.

173
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:36,810
So the messaging that the government, I believe, was trying to get out there was in order to conserve the resource for those who needed it most.

174
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:45,600
But it essentially created a great deal of confusion around what was appropriate for the general public and what was appropriate for health care.

175
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:52,889
And confusion over the effectiveness of cloth masks as well as surgical masks.

176
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:56,970
And in 95 and what we now know as clarifies and so on.

177
00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:00,660
And there was a whole lot of discussion about that.

178
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:10,890
And there still are cloth masks help in regards to reducing the spread, but they provide very little to no actual respiratory protection.

179
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:19,590
And there was a lot of questions around the efficacy of all of these and how it was being framed was around respiratory protection.

180
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:24,450
Whereas at the time a lot of us were really pushing the messaging that the cloth

181
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:28,680
masks were to stop the particles coming out of my mouth from hitting other people.

182
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:32,490
It wasn't to stop to provide respiratory protection for the wearer.

183
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:45,350
Which, by the way. And I. One of the things that one of my directors always tell them is sometimes I talk nonstop, if any, which by the way,

184
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:50,480
you know how you get to be a dean if there's an awkward silence and someone needs you to fill a half hour.

185
00:20:50,570 --> 00:21:01,700
You can do it without blinking. So this is my way of saying if you have any questions about what we're discussing, if you want to discuss anything,

186
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:11,389
feel free to simply let Dr. Lay now and she can interrupt me because I can't really see the discussion or the chat at all.

187
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:16,550
So if anyone's dropping anything into the chat, I'm not able to read it with all the screens up that I've got going.

188
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:20,690
And if you're waiting for me to pause, it's probably not going to happen.

189
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:29,850
Although every now that I will have to take a sip of coffee. So if you got any questions as we go.

190
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:39,159
Feel free to ask. So we started seeing a lot of debates in regards to the masking circles where people were.

191
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:44,420
We're looking at the behavioral principles involved and there there tended to be

192
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:49,730
also widespread individual confusion over who should and who shouldn't eat where,

193
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:53,990
which different types of masks, as well as their effectiveness.

194
00:21:54,440 --> 00:22:00,620
And then we started getting into a whole confusion around individual rights and liberties, which.

195
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:06,130
Which really became very problematic to trying to to stop the spread of the disease,

196
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:13,050
particularly down here in Texas and some of the southern states as as things kind of went and moved through.

197
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:18,910
Now, one of the things to remember about viruses viruses do not care about politics.

198
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:23,580
They don't care about borders. They don't care about who does what.

199
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:29,860
If they see an opportunity to get into. Host That's all viruses do is create more viruses.

200
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:36,550
Dr. GIBBS Yes, I was going to say, if you wouldn't mind sharing, so we're on Zoom now, but if we were in person,

201
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:45,490
basically all of this class today would still be masking with surgical masks and 95.

202
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:50,380
So would you mind just sharing like the difference of what was going on at Texas A&M?

203
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:58,570
So I can tell you for the first year, I was in charge of the COVID 19 response.

204
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:07,240
So it's you know, it was one of those things where I shut up in May of 2020 and then by the summer I'm in charge and I'm going,

205
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:10,149
okay, I just found out where the Post-its are,

206
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:21,040
but sure, put me in charge of COVID response for 75,000 students, 30,000 employees, eight counties and 11 other universities and five state agencies.

207
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:25,030
Don't get me wrong, this is this is what I do.

208
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:33,700
And one of the questions I got, you know, I always get is, well, are you happy when it's an epidemic or a pandemic?

209
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:39,220
And the answer is, no, I'm not happy. But just like people who trained to be cardiologists,

210
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:44,920
you you don't train to become a cardiologist because you don't plan to do heart surgery, you know?

211
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:53,800
So it doesn't mean you want people to have heart failure or cardiac issues, but you're prepared for it and you're ready to do it.

212
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:58,450
So with the first year where I ran the COVID response,

213
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:06,730
our our response was probably in most areas similar to the rest of the nation where

214
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:14,050
where things differentiated was I advocated and did a lot more outdoors student

215
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:20,350
related activities because we had all students were able to be on campus or our

216
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:25,540
dormitories were full and we had a lot of people here in Ryan College Station.

217
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:35,320
And my thought process there was we have a lot of options to kind of do that safety relief valve.

218
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:40,840
And if you remember, at some point at many college campuses, even several up in Colorado,

219
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:46,750
which were far more accepting of some of the public health guidelines than down here in the south,

220
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,440
they started seeing minor student rebellions and other things like that.

221
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:55,240
So I was advocating we were doing a lot of things outdoors.

222
00:24:56,170 --> 00:25:01,570
And my logic there is, even as we were learning more about the virus, was this is a virus.

223
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:08,710
There's huge dilution factors. I don't want to upset anyone there in Michigan.

224
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:14,200
I'm originally from southwestern Ohio. I don't want to upset you, but.

225
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:21,320
Thanksgiving this week I'm having on my back patio. You know, it's going to be 65 degrees around here.

226
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:27,050
So our winters are very different than your winters.

227
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:37,430
Now, don't get me wrong, come summer, it's 100 degrees outside and a U.V. index of 12, and we're all hunkering down inside.

228
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:42,260
So when we are talking about outdoor activities for students in fall and spring,

229
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:48,470
we weren't shoving people out into two feet of snow and, you know, ten degree weather.

230
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:53,180
We were doing outdoor activities and, you know,

231
00:25:53,330 --> 00:26:01,940
52 and in many cases 70 degree environments where there is a large dilution factor for air and large UV.

232
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:06,470
So I felt relatively secure at doing those outlets.

233
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:14,270
We actually and some of you, I'm guessing, since you're at the University of Michigan, a couple of you may be football fans.

234
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:19,790
I was on the SCC Medical Task Force. I was the A&M representative.

235
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,980
Interestingly enough,

236
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:30,740
I was actually appointed as the A&M representative to the Southeastern Conference when I was still employed by the Big Ten at Indiana University.

237
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:34,520
Now, I was already announced as the incoming dean.

238
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:38,930
So Indiana was very aware of this, and they were very cordial in the transition.

239
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:45,250
But, you know, we were working very hard in regards to what we could do.

240
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:58,270
And I can tell you. Some of the the biggest damage I think that was done early on was a lack of understanding of how viruses live and behave.

241
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:11,230
And think back and I remember this one graphic and this one graphic was put out and it showed one jogger passing another jogger,

242
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:15,910
and it showed the plume of particles behind one jogger.

243
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:25,850
And then they had it infecting the second gentlemen. And I remember being at an SCC meeting and then later on in an A&M meeting talking about that,

244
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:33,350
that graphic and I was the only industrial hygienist in and all of these groups that I was in.

245
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:38,990
And, you know, essentially the question comes up with, well, if it spreads like that, what should we do?

246
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:45,520
And my answer was nothing. If it spreads like that, there's no stopping this.

247
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:56,260
If you can infect someone by walking past them outside in a glancing encounter like that, there's no stopping this.

248
00:27:56,290 --> 00:28:00,040
I don't think this spreads like this based upon my understanding of mirrors.

249
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,290
My understanding of the original sayers.

250
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:12,610
And even if you bioengineered a virus, it's still not going to live long enough in an aerosol to spread in an outdoor environment like that.

251
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:16,899
And I say that with most of the organizations I was working with,

252
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:23,080
being in warm weather climates, but that would even hold true there and in Michigan as well.

253
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:31,790
Now, all of this is to say that we were able to do a great deal essentially until March of 21.

254
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:40,340
And and I know Dr. Lay has talked to you probably fairly often about different things in regards to public health response in different localities.

255
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:49,190
So here in the state of Texas, what ended up occurring was the governor essentially in March of 21,

256
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:56,210
restricted or eliminated all public health response to COVID 19.

257
00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:02,640
So we eliminated or we were forced to eliminate masking requirements.

258
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:07,550
We were not able to implement any vaccination related requirements.

259
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:15,770
We weren't able to implement a lot of the what we would call primary prevention measures associated with the virus.

260
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:19,940
And then we then had to essentially adjust around that response.

261
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:26,360
And that was true here, as well as in a lot of the other states that we work with.

262
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:36,680
And as the person leading the COVID response, working with others, that that took away a lot of our ability to slow down the spread,

263
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:40,910
particularly in areas where health care systems were being completely wiped out.

264
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:47,160
And I'm just now looking over and realizing I've only got about 50 minutes left and I've barely got through.

265
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:51,540
So I'm, you know, again, I'm a talker. I'm a talker.

266
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:55,230
But I know you guys have places to be, you know, with the classes over, so I won't go over.

267
00:29:56,670 --> 00:30:08,940
So this also we saw huge late response in regards to addressing and getting into vulnerable populations and the vulnerable populations.

268
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:14,220
We're all aware of the racial disparities associated with pretty much everything in health care.

269
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:19,590
This was really exasperated as well as in the rural urban divide.

270
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:28,320
And additionally, the most of how these things were rolled out were at the state or even in some cases county, local area.

271
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:34,080
So you saw extremely different approaches to vaccine distribution,

272
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:42,360
very different approaches into how the health care system was backfilled and even supply chain.

273
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:46,080
So when we were doing Ebola response,

274
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:52,620
the CDC stepped in and regulated the supply chain associated with personal protective

275
00:30:52,620 --> 00:31:00,270
equipment and for a variety of reasons that did not occur in regards to COVID 19.

276
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:09,899
So you then had states bidding against each other for resources instead of the resources being centrally funneled

277
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:17,070
through the federal government and then moved out to individual or organizations that needed them most.

278
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:22,469
So this is why we saw what would normally be with the purchasing power of most health care

279
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:29,520
systems a filtering face piece respirator that should cost a dollar 25 to a dollar 45,

280
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:38,040
jumping up to in some cases being 10 to $12 a piece because you go back to your basic supply and demand curve.

281
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:46,010
People started bidding against each other. Additionally, we started seeing the health care system being overwhelmed,

282
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:56,360
which is a lot of people did not understand that the health care system in the United States doesn't have surge capacity built in.

283
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:02,720
Most hospital systems in the United States are designed to run almost full.

284
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:07,280
They're designed to run at 90, 95% occupancy.

285
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:13,220
So they're not they're not designed to to absorb a doubling or tripling in need.

286
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:17,180
And that's getting back into how all of this is funded and supported.

287
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:25,270
So what we saw is the United States response to COVID 19 was essentially fragmented,

288
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:34,959
and we saw essentially a politicization and a partizan divide over virus and vaccine later

289
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:41,890
level politics that that negatively impacted our ability to respond to this pandemic.

290
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:49,209
Now, I will tell you, one of the things that I'm grappling with right now is a lot of the some of the

291
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:56,320
organizations I work with we deal with also bioterrorism and bio warfare level responses.

292
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:08,310
We now, as an after action from COVID 19, are having to essentially throw out the entire doctrine and start reworking it from scratch.

293
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:13,200
Does anyone want to guess why? I can tell you if you're thinking it, you're probably right.

294
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:29,450
So any bioterrorism or bio warfare response, number one, requires the population to agree it's happening.

295
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:40,970
The second part of it is that they they participate essentially in the mitigation mitigation methods.

296
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:48,740
You know, we have point of dispensing systems that are that you set up and put out there which require people to come to them.

297
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:58,880
And what we've learned out of this response is there's a larger proportion than previously suspected who would simply not believe it's happening.

298
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:05,060
And then an additional proportion who simply would not cooperate or participate

299
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:13,940
in the response or in some cases would actually do damage to the response.

300
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:24,830
So I can tell you the security plans for point of dispensing systems nine times out of ten, actually, I'll say 19 times out of 20,

301
00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:35,090
focused exclusively on how to protect the pods from people who really, really want the medication or the vaccines that they're distributing.

302
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:45,590
The security plan is not set up. To account for people who don't want the distribution to happen for anyone.

303
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:50,010
And these are now questions that we have to ask that we have to answer.

304
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:59,070
So next I'd like to go on to essentially avian and swine influenza as well as seasonal influenza.

305
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:04,049
Seasonal influenza, it's endemic. We see it every year.

306
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:11,190
We know what's going to happen. I would say this is one of the biggest issues we run into in my world with infectious diseases.

307
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:14,880
Everything always starts presenting with flu like symptoms.

308
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,810
You know, it also presents with flu like symptoms, flu.

309
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:28,110
So it's it's one of those things that we constantly run into where, yeah, if you see flu like symptoms, chances are it's the flu.

310
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:33,780
And in a very small, small portion of people, it turns out to be not the flu.

311
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:42,540
And even when we're talking about novel influenzas and so on, we have to be prepared for for what's coming through.

312
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:47,430
I'm assuming at this point you guys are familiar with how the flu vaccines are created.

313
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:55,260
So it's all very speculative. And and the speculative creation of the flu vaccines for a large population

314
00:35:55,710 --> 00:36:00,210
essentially means sometimes you get it right in the flu vaccines extremely effective.

315
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:04,140
Sometimes you get wrong and it's not as effective as you would want.

316
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:09,480
But still, the overall vaccination uptake when it comes to the flu is very low.

317
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:15,990
And I'm not going to embarrass anyone. I don't want to show of hands or anything of that nature.

318
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:21,900
You're all young, likely healthy public health, soon to be public health professionals.

319
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:25,980
I'm guessing the flu vaccination rate in this room is not 100%.

320
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:30,440
And. That that's just how we're dealing.

321
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:40,969
So when you extrapolate that out to the general population you're talking about even with vaccinations, we see a lot of hospitalizations.

322
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:45,020
We see a lot of. Avoidable deaths.

323
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,980
Now they tend to be avoidable deaths and people with large comorbidities.

324
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:55,640
But a bad flu year, you could see 60 plus 90 plus thousand deaths associated with the flu alone.

325
00:36:56,300 --> 00:37:04,400
Now, that was a little bit different when people were trying to compare early on the flu to COVID 19, you know, a bad flu season.

326
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:11,890
60, 90,000 plus deaths. COVID 19 was a million in one year and rising.

327
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:18,260
You know, we're still, as of a few weeks ago, still seeing hundreds of deaths a day associated with COVID 19.

328
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:23,530
So you see this here?

329
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:30,800
You see? Essentially how the how the flu season essentially peaks.

330
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:38,480
And this is how we kind of rolling nationally. You see large peaks of this in January through February.

331
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:47,990
Interestingly, when it comes to flu vaccinations, there's there's a little bit of disagreement as to when you should get it for maximum effectiveness.

332
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:59,180
I can tell you, my wife and I got our fourth COVID booster and then a couple of weeks later got our flu vaccine for the year.

333
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,450
And we did so in early October.

334
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:08,360
And that was earlier. Now, I'm not saying I would recommend October.

335
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:13,070
Normally I wait and I get my flu vaccination in early November.

336
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:16,880
Anyone want to speculate as to why I bumped it up a month this year?

337
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:30,360
Normally I recommend in November because of the holiday events and having maximum protection going through the holiday events.

338
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:41,460
We did it in early October because I was flying to Boston for the events and was going to be flying and exposed to a lot of people during.

339
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:48,150
Right now we're experiencing a triple virus hit that hopefully you guys have been hearing about,

340
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:55,650
which is COVID 19, RSV as well as the flu already hitting and overwhelming in some cases.

341
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:02,460
A number of the pediatric care units that we have and getting into adult medicine as well.

342
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:08,319
So avian influenza, you know, it it's the flu.

343
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:13,120
It it transmits just like the flu. Now, one of the things I would like to say is avian influenza.

344
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:17,980
If you take a look, one of the concerns we always have is it has a higher mortality rate than the flu,

345
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:22,810
but it transmits right now from the animals to people.

346
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:32,050
We don't see the current avian influenza is really going from people to people, which is great because if it starts moving person to person,

347
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:41,590
that's going to be a whole lot scarier and a whole lot bigger an issue than seasonal flu or how we're currently seeing avian influenza spread.

348
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:51,460
I always like to show this image that was made by the CDC where it's talking about backyard chickens and other things and.

349
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:57,640
After they correct me, I think this image came out, what, five years ago, maybe even six years ago.

350
00:39:58,050 --> 00:40:02,640
I think I was using this in like 2000. 15, 16 something.

351
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:07,110
Yeah. So, I mean, it's been out for a while. And one of the things I always like to do is put up this.

352
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:14,190
As regards to how as a communication issue that I felt the CDC was having because I was going,

353
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:18,870
all right, who's picking up a chicken and rubbing it all over their face?

354
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:22,739
You know, I was going. Come on, CDC show.

355
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:25,770
Show. Really what they're going to be dealing with. Show really how it is.

356
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:31,290
And, you know, I was up on my high horse going up communication people at the CDC.

357
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:35,070
What are you thinking? And then a couple of weeks ago, I saw this.

358
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:48,150
And number one. I did not realize Tick Tock had more than one IMO, let alone favorite IMO influencers.

359
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:56,400
And if you take a look at all of the tweets associated with this from infectious disease people,

360
00:40:56,850 --> 00:41:04,610
you know, this this person over here, if you're emo or any bird has avian influenza, do not kiss it.

361
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:12,300
Do not cuddle with it. Do not touch it. Bird flu, like everyone is, is completely going, don't do this.

362
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:22,349
So it was one of those things where now I feel like I need to go back to 5 to 7 years worth of classes like this and say, yeah,

363
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:30,030
I was wrong about that, that the CDC actually knew there were people out there rubbing birds on their faces and we're trying to get them to stop.

364
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:36,149
So if anyone ever goes on to the CDC, please express my apologies to them.

365
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:44,129
And matter of fact, the current director of the CDC Emergency Operations Center is a former student of mine and a collaborator of mine,

366
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:47,820
and Dr. Lay's Chris Brown. And I've shared this with him as well.

367
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:52,530
I was like, Yeah, I was kind of teasing you guys a little bit about that infographic you've been using.

368
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:55,800
Turns out you were right to be using it. That's on me. Sorry.

369
00:41:57,940 --> 00:42:07,870
So the the main types of these we still see are really going from bird to person and really have at heart person to person.

370
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:12,400
The real concern we have is if they start really hopping person to person.

371
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:17,690
All right. So I'm going to talk a little. Sorry. Let me check in.

372
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:27,469
Dr. Lee. I've got about 915 your time and I know we go until about 950 yet were do you got any questions

373
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:32,120
in the charts or anything I should address before I start hopping into Ebola virus disease?

374
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:35,390
No, they're pretty they're pretty quiet today.

375
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:42,890
But we were just talking in the chat about how we are not seeing these immune influencers on our tik tok for you page.

376
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:47,209
But it's more common than you think because on The Bachelorette all the time they

377
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:52,470
have people whose careers are just like chicken enthusiast or something sloppy.

378
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:57,410
Go ahead. Hi, Dr. Gibbs. I just had a small question.

379
00:42:58,430 --> 00:43:09,079
I want to know if, like that timeline of getting your flu vaccine, does it really affect, like, people in any way?

380
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:14,809
Because I know, at least in terms of COVID, we're getting booster shots every now and then.

381
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:17,870
But the flu vaccine is like an annual thing.

382
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:24,680
So and they normally start rolling them out by like early September, which is when I got my flu shot.

383
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:30,080
But I still ended up like I felt sick two or three weeks ago.

384
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:38,479
Thankfully, it wasn't the flu, but I wanted to know, like if the timeline of getting the flu vaccine also like plays a role in this case,

385
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:45,830
or would you recommend people to get their flu vaccines on the nearing November?

386
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:50,520
Or of course, you had stated an example with that.

387
00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:55,309
So good question. And this is one that is hotly debated.

388
00:43:55,310 --> 00:44:04,400
So there's not a 100% of a right answer. So just like the COVID vaccine and many other of our vaccines, once you get it,

389
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:09,590
you have a peak and immune response and then you have a drop off in immune response.

390
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:16,399
And what we see with the flu vaccine, like what you've probably heard about the COVID 19 vaccine,

391
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:21,530
is you get a very robust response for about 3 to 4 months and then it starts dropping off.

392
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:27,180
So there's a couple schools of thought on this one school of thought.

393
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:31,230
And again, no right answer. No right answer at all.

394
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:38,130
One school of thought is simply get the vaccines into people as quickly and as early as you can.

395
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:40,979
And nothing wrong with that school of thought.

396
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:45,690
I understand completely so that they would go along with as soon as they start rolling out, get them into people.

397
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:51,570
Now, with what we know in regards to our uptake of vaccines.

398
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:58,730
And I don't have the numbers off the top of my head in regards to flu vaccination rates, but it's it's not very high.

399
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:03,300
I don't think we exceed 40% of the population in almost any area.

400
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:14,110
So I fall into the other school of thought, which is looking at sense since I know not everyone is going to be vaccinated.

401
00:45:14,530 --> 00:45:21,790
I started then looking into my and my families most likely riskiest time period.

402
00:45:22,570 --> 00:45:23,920
And for me,

403
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:34,680
traditionally that's been going to visit family and I've got a lot of family who I know aren't vaccinated for flu and aren't vaccinated for COVID.

404
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:42,160
We've all got that family, right? So I look at what my response or my my most risk is going to be.

405
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:48,430
And then I vaccinate 2 to 3 weeks before I know I'm entering into that risk zone.

406
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:56,649
So the reason why I swapped it up a little bit this year was because I was going to Boston for

407
00:45:56,650 --> 00:46:04,210
the events and I wanted maximal protection for that events and I didn't want people to be going.

408
00:46:04,430 --> 00:46:11,350
I think the dean at Texas A&M gave me the flu, you know, so a little bit PR as well.

409
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:18,550
But we also do have more build up within our entire population of response.

410
00:46:18,890 --> 00:46:23,980
Now, when I start saying it drops starts dropping down, does that mean your protection goes to zero and not six?

411
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:31,150
No, it just means your protection is not nearly as robust as it is for that first 3 to 4 months.

412
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:36,040
Good question, Swati. Sorry. Did I say your name correctly? Yeah.

413
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:44,880
Thank you. Thank you. So Ebola virus, disease, it gets a lot of attention.

414
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:52,220
The one and one thing like there's right now a major outbreak going on in Uganda.

415
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,229
Matter of fact, one of the groups I work with was working with the U.S. Air Force last week,

416
00:46:57,230 --> 00:47:01,340
updating some of their air aeromedical isolation transport procedures.

417
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:04,880
So I was texting back and forth with them all last week about this.

418
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:12,810
Ebola is one of those that tends to be scarier. But also, you need to put things into perspective.

419
00:47:12,870 --> 00:47:17,810
It is a very unlikely that you are going to encounter this domestically in the United States,

420
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:22,850
and it's very unlikely that you're going to encounter this even globally.

421
00:47:23,450 --> 00:47:27,680
It's really endemic to a small number of areas of it.

422
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:39,620
It's also one of those things that I'm told from former Ebola patients are patients with Ebola virus disease that they know something's difference.

423
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:47,570
While it presents like flu like symptoms. And I'll I'll move to the next slide because I think this is germane for this story.

424
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:58,600
This is all public information. One of the patients that we treated in Nebraska was Dr. Rick Sacra, who was with Samaritan's Purse,

425
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:05,200
which was doing essentially medical work in West Africa when he became infected.

426
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:09,100
He was repatriated to the United States, treated and released.

427
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:16,689
And several weeks later and again, this is all public access, public records.

428
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:20,380
I'm not putting anything out there that's a hip hop violation.

429
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:24,760
Several weeks later, became ill and was readmitted to a hospital.

430
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:35,260
And I got called in because the hospital that admitted him was not prepared to handle Ebola virus or Ebola virus related waste.

431
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:42,189
So I remember distinctly being on a phone call with some of the people who were in his

432
00:48:42,190 --> 00:48:48,610
room while I was talking to through what is called Category a waste and how to handle it,

433
00:48:48,610 --> 00:48:54,840
how to process it with them. And I distinctly remember hearing him in the background say, this isn't Ebola.

434
00:48:54,850 --> 00:48:57,850
I've had Ebola. This feels nothing like Ebola.

435
00:48:58,210 --> 00:49:07,480
And, you know, that's one of the quotes I always I always like to utilize is, you know, this is why it starts off like the flu very quickly.

436
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:15,320
You know, it's not the flu. So Ebola virus disease is considered by all to be a category a waste.

437
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:20,750
And in the United States, that has to be handled and transferred like a category a waste.

438
00:49:21,350 --> 00:49:24,409
So just just a quick question.

439
00:49:24,410 --> 00:49:26,600
There's no one answer, is it? That's fine.

440
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:36,590
I always just like to put this out, which is who makes the determination as to what is and is not a category a waste in the United States.

441
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:47,480
Was anyone thinking of the U.S. Department of Transportation?

442
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:54,430
I'm guessing. Yes. And don't feel bad.

443
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:58,830
No one guesses the U.S. Department of Transportation. One guest for EPA.

444
00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:06,640
EPA? Yes. So U.S. Department of Education is, by the way, EPA's a very good guess.

445
00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:16,960
Also, CDC is a good guess as well. But U.S. Department of Transportation is the one who categorizes anything that is moved on a U.S. road.

446
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:22,390
So if something is has to be moved from point A to point B on a U.S. road.

447
00:50:23,330 --> 00:50:30,970
Department of Transportation is the one who has the determination. So what happens is the U.S. Department of Transportation is the lead agency.

448
00:50:31,090 --> 00:50:34,150
And then whoever gets the U.S. EPA is correct.

449
00:50:34,330 --> 00:50:41,440
They are one of the consulting agencies as well as CDC all enter into discussions about what is and what is not.

450
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:49,480
Category a waste. And why this is important is if you're involved in an organization that is handling medical waste,

451
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:55,059
medical waste is probably disposed of somewhere between $0.25 and a dollar

452
00:50:55,060 --> 00:51:00,040
per pound based upon the size of your organization and your purchasing power.

453
00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:06,020
So that's worst case scenario, a dollar per pound category.

454
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:13,690
A waste is going to cost you somewhere between 250 and $700 per pound.

455
00:51:15,250 --> 00:51:21,280
And the packaging material alone is going to be a minimum of 35 to Â£50.

456
00:51:21,670 --> 00:51:29,270
So if you take a tissue and say this is contaminated with Ebola virus disease and this is all I need to dispose of.

457
00:51:30,190 --> 00:51:38,140
You're going to have to put it in Â£35 worth of packaging to send this away to be disposed of 35 times 500.

458
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:41,550
That adds up very quickly. Where is that something?

459
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:45,400
It can be deactivated on site to category B waste.

460
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:48,790
Then you enter into that $0.25 to $1 per pound.

461
00:51:49,450 --> 00:51:52,000
So the organization that I worked with.

462
00:51:53,530 --> 00:52:01,509
And here is a graph, some one of our publications that shows where all the Ebola cases were in the United States,

463
00:52:01,510 --> 00:52:09,790
as well as the facilities that could treat them. Our location there in Omaha, Nebraska, for three actual Ebola patients,

464
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:17,530
we paid less than $10,000 to dispose of our waste because that waste was deactivated on site

465
00:52:17,770 --> 00:52:22,960
through an autoclave process that turned it from Category A waste to category B waste.

466
00:52:23,830 --> 00:52:33,910
So when it comes to Ebola, all but two of these cases were essentially transported into the U.S.,

467
00:52:33,970 --> 00:52:40,960
four or so repatriated into the United States, and then were were essentially treated in the United States.

468
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:47,710
So in the vast majority of situations, when there is an outbreak or something,

469
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:53,620
you want to leave people in the outbreak zone and treatment treats them in the outbreak zone.

470
00:52:54,040 --> 00:53:03,910
Does anyone want to speculate as to why in these situations the United States, as well as many other responding countries,

471
00:53:04,210 --> 00:53:12,160
decided to pull their infected health care workers out of that environment and treat them domestically in their home countries.

472
00:53:16,030 --> 00:53:22,730
Someone. Someone. Take a guess. It's like Dr. Lay, you can't guess because you know the answer.

473
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:38,680
So in situations like this where you are trying to convince health care workers essentially

474
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:46,690
to go into outbreak zones for limited periods of time to augment or in some case,

475
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:50,380
be the sole health care facility in that area.

476
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:57,860
It takes on a psychological toll for the other health care workers who have been flown in.

477
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:05,650
Additionally, what we would consider an Ebola virus treatment center in the United States is going to look and be

478
00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:13,210
very different than those in the various West African countries that we're coming in to help support.

479
00:54:13,810 --> 00:54:22,270
So essentially, it is a psychological determinants as well as a medical treatment determinants.

480
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:31,240
Where is the level of supportive care that you can give in in the United States for these individuals drastically increases their survivability.

481
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:42,930
And that's just not an option to bring all of those facilities into these countries experiencing the outbreaks, unfortunately.

482
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:52,170
So this is part of a strategy that is built on not deteriorating the the the health care workers who have essentially

483
00:54:52,170 --> 00:55:01,350
volunteered to go in and also to to reduce the likelihood of losing those health care workers if they become infected.

484
00:55:02,130 --> 00:55:09,720
Because the thing that I always like to remind people is, in my business, rarely, rarely do we eliminate risk.

485
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:13,830
We only reduce risk and we protect people as much as we can.

486
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:26,010
So of the Ebola virus cases in the United States, we had one returning health care worker who was infected and presented in New York.

487
00:55:26,370 --> 00:55:33,600
We had one citizen or one individual who was traveling, who presented at Texas Presbyterian in Dallas,

488
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:36,930
who then subsequently infected two health care workers,

489
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:43,440
and then the others were sent to facilities who were aero medically evacuated out of the outbreak zones.

490
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:52,510
So we we started seeing this present and now the Ebola virus disease doesn't go anywhere.

491
00:55:53,680 --> 00:56:01,090
When someone is cured for the Ebola virus disease, they can still have the Ebola virus not in their blood,

492
00:56:01,390 --> 00:56:10,810
but in the aqueous humor of their eyes or in their sexual secretions for up to 6 to 9 months after they are infected.

493
00:56:11,690 --> 00:56:18,259
So this is one of those cases where we've seen individuals recovered from the Ebola

494
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:24,500
virus disease who have then infected their partners later on through sexual activity.

495
00:56:25,130 --> 00:56:32,240
So there has to be a lot of education around what your aftercare is and your tracking.

496
00:56:32,540 --> 00:56:38,239
And in some facilities, in some countries, that aftercare and that tracking is possible.

497
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:52,830
But that's not possible in all facilities globally. So I wanted to point out here that we started tracking an outbreak in Uganda in September there.

498
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:58,680
And the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo in August had just ended.

499
00:56:59,610 --> 00:57:03,180
Now, the one in Uganda, we're a lot more worried about us.

500
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:12,240
And the reason why we're a lot more worried about it is there's been a lot of decimation of the health care system there from COVID 19.

501
00:57:13,150 --> 00:57:17,040
There's a lot of Western and U.S. interest in that country.

502
00:57:17,550 --> 00:57:22,740
What that means is there's a lot of movement back and forth out of that country into other countries.

503
00:57:23,430 --> 00:57:30,390
And we've seen that virus present at a lot of different locations that are not easily located.

504
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:42,420
We've also seen that country. There's concern that the public health infrastructure in that country aren't being as forthcoming as we would expect.

505
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:47,070
And in one of the discussions and one of the calls that I've been part of,

506
00:57:47,910 --> 00:57:53,100
there was speculation as to whether or not the true numbers coming out weren't

507
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:57,660
anywhere between five and ten times higher than what was being reported.

508
00:57:58,410 --> 00:58:02,219
We're also seeing people running from contact tracers.

509
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:08,010
We've seen people not cooperating, which, if you think about it,

510
00:58:08,010 --> 00:58:13,560
is what we were what I was just talking about earlier in regards to bioterrorism or bio warfare.

511
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:21,090
Bless you. In regards to how we might see some portions of the populations here in the United States respond,

512
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:29,190
so please don't take my concerns about the response there as as a criticism of that country.

513
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:41,280
I honestly think here in the United States, we could see similar issues in regards to how the public reacts to yet another potential epidemic.

514
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:52,200
And at this point, you're probably very aware that we're not going to be seeing less frequent epidemics and pandemics as we move a society forward.

515
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:59,900
We're going to probably be seeing more frequent ones. We've got about 20 minutes.

516
00:59:00,410 --> 00:59:06,070
I want to talk a little bit about Zika. Zika was one I was wrong about.

517
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:10,460
And I'm glad to hear I was wrong about it.

518
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:19,790
So when we started seeing when Zika really started hitting the front pages of the newspaper was years after we started following

519
00:59:19,790 --> 00:59:27,860
Zika and Zika started hitting the newspaper because of all the concerns associated with the Rio Olympics a number of years ago.

520
00:59:28,490 --> 00:59:32,660
And at that time, with the the huge population.

521
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:43,790
Zika is one of those rare disease, one of those diseases that not only makes individuals ill, but also leads to negative pregnancy outcomes.

522
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:52,700
And interestingly enough, the negative pregnancy outcomes can be a result of the person with the egg being

523
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:57,890
infected with Zika or the person providing the sperm being infected by Zika.

524
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:05,060
So it's it's not one of those that is just going to impact one of the contributing parties.

525
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:12,890
And if you take a look, this is the the spread of the this isn't the spread of Zika.

526
01:00:13,250 --> 01:00:19,220
This is just the range of the insects, the mosquitoes that can carry Zika.

527
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:28,639
So I was of the belief that it was very likely after the the huge uptick in Zika that we were

528
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:37,549
seeing around the Rio Olympics and the huge travel migration from the United States to Rio,

529
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:46,490
and then back that we were going to see a lot of Zika start coming into the United States becoming endemic into our mosquito population.

530
01:00:47,330 --> 01:00:52,190
Matter of fact, probably in a class similar to this five, six years ago,

531
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:59,720
I was predicting that as part of family planning decisions, when when individuals decided that they wanted to have children,

532
01:00:59,930 --> 01:01:04,309
that there would likely be a Zika screening to make sure that neither party were

533
01:01:04,310 --> 01:01:08,930
infected with Zika so that they could be advised to wait until they cleared the Zika.

534
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:20,660
That did not happen. As you can see from some of these numbers here, we've seen Zika really drop out.

535
01:01:21,290 --> 01:01:24,560
Now, I do have questions on these numbers.

536
01:01:25,430 --> 01:01:36,200
My questions on these numbers are, have we really seen this few Zika cases or are we just no longer testing for it and paying attention?

537
01:01:36,950 --> 01:01:47,720
And in the vast majority of the vast majority, a large number of individuals, when they have the actual Zika virus, it will present like a mild flu.

538
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:51,620
So if it's there's not a lot of attention being paid for it.

539
01:01:51,620 --> 01:02:01,440
There's not testing. Are we seeing individuals who are actually infected with this and don't know it and are just clearing it naturally?

540
01:02:02,250 --> 01:02:05,610
And the answer to that is, I don't know, because the data is not there.

541
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:13,739
It's a possibility. I feel more confident that that is not occurring because of the number of environmental

542
01:02:13,740 --> 01:02:19,650
health programs around the United States that do mosquito capturing and mosquito testing.

543
01:02:19,950 --> 01:02:23,310
And they teach that they test them for West Nile.

544
01:02:23,580 --> 01:02:28,530
They they test them for a whole host of mosquito borne diseases, including Zika.

545
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:32,280
And we're not seeing huge upticks in those as well.

546
01:02:32,430 --> 01:02:39,540
Matter of fact, to my knowledge, in the past year, we've not seen a single recovery of Zika in the mosquito population.

547
01:02:40,730 --> 01:02:45,260
So this is one where I was looking at the data, I was looking at the behavior, I was looking at the disease.

548
01:02:45,590 --> 01:02:50,780
And I was thinking that this was just going to become part of our reality within the next decade.

549
01:02:51,020 --> 01:02:54,229
And for one reason or another, that did not occur.

550
01:02:54,230 --> 01:03:00,560
I'm happy I was wrong. I'm happy it didn't occur. But, you know, that's what we are doing with incomplete information.

551
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:08,700
Monkey pox. Hopefully you are all familiar and have been educated a bit with monkey pox.

552
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:15,180
Now this one, much like COVID 19, is less of an after action because we're still in it.

553
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:18,720
And what I would like to talk to is about monkey pox.

554
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:24,150
We started seeing parts of it in the United States, the potential for it in the United States in July.

555
01:03:25,020 --> 01:03:28,470
And we saw the Health Alert Network pop up.

556
01:03:29,130 --> 01:03:35,670
And we had also been tracking it in Europe. And we have been tracking it, of course, you know, in West and Central Africa,

557
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:47,370
where it's it's not uncommon to find this is essentially a perfect storm of of a spread of a preventable disease.

558
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:52,830
And I've got a couple speculations on this and a couple of issues that came out.

559
01:03:53,370 --> 01:04:02,010
So if you take a look here, this is this is all the monkeypox cases that we saw all across the country or across the globe.

560
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:09,400
Now there are a couple calling answers I'd like to do, or at least if you don't want to answer, just kind of think through.

561
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:14,440
I was on a call when the and I'll go to the next slide.

562
01:04:14,890 --> 01:04:20,770
I was on a call in August and those are US cases. So you can see that peak there in that that August timeline.

563
01:04:21,130 --> 01:04:27,940
So I was in a call in that August timeline where they were also talking about individuals

564
01:04:27,940 --> 01:04:36,490
showing up and asking for the monkeypox vaccine who had never been COVID vaccinated.

565
01:04:38,100 --> 01:04:46,740
In this confused me. And the person who was asking, you know, I was like, is it because monkeypox has been around longer?

566
01:04:46,750 --> 01:04:50,130
Is it because this is a more traditional vaccine?

567
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:55,139
Is it because there's more familiarity with monkeypox? Because monkeypox is not novel.

568
01:04:55,140 --> 01:05:00,760
It's something that we've been aware of for quite some time. Anyone want to guess the answer I was given?

569
01:05:06,940 --> 01:05:11,350
By the way, when I guess I got a completely wrong. So feel free to guess and be wrong.

570
01:05:18,830 --> 01:05:30,110
Monkey pox can lead to visual scarring. And one of the reasons that's one of the reasons that kept popping up over and over again for those who are

571
01:05:30,110 --> 01:05:37,910
showing up for the monkeypox vaccine who had never been COVID 19 vaccinated was concern over facial scarring.

572
01:05:39,290 --> 01:05:49,099
Now, remember, with monkeypox, I think. Don't quote me on this, but I believe we ended up having to date what to say about 18,000 U.S. cases,

573
01:05:49,100 --> 01:05:53,690
maybe close to 20,000 U.S. cases and less than five U.S. deaths.

574
01:05:53,960 --> 01:06:00,590
Now, don't get me wrong, it's not a pleasant experience, but that's something that was just very different.

575
01:06:02,030 --> 01:06:05,560
Now, the U.S. response to this was also a little bit different.

576
01:06:05,570 --> 01:06:10,280
And I want to talk about some of the inequities and some of the.

577
01:06:12,110 --> 01:06:21,739
Essentially the perceptions or the assumptions that were made so early on in this in this pandemic for for monkeypox,

578
01:06:21,740 --> 01:06:26,840
one of the things that we were seeing was it was predominantly presenting in men who have sex with men.

579
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:40,549
And unfortunately, that led to a number of assumptions that just were not true from a state or local government level and for from some cases,

580
01:06:40,550 --> 01:06:50,480
a public health response. So women were were also at risk for this because it can be transmitted during close physical contact.

581
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:57,620
It is not a true sexually transmitted disease because it can be transmitted through contact with pustules.

582
01:06:58,460 --> 01:07:06,920
So if you take a look early on when some of the first children became infected with monkeypox,

583
01:07:07,220 --> 01:07:18,080
there were a variety of groups that popped up and who were talking about this was proof of molestation and all this other stuff.

584
01:07:18,710 --> 01:07:27,200
And 100% it is not. What's what this is proof of is all parents pick up their children.

585
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:33,980
All parents hold their children. And all parents interact with their children in the early stages.

586
01:07:33,980 --> 01:07:38,710
And in some cases of these pustules, they can be on the hand.

587
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:44,450
They can be on the face routinely. Not all of them are excruciatingly painful.

588
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:50,180
Now, don't get me wrong. Once it progresses to certain level, they are excruciatingly painful.

589
01:07:50,630 --> 01:07:58,760
But what this shows is children of men who have sex with men are essentially interactive,

590
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:03,590
very similar as any other parents, because they are any other parents.

591
01:08:03,890 --> 01:08:07,940
This is not proof of any type of abuse or anything like that.

592
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:13,640
It's simply that when you pick up a child, you use your hands and your hands may have pustules.

593
01:08:13,850 --> 01:08:20,990
Additionally, when you hold a child and if you're unaware that you have this and children are touching your face,

594
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:30,500
there's the the ability to transfer their so that we had to counter a lot of very negative and very ugly rumors in regards to that.

595
01:08:31,970 --> 01:08:43,160
And it's the messaging. We were very concerned and in some cases the messaging did become more a round of a shaming events.

596
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:47,270
And that was not the not the approach that should have been taken.

597
01:08:48,260 --> 01:08:54,290
Additionally, one of the things that I actually think hurt us a little bit is.

598
01:08:55,290 --> 01:09:03,960
The the Muslim community is so highly targeted for condom specific related education.

599
01:09:05,010 --> 01:09:11,610
And one of the things that I don't think we did a good job of talking about was that this is not a true sexually transmitted disease.

600
01:09:12,090 --> 01:09:15,240
So you can have practice safe sex.

601
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:24,000
But because of contact with pustules or you can contact or you can practice non sexual activity,

602
01:09:24,630 --> 01:09:27,930
but through cuddling and other things still spread this disease.

603
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:35,610
So I think too much was was placed on the sexual activity of this and not enough was passed was was

604
01:09:35,610 --> 01:09:42,180
placed upon just the general physical contact and the general risk factors associated with that.

605
01:09:43,050 --> 01:09:46,230
Now right now it's looking like. I'm sorry. Go ahead.

606
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:49,770
Dr. Lang, I want to flag you for 9 minutes.

607
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:59,090
Oh, 9 minutes. So this is a I've been talking a long time that I need to speed it up because I'm at 37 of 49 sites.

608
01:10:00,420 --> 01:10:09,810
So this picture is one that was taken of me and Dr. John Lowe doing an ambulance decon after an Ebola transports.

609
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:15,240
And I could do an entire lecture just on decontamination and well,

610
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:20,790
I have done an entire lecture just on decontamination and entire workshops on transport.

611
01:10:21,390 --> 01:10:27,390
So I'm just showing you there a little bit, by the way, I'm I'm the one in the yellow minions suits.

612
01:10:27,750 --> 01:10:37,560
And I can tell you, when you do a decontamination in a facility in Nebraska, that is 85 degrees and 85% humidity.

613
01:10:38,070 --> 01:10:47,229
I poured out over a gallon of fluid from my suits during the the doffing process there and was sloshing around quite a bit actually.

614
01:10:47,230 --> 01:10:52,410
It made me feel a little bit good knowing that the suit was able to hold all that water.

615
01:10:52,830 --> 01:10:56,580
It meant that it was pretty if it was holding my water and it was holding everything out.

616
01:10:56,580 --> 01:10:57,840
So I was happy about that.

617
01:10:58,930 --> 01:11:08,380
So when you're talking about these responses, you've got to weigh the pros and cons and talk about the overall disruption that you will cause.

618
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:15,460
And we saw this being utilized and in some cases weaponized throughout all of these epidemics.

619
01:11:16,090 --> 01:11:27,430
And people are more likely to accept diversion and some of these lockdowns, when they believe it's something that is outside of the United States,

620
01:11:27,430 --> 01:11:36,490
when it gets back to the fear of other that were hopefully at this point you're all very well versed on and that's not a good thing because.

621
01:11:37,090 --> 01:11:40,180
Well, the basis of it, it is clearly not a good thing.

622
01:11:40,390 --> 01:11:45,400
But also it negatively detracts from our ability to do domestic response as well.

623
01:11:47,310 --> 01:11:51,420
And preparing. One of the things that was created and I helped create this,

624
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:56,339
it was originally the National Emerging Special Pathogens Training and Education

625
01:11:56,340 --> 01:12:00,090
Center was originally called the National Ebola Training Education Center.

626
01:12:00,660 --> 01:12:08,040
And this is the name change was part of the lobbying and stuff that others and I did about this can't be disease specific,

627
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:14,100
this can't be organism specific. We have to be prepared for anything that walks through the door.

628
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:17,100
And this is still growing.

629
01:12:17,340 --> 01:12:29,220
So that facility, that act created a ten regional special pathogens education center units across the U.S. within the past month and a half.

630
01:12:29,230 --> 01:12:38,670
They just add an additional three. So to put that in perspective, the United States, which is pushing 300 million people,

631
01:12:39,990 --> 01:12:47,070
has 13 such facilities with a bed capacity total of about 100 beds tops.

632
01:12:48,540 --> 01:12:52,319
Most of them operationally can only hold tops.

633
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:58,260
About 50, 60 bed capacity is very different from beds that people can actually use.

634
01:12:59,350 --> 01:13:04,870
To put that in perspective, the country of Germany, which is roughly the size of Texas,

635
01:13:05,380 --> 01:13:13,870
has one of these facilities every 250 kilometers and has more capacity than the entire United States.

636
01:13:16,310 --> 01:13:20,210
So we're and this is one of the transports that I did.

637
01:13:20,540 --> 01:13:27,680
So this is what my team members. Now, we've only got a few minutes, but I always like to ask this question with this picture,

638
01:13:28,900 --> 01:13:32,150
what we're going to be doing, move more of these movement back and forth.

639
01:13:32,690 --> 01:13:38,480
What do you notice about this picture that seems odd to you, aside from all the seats and everything or all the suits?

640
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:47,510
They're not coming downstairs. That's a flatbed pickup.

641
01:13:48,790 --> 01:13:53,830
And the reasoning behind that is not because we wanted to do it that way.

642
01:13:54,190 --> 01:14:00,580
All stares at airports are owned by air carriers,

643
01:14:01,060 --> 01:14:12,220
and the various air carriers had no desire of having their their logo on the side of a stair car being used in pictures like this.

644
01:14:12,670 --> 01:14:16,780
And at the time, I was very angry and very annoyed with them for that.

645
01:14:16,990 --> 01:14:24,910
But when you take a look at some of the disproportionate public responses so that the two young nurses who were infected in Dallas,

646
01:14:25,750 --> 01:14:31,360
one of them went to a bridal shop that was forced to close down months later because of public perception.

647
01:14:32,020 --> 01:14:38,470
One of them, when the team did their decontamination of her apartment, disposed of her engagement ring.

648
01:14:39,370 --> 01:14:47,380
Like completely. It was incinerated. My solution would have been to drop it in bleach for 5 minutes and then give it back to her when she was healthy.

649
01:14:47,830 --> 01:14:55,400
So there's disproportionate solution to all of these things, and we're always constantly looking out for what's going to be next.

650
01:14:55,930 --> 01:15:04,480
And this one you see at the bottom, there's something called disease X, and this blueprint has been out for seven, eight, nine years.

651
01:15:04,780 --> 01:15:13,000
And I will tell you, COVID 19 is an example of disease X we saw and we're challenged by and face disease

652
01:15:13,030 --> 01:15:19,690
X over the past two plus years and disease X is now or that version of it.

653
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:22,930
There will there's always the potential for a new one coming out of stem.

654
01:15:23,900 --> 01:15:27,200
So that's the finish of most of my lectures.

655
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:32,780
Think of any question you have and as y you're thinking of that question, I got some bonus material for you.

656
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:43,980
I have written some of the definitive works on how to respond to highly infectious diseases and of those definitive works.

657
01:15:44,010 --> 01:15:47,010
At this point, I'm guessing most of you are familiar with old metrics.

658
01:15:47,550 --> 01:15:51,360
The metrics on most of those will be between 102 hundred.

659
01:15:51,570 --> 01:15:54,150
And that's after them being out for years.

660
01:15:55,080 --> 01:16:07,860
I wrote a paper on contact tracing and virus spread for COVID 19 amongst the Southeastern Conference, and its metric is currently over 700.

661
01:16:08,460 --> 01:16:14,670
So this is by far the most impactful paper I've had because it's gotten so much attention.

662
01:16:15,450 --> 01:16:26,040
And one of the things I always like to show is when you're talking about one of the arguments that I had for for playing sports and fall of 20,

663
01:16:26,220 --> 01:16:31,860
whether it was the right idea or the wrong idea. What we are going off of is contact tracing.

664
01:16:31,860 --> 01:16:42,960
And we had essentially RFID tags on the different players and we were able to track and you see up here in the top graph contact duration,

665
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:49,320
the average contact between players on opposing teams was less than a seconds.

666
01:16:49,890 --> 01:16:57,180
And it was in an outdoor environment. And even though it's a contact sport, it was in an outdoor environment in the American Southwest,

667
01:16:57,180 --> 01:17:00,930
which had high heat, high humidity, and in most cases, high UV.

668
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:12,330
So we were actually able to track our COVID and we actually saw more COVID cases out of non home games down here than we did out of home games.

669
01:17:12,690 --> 01:17:18,650
Anyone want to guess why? Now, I'm not saying this would have worked up in the north or in other places.

670
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:31,360
We had 25% occupancy at our outdoor stadium and in our outdoor stadium the students went to the home games at the non home games.

671
01:17:31,630 --> 01:17:40,200
They all got together in apartments and watched them together. And I'm guessing more than one of you have been at this those kind of watch parties,

672
01:17:41,910 --> 01:17:49,230
let's just say in an outdoor environment, there's a lot more dilution, a lot more distancing and a whole lot less beer.

673
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:53,780
So all of that was some of the. No, I'm not saying that would have worked up north.

674
01:17:53,790 --> 01:17:56,130
That was just some of the rationale and what we saw.

675
01:17:57,240 --> 01:18:05,760
You'll also see figure two is actually all of the cases from all of the teams that happened during the 2020 season.

676
01:18:06,300 --> 01:18:12,440
I get a lot of people who were asking, we deliberately did not add in a legend for this.

677
01:18:12,450 --> 01:18:14,580
That way you can't tell which team is which.

678
01:18:15,180 --> 01:18:24,090
And JAMA gave us special permission not to put on a legend because no one wants to point out what's LSU, what's Florida, what's A&M and so on.

679
01:18:24,330 --> 01:18:29,100
Because then the universities would have been less likely to be party to it.

680
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:35,320
So. And before I close, I want to wish you a happy holiday.

681
01:18:35,650 --> 01:18:41,600
This is one of my favorite times of year. You know, the the autumn leaves are coming down.

682
01:18:41,620 --> 01:18:45,940
There's the energy in the air. And everyone's looking forward to the Ohio State Michigan game.

683
01:18:47,790 --> 01:18:52,409
So Dr. Gibbs forgot to mention here is a huge problem.

684
01:18:52,410 --> 01:18:56,100
So I'll be a huge D-Ohio state fan.

685
01:18:56,130 --> 01:19:03,540
So what I got offered this job is they're giving me a lot of pokes and fun.

686
01:19:03,540 --> 01:19:07,439
And I had I'm not a football person, as you may have concluded.

687
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:14,940
I have to say, over the years, some of my best experiences in college football have been either in Ann Arbor or in Columbus,

688
01:19:14,940 --> 01:19:16,920
going to the Ohio State Michigan game.

689
01:19:17,310 --> 01:19:28,620
And I you can tell the teams have a great deal of traditional respect for each other where when Bo passed away, the tribute that Ohio State gave.

690
01:19:29,460 --> 01:19:38,580
Additionally, I can tell you I have been teased relentlessly in Ann Arbor and then offered a beverage or a bronze after they teased me.

691
01:19:38,700 --> 01:19:49,140
And I always enjoy those games. So seriously though, enjoy your your holiday, enjoy Thanksgiving and enjoy this weekend's game.

692
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:55,470
We got any any questions Auburn got a couple of go blues and then we got a gig

693
01:19:55,470 --> 01:20:03,390
up and go Blue Jay going to go blue that's you know the giggle I have a oh,

694
01:20:03,390 --> 01:20:10,800
sorry. I have a question. Thanks for coming and talking with us or giving a lecture.

695
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:19,379
Do you have anything is there anything that you wish you would have known before

696
01:20:19,380 --> 01:20:23,520
going into the field or would have been helpful going before going into the field?

697
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:30,900
Like as a lot of us are graduating or maybe all of us accept change and accept opportunity.

698
01:20:31,850 --> 01:20:42,230
And and this is something when I talk to our dear students, our Ph.D. students about career, I have four degrees.

699
01:20:42,350 --> 01:20:45,200
One is in biology. One is in environmental engineering.

700
01:20:46,370 --> 01:20:51,710
My doctorates in environmental science and I have an MBA in agribusiness, and I'm a certified industrial hygienist.

701
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:56,760
None of them are from a school of public health and none of them are in public health.

702
01:20:57,030 --> 01:21:02,580
I've been doing public health my entire life and I've been in schools of public health my entire life.

703
01:21:02,940 --> 01:21:06,450
It's just when I was coming through my graduate, you know,

704
01:21:06,450 --> 01:21:12,860
as someone who didn't have family members who went to college, I didn't understand what public health was.

705
01:21:12,870 --> 01:21:19,379
I didn't know what it was until I was in my doctoral program. So you're always you're already have a leg up on me.

706
01:21:19,380 --> 01:21:24,720
A leg up on me. You are getting skill sets that are widely applicable.

707
01:21:25,320 --> 01:21:29,100
Don't get locked in into what your career you think is going to be.

708
01:21:29,970 --> 01:21:36,690
I did my master's degree solely because I was employed as a contractor for U.S. EPA,

709
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:43,380
and that company had tuition remission, and I was a resource limited kid from southwestern Ohio.

710
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:49,260
And I just went. Ohio State was, at least in my world at the time, kind of expensive.

711
01:21:50,070 --> 01:21:57,180
Now, looking back at what I know, other colleges cost not so much on the expensive side, but I started my master's degree.

712
01:21:57,180 --> 01:22:03,060
I started taking classes there just because I saw it as a benefit I wasn't getting and I had good mentoring.

713
01:22:03,090 --> 01:22:07,590
Who said, Hey, you're pretty good at your masters, your research work?

714
01:22:07,590 --> 01:22:12,780
Have you thought, I'm going for a Ph.D.? I was wanting to get a master's, potentially move up in the company I was at.

715
01:22:13,810 --> 01:22:17,140
You know, so just embrace change of race opportunity.

716
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:21,700
Swati, did you have your hand up as well? Yes.

717
01:22:22,150 --> 01:22:32,530
I just wanted to know. As you very beautifully stated, how your very range of degrees that you have.

718
01:22:33,010 --> 01:22:41,260
I was wondering how you specifically got into infectious disease and emergency response.

719
01:22:42,310 --> 01:22:45,880
A lot of it was evolution of my of my work.

720
01:22:46,210 --> 01:22:53,770
So my my masters degree, I was actually looking at bio aerosol as drift coming off of confined animal feeding operations.

721
01:22:54,250 --> 01:23:01,690
And then with my doctoral work, I was looking at what was called an intentional cross connection into a distribution system,

722
01:23:02,440 --> 01:23:09,580
which was basically how would you intentionally poison or in fact a community using the water system.

723
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:19,390
And then just opportunity. So the first five years of my career, I was doing a lot of work on bio aerosols and in 95 protection,

724
01:23:19,960 --> 01:23:22,450
mostly looking at it from an agriculture standpoint.

725
01:23:22,450 --> 01:23:29,709
And then I started moving into hospital acquired infections, which if you're unfamiliar with hospital acquired infections at any given year,

726
01:23:29,710 --> 01:23:35,770
75,000 people die from a hospital acquired infection and it costs us $1,000,000,000 plus.

727
01:23:36,580 --> 01:23:39,580
And then as I started working in a hospital acquired infections,

728
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:47,350
I got recruited to leave the UT School of Public Health by the University of Nebraska to help create their new School of Public Health,

729
01:23:47,620 --> 01:23:52,690
our College of Public Health. And they were home to a fledgling biocontainment unit.

730
01:23:52,990 --> 01:23:56,410
And I just started talking with the doctors and nurses there,

731
01:23:56,710 --> 01:24:03,430
and they realized that there was a whole thing in regards to this response that they weren't protected with.

732
01:24:03,430 --> 01:24:07,810
And I realized there was a whole nother opportunity and started doing work in that.

733
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:12,490
And really, it's about opportunity. It's it's about situation.

734
01:24:12,760 --> 01:24:17,050
You can divide my career from pre Ebola and post Ebola.

735
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:20,700
I was a tenured full professor pre Ebola.

736
01:24:20,710 --> 01:24:30,040
I was doing very well. I probably you know, I probably had 60, 70 publications post Ebola that doubles almost within five years.

737
01:24:33,680 --> 01:24:38,240
Well, thank you so much, Dr. Gibbs. We got a lot of thank you's in the chat.

738
01:24:38,270 --> 01:24:42,350
I'll send out the evaluation. I'll put an announcement on cannabis.

739
01:24:43,100 --> 01:24:47,089
But thank you so much for taking your time. I know you're incredibly busy, as always.

740
01:24:47,090 --> 01:24:55,069
Even though I've heard you give different elements of this talk and different iterations, always very entertaining and informative.

741
01:24:55,070 --> 01:24:59,000
So thank you so much. Excellent. Best of luck in your career.

742
01:25:00,170 --> 01:25:04,730
Go Buckeyes on Saturday and then I hope you win your bowl game. Thank you.

743
01:25:04,760 --> 01:25:05,450
Bye.
