1
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:37,290
After. Right.

2
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:46,120
So I realized Claire might know some of this stuff and I edgewise, but.

3
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,300
It's good to go over. See.

4
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:09,060
Do you guys have any questions or anything of stuff coming? First kind of just getting back into the swing of things.

5
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:19,010
Talk about an age first. If there's so much there's so much NIH detail.

6
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:44,110
And then. Okay. Well, here, let me just start a very quickly to the restroom, a few more minutes before going back and starting to clean out.

7
00:01:44,130 --> 00:02:10,630
And then I have no idea. I didn't want to make you cry.

8
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,980
Oh, I can bring you. I'll bring you something, I.

9
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:46,530
I rest. I feel like I still have a lot of anxiety. I was thinking like this, not only are we going to have to kind of get started on.

10
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:54,879
I want to make sure we talk about this.

11
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,560
We can get started and then we can see how it goes.

12
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:08,409
Okay. So I wanted to just also check in on a few things like around assignments and when you guys want to do presentations and stuff.

13
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:13,030
So we'll kind of build remind me to back that up to.

14
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:17,590
Presentation dates chopped down.

15
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:29,490
And then what I wanted to do is just kind of talk through and get your guys experience on all these different kinds of applications.

16
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:38,430
Have patience and then kind of dove into like grant writing, you know, tips and things to think about and ways to approach it.

17
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:46,530
And I think the thing that I say a lot about that and I think it's actually I find it kind of fun because it's you can get to like,

18
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:50,160
you know, you're not doing the project, you're just like reposting the project.

19
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:56,920
But there's like so much detailed stress that's often comes around it.

20
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:01,230
So it's good to just sort of like have that overview of where you're aiming.

21
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:08,760
And then if we have time, like, and I, it's, and I don't know if you guys have looked at these videos,

22
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,319
but there are some videos around like the NIH review process.

23
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,050
And I think it's good to just sort of dove into that a little bit because,

24
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:20,969
you know, depending on how much grant writing football experience people have,

25
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:26,940
which I think this group has more than some prior years, if I'm not wrong,

26
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:32,490
it's interesting to like unveil a little bit of that review process because it's.

27
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,670
Because it's like, not perfect. But I think so.

28
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:45,780
I'll go over a few things, but then I think we could like pivot around if people are like, Oh, I totally know this stuff, let's talk more about this.

29
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,950
We can shift.

30
00:06:48,550 --> 00:07:00,570
Okay, so we want to confirm these final assignments and then I don't know if Jackie has reached out to you guys yet about this on the website.

31
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:06,180
Yeah, I just sent it to her. Oh, great. Okay, awesome.

32
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:13,709
Usually, like, right around now this reminder is always I she was like five three right around now.

33
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:16,920
And I think it's like a post fall break or is like, okay, wait, what's going on?

34
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:21,600
Like, we've gotten through the first burst of this semester, so.

35
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:29,060
It's nice to have everybody's profiles up there and not everybody wants to put their photo up just fine.

36
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:36,660
But it's a good place to, you know, have have some professional representation.

37
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,670
So I will make sure to mention that an acquaintance or two.

38
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:50,070
Okay. And then, Jackie, just send the info to Jackie about that.

39
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:55,690
And when you look at those blurbs. It has blown up.

40
00:07:56,260 --> 00:08:02,299
So who's up there? You know, there most of these have been up there.

41
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:07,350
I'm just scanning them. Since the people started.

42
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:18,090
So I would say make it broad enough. So that it still, you know, it can have a range if there's any.

43
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:22,410
Yes, there's several. Exactly. I don't know.

44
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:27,209
Yeah, I don't know. I see. This is like one of these Internet website management things.

45
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:31,740
Like, everybody's got like a slightly different size. I don't know. I don't know who is putting on it.

46
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:36,180
There's Chelsea is bigger, too, I think.

47
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:49,680
But it may not be Jacqui who actually does it, but it's a good place to for everybody to look around and kind of also like build that community of,

48
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,220
you know, faculty, know who the students are.

49
00:08:53,470 --> 00:09:02,310
They're not, you know, they're working with them. Oh, and the other thing, this will probably just be upcoming.

50
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:09,710
But Christine, I had a big I had a meeting yesterday about the IDP and the IDP assignment, like what works the best?

51
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:22,740
So we're going to try to get feedback from you guys about like it's really like format since we're trying to standardize a little bit across people,

52
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:26,430
which personally I think would be awesome,

53
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:31,709
but we wanted to allow people flexibility for a few years to kind of just figure out what is working the best.

54
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:35,070
So given that you guys have just looked at that process.

55
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:43,600
We may reach out. We may have the Hibiki representatives who I think are Sarah and Sarah Feldman and.

56
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:53,760
I can't remember who the other person is. Reach out to current doc students to say like what's what format is helpful?

57
00:09:53,760 --> 00:10:04,799
And then also having a sense from like students who are further in the program know what's been helpful for like moving forward.

58
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:10,920
And I think that, you know, as you guys can reflect to like different things are helpful are different parts of your program.

59
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:16,080
But if we can get a format that works across time, I think that would be great.

60
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:20,400
And then I could just say, like, my thought for this class would be like,

61
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:27,150
I still like that CVS assignment right at the beginning because it just sort of forces people to like reorient a little bit to like,

62
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:28,769
okay, this is what I've done.

63
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:36,090
Like, this is like it's like the start of my professional packaging, but I can totally see splitting up the IEP assignment to later.

64
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:40,079
So I mean, you know, as he tries to reflect on that,

65
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:52,860
to put those apart and then we have this more formal IEP like review kind of baked into other review processes, which I think would be good.

66
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:58,349
But it's kind of taken a while for people to kind of get on board with that.

67
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:03,450
But people have to like force it right away. So yeah.

68
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:12,150
So will that more to come on that I think. But I'm trying to think I think not everybody.

69
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:17,130
There are few people finishing up who took this class prior to having that.

70
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:25,290
But the people who were in this class, I think Keanu now, I can't remember who was first in.

71
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:27,910
The first cohort that I did of this class.

72
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:34,650
But almost everybody now has done 800 in this kind of format, which is pretty different, somewhat different from what it was before.

73
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:40,010
So hopefully people will have a take on this idea.

74
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:46,450
Cool. Okay. So those are like items of business. So, all right.

75
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:49,930
So we can start to just talk about grants.

76
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:54,710
Why do this? Maybe. You know, we are.

77
00:11:56,030 --> 00:12:05,420
But I think overall, this is something, especially when people have funding, this can like fall to the back burner.

78
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:08,149
And I worry a little bit about that.

79
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:18,680
Not that people have to be like stressed about writing grants to get funds per say, but it's just good practice and to get like a habit of doing it.

80
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:27,169
I think it's smart. It's also just sort of practical because you can also, depending on sort of what you're writing about,

81
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:31,940
you can read news like we talked to the panelists here about like music class assignments and stuff.

82
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:41,660
When you write grant proposals, you're sort of forced to like really boil down your argument in a very tight way.

83
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:47,730
And I think, Oh yeah, I've just commented on your guys presentations and stuff.

84
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:54,620
I feel like that's a good practice too for like a grant proposal because just like here are the main points in

85
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:59,810
my argument and that's really what you have to do for like no matter what the scope of your grant proposal is,

86
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:05,450
it's always that like. Crisp, you know, tight argument thing.

87
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:12,259
And so once you kind of get some of those parts going, you can reuse all over the place.

88
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:16,639
And I would say, like in terms of self plagiarism, which we've talked about a little bit,

89
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:27,200
like ran applications are just like that sort of goes out the window because people just reuse the lit language and I think that's 100% fine.

90
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:34,849
Like it's so different. So I don't know if you guys have had that experience and you guys both work with research teams where

91
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:39,680
you're pulling information probably from like what's been done before and written about before,

92
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:46,270
boilerplate language. So all of that. It's print and grant writing.

93
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:54,430
I think this is the other important reason to do it in grad school is that it is usually low stakes.

94
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,580
Is it $500? Is it $1,000?

95
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:07,500
You know, like it's sort of low stakes money in there for low stakes applications or like less glamorous, but it could be high yield.

96
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:15,450
And again, once you get like sort of an idea going that you've written about in Grant, grant format, then you can start to shop it around.

97
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:18,090
And there are a lot of funding opportunities around which we'll talk about it.

98
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:24,000
And I think that the other thing like Laura was mentioning, she did primary data collection.

99
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:30,450
So that could be like a really specific ask because I think sometimes it's unclear.

100
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:34,350
Like, well, I'm taking classes, I'm kind of doing my work.

101
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:39,059
I'm funded for my education. So like, why do I need to write a grant?

102
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:46,469
And so figuring out like an ask in that business terminology I think is helpful.

103
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:49,680
And I think it's sometimes it's really clear and sometimes it's not so clear.

104
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:56,909
So I think that can be like a point of like just strategizing and talking to people, like, what could I write the brand for?

105
00:14:56,910 --> 00:15:05,490
And I think something like that Summer Writing Award is an obvious low hanging fruit thing, but some other things that are more.

106
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:16,860
Either for more specific. Type of support or broad support type of support.

107
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:21,120
Those can be more amorphous in terms of like what fits in there.

108
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:27,510
So that's certainly like an ongoing thing to think about. Okay.

109
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,530
And so, again, like, these are sort of like super straightforward,

110
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:35,580
but I think it's always really good to take a step back and be like, okay, what are we doing here?

111
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:41,550
And I wanted to look at the we still just pop up.

112
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,750
Okay. So find a mechanism.

113
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:54,070
This is a good place to look and we'll pull that up. I say this and I do it like I'm just trying to apply for something right now.

114
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:57,110
And I'm like, okay, I'll go back like, what is this for? What?

115
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,130
Who? What are you trying to do and what's the eligibility?

116
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:08,070
And you guys are in like a special status where you likely have increased eligibility for some things and not eligible for other things.

117
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:14,610
And so really before getting excited about anything, figure out that you're eligible to apply for it.

118
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:23,730
And then if we can get some examples and I pulled up some of the sites that have really good examples of each

119
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:31,530
level grants but kind of at all levels see if that exists when you're thinking of applying for something,

120
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:38,340
you know, definitely talk to your advisor, obviously. And then the department administrator, who's Chris Boling,

121
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:48,440
she is possibly someone who needs to know if you're putting in a grant proposal, like I'm not sure.

122
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:54,780
I think she ultimately knows about even like summer writing awards because she's just all things money and finances in the department.

123
00:16:56,550 --> 00:17:06,570
But certainly if you're applying for anything external, it's good to talk to your advisor first and then she may be need me to be looped in.

124
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:16,949
Some of these graduate student funding streams require some cost sharing from the advisor and

125
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:26,850
so that's something that would need to be planned and need to be planned early and for any.

126
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:34,589
Oh, I, I'm you know, no, I figured we just we just started talking broadly, but I'm sorry.

127
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:38,060
It's just for travel, and I got delayed in.

128
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:48,890
Oh, I couldn't make it. This morning is in the capital thing, you know. Well, I'm glad you answered hustling and yeah, it's.

129
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:54,209
I know applying right now is just, like, not cool.

130
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:59,130
So we're just retention grants stuff and just sort of why do it and kind of what are like U of

131
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:04,410
M resources we'll talk about and then I'm saying I've got a bunch of stuff around and I age,

132
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:14,250
so either you'll have unique additional info to add or it'll be like, I know that that's the one thing.

133
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:20,549
Uh, let's see. I feel like there was a third thing I meant.

134
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:25,800
Oh, the AP will also figure out, like, well, maybe an hour break.

135
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,610
We'll figure out, like,

136
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:36,089
when people are going to do presentations and then get pictures up on the speech profile website for grad student for students.

137
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:39,300
And then so when come back to those.

138
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:43,470
So let's see. Yeah.

139
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:50,520
So in terms of this just grant to nuts and bolts stuff that was saying you need this sort of concise

140
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:55,259
description of your work that you can reuse and you also usually need a concise description of you,

141
00:18:55,260 --> 00:19:00,989
which is another reason I do that. I have sketch like file sketch paragraphs where like a an early start of that

142
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:04,950
because probably what you guys would be applying for if it's anything big,

143
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:08,670
is like a training has got to have a training component to it.

144
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:13,589
And so that concise description of you and your awesomeness and why you're like

145
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:18,389
the perfect person to get this award is an important part of any training thing.

146
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:25,770
In addition to all those resources I was talking about, like the redness Chakotay see scarring, go to all the acronyms and to, you know,

147
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:34,200
different workshops and things of training like for research planner activity and training of that training planner are what you're going to need.

148
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:39,150
And you may also need again here references from advisor.

149
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:50,370
And then I mentioned if it's a training goal training grant, you'll need a whole separate section for that and then budget justification.

150
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:56,760
So again, the budget for like the Summer Reading Award is a few hundred dollars and your justification is like,

151
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,920
I need to survive and then I will deliver. Your deliverable at the end is like a paper submission.

152
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:06,550
So that's pretty straightforward and honestly make it a lot more complicated and.

153
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:14,710
It's good to I think while you're here, this is another reason why it's good to put in,

154
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:19,850
I would say, an F 31 while you're here because you can meet with somebody,

155
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:26,829
get that budget is relatively simple for like an age grant but you can meet with somebody

156
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:31,030
who like really knows budget stuff and they can kind of sit down and walk you through it.

157
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:36,040
We'll talk about, we'll talk about certain budget things today, but.

158
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:42,330
It's just so helpful to have somebody sit down with you and say, like, these are all the things you need to think about, you know?

159
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:47,749
Oh, really? And it differs by situation and stuff.

160
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:58,070
Like, for example, here in this page, you have to pay as a faculty person, you have to put it to get computers and things through grants.

161
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:03,410
Phone lines, all kinds of stuff goes on your back budget.

162
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:08,930
In psychology, you don't have to do a flight covered by the infrastructure of the department.

163
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:14,220
And so that's just sort of, again, one of those things that are helpful to know and you won't know.

164
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:21,600
So it's just good to go to the budget person and say, Hi, I'm doing this great proposal and I've allowed a lot of time to plan.

165
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:27,140
Let's talk about my budget because that's actually an early part of grant writing.

166
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:31,700
But you can get into. Okay.

167
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:39,680
So let me talk about so that's just the big overview. But let me talk about the is this U of M funding site?

168
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:49,660
So. You know, like all of these sort of sites, there's a big, you know, automated, like it sucks information.

169
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:56,590
And so you probably have to sort of scroll around a little bit to feel it, figure out what's going to be useful to you and talk to people also.

170
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:02,260
But there's definitely there's also just like a general help section.

171
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:07,240
But here you click on each of them.

172
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:10,660
Funding. I don't think you just see here. Oh, yeah.

173
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:20,350
So on this site, there's like an internal U of M funding thing for, like, better for grad students.

174
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:26,400
And this is a helpful page to sort of keep on your guy's radar.

175
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:34,920
It's from this library guide because it just goes through lots of different funding sources.

176
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:42,149
So, for example, for you guys, you could for sure be this a CW.

177
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:48,300
It's a center for the education of women. And so very often a really good funding source if one is a woman.

178
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,990
These are more topically related.

179
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:59,460
So this is like more environmental.

180
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:03,480
Ginsburg Center is more civic engagement.

181
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,989
And they're they're really great. They do a lot of work.

182
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:12,809
And I don't know off the top of my head if they have like a Ph.D. project funding kind of grant.

183
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:16,590
But I think they could. Earwig is another one.

184
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:23,070
If you're conducting research on women and gender, so like I could see any of your topics touching on earwig.

185
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:35,490
It's like a really goofy sounding acronym, but they, they're a good one to sort of if you're focused on women's issues in any way.

186
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:42,150
And then there's other ones, you know, kind of as you go down the line, we've talked already about Iraq.

187
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:48,960
I mean, I know you guys are really familiar with Rackham, but that is also another like first line place to look to see like,

188
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:55,380
what could I possibly do in this funding world that I could that I could look at?

189
00:23:57,090 --> 00:24:01,510
And then also here. Here's the public health one.

190
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:09,420
They have tuition, but I think they also have a.

191
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:14,040
Do they have that funding links? I think they might actually link back.

192
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:17,940
So this is more like financial aid, less like grant writing.

193
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:21,790
But I think this research guide is helpful.

194
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:29,260
This is a get down the line, but this is why I give you guys these links for later.

195
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:36,220
There are specific like dissertation fellowships not only for like an F 31 from NIH,

196
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:40,750
but lots of different foundations like big foundations offer them.

197
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:45,639
So like Blue Cross Blue Shield also has offered that in the past.

198
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:49,090
So again, I get to see particularly your guys research lining up with that.

199
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:52,610
I feel like they've also had an interest in like migrant health.

200
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:56,820
So again, you can kind of play, you know, look at do the sort of general search,

201
00:24:56,870 --> 00:25:02,950
know what's out there, and then we'll talk about you need to dove into their like areas of interest.

202
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:11,230
Okay. So that's kind of like where to find groups that get out of this.

203
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:15,920
Thing. Okay, hold on. In seat. I mean, opportunities.

204
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:22,530
All right. I guess so.

205
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:25,890
Just on the other. Okay. So the question.

206
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:33,100
So here's just again, like a scope of different types of things that would be relevant for you guys.

207
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:41,139
And this is again, this is like a process to talk to people, but this is like travel to answer another like clear ask.

208
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:45,760
And you usually have to be presenting at the conference to get a travel ban.

209
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:47,979
But that's a great thing to do.

210
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:58,690
And of course, if you get an interest finding you listed on your CV and you can even list the amount until the amounts until you get bigger amounts,

211
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:03,909
and then you feel like, okay, I can take the $500 off, but I still leave the award on.

212
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:09,389
But I can just take the amount of. Research centers.

213
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:13,900
So Earwig is an example of a research center that's like offering, you know,

214
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:18,989
has a programmatic way to approach graduate student funding and postdoctoral fellowships,

215
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:23,100
which are going to be like down the line, obviously, for you guys, but.

216
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:29,319
Rackham We'll also have the dissertation grants and then HPC has some reading.

217
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:35,380
So there's a lot of these sort of like little places you can seek and seek funding.

218
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:44,560
And I know that as we talked about a little bit, I think on the panel, yeah, like the timing of when you want to get, you know,

219
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:51,970
internal or some other kind of funding for your research versus like take your rack of merit funding,

220
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:58,060
you can always get a travel award over and above, like that's for a specific purpose.

221
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:05,130
And then I think I can also mention that there's some zero funding for teaching staff.

222
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:10,880
So we've been to the Rackham site, but that was those are two, I think overall good ones.

223
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:16,190
Um, let's see. Oh, the other thing.

224
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:29,390
Yeah. I'm just trying to think there are like in the mental health space and thinking about beanies,

225
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:38,060
there will definitely be certain specific foundations and things and psychiatry.

226
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:45,080
The Depression Center is another place that often has funding, like pilot funding, student funding.

227
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:53,450
Sometimes they're pretty specific, but not always. So just kind of do the reading the directions.

228
00:27:54,830 --> 00:28:00,080
Okay. So the other thing that I have coming to my email all the time are just like planning

229
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:07,340
alerts and if people are getting those or those are good things to sign up for.

230
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:12,290
Just so again, trying to get used to getting them and scrolling through to see.

231
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:20,030
You know what's what's coming down the pipeline and some of these and I each one is.

232
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:27,520
That pulled everyone. Here's just the NIH grants and funding site.

233
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:32,610
And they have a lot of info here.

234
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,999
But one of the helpful things,

235
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:43,889
since you can get just e-mail updates of what's happening broadly and you'll get this usually on a Friday afternoon is a big,

236
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:47,880
huge, dense text and you can sort of scroll through.

237
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:53,369
And I think it's, again, like good to do, good to just kind of get it in your brain early in the training process,

238
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:58,290
because then you can know how to scan through and say like, what are people interested in?

239
00:28:58,290 --> 00:29:03,840
What's, you know, ooh, there seems to be like a flurry of activity of interest in my research area.

240
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:07,890
And I'll talk about some of the different acronyms.

241
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:13,020
But some are very like formal notifications of funding available.

242
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:20,670
Some are like descriptions of this is going to be of interest to NIH in the next year.

243
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:24,209
And some are like sort of standard what they call program announcements,

244
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:33,420
which are just broad areas of research that people do that can all of it's helpful just to get a sense of

245
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:40,440
like what people are talking about at NIH and I'm talking about NIH because it's such the dominant funder.

246
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:44,760
But it goes for lots of different, you know, agencies.

247
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:58,200
So I keep losing my thing. All right. So a bunch of different ways to get to get external funding like alerts coming to you.

248
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:04,210
Okay. And so those are. That's a lot of like nuts and bolts stuff.

249
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:09,750
But sort of just taking a step back and thinking about different kinds of funding streams.

250
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:16,030
And again, I know that you guys have varying experience with different funding kind of sources,

251
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:29,110
but things to know about federal versus foundation money not versus but federal and foundation money, starting with foundations.

252
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:39,650
These are much more, I would say, somewhat more variable than federal funding streams or sources often.

253
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:47,680
Foundations tend to be small and fund really local specific priorities.

254
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:52,930
In Michigan, we have like the Kellogg Foundation, which is not tiny,

255
00:30:52,930 --> 00:31:00,999
but it funds like Michigan focused things in the infant and well, in obesity world.

256
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:08,380
We have the Gerber Foundation, which funds like the Western Michigan projects that look at feeding and eating.

257
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,680
So it's like, great if you're an obesity researcher to know that,

258
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:19,880
but you got to kind of figure out all these little niche foundations for your particular research area.

259
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:29,380
So that's helpful. To kind of just spend some time, you know, looking around at these foundations and figuring out where people are funded from.

260
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:43,970
There is a woman here, Donna Lartigue, who is like the foundation person at U of M who works for the School of Public Health.

261
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:51,780
And she is often the person who sends out alerts about foundation funding and what their priorities are.

262
00:31:55,490 --> 00:32:06,560
These little smaller foundations, you really deeply need to know their priorities for funding because they are bound to the people who fund them,

263
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:16,640
who are often like individual donors or some sort of, you know, a company or an endowment, and they can only fund what is in their mission.

264
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:23,030
So there are a lot more restricted. And so it's worse for especially smaller foundation funding,

265
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:31,810
which is great to apply for if your question can be made to fit its funding profile of their spending priorities.

266
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:36,950
Because if it's out of scope, they're just. Can't find it.

267
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:45,439
There are some larger foundations that are a little bit more like NIH, like so the National Science Foundation,

268
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:54,979
and that's also federal, but it's the foundation, American Heart Association Foundation, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation funding.

269
00:32:54,980 --> 00:33:04,490
So those are all like really big funding profiles and they fund a lot, but they're a little bit they also have like very specific priorities.

270
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:07,430
It's just they're broader and bigger because they have more resources.

271
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:19,440
Generally speaking, foundations have fewer like just sort of, I would say like free for all, like investigator initiated ideas.

272
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:24,549
So like if you have a great idea and you're like, ooh, I think Robert Wood Johnson should fund this,

273
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:28,990
or like the Grant Foundation, which is another big one that funds kids.

274
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:36,750
That's great. But like they have to be. It has to be responsive to whatever call they have out at the time.

275
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:45,630
So that's like a big difference between foundation and just sort of these broader federal funding sources.

276
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:50,890
Um. One way like that.

277
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:57,930
Here's a few things to just know about foundations is that they're very relationship kind of dependent.

278
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:04,110
And so the great thing about foundation funding is that like if they like you,

279
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:10,770
they may just keep funding you, they like what you do and their priorities keep aligning with that work.

280
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:15,840
You can like be funded for a long time from foundations.

281
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:23,549
There's one called the Templeton Foundation. The first that focuses on like positive is like a positive psychology kind of foundation.

282
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:29,879
There's a fence or grant, you know, they're all all different types of foundations exist for like lots of different reasons.

283
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:36,390
If you can find your niche and the foundation that like really wants to commit to what you do, awesome.

284
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:39,510
And you should totally see if that exists.

285
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:45,570
And then what you do is you really cultivate the relationship and you talk to the people who work at the foundation whose jobs.

286
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:47,899
We'll talk more about this,

287
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:55,970
but whose job it is to basically like have a portfolio of grants that they fund that they try to pull in awesome investigators.

288
00:34:57,830 --> 00:35:06,020
The other thing to know about foundations, which you guys may hear about or know about already, is that generally speaking, usually always foundation.

289
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:13,880
Foundation funding brings in less money to the institution than federal money.

290
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:21,680
So that IDC do people know what that acronym did where people heard of indirect costs?

291
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:28,009
So that's that acronym. So if you talk to like budget people that are like the ITC, the IBC,

292
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:35,150
the IDC because a foundation of indirect costs are the way that indirect costs work.

293
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:42,320
And I apologize if this is totally, deeply familiar to everybody, but like, say, if you have a grant,

294
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:49,640
that is a grant proposal that's proposing like a $100,000 of the total budget of the grant.

295
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:58,720
If you're applying to a foundation, the indirect cost rate, which is like the key phrase,

296
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:14,590
can be anywhere from like 10% to like 30%, which means that the institution gets know, say, 10000 to $32000 if that 100,000 total.

297
00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:26,270
That's great, but it's not as much as if you had a federal grant that has an indirect cost rate of like 55% or higher.

298
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:36,300
Some of this varies by institution and direct cross-trained. So like, for example, at Harvard, the indirect costs rate is like 90 something percent.

299
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:41,820
So if you get a grant there from NIH, this is another difference.

300
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:55,920
And I each specifically, they will pay $100,000 plus whatever, $98,000 to the institution and $100, $100,000 to the project.

301
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:05,250
And so you can see why, like institutions sometimes don't love foundation grants because they don't get as much.

302
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,830
Infrastructure money from a foundation grant.

303
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:12,590
That said, these are really important,

304
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:17,870
especially when you're really starting out and especially if you can find a foundation that aligns with your research area.

305
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:27,209
So. At a faculty level, people can get pushback from like administrators and budget.

306
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:34,080
And like here, just for example, you have to write up a special little thing that says, I'm going to apply for this foundation money.

307
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,170
I know they won't give you as much in direct cost.

308
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:42,160
Back. So therefore I can make a deal.

309
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:47,560
But you can say I. Alison will pay. Make up the difference from another source.

310
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:50,980
That's the worst case scenario. Like nobody likes to do that.

311
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:59,140
But that might be sometimes worth doing, if you like, really want to get funding for a specific project that the foundation is eager to fund it.

312
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:00,970
So definitely gets a little complicated.

313
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:16,149
So switching to federal sources, a lot of other acronyms NIH, CDC, Department of Justice, USDA, lots of different federal funding agencies.

314
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:24,970
And I'll talk about just the NIH structure. One thing to know and to keep in mind is that this indirect cost rate that I was just talking about,

315
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:31,840
that the way that that is distributed and accounted for differs by grant mechanism,

316
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:36,160
like even for these federal grants, which have a higher indirect cost rate.

317
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:45,250
So sticking with a $100,000 example at NIH, if your indirect cost rate is 55%,

318
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:54,730
they're going to give and I will give the University of Michigan mascot a message that's going to get me about like, you know, $155,000.

319
00:38:55,060 --> 00:39:01,480
If you get that grant, if you the investigator. Right it get it goes to the University of Michigan and it gets goes for that much money.

320
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:07,360
You as the investigator for the project will see $100,000 of that.

321
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:13,840
That's 155. So that's and I need to give it one top and that's total costs.

322
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:18,250
155. Indirect is 55 and your project costs are 100.

323
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:29,160
In contrast, like CDC, which also pays that 55% indirect cost rate because that's like University of Michigan, like what?

324
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:40,950
University of Michigan charges to kind of do business. But a CDC grant, if you see the call for $100,000, that 55 actually has to come out of 100,000.

325
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:51,840
Because for the CDC, when you see like a call that says we're, you know, this grant budget is up to $200,000 or $100,000 to keep my mouth simple.

326
00:39:52,960 --> 00:40:00,910
You have to remember as an investigator that that is total cost and that the indirect costs will come out of that budget.

327
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,840
And if you're talking about indirect costs that are like around 50%,

328
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:14,480
that means like you have half the money for the project if you get it funded by CDC compared to if you get it funded by NIH.

329
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:23,480
And that is another big reason why people love a share, because you just sort of are working with like your bottom line of that number.

330
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:30,710
But the proposal that's giving. So that's just, you know, it's all this like nuance.

331
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:34,180
But that's why people kind of go crazy about this for.

332
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:38,580
And these are the reasons why. Yeah.

333
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:48,230
I don't know. Two different, like, academic institutions handle the way I see it boil down to the actual investigator differently.

334
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:55,070
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I think it does vary by institution.

335
00:40:55,550 --> 00:41:03,920
It's not supposed to ultimately, I think as designed, come back to the investigator, but it sometimes does in different ways.

336
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:19,160
So for example, here as a research faculty member, you get some I can remember, I think it's you get 5% back.

337
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:28,640
It's like a kickback of the total amount of indirect costs that you generate for the university, I think, across two years.

338
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:35,900
So like you get a few hundred thousand dollars if you've been generating a lot of money for the university institution.

339
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:45,009
The tenure track faculty member has a different type of arrangement and it's not that good

340
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:49,540
because less of their job is about writing grants and some of their job is about teaching.

341
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:55,420
So even within like a unit at an institution, it's different.

342
00:41:58,030 --> 00:42:06,450
So it's tricky. The other thing that like these pay for it though, are like our grants administrators, you know, they're supposed to pay.

343
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:12,100
And then here's another issue. Could go on for a while, but it's important.

344
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:16,959
And it's like it's it's why there's like sometimes drama about like where to apply

345
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:22,690
for this or like some the training awards have very low indirect cost rates.

346
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:30,010
Like if you guys have heard of K awards, yeah, those have an 8% F direct cost rate and it's for five years.

347
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:36,160
So awesome for the individual. Getting the K award is fantastic.

348
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:43,240
But like the institutions like what, 8% and we have to support this person, give them an office, blah, blah, blah.

349
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:53,910
So it's there's this sort of disconnect in training words. But what I was also going to say is that like more and more because of, like, you know.

350
00:42:55,500 --> 00:43:00,990
Cuts to education budgets universities rely on fees to.

351
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:06,219
Like update their classrooms have nice you know, turn on the lights,

352
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:14,920
pay for some basic things and so when these go down, the university stressed especially the university doesn't have,

353
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:23,680
you know, deep endowments of pockets and stuff because these, like, really drive what the workings of the university can be.

354
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:27,129
And if you don't have a grants administrator like, you know,

355
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:32,260
if you're at a place and you want to apply for NIH grant and there's no grants administrator or

356
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:36,610
there's like somebody who's there 2 hours a week and they haven't applied for a major grant before.

357
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:41,110
That's a whole different story than like doing it from here,

358
00:43:41,110 --> 00:43:46,780
where we have like a few grants administrators who've like done it a lot and they're like, No, the deal and no the budgets.

359
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:51,910
Because there's like, we're all worrying about the science, but there's so much more.

360
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:55,680
Right. And everybody's probably been involved in parts of the so much more.

361
00:43:57,250 --> 00:44:00,309
So it really it it's all very tied together.

362
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:06,280
And it makes you kind of realize why this research one university is like Michigan.

363
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:14,660
Why they're so focused on not only the science, but like to keep the operation running.

364
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:19,500
It is. That's why people need to get these big grants.

365
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:30,470
Also, if you're at an institution which is like, you know, for example, people go into academia and they go to like a teaching focused institution.

366
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:37,490
That institution is generating much more money from tuition than they are from grant money.

367
00:44:37,730 --> 00:44:45,560
And so the expectation is not to get BS, but like foundation, like it's sort of less of an issue, if that makes sense.

368
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:52,150
So yeah, there's a lot of like that. Sort of complication and stuff.

369
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:56,020
And then I'll see you again. You go down together.

370
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:59,560
How do you do that as an investigator?

371
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:05,230
It's not just friends. We used to, like, catch things related to other researchers.

372
00:45:05,410 --> 00:45:10,450
Yeah, they related to the practice of gravity. It's a great question.

373
00:45:10,670 --> 00:45:12,000
It probably depends.

374
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:26,590
But like, for example, here, if people have here any kind of like slush fund, it's called a research incentive account for a reason.

375
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:30,760
If you guys are for that term, like your advisors all have a reason,

376
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:43,120
meaning that whatever money has kind of come their way that's like unattached to a project goes in your reason, your research incentive account.

377
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:51,939
And that's a little bit like it's not free money, but it's like you can divert it to a graduation project or someone's travel or something.

378
00:45:51,940 --> 00:46:02,090
That's not, like you said, connected to a project. I should have a better sense of how those get replenished.

379
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:10,370
It's definitely through indirect costs. And I don't know the calculation for the tenure track faculty.

380
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:13,250
Now that I am one, I'm like, I should know that.

381
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:22,850
But one thing too is that like people who like, I really like big grant getters and get a lot of federal funding,

382
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:28,940
these research incentive accounts can be pretty big and it's a little bit of

383
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:33,770
attention because if they're too big and they're just sort of sitting around,

384
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:38,960
the university also doesn't like that because that means I cannot spending the money.

385
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:45,200
And so you there was a and I don't remember actually what happened with this because I'm not.

386
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:53,760
One of these. Like. Like, I'm not like the rainmaker person anymore, but there is a big discussion about, like, some people have, like.

387
00:46:55,640 --> 00:47:01,520
Hundreds of thousands of dollars have been a reason and they needed to spend it down.

388
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:09,380
But you can also understand why people who are like going away and hoarding that so that I can like pay for a grad student or a postdoc,

389
00:47:09,890 --> 00:47:13,880
who would take that? Who would be paid by that? Money doesn't have to be affiliated with a project.

390
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:19,510
So there was a little bit of like. Tension around that fears that.

391
00:47:20,810 --> 00:47:31,580
So yeah there's a lot of you know like I think this issue is always sort of there but understanding like why people care about those things is,

392
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:35,180
I think helpful just as you guys are going into this.

393
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:41,149
And again, it does vary by institution and knowing that that has their cost range also varies.

394
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:46,370
If you think about like then if you're a researcher at a Harvard with like a super high

395
00:47:46,370 --> 00:47:51,300
indirect costs that really have to apply to like an eye age because if you kind of see,

396
00:47:51,380 --> 00:48:01,400
see they're going to like eat the whole budget. And I think again, like people make deals and do all sorts of things with the foundations, but.

397
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:10,010
It's good to know about that. Oh, and I also always tell the story about myself.

398
00:48:10,010 --> 00:48:17,470
The first script that I got that was external was after like a K award, but it was like an external, very small.

399
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:25,100
But I didn't realize that under a cost issue and they needed to account for, you know,

400
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:29,380
they basically had given the total cost and I needed to account for indirect costs.

401
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:33,920
I didn't realize that. And I'm like a junior faculty member just trying to apply for all these things.

402
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,030
And I didn't know that.

403
00:48:35,510 --> 00:48:44,809
And so I met with the budget person, like not that long before the grant was due and she was like, Oh, Allison, I think your budget is totally wrong.

404
00:48:44,810 --> 00:48:50,240
Like, you can't spend this much money on the project because you haven't accounted for the indirect costs.

405
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:51,680
And so I was like, Oh.

406
00:48:52,850 --> 00:48:59,220
And so I had to, like, shrink the budget by like 45%, you know, in two days I was like, I guess I'm doing a different kind of project saying,

407
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:04,740
you know, so because it's a very real constraint and like you have to know about stuff going in.

408
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:10,219
So luckily I was just like, Hey, I guess I'll have less of my salary, you know, but it was okay.

409
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:16,750
But so that's something that's really helped. Yeah, that's right.

410
00:49:16,990 --> 00:49:24,350
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You fun that they want you to be invested, hmm?

411
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:27,580
Mm hmm. Mm. Yeah.

412
00:49:27,610 --> 00:49:37,860
I was just on a call yesterday about. I think it's a project that's like me, Justin, and someone in social work, and she's a pi,

413
00:49:37,870 --> 00:49:43,900
she's junior, and she wanted, I think, to be equitable and, like, put us all on equally.

414
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:53,920
But I was like, No, no, you need to put more of you on as the P.I. and also we're more senior, so our salaries are programs like shrink us to 2%.

415
00:49:54,910 --> 00:49:59,649
Put yourself on the budget for at least like ideally 10%, at least 5%.

416
00:49:59,650 --> 00:50:04,670
And this is like an internal thing. So it's. It's big for an internal thing.

417
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:11,370
Otherwise, usually internal grants don't have faculty salaries at all on there, and so people are just kind of donating time.

418
00:50:14,730 --> 00:50:18,930
But yeah, it's a balance because that's the obvious. That's the most expensive part of it.

419
00:50:18,990 --> 00:50:23,400
Grant usually is like co-investigator and investigator salaries.

420
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:27,780
And so it's, it's like a strategy thing too,

421
00:50:27,810 --> 00:50:36,330
which is that to get something funded often you need like big senior people who are like famous in that world to,

422
00:50:36,990 --> 00:50:43,680
you know, give advice like legitimately but also kind of name recognition to your proposal.

423
00:50:44,610 --> 00:50:48,750
But they cost a lot. And if they're not at your institution,

424
00:50:49,050 --> 00:50:58,050
then you get in a situation where you're paying their institutional indirect cost and salary and like extra things because it costs more.

425
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:04,840
So often people come on as a consultant. That's like one way to work around the problem.

426
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:12,040
Exactly. So like, if you're a consultant and you're like a big senior person, I'm saying that in quotes too.

427
00:51:13,510 --> 00:51:21,969
You can say, Oh, yes, I'll consult with this team, you know, for ten days across the life of the project at like, you know,

428
00:51:21,970 --> 00:51:24,970
$500 a day or $1,000 a day or something like that,

429
00:51:24,970 --> 00:51:32,770
that's going to be cheaper than having 1% of that person on the ground because it doesn't have a direct cost with it.

430
00:51:35,410 --> 00:51:41,670
And then strategically thinking about like the reviewer going 1% of that person, like what is that?

431
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:44,350
You know, so at some point it's better to be a consultant.

432
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:52,130
The catch, though, is that you can't have a consultant who's from your institution only has to be outside.

433
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:59,380
So that's why so personally, like I'm on a lot of grants for like 2 to 3%, 1 to 3%, really.

434
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,900
And it's ridiculous. And I just feel like.

435
00:52:03,510 --> 00:52:07,950
I'll just you know, we talked about like that conflict of interest or that you're going to certify your effort.

436
00:52:09,090 --> 00:52:15,270
Some months, you know, it's like I work on a bunch of different projects with a lot of code collaborators,

437
00:52:15,810 --> 00:52:20,590
and you look at the funds and you're like, Wow, it was like 12 projects, some of which you're on for very little time.

438
00:52:20,610 --> 00:52:29,520
So there's a lot of like, like you said, wiggle room, but just sort of balance and strategy and figuring out the best way to do that.

439
00:52:30,030 --> 00:52:35,159
The consultant thing is great for any training grant.

440
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:44,010
Also, the mentors don't take any salary like and all mentors need to in their letter that's for the training grants say,

441
00:52:44,550 --> 00:52:54,400
you know, I'm donating my time at no cost to the grant. It's another little tricky thing, though, if you think about it for certification.

442
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:58,959
Like if you mentor a lot of people, like where is that time technically?

443
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:04,570
Right. Because if you're if you have 100% of your time taken up, so it gets a little tricky.

444
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:10,819
To to kind of figure out what the best plans are.

445
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:16,730
But from that sort of applicant perspective, the consultant is a way that's a good way to go and,

446
00:53:17,330 --> 00:53:20,900
you know, thinking about the number of collaborators that you need.

447
00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:29,840
So it would be great to have these seven people, but like, could we like scientifically get away with having four of them?

448
00:53:31,630 --> 00:53:35,130
So I think that's. You know,

449
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:44,850
that also gets tricky because I think we all have done like team science and have a team and the team grows then like who's on which proposal,

450
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:53,810
you know, who's involved with this proposal. That can be challenging because you can't have usually like each collaborator, you know.

451
00:53:57,570 --> 00:54:01,010
So it gets tricky. Yeah.

452
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:06,260
There's definitely a lot to think about for that for that, that part of the budget.

453
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:11,060
I, I have we see.

454
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:15,469
Let me talk a little bit about these foundations, too, because the foundation,

455
00:54:15,470 --> 00:54:23,330
like if one hasn't lived in the foundation world, it's like really, really different from the NIH world in many ways.

456
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:30,080
I mentioned they have to meet their mission focus, but often foundations will fund.

457
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:33,170
And this is why, like even with this low indirect costs,

458
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:40,130
generally smaller budgets like people are interested in applying to foundations because they're like working out a new idea or like,

459
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:49,219
I need to get like a foothold in this area and I'm not ready to apply for NIH funding because you just have to be so far long and detailed,

460
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:51,740
sophisticated, and they're like research for that.

461
00:54:52,520 --> 00:55:02,060
Let me turn to a foundation funding that's interested in this area and see if I can link to a proof of concept type study like.

462
00:55:02,870 --> 00:55:11,120
Just going with us phone calls on yesterday like it's about screening kids and families for social determinants of health and like, schools.

463
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:15,440
So, like, is this going to work? We don't know.

464
00:55:16,490 --> 00:55:22,760
So can we make more of like a proof of concept study and figure out what the implementation stuff

465
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:30,110
that we would need versus like let's propose a big trial with three arms and hundreds of people.

466
00:55:30,110 --> 00:55:34,880
Could we do it? You know, can we answer some questions around this with like 50 people, you know?

467
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:46,280
Um, so again, here's a few foundations here. Michigan Health Endowment Fund is a relatively new one that was created due to sort

468
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:51,860
of insurance changes at the state level that created this like excessive money.

469
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:55,700
So they said, let's make it health endowment fund for Michigan.

470
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:02,240
And they have really strict rules that I think are good but hard to me as a researcher sometimes

471
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:08,240
about sustainability and like benefiting the community and having a sustainability plan.

472
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:17,870
So if you go for health endowment funding, you really their mission is to only fund people like once or twice and then be like, okay, now you're done.

473
00:56:17,870 --> 00:56:22,580
Now you're projects in the community, which is awesome, but it's hard to get.

474
00:56:22,790 --> 00:56:28,550
It's hard to do a research project that way. So that's sort of, again, like shaping.

475
00:56:28,790 --> 00:56:35,780
Can you think about pulling out parts of what you're interested in to do over here and do kind of research questions here?

476
00:56:36,470 --> 00:56:43,250
Most people build in some sort of research question to these proposals, but the really health endowment fund is like we don't fund research.

477
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:53,020
So that's something else to know. One thing that foundations often want to know is their impact in terms of how many people you serve.

478
00:56:54,310 --> 00:57:03,190
And like I mentioned, sustainability, which is really baked in to Health Endowment Fund and is generally like a stated goal for lots of foundations.

479
00:57:03,190 --> 00:57:10,900
But some are a little more like, yes, we want it as a sustainable thing, but it's not like a requirement of this specific project.

480
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:19,810
Whereas Health Endowment Fund is like, Give me your sustainability plan or we're not going to fund you because of this.

481
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:25,990
There's a more finite timescale. I mentioned a few indirect costs, a lot of which is relevant for us.

482
00:57:25,990 --> 00:57:28,840
A lot of foundations are focused on social justice,

483
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:39,430
and a lot of them in the past three years have like turned some focus to racial justice and social justice, and particularly the Ford Foundation.

484
00:57:39,430 --> 00:57:45,550
They were like in the news a lot for this because that wasn't necessarily their focus before and like policy was sort of their focus.

485
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:51,340
But now they've sort of really stated like, we're not going to fund things unless they are addressing this.

486
00:57:51,970 --> 00:57:55,630
So I think that's interesting. And it's it's also a good reason to like,

487
00:57:56,080 --> 00:58:00,190
just kind of keep tabs on like your favorite foundations because they could like move

488
00:58:00,190 --> 00:58:03,610
in the direction that you want to do or away from the direction that you want to do.

489
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:16,000
The Bill and Melinda Gates funds a lot of international research, and they do awesome work if your interests fall into that.

490
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:26,620
What was I going to say? Oh, Grant is another foundation that they've kind of shifted their mission over the past, like probably decade.

491
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:35,079
And so, you know, again, always good to talk with the people at Michigan who are connected with these foundations.

492
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:43,569
And like their job, like Donna Teague's job in large part is to, like, maintain relationships with these foundations,

493
00:58:43,570 --> 00:58:49,650
to understand, like, what they care about right now is her work on national events.

494
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:57,050
And they. Or this lasted for weeks and months.

495
00:58:57,340 --> 00:59:00,370
Maybe that is what did it. Yeah, I haven't looked at that.

496
00:59:00,730 --> 00:59:04,600
I think they made a statement about that. Nobody's talking about.

497
00:59:05,610 --> 00:59:10,360
Been looking at that music business. Next year get this year.

498
00:59:10,370 --> 00:59:18,040
The next year. The last year they're to. I think other training think it might or it might be.

499
00:59:20,330 --> 00:59:25,550
Yeah, definitely could be forward because they've like they've been there been a lot of like stories to

500
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:32,150
sort of unpacking their shift of priorities and I feel like maybe that is related to focused on.

501
00:59:33,530 --> 00:59:37,520
Getting people into academia. Yes.

502
00:59:37,530 --> 00:59:46,890
Then they can be. Yeah, it's either it could be W.T. Grant or so because that's, that's very youth focused.

503
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:55,110
And they have like they used to have this WTO Grant Scholars program, but I think they still have.

504
00:59:55,110 --> 01:00:02,200
But I think it's shifting or ending. I haven't looked recently at that.

505
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:07,120
But yeah. And then there's another one that's like, I can't remember what I'm trying to think of.

506
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:18,630
Can't pull it up. But yeah, it's in this space.

507
01:00:18,650 --> 01:00:22,270
I would say, like these spaces changes change more frequently in terms of that,

508
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:27,830
like what our focus is or like our stated mission and I each same mission.

509
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:31,580
Their forums change a lot and their details change a lot.

510
01:00:31,580 --> 01:00:35,870
But like the overarching mission stays the same.

511
01:00:35,990 --> 01:00:39,209
So. There's just sort of different ways to think about that.

512
01:00:39,210 --> 01:00:46,390
And so yeah, definitely talking to people and that the U of M Foundation people have Donna who have taken that and said,

513
01:00:46,470 --> 01:00:49,170
hey, let's see what else about foundations.

514
01:00:50,160 --> 01:01:01,320
Okay, let me talk about and I h a little bit to just because again, like it's the behemoth, it's the funds, you know.

515
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:10,500
Most of the science and now certainly a lot of the political science in the nation.

516
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:13,400
And, you know, this is their mission.

517
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:23,010
So it's very you know, it's again, it's aspirational, but it's also not necessarily focused on sustainability in the way that foundations are.

518
01:01:23,310 --> 01:01:26,370
It's also not local in the way that many foundations are.

519
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:37,850
But it's pretty awesome, right? It's like, okay, this is our mission and the way that and I it's, you know, all the style and I guess, I don't know.

520
01:01:38,030 --> 01:01:43,650
Was your building really? It's funny because I whenever I've talked to like program officers,

521
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:51,299
they're like I'm like at my little cube and my phone and like the like and I see HD, which is the child one I like.

522
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:54,570
The ceiling's leaking, like the building's falling down around.

523
01:01:54,570 --> 01:01:59,790
It's like it's not great. It's like old, old buildings that are just sort of in disrepair.

524
01:01:59,790 --> 01:02:04,319
So yeah, I know that was your experience. You're also probably not on this campus.

525
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:09,210
There's a lot of the program officers and the grants. People are like they have all these little kids.

526
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:13,780
It's around our Super Bowl. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

527
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:19,799
Like there's one cafeteria. I can't remember the name of it, but that we would go to for some meetings and stuff.

528
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:23,460
And I was just I was I was sort of thrilled. I was like, Oh, I know the leach.

529
01:02:23,490 --> 01:02:29,030
This is so cool. We like all these little girls. Cafeteria was worse than a normal hospital.

530
01:02:29,670 --> 01:02:34,850
But some of the institutes like the. But.

531
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:40,370
I can't remember. But they have their own separate.

532
01:02:41,770 --> 01:02:46,540
Sunday in the capital city.

533
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:50,580
The art is so funny. Yeah. Yeah. So like, even within any.

534
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:55,320
So that's good. That's a good segue way because there are all these different institutes, right?

535
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:59,410
And they kind of have they have a different explicitly stated mission.

536
01:03:01,270 --> 01:03:09,640
And what's important to know is that each one, you know, they vary along really important dimensions.

537
01:03:11,110 --> 01:03:16,929
So they different institutes and these are just like a sampling of the few of them have used

538
01:03:16,930 --> 01:03:22,120
different grant funding mechanisms or like like will offer funding through different mechanisms.

539
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:29,770
So we'll talk about some different mechanisms, but like for example, not all of them do they have 32 awards.

540
01:03:29,980 --> 01:03:33,309
They just don't do that. Not all of them do that. 30 ones.

541
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:35,290
And like there's a small group that do.

542
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:43,230
So you have to figure out how to make your research question if you're going for an F 31 link to the Mission Map Institute.

543
01:03:43,780 --> 01:03:48,190
Um, one thing to know selected by heart, lung and blood.

544
01:03:49,870 --> 01:03:51,399
Like, what is that? What are they funding?

545
01:03:51,400 --> 01:04:01,780
And they actually fund a lot of an increasing amount around like cardiovascular health and they also fund a lot of sleep research.

546
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:08,500
I think we could all agree and I feel like it the science is like bringing that out more and more like sleep is really foundational,

547
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:10,270
but there's like no NIH of sleep.

548
01:04:11,020 --> 01:04:17,650
And so people who do sleep research have to like sneak it in in different places and they're like sleep friendly people at this institute,

549
01:04:17,740 --> 01:04:21,160
which you kind of get to know as you become a sleep researcher.

550
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:24,940
And they're like, Where did you get that right? Funding and that kind of thing.

551
01:04:25,810 --> 01:04:33,280
So the other things are the different mechanisms of funding, different mission, different kind of goals that are stated on their mission statements.

552
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:38,500
And then the payline, which probably is a term we have to have heard.

553
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:47,520
But what that means is basically the percentile that you're going out to scores like ideal.

554
01:04:47,530 --> 01:04:55,620
It'd be like second percentile. Awesome, could be 10th percentile, could be 23rd percentile out of 100 rate.

555
01:04:57,190 --> 01:05:02,470
All of those are different percentile scores that your grant review results in.

556
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:08,270
So that's sort of like after the scientific review part, you get this percentile score,

557
01:05:08,330 --> 01:05:18,560
numeric score the payline for how like how low they go in the percentile score and varies by institute.

558
01:05:19,250 --> 01:05:28,970
So like some institutes will score will fund that's the payline down to like the 10th percentile some can fund.

559
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:32,870
And again, this also varies a little bit by mechanism and it's not a hard and fast rule,

560
01:05:32,870 --> 01:05:38,390
but like on average, some will fund down to the 12th percentile.

561
01:05:38,420 --> 01:05:41,090
So if your grant is scored at the 12th percentile,

562
01:05:41,090 --> 01:05:49,370
you're like really hoping that you've chosen your institute focused well, because that institute might fund your grant.

563
01:05:49,970 --> 01:05:55,730
If you've chosen an institute that typically only funds down to the eighth percentile and you score at the 12th percentile,

564
01:05:56,270 --> 01:05:59,780
you're like, Oh, so close and yet so far.

565
01:06:01,310 --> 01:06:02,290
So that's important.

566
01:06:02,450 --> 01:06:11,450
It's not like a driving reason to apply to one institute or another, but it is an important reason to maybe cross list your proposal,

567
01:06:12,170 --> 01:06:18,410
because if you do that at the beginning, so say you have something that looks at sleep and obesity,

568
01:06:19,130 --> 01:06:23,330
which is a case digestive and kidney, and they fund obesity research.

569
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:30,079
And I kind of laugh sometimes like a lot of my funding through here and like I'm a developmental psychologist,

570
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:35,670
like digestive and kidney disease, you know. But that's because like a lot of obesity research is there.

571
01:06:36,260 --> 01:06:41,540
So if you're like looking at sleep and obesity in combination in kids and I see excuses,

572
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:48,110
maybe you list all of those institutes and say this application is relevant to all three institutes.

573
01:06:49,140 --> 01:06:57,800
Because they have different paint lines that vary like not that much, but that could make the difference in programs like on the bubble for funding.

574
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:05,220
So that's sort of just another thing to like think about the institute and sometimes that information is stated and sometimes it's not.

575
01:07:06,630 --> 01:07:12,480
So that's like good to talk with people. So NHLPA has recently begun to fund a lot of kids stuff,

576
01:07:13,170 --> 01:07:20,220
and their pay line is slightly better than anticipated because they just don't have as much money as NHLPA.

577
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:28,190
So it's all in a release? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, like you say, like listing all three people interning in one application.

578
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:32,830
Just in general and in each portal. Yes.

579
01:07:33,870 --> 01:07:36,880
Yes. So you write a cover letter. Yes.

580
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:41,530
That in that cover letter. And again, I have learned this the hard way.

581
01:07:42,250 --> 01:07:48,560
If you don't say it upfront that it's relevant to the three and you can have a proposal that

582
01:07:48,570 --> 01:07:54,280
isn't sitting on the bubble and that you're like talking to program officers and they go,

583
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:57,550
Oh, this might fit over at NHLPA.

584
01:07:57,850 --> 01:08:01,150
And you're like, Oh, great. And I like, Did you listed in your cover letter?

585
01:08:01,270 --> 01:08:06,310
But now you go, Oh, I really can't. Like, it's too late, kind of after it's been reviewed.

586
01:08:06,970 --> 01:08:11,050
I'm sure it's possible, but it's not. It's like, frowned upon.

587
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:17,290
You can't really, you know, have something that's on the bubble and, like, shopping around, necessarily two different institutes.

588
01:08:19,890 --> 01:08:24,990
So it's important to kind of like think upfront strategically in that way, like which,

589
01:08:26,010 --> 01:08:30,870
you know, how it's kind of like how broad can I make the appeal of this proposal?

590
01:08:31,890 --> 01:08:40,560
And I think we're lucky to be sitting in public health like we have a lot of broad appeal, and we also don't necessarily fit in one institute.

591
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:50,640
So we kind of already have to be strategic like that. This is the newest Institute for Minority Health and Health.

592
01:08:52,690 --> 01:08:55,780
What the spirit is. It is this. Is the institute now.

593
01:08:57,150 --> 01:09:01,920
Okay. Oh, good. I need to update my iPod, because that's the newest one.

594
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:06,000
And I am in my quest to see. Untrue.

595
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:10,040
Did I? Yeah, it started. Yeah, it mirrors.

596
01:09:11,430 --> 01:09:14,540
I think it's been an institute for that one, but it's been there.

597
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:17,870
Oh, yeah. The whole span of it, I think is on it.

598
01:09:17,890 --> 01:09:22,180
And when I first got there that they're celebrating in the university or something.

599
01:09:24,250 --> 01:09:32,170
Okay. Yeah, right. It is. It's like the baby and I it institute and you know, and it doesn't have, you know, like compared to MCI.

600
01:09:32,740 --> 01:09:37,630
That's like if you can have, if you can apply their their pain line is better because they just have so much money.

601
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:43,090
These guys don't have enough to have as much money. These guys don't have as much money.

602
01:09:43,330 --> 01:09:44,230
These guys don't.

603
01:09:45,100 --> 01:09:54,190
And I am h does have a lot of money, but it also has had this shift a little bit in mission to really be sort of brain biology focused it.

604
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:59,769
So you've got to have some sort of like biological. There's a little bit of a backlash now to that.

605
01:09:59,770 --> 01:10:07,390
But 20 something years ago they were like, it's got to have biology and I am each application is just not responsive.

606
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:09,700
Now they're back then when I'm out a little bit.

607
01:10:09,700 --> 01:10:16,899
But it's, it's something to know because that if you go with a mental health application that doesn't have a kind of biological,

608
01:10:16,900 --> 01:10:21,040
physiological underpinning, they're going to be like, well, it's not in our mission statement.

609
01:10:22,180 --> 01:10:25,089
So it's very there's some reading between the lines.

610
01:10:25,090 --> 01:10:31,960
And that's why it's good that you're again here with people who know a lot about these institutes and sit on the review panels

611
01:10:31,990 --> 01:10:40,150
and you get all that like insider information mean yeah they have a lot of different ideas there with the nature of the,

612
01:10:40,750 --> 01:10:46,440
um, so there's a lot of projects that are funded by the public. So that's another way to work around funding for training.

613
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:51,210
For sure for sure the maps that cross listings.

614
01:10:51,370 --> 01:10:55,959
So if you can have you know, I mean you probably know what to do list a project that's like across six institutes.

615
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:59,800
But yeah, the nature of the, I guess, you know,

616
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:07,990
historically underserved neighborhoods and kids like that three institutes and you see that a lot that things are funded you know, across three.

617
01:11:11,170 --> 01:11:13,270
I don't know if I have something on here,

618
01:11:13,270 --> 01:11:21,970
but there is also something that is called the Office of Behavioral Science Research, and they're like a trans NIH group.

619
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:28,810
I may have put them down here. Let's see.

620
01:11:30,430 --> 01:11:33,990
Okay. So nine priorities. What mechanisms they accept.

621
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:45,309
And so now it's often stated like clinical trial required for a certain certain proposal or no clinical trial accepted.

622
01:11:45,310 --> 01:11:51,760
Like there's sort of some, some guideposts they give you. Um, and these do change often.

623
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:57,430
So this is important to think about. And in those email blasts of on Friday afternoons, they'll be like,

624
01:11:58,390 --> 01:12:04,900
this institute is no longer accepting a bunch of acronyms that are different grant mechanisms.

625
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:09,670
And they're like, Okay, did I need to apply for an AR 21 to this institute?

626
01:12:10,570 --> 01:12:23,740
Oh, shoot. Now I got to retool. So that's why it's good to keep tabs on this stuff in I in idea which is asthma and allergy for whatever reason.

627
01:12:23,740 --> 01:12:26,730
I don't know if you know anybody here, but they,

628
01:12:26,860 --> 01:12:35,860
they have always had a really good informative website for just like unpacking some of the details around an AIDS grant funding.

629
01:12:36,310 --> 01:12:41,920
And I think they just kind of like early on committed to saying like our institute is going to like provide a lot of this info.

630
01:12:42,250 --> 01:12:44,799
Now it's a bit more broad across NIH.

631
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:51,400
You can find like sample grant applications and what do I do once my thing is scored or what do I do at this stage?

632
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:58,750
What happens now and I in in idea has been I oh, that's right.

633
01:12:59,110 --> 01:13:03,740
There you go. See they like to be like invest they invest in things that are useful.

634
01:13:04,590 --> 01:13:08,680
So for fellows to like yes. Are processes and stuff.

635
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:12,130
So I think maybe they're just people in the offices that care a lot about.

636
01:13:13,900 --> 01:13:17,050
I think you were totally right. I think, like I like for now.

637
01:13:17,090 --> 01:13:24,970
Like, I'm just I know in my K Ward era, which is like 2000, I was like looking at this website, looked a lot more concrete,

638
01:13:27,100 --> 01:13:32,950
but they just like for whatever reason, they are like the people who like provide this info in a helpful way.

639
01:13:33,460 --> 01:13:39,010
And so I won't click through all this. It's like too in the weeds for like today, but it's just again,

640
01:13:39,010 --> 01:13:47,770
that's a good one to to know and they do they have an overview of process understanding due dates like what the heck does this mean?

641
01:13:47,770 --> 01:13:52,690
I will click on this one because it's I think this is the one I see.

642
01:13:55,590 --> 01:14:00,360
Getting it ready early. The was. Okay, wait, hold on.

643
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:05,480
Hold on. I want to see if they think the illustrated timeline is better.

644
01:14:08,930 --> 01:14:16,220
Okay. Okay. So here's why I also like this is just it's kind of like an investment in learning about and I

645
01:14:16,370 --> 01:14:23,630
took a little tutorial like how the heck they work because also remember those email blasts.

646
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:27,080
Sometimes they will come out with something that's like perfect, perfect,

647
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:32,989
perfect for your project and you're like well positioned to be like applying for it because it doesn't work in foundation funding.

648
01:14:32,990 --> 01:14:38,960
And you're like, I'm ready for an NIH application. And then they come out and they say, We're going to fund this very research.

649
01:14:39,230 --> 01:14:42,530
Oh my gosh, that's my area of research. I better apply for this.

650
01:14:42,540 --> 01:14:50,580
And so you can this timeline can get shorter, like with many other things in life, like you think you have all this time, you know.

651
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:53,780
So it's good to have things like in the, in the hopper.

652
01:14:54,290 --> 01:15:01,069
But here's the thing. Like you turn in your grants on these sort of their standard deadlines that differ by mechanism.

653
01:15:01,070 --> 01:15:09,500
And so we may have seen people get stressed out around like June and February and October 1st because those are our deadlines.

654
01:15:11,210 --> 01:15:18,260
And then revision deadlines are usually a month after that. So those are due in a few months.

655
01:15:18,260 --> 01:15:22,940
Those grants get reviewed by the peer review process that we'll talk about.

656
01:15:23,390 --> 01:15:31,580
And then and that's like the Science Review. So CSR is a center for scientific review and we'll talk about that kind of stuff.

657
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:36,210
But that's like really the science. Council has the money.

658
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:47,070
And so council is where they make the decision about like which ones like this one's at 9% after the scientific review process, this one's at 9%.

659
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:50,970
This one is like going to be more responsive to our priorities.

660
01:15:50,970 --> 01:15:55,710
We're going to take this one. Council can also say like this one got scared of 2%.

661
01:15:55,740 --> 01:15:59,640
This one got scored at 2%. We should really just fund both of those. And there's like less discussion.

662
01:16:00,420 --> 01:16:03,930
This one got scored at 11%. We usually only fund 9%.

663
01:16:03,930 --> 01:16:08,249
But like, this is such a hot topic and we want to move into this area and we think it's really important to fund

664
01:16:08,250 --> 01:16:15,990
it and so they can work it from the pile of technically below the line funded one funding and fund it.

665
01:16:16,290 --> 01:16:22,920
So council is like a place where there's a little another like area of some flux in the system.

666
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:31,409
Then you kind of get this funding which comes, you know, months after you proposed the thing.

667
01:16:31,410 --> 01:16:37,800
So this is a gateway like an HMO. Patients are like not a walk in the park in terms of just planning and being ready to do it.

668
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:42,180
And then there's also this end of fiscal year funding.

669
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:47,310
There's like a little blip because they have to use up their money by the end of the fiscal year.

670
01:16:47,970 --> 01:16:55,140
And so it's possible, again, that you can have a graph like scores of pay economy and we're going to have to reapply and then it could get funded.

671
01:16:55,650 --> 01:17:05,490
It's like a dream situation. It happens. But that's just sort of the length of the cycle is long.

672
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:13,980
Okay. And it says here it takes between 8 to 20 months after the due date to get an award.

673
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:20,760
So as we're planning and you guys have all been involved in some of this planning like it really is long term,

674
01:17:21,150 --> 01:17:26,070
unlike a foundation which is like our applications are due in November,

675
01:17:26,850 --> 01:17:31,260
we're going to fund you in January and you have to have the project completed by the following December.

676
01:17:32,010 --> 01:17:35,730
So that's a totally different timeline and a totally different project.

677
01:17:39,510 --> 01:17:44,810
Okay. Um, let me just show you.

678
01:17:46,390 --> 01:17:49,430
So here is again some of these centers.

679
01:17:49,450 --> 01:17:53,730
Oh, look, I put I put it right there. My image is up there now.

680
01:17:54,540 --> 01:17:59,790
So I just got to change it again. But there's, like, a lot of these centers, right?

681
01:17:59,790 --> 01:18:05,969
And I just sort of circled some. And I don't even I don't even think I got a lot like I've actually applied to this

682
01:18:05,970 --> 01:18:12,330
dental one before to do like a dental parenting toothbrushing outcomes project.

683
01:18:13,050 --> 01:18:18,090
And so it really like a lot of them are driven by outcome and a lot of those,

684
01:18:18,780 --> 01:18:21,650
you know, we're public health, so we could pick a lot of different outcomes.

685
01:18:21,660 --> 01:18:27,120
And so I think that's the other reason to kind of think about like where conceptual models might go

686
01:18:28,410 --> 01:18:34,470
because you could end up having a conceptual model that could apply to a lot of different outcomes.

687
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:44,520
So like kind of keeping the cancer knowledge like on the docket and like in clinical encounters, you know, in lots of different domains are important.

688
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:53,070
The other thing I would say is that I'm a very focused on my PhD because they do kids and they do prenatal

689
01:18:53,880 --> 01:19:02,490
and then aging is another one that's like it's not disease oriented and then environmental health sciences.

690
01:19:02,670 --> 01:19:05,880
So not disease oriented, but it's more of much more context oriented.

691
01:19:06,540 --> 01:19:11,010
So a lot of colleagues here get funding from them and they actually also,

692
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:16,650
for understandable reasons, they do a lot of really great like community focused work and funding.

693
01:19:17,910 --> 01:19:24,630
There is a children's center here that I was a part of that they thought they were funded through an IHS partnership with the EPA,

694
01:19:25,380 --> 01:19:31,440
which was interesting because that sort of built in like this advocacy part of the center,

695
01:19:32,730 --> 01:19:38,610
which was kind of nice because it was EPA as well as the NIH funding.

696
01:19:43,070 --> 01:19:50,479
Other ones. Oh, then this one. And perhaps that's another one that's not disease specific.

697
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:55,760
But they're, they don't they they sort of they sort of released like this sounds awesome.

698
01:19:55,940 --> 01:20:00,200
And I think they are awesome, but they're very focused in their calls.

699
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:06,440
They're not like as general as we might want them to be, and they're sort of like big trials to see.

700
01:20:07,250 --> 01:20:10,400
You know, tester scalable intervention and that kind of thing.

701
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:15,049
And then there's also this complementary integrative health.

702
01:20:15,050 --> 01:20:21,110
They do like mindfulness type work. So I think that's where some mental health work gets funded.

703
01:20:21,530 --> 01:20:28,400
If it's using complementary alternative strategy for alternative matter methods.

704
01:20:30,230 --> 01:20:37,330
I'm trying to think where else? That's a reasonable representation.

705
01:20:38,140 --> 01:20:46,000
The other thing so this is where the Science Review happens, and an important thing to know is that it's not like tied to an institute.

706
01:20:46,540 --> 01:20:54,369
And so you apply to an institute or like strategic going apply to Fudan and say it's relevant for a few and they all get funneled

707
01:20:54,370 --> 01:21:03,100
then into these different like there's a whole nother funnel down here on these different review panels and the review panels.

708
01:21:04,700 --> 01:21:09,020
Do not align with the institute units.

709
01:21:10,310 --> 01:21:20,750
They're both much more specific. And much more interdisciplinary than the review panel, than the I'm sorry, the institutes themselves.

710
01:21:22,010 --> 01:21:25,809
And so you have a. Link to the review panels.

711
01:21:25,810 --> 01:21:29,560
But actually, let me just I'm just going to pull that up, just following on that point.

712
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:38,679
I know. And I don't know if you guys have heard this, but this is another part where they're also called study sections.

713
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:40,780
That's probably a familiar term to some of us.

714
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:50,550
This is another choice point and something that say saying your cover letter, this it's not really a choice point.

715
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:59,450
We don't have choice about it. But it's an important part to put into your cover letter, which review panel you want the thing to go to.

716
01:22:00,110 --> 01:22:08,690
So you both choose. I want it to be maybe it's relevant to these institutes, and we request that it be reviewed by this panel.

717
01:22:09,410 --> 01:22:13,960
And so what you want to do. Is.

718
01:22:15,690 --> 01:22:22,360
Talk to people first, because if you've just spent quality time on this website, it would not it would cease to be quality time alone.

719
01:22:23,190 --> 01:22:31,680
But there are key ones that review. So I'm actually just going to see a concert.

720
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:38,350
Here we go. P. B, r p. Because I don't even know where that lives.

721
01:22:38,590 --> 01:22:41,710
But. For example, p.

722
01:22:41,770 --> 01:22:45,520
rp0. That's my study section that I was on.

723
01:22:45,620 --> 01:22:49,310
And she's actually she went to Michigan. She's lovely, lovely woman there.

724
01:22:49,350 --> 01:22:53,649
And she's sort of the person who organizes is in charge of this this study section.

725
01:22:53,650 --> 01:23:02,350
It's called Psychosocial Development, Risk and Prevention. This one, just for example, funds behavioral interventions.

726
01:23:02,350 --> 01:23:06,040
They often focus on kids. They have longitudinal data.

727
01:23:06,670 --> 01:23:15,580
They're very methods focused. And what you can find out is who the members are of this study section.

728
01:23:16,090 --> 01:23:20,380
And then you can go look them up and see if their research aligns with what you're doing.

729
01:23:20,390 --> 01:23:28,360
So as you can tell, like there's a lot of deep dives you can do in each of these.

730
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:35,739
And so it's really good to first talk to people before you ever submitted an application about like the entire process,

731
01:23:35,740 --> 01:23:40,690
like which institutes, which panels, which review panels should I go to?

732
01:23:40,690 --> 01:23:48,100
Because each review panel and I did this for many years, like they each have kind of their own culture.

733
01:23:48,640 --> 01:23:52,810
They're all operating under the same review, expectations and instructions,

734
01:23:52,960 --> 01:24:00,100
but they do have their own culture in terms of what they think is important to address in applications.

735
01:24:04,700 --> 01:24:09,140
We can kind of dove more into review, but just to kind of.

736
01:24:10,130 --> 01:24:16,640
This is like the how to find it stuff. So these are called CSR review panels, Center for Scientific Review.

737
01:24:17,300 --> 01:24:22,910
And it's kind of fascinating to just like compare and contrast what different review panels care about.

738
01:24:23,480 --> 01:24:29,300
And you get some of that from this like paragraph description, but then you get a lot more detail from just talking to people.

739
01:24:31,070 --> 01:24:38,750
One thing to know is that there are people on these review panels like all over the map.

740
01:24:39,350 --> 01:24:43,210
So here's another one, MASH. Emotion, stress and health.

741
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:46,720
There's sort of like, here's some nearest neighbors of a review panel.

742
01:24:49,570 --> 01:24:57,220
There are usually people on each review panel. There are going to be some people at some points.

743
01:24:57,340 --> 01:25:01,930
I would imagine from the University of Michigan. And you can kind of you know, again,

744
01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:06,460
like if you're at the level of like what should be what review panel should I put for like that to be reviewed on?

745
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:12,760
You can reach out to those people and ask them kind of about the review process on that panel.

746
01:25:14,230 --> 01:25:21,580
But because you guys share an institution, they can't be present when you're people, when you're seniors from underground.

747
01:25:22,870 --> 01:25:29,699
So that's something to know. But it won't stop your ability to be able to submit to that, correct?

748
01:25:29,700 --> 01:25:43,690
Correct. Yeah. If you if somebody is a co-investigator on your grant, you typically don't want to submit to the review panel that they're on because.

749
01:25:46,070 --> 01:25:54,590
And I think this is true of the people on the review panel. No, that person individually, but now they know them virtually more like.

750
01:25:54,590 --> 01:25:58,909
But and so it's an inherently conflict of interest.

751
01:25:58,910 --> 01:26:04,160
And so what they do then is that they pull out and make a special review, special emphasis panel.

752
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:08,900
It's called you guys have heard of that. And that can be a little bit of a Wild West.

753
01:26:09,710 --> 01:26:13,970
Like it's not clear who they can get to review for those panels. It's not the typical review group.

754
01:26:15,110 --> 01:26:22,270
So in that case, one thing that can be helpful is to like have a few different review panels that are relevant to your projects.

755
01:26:22,310 --> 01:26:34,360
So like for example, I reviewed for this P PD IRP, but that my grants would go to P and it's ridiculous.

756
01:26:34,370 --> 01:26:39,080
P r d p very similar acronyms. K nod.

757
01:26:39,380 --> 01:26:42,440
Here's one that we're much more on.

758
01:26:44,270 --> 01:26:52,640
Obesity topic. So I would like apply to a review panel that wasn't kind of my core people because the topic

759
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:58,580
fits in that review panel and then I could get the regular review panel to review my projects.

760
01:27:01,450 --> 01:27:04,900
Yeah. This is like a level of nuance that like is,

761
01:27:05,110 --> 01:27:12,040
is really I think it's important to know and think about you guys won't be there for a long time, but it's good to know that it's there.

762
01:27:12,040 --> 01:27:17,439
And the key thing is like talking with people because there are and I'm sure we've all heard these kinds of discussions.

763
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:23,769
So this is also like an effort to like here's what it's all about and how this stuff happens.

764
01:27:23,770 --> 01:27:27,010
Because then people will say, like, I don't want it reviewed by this panel.

765
01:27:27,580 --> 01:27:34,059
And it could be because, you know, this panel always wants like biological measures or something.

766
01:27:34,060 --> 01:27:38,500
This panel is very concerned with longitudinal data.

767
01:27:38,860 --> 01:27:43,840
And if you don't have longitudinal data in your study, like it's just going to be kicked out like from the beginning.

768
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:51,430
So those are the kinds of things that are like impossible to know now, you know, talking to talking to people.

769
01:27:55,640 --> 01:28:01,430
Okay. So why not? We can take a little pause and then talk about just kind of more broadly writing stuff.

770
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:10,459
And yeah, there's a lot of a lot of info, hope it's not overwhelming,

771
01:28:10,460 --> 01:28:15,050
but I like to kind of go through all this processing things because it's kind of fascinating.

772
01:28:16,490 --> 01:28:21,260
It's kind of like getting the chance to sit down to start designing the new ones.

773
01:28:21,980 --> 01:28:32,170
Yeah. Yeah, that's true. You know, kind of curious.

774
01:28:32,170 --> 01:28:37,030
And at the time I looked at my other study section, people need a break or.

775
01:28:43,690 --> 01:29:02,370
I'm not certain. See.

776
01:29:39,320 --> 01:31:30,420
Yeah. Kicking me out of here.

777
01:32:42,460 --> 01:32:49,870
The other thing Christie never talked about was just stuff trying to get the half 31 application process like.

778
01:32:50,580 --> 01:32:54,090
To be a thing because this.

779
01:32:55,780 --> 01:32:59,770
It's going to be great if people somehow. And again like.

780
01:33:00,280 --> 01:33:09,160
Depending on the topic and I think I mean maybe hard to wedge into an age but I feel like there's it would be good to try to do so.

781
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:14,810
So we'll see. But. Okay, so I'll.

782
01:33:15,010 --> 01:33:20,260
I'll just spend a little bit more time on this and the age terminology world and then we can talk more generally too.

783
01:33:20,260 --> 01:33:26,770
But this is again like a lot of acronyms we've probably all heard.

784
01:33:28,600 --> 01:33:33,910
I talked a little bit already about the training awards.

785
01:33:34,450 --> 01:33:39,390
Key things to know when you hear that term grant mechanism, it's like scope,

786
01:33:39,940 --> 01:33:47,890
which means like funding and purpose of the purpose of the grant proposal and.

787
01:33:50,230 --> 01:33:56,440
Like I said, the training awards are generally less money because the point is not to do a huge,

788
01:33:56,440 --> 01:34:02,020
amazing fancy research project, but like to invest in the candidate who is getting trained.

789
01:34:02,920 --> 01:34:07,030
And so these training awards, they're not a ton of money.

790
01:34:07,420 --> 01:34:12,069
They're not a lot of indirect cost. But they're super awesome for the applicant.

791
01:34:12,070 --> 01:34:20,800
And I think very strongly like institutions should be going for these awards because it's really important.

792
01:34:21,850 --> 01:34:28,600
And so these sort of changed. But the basics are those efforts that are the individual proposals.

793
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:36,580
So f 31 is dissertation grant, PhD student 32 is postdoctoral and those are individual words with a mentor.

794
01:34:37,630 --> 01:34:41,680
And then the T 30 twos are the institutional awards.

795
01:34:41,680 --> 01:34:46,770
And like Laura talked about being on the T 32, I think Chelsea is now on a T 32.

796
01:34:46,780 --> 01:34:53,710
I think the same as Laura. It's focused on aging and it's funded through an IEA, the Aging Institute.

797
01:34:53,720 --> 01:34:57,520
And so that's like to the University of Michigan that lives in epidemiology.

798
01:34:58,420 --> 01:35:08,350
That's where the pieces are. But then that means they can take fellows, some pre doctoral and some postdoctoral is designed that way,

799
01:35:09,850 --> 01:35:14,440
you know, kind of generally like they don't have to be epidemiology, they don't have to be particular.

800
01:35:15,160 --> 01:35:18,280
Even for Michigan, if they're a postdoc, they can come in from outside.

801
01:35:19,210 --> 01:35:22,240
So that's that institutional that's really nice and flexible.

802
01:35:23,470 --> 01:35:27,430
K Awards, there's a lot of different versions of K Awards,

803
01:35:27,430 --> 01:35:39,219
but basically the upshot of the K Awards is that it's like more training and after you're completed postdoc, you're like, I want to do more.

804
01:35:39,220 --> 01:35:43,900
I'm like, In this NIH world, that's what CARE Awards are for.

805
01:35:44,050 --> 01:35:55,750
And so it's five years of a proponent of a proposal project that includes both heavy training and a research project.

806
01:35:57,910 --> 01:36:05,440
The scope of the research project that you're going to propose for like an F 31 versus K and F 31 is dissertation sized.

807
01:36:05,440 --> 01:36:08,490
It's like for a year and a K is for five years.

808
01:36:08,530 --> 01:36:19,030
So those are just going to actually be different in scope. But AK is still going to be smaller than an AR project, which is a research grant.

809
01:36:20,010 --> 01:36:24,600
Because those just dedicate more money to the project which pays and apps and everything.

810
01:36:24,600 --> 01:36:29,320
Dedicate more money to the person. Yeah.

811
01:36:29,330 --> 01:36:34,030
Yeah. So the f 32 is the post doc independent post.

812
01:36:34,040 --> 01:36:41,130
I'm pretty. And.

813
01:36:42,840 --> 01:36:49,950
Just like the FS and the KS, somewhat less the T because it goes to the institution.

814
01:36:50,460 --> 01:36:58,080
We still have to have a mentor on the team. But like, for example, the injury center or the I don't know what it's from,

815
01:36:58,080 --> 01:37:01,830
it's either through the injury center, the firearms or the Violence Prevention Center.

816
01:37:02,340 --> 01:37:06,630
But they just got a T 32 training grant. So if people.

817
01:37:08,550 --> 01:37:15,120
It could be relevant. I'm not sure. Well, it might be all post-docs together, might be all postdocs.

818
01:37:15,120 --> 01:37:21,390
But anyway, they just got a training grant and there are a number of different investigators at Michigan on that training grant.

819
01:37:22,200 --> 01:37:28,380
And so an applicant for those funds could say, I want to work with these different mentors at Michigan.

820
01:37:29,160 --> 01:37:32,830
And that's how the mentoring match happens for F 31.

821
01:37:32,850 --> 01:37:37,950
So the grant party exists and people apply to it. And the FS and the KS.

822
01:37:39,670 --> 01:37:44,980
The application process involves both the applicant and the mentor, like from the get go.

823
01:37:45,790 --> 01:37:53,920
And so that's a difference. And it basically means that you need to put together the projects with the mentor.

824
01:37:55,660 --> 01:38:03,760
And they need to show like they're invested in the mentors invested and that the mentor has like infrastructure to support you doing this project.

825
01:38:05,420 --> 01:38:14,310
Okay. As you guys sort of obviously like hiring or training more is required, but that sort of thing is the kind of process for them.

826
01:38:15,030 --> 01:38:19,510
Yeah. The flow. Again.

827
01:38:21,400 --> 01:38:27,040
And just in case you heard these terms like K 23 is something that a lot of MDs do,

828
01:38:27,310 --> 01:38:33,610
which is a patient centered K, but that would perhaps also be relevant for for public health.

829
01:38:34,150 --> 01:38:39,219
And then these K 99 are also are called kangaroo awards,

830
01:38:39,220 --> 01:38:44,049
which basically means like you do training and a small research project at the beginning and then

831
01:38:44,050 --> 01:38:48,820
you do a bigger research project at the end and it's like to launch you into full dependance.

832
01:38:50,230 --> 01:38:53,950
So again, these terms come up and that's kind of what they what they are.

833
01:38:55,510 --> 01:39:03,010
The other big set of terms to just talk about are the research grants are they're all they're all for grants.

834
01:39:03,550 --> 01:39:09,310
And so we've all heard of an R one that's like the five year they give you,

835
01:39:09,820 --> 01:39:15,670
ultimately $2.5 million to do projects for five years, which sounds like a lot of money and it is a lot of money.

836
01:39:16,330 --> 01:39:24,820
But like, it's still, you know, you still have to budget what you spend it on very carefully and very precisely.

837
01:39:25,330 --> 01:39:29,590
And it doesn't go as far as one would think because of all those investigator salaries and things that you're talking now.

838
01:39:30,550 --> 01:39:33,970
But if it's an eye age, the indirect cost you don't need to worry about.

839
01:39:33,970 --> 01:39:38,890
So that's good to know. Our threes are a grant that are smaller.

840
01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:43,750
There's two, they're two years, they're like $50,000 a year.

841
01:39:44,470 --> 01:39:50,860
And basically they're for sort of their best suited for like a secondary data analysis project.

842
01:39:50,860 --> 01:40:00,639
So like you have access to an awesome data set, you want to pay your own self, maybe a data analyst or somebody to help you or maybe you.

843
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:02,830
The things that go in a budget for R3, you're like,

844
01:40:03,220 --> 01:40:08,500
I need to pay to get access to my data set or I need to go to a conference or like there's sort of these smaller costs,

845
01:40:08,500 --> 01:40:14,650
but they're not like they could be like, I'm going to interview 30 people and pay those people,

846
01:40:15,430 --> 01:40:19,089
but they can't be like I'm going to interview 200 people in person.

847
01:40:19,090 --> 01:40:24,140
Like maybe you could do a field survey of 200 people, but it's sort of a low, relatively low cost carrier,

848
01:40:24,610 --> 01:40:29,920
which again, those of us who are like used to working just by ourselves on a project,

849
01:40:30,130 --> 01:40:37,180
$50,000 sounds like a lot, but once you get into it, it doesn't end up being the ones that are 20 ones are another common one.

850
01:40:37,180 --> 01:40:44,830
And that is no, that's also a to your proposal to your grants, but that's known as a it's like a high risk, high reward.

851
01:40:44,990 --> 01:40:49,150
Have to be super innovative, breaking new ground.

852
01:40:51,300 --> 01:40:54,959
Type of proposal, and then there's some other other types.

853
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:56,850
We don't need to get into all the details.

854
01:40:56,850 --> 01:41:05,729
But the other thing we have talked about in here that could totally be relevant to you guys is the diversity award or administrative supplements.

855
01:41:05,730 --> 01:41:11,940
And those are if there's an existing usually are a one. Perhaps exclusively our own.

856
01:41:11,940 --> 01:41:20,490
I don't know. But if your advisor has NIH research funding, it's worth talking about, you know, whether he can put together.

857
01:41:20,910 --> 01:41:28,860
Could we put together a diversity supplement, an administrative supplement to this award so that we can do this, like offshoot project?

858
01:41:29,850 --> 01:41:33,430
And you don't have to build in training to that. Okay.

859
01:41:34,460 --> 01:41:40,540
The other kinds of things that we might have heard of are like P20 awards or P30 awards or, you know,

860
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:47,570
won awards like these are these big, big awards where you're like five are ones linked together and make a center.

861
01:41:48,050 --> 01:41:53,420
So people sometimes talk about like center grants and those are these big mega,

862
01:41:54,620 --> 01:42:03,800
mega initiator, mega investigator centers or sort of funded know so bazillions of acronyms.

863
01:42:05,030 --> 01:42:10,370
What's the time like? In terms of the scope of it.

864
01:42:10,520 --> 01:42:13,800
Yeah. And just in terms of like in the peace process.

865
01:42:13,910 --> 01:42:17,120
Yeah. So usually there to fund dissertation.

866
01:42:17,390 --> 01:42:28,970
Okay. So. So you'd apply for it probably like in year four or three or four, like the year before you would be planning to really do dissertation.

867
01:42:29,270 --> 01:42:31,310
Okay. Um, so like,

868
01:42:31,660 --> 01:42:39,320
remember we talked about there's sort of like this gap maybe for like a little bit of a pause post prelim because you're not in courses anymore, like.

869
01:42:40,430 --> 01:42:48,230
But Kristy and I talked about, could that be a great time to be like, okay, let's think about an F 31 while you're all fresh in terms of the prelim.

870
01:42:48,260 --> 01:42:54,499
You know, like it's kind of logical to me like that. That could be something we put into place.

871
01:42:54,500 --> 01:42:59,630
And if people are interested, that would be a good time to be like, All right, I've done coursework.

872
01:43:00,380 --> 01:43:03,320
I'm going to, you know, kind of situated my research.

873
01:43:03,920 --> 01:43:11,290
I know maybe what next steps I want to do and I need Zack's training to do those next steps to me.

874
01:43:11,300 --> 01:43:18,620
Like, that's the sweet spot to apply for an F 31, and then you get an F 31 to kind of fund your dissertation.

875
01:43:19,250 --> 01:43:28,069
You're. So again, it may not work for everybody, but that's kind of a good way to think about it.

876
01:43:28,070 --> 01:43:32,389
And at the scope is for a year and I forget what the budget is.

877
01:43:32,390 --> 01:43:36,770
I don't know if anybody knows that, but I guess you can tell a lot.

878
01:43:38,130 --> 01:43:42,370
Probably based on. Oh, yeah, that's true.

879
01:43:42,380 --> 01:43:51,200
And there is a there is an NIH pay scale that's pretty rigid and it's not super high.

880
01:43:53,060 --> 01:44:02,660
So like postdocs who are on an F 32, I think for my current postdoc, she's on an American Heart Association award.

881
01:44:02,660 --> 01:44:08,540
But it was the same as for F 32. We applied like multiple places, which I call like pan submitting.

882
01:44:08,930 --> 01:44:13,940
So we had this idea with this application. She applied for an F 32, I think two times.

883
01:44:14,450 --> 01:44:19,070
She applied for this American Heart Association award because it's about like eating stress and trauma.

884
01:44:19,970 --> 01:44:27,260
And so we made that 50 age, but the pay rate was pretty low.

885
01:44:27,470 --> 01:44:31,040
I would say it was like 51 or something. It was pretty low.

886
01:44:31,580 --> 01:44:35,900
And so we gave her like a bonus to get equitable with other people.

887
01:44:36,480 --> 01:44:41,740
But in pro stocks. So. Okay, so then your come to the.

888
01:44:42,100 --> 01:44:48,639
Yeah. For my reason. Uh huh, yeah. Yeah. It all comes together so that yeah.

889
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:52,120
Like there's a lot of and that's why I like going to talk to the business administrator.

890
01:44:53,200 --> 01:44:57,999
So that's like, I think if we were like if this program was like,

891
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:03,730
get in the habit of like having people apply for f30 ones, then it just gets easier because you have so many models.

892
01:45:04,360 --> 01:45:13,329
I've talked to people who did it and I think it makes a lot of sense to just have something that you've worked on applying, you know, doing.

893
01:45:13,330 --> 01:45:20,520
And then even if so, this is another thing like this is all very much sticking like that academic medicine kind of space, right?

894
01:45:20,530 --> 01:45:27,370
All of these awards, like you're not going to apply for these awards if you're like at a nonprofit or at the CDC or something like that.

895
01:45:27,820 --> 01:45:34,990
But could it be useful to have like a sort of off the shelf research project idea or evaluation

896
01:45:34,990 --> 01:45:39,670
idea that you've pitched as of 31 and then you could pitch it as a valuation product,

897
01:45:40,120 --> 01:45:45,370
you know, a project at another, you know, location or another position?

898
01:45:45,370 --> 01:45:50,320
I think so. And it's certainly good practice to go through that writing type of writing.

899
01:45:52,510 --> 01:45:59,860
So I think it is helpful to think about and I have had a lot of experience with mentoring and

900
01:45:59,860 --> 01:46:06,190
writing 30 to's for postdocs and Christie has had more experience looking doing F 31 is.

901
01:46:07,030 --> 01:46:10,660
And so yeah, people are keep it on your radars.

902
01:46:12,880 --> 01:46:17,260
Oh, okay. I want to make an interview with 26,000.

903
01:46:19,500 --> 01:46:24,549
Yeah. Right. So. I know.

904
01:46:24,550 --> 01:46:33,070
And age has all those like years. Like, I think for the postdocs anyway, it's like I'm at year zero freed up and then post-docs.

905
01:46:33,340 --> 01:46:36,970
Yeah, a year zero. It's one year. I bring more experience.

906
01:46:37,470 --> 01:46:42,600
Yes. Yes. I think it's just like it's like a little disheartening to me.

907
01:46:42,600 --> 01:46:48,270
Like, really, I'm in school for, like, 17 years, and I bet you're zero.

908
01:46:48,380 --> 01:46:50,030
Like, thanks so much, guys.

909
01:46:52,560 --> 01:47:04,140
So, yeah, lots of lots of different details to like to think about better 1930 just seem like what has it like in terms of there's nothing.

910
01:47:05,220 --> 01:47:08,610
It's there's not like a whole mess of.

911
01:47:08,610 --> 01:47:11,760
Oh, sorry. Thanks, Amy. And.

912
01:47:14,010 --> 01:47:25,620
There's not a cohesive list, but I think within like the U of M system, there'd be two ways that I think we could go about this.

913
01:47:26,100 --> 01:47:27,960
One is to look within.

914
01:47:29,250 --> 01:47:37,200
So there used to be a database called PSAs, which is like awards received or something, and I don't think it's active anymore for some reason.

915
01:47:38,010 --> 01:47:46,420
But the other way we could do it. Which is not that they feel like the school should maintain a more.

916
01:47:55,720 --> 01:48:02,380
So this is a way to do it. Like, look, in this NIH report, I think we looked at this before get 20.

917
01:48:03,510 --> 01:48:09,520
Yeah. So this is a really backwards way of looking around.

918
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:15,550
But like here, for example, like training and genetic science, genomics, science.

919
01:48:16,780 --> 01:48:24,130
Let me see if I can see the one. LC That's Scott's.

920
01:48:29,730 --> 01:48:35,580
But see, it's kind of like, oh, here it is. Here's the facts. What the new 32.

921
01:48:35,580 --> 01:48:45,629
And so that's Patrick Carter, who's in an emergency department injury center and mark his training program in translational research.

922
01:48:45,630 --> 01:48:49,140
And I don't know what that is, but it's funded by the general medical science.

923
01:48:49,140 --> 01:48:59,160
So I think that it's probably like friends who are moving away from like cells like one level up, but I could be wrong.

924
01:48:59,250 --> 01:49:05,870
So this is the kind of thing though that like if you guys know about these ways to search there,

925
01:49:05,910 --> 01:49:14,160
you could, you could oh, here is that health and agent one. So I think that's the one that Laura and Chelsea both ah have gotten funding from.

926
01:49:15,030 --> 01:49:23,099
But like there's a lot and it's the question of like food and what public health has not done,

927
01:49:23,100 --> 01:49:28,380
but I think would be great would be like pull together these things as a resource.

928
01:49:29,790 --> 01:49:35,970
So basic anytime you see basic and you look at the funding, well that's an indicator, but so diabetes.

929
01:49:37,240 --> 01:49:40,510
This probably sells. Yes.

930
01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:46,570
That's. Yeah. Yeah. So. And here's the developmental psych one.

931
01:49:47,350 --> 01:49:53,220
This is a great one. This is the pop studies, one that we have funding from, too.

932
01:49:53,230 --> 01:49:56,240
So it's. Oh, yeah.

933
01:49:56,270 --> 01:50:05,560
Oh, Dave, is that so funny to look up the stuff and then you see your friends and you're like, Oh yeah, so, like, multidisciplinary cardiovascular.

934
01:50:05,570 --> 01:50:09,860
Like, how could that be relevant to public health?

935
01:50:09,860 --> 01:50:15,450
I don't know. So. That's that's one way I would search, which is not very.

936
01:50:17,450 --> 01:50:23,670
But yeah, it's. It's. I think there is a need for that and we have not gotten there yet.

937
01:50:25,380 --> 01:50:30,900
But I'm going to put that on my Christine Christina. We're going to have like a big powwow because we keep talking about this stuff,

938
01:50:30,900 --> 01:50:41,520
but but also 230 to list because there's like speech relevance we can call through like we could do that together and I could come up with a list.

939
01:50:42,630 --> 01:50:51,450
Okay. So more just I think I've mostly talked about this a little bit and this is for your guys info and know charities obviously.

940
01:50:51,450 --> 01:50:58,650
But like all of these acronyms, the key ones are like RFA, RFP, the proposals.

941
01:50:59,130 --> 01:51:07,950
That means that like there is money set aside that needs to be spent and like we're going to fund some proposals for sure from this,

942
01:51:07,950 --> 01:51:10,620
like set aside chunk of money.

943
01:51:12,770 --> 01:51:19,280
What's great about these is that, you know, something will be funded and it's not like they'll review the proposals and be like,

944
01:51:19,670 --> 01:51:23,450
we didn't get anything good, like we're going to move on, which sometimes can happen.

945
01:51:24,780 --> 01:51:28,350
The downside of these is it's often like a really quick turnaround.

946
01:51:29,070 --> 01:51:32,760
And Mark Zimmerman often uses the phrases like it was wired,

947
01:51:33,030 --> 01:51:40,650
like they they knew who they were going to find kind of before they put out this application and they put it out with a quick timeline.

948
01:51:41,370 --> 01:51:48,990
They knew who was going to apply. And then they got applications from those people because these are still a big, huge, you know, in any application.

949
01:51:49,470 --> 01:51:54,870
So they're not that many people who are like ready to apply for it within a month of seeing probation.

950
01:51:54,870 --> 01:51:59,910
So like those are great, but they're like, you have to be ready to like jump.

951
01:52:01,200 --> 01:52:09,030
The way you can get yourself ready to jump in is being familiar with all this other stuff and so parent announcements.

952
01:52:09,300 --> 01:52:12,770
So I said like this just sort of describes this general mechanisms.

953
01:52:12,780 --> 01:52:26,129
This is what they are. You know, NHLPA is funding our own ones means like the NHLPA Institute, Heart, Lung and blood is going to be funding this.

954
01:52:26,130 --> 01:52:31,680
Our one mechanism could be like on anything broadly related to heart, lung and blood, sleep, etc.

955
01:52:33,660 --> 01:52:40,799
This gets a little more focused, too, because this current announcement kind of describes a mechanism program announcement that sort of

956
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:48,390
like we're particularly interested in relations between like violence in the community and sleep.

957
01:52:49,140 --> 01:52:58,170
That's like a broad interest of NHL. So if you have an interest in that area, like maybe then reach out and talk to a program officer to say,

958
01:52:58,170 --> 01:53:03,030
Hey, you guys have a broad interest in my area. How can we, like, make this happen?

959
01:53:04,950 --> 01:53:07,379
And that's when you also want to like kind of look at the details,

960
01:53:07,380 --> 01:53:13,920
because sometimes these will be open for a little while, like a little while, meaning like five years, like a while.

961
01:53:14,520 --> 01:53:23,219
But then they'll eventually close down. So they've had like a, you know, early infant toddler, early childhood obesity for like five years.

962
01:53:23,220 --> 01:53:30,810
And I think it's closing in like a year or so. So those are going to go those are like, you know, more focused.

963
01:53:31,410 --> 01:53:34,170
And then here, this is a relatively new acronym,

964
01:53:34,560 --> 01:53:47,940
but it's called a noticed of special interest are no see these usually come about through kind of an H workshops that are basically opportunities

965
01:53:47,940 --> 01:53:54,720
to invite like scientists investigators to NIH to say come and talk about your research and tell us what you think is cutting edge.

966
01:53:55,770 --> 01:54:02,790
And then from those workshops they'll often develop a no see that's like who people think that

967
01:54:02,790 --> 01:54:09,390
like cardiovascular health in kids under five is cutting edge and important for these reasons,

968
01:54:09,900 --> 01:54:13,229
we developed a little like summary of why why it's important,

969
01:54:13,230 --> 01:54:19,200
and then we're putting out a no see notice of special interest for applications in that specific area.

970
01:54:20,400 --> 01:54:26,190
And that really isn't helpful because it kind of directs you to like what NIH is excited about.

971
01:54:27,580 --> 01:54:32,530
And so you still go through all the other things we're talking about, like what? Institute and cover letters and all that stuff.

972
01:54:32,530 --> 01:54:42,760
Reviews, panels. One thing to know is that even though you might be like really exactly responsive to the no see the review panel

973
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:47,920
that your application goes to and more specifically like the three people who actually read your application,

974
01:54:49,060 --> 01:54:58,000
they might not know that they're see. So you can sometimes in your application say like than people often do and like their specific names page there

975
01:54:58,030 --> 01:55:06,730
this is really responsive to the know see the special interest of NHLPA cardiovascular health in kids under five.

976
01:55:08,170 --> 01:55:11,850
That's why it's a really significant application.

977
01:55:12,400 --> 01:55:17,440
It's going to have big impact and you then can like look at the notes and be like, why did they say what happened in that?

978
01:55:18,670 --> 01:55:22,510
So that's like a strategy for thinking like the significance of look, when your kids.

979
01:55:23,910 --> 01:55:28,930
Those are also like if you can find one that's kind of in your interest area, it's probably helpful that, you know,

980
01:55:28,980 --> 01:55:33,750
could be helpful to just like me through it because then you kind of get a sense of

981
01:55:33,750 --> 01:55:39,360
like they'll sometimes say applications of this type are considered responsive,

982
01:55:39,750 --> 01:55:49,050
but like a clinical trial, testing a drug to reduce cardiovascular outcomes in five year olds is not responsive.

983
01:55:49,060 --> 01:55:50,280
That's not what we're talking about.

984
01:55:50,280 --> 01:55:55,409
We're talking about like social contexts, how it gets under the skin to create cardiovascular health in five year olds.

985
01:55:55,410 --> 01:55:59,700
So like that will sort of guide you to say like, Ooh, yeah, this is what I do,

986
01:55:59,700 --> 01:56:06,720
I should apply for this because you kind of have to have a Z as in Focus took so much work to do it,

987
01:56:07,140 --> 01:56:09,510
even though I know I started out saying it was kind of fun.

988
01:56:10,830 --> 01:56:18,780
So that's the other kind of like background stuff around and I think in talking with people, but if you get signed up on those email blasts,

989
01:56:18,780 --> 01:56:23,370
you can kind of just have it like it's like that like wash over you a little and

990
01:56:23,370 --> 01:56:27,900
get a sense of how to think about this stuff because it is that is a strategy.

991
01:56:32,130 --> 01:56:44,280
So I wanted to then sort of shift gears a little to talk more about like like how to, you know, how to implement this great writing stuff.

992
01:56:44,290 --> 01:56:54,270
So. You know, that whole kind of beginning part is like about background of where your grant proposal ultimately goes.

993
01:56:54,820 --> 01:56:58,809
And then if we get time either now or another time, we can talk about how it's reviewed,

994
01:56:58,810 --> 01:57:06,850
which I do think it's also important stuff like unmask unmasking peer review as an effort at NIH for yourself.

995
01:57:07,900 --> 01:57:13,060
So but this is more general, like this is for any kind of, you know, proposal, right?

996
01:57:13,990 --> 01:57:19,870
And so, you know, we've talked about our big, huge, broad conceptual models that we're like musing on.

997
01:57:20,590 --> 01:57:23,950
And the idea of a grant proposal around that is like, okay,

998
01:57:23,950 --> 01:57:31,750
I want to carve out a specific question from the big broad area I'm interested in and like figure out how to test it.

999
01:57:32,950 --> 01:57:37,030
And you have to understand, like, how crowded is the field?

1000
01:57:37,600 --> 01:57:42,610
What's been done before? Where's the gap? Why is this important?

1001
01:57:42,880 --> 01:57:50,130
Why do we care? Is it something that is innovative, which again, depending on the funding agency you're going for,

1002
01:57:50,140 --> 01:57:57,040
everyone wants innovation, but sometimes that's a really specific part of the proposal.

1003
01:57:58,690 --> 01:58:04,740
And then is it a fundable idea? Like, what's the sort of scope of the idea that I'm trying to carve out?

1004
01:58:04,750 --> 01:58:09,880
And so I think that there's like so much back and forth between all of those activities.

1005
01:58:11,110 --> 01:58:19,000
But I think that that's that's kind of like the critical place to, to to know and then here for training awards specifically.

1006
01:58:19,010 --> 01:58:29,050
So like for an F 31, it would be okay, what do I personally as a candidate need to be able to answer this question?

1007
01:58:29,770 --> 01:58:31,630
And I think for training awards.

1008
01:58:33,180 --> 01:58:41,280
It's a balance between saying like, I'm super amazing and I just need this additional piece to like complete the picture.

1009
01:58:41,850 --> 01:58:46,440
And that's the kind of way you think about training awards because you don't want to say like,

1010
01:58:46,710 --> 01:58:51,630
I need training and everything because then they're like, Well, you're not ready to do the project, you know?

1011
01:58:52,560 --> 01:58:56,880
But sort of being very specific about these trainings and why it will help with the research.

1012
01:58:58,110 --> 01:59:04,980
And then this is this question, which is again that like they're all sort of mutually informing, but what will I do and how much will it cost?

1013
01:59:05,170 --> 01:59:09,450
Right. So how is what's the scope? And that takes practice.

1014
01:59:10,440 --> 01:59:14,930
And again, talking with other people who are doing this work. But like, how much does it cost?

1015
01:59:14,940 --> 01:59:20,459
Like you don't want to you don't want to pad your budget and inflates the costs.

1016
01:59:20,460 --> 01:59:27,780
But it also is really true that you don't want to under estimate the cost because many times,

1017
01:59:27,780 --> 01:59:33,180
like again in the NIH review sections, you'll get a junior investigator who's like,

1018
01:59:33,540 --> 01:59:37,530
I can do this on a shoestring and like they can,

1019
01:59:38,160 --> 01:59:46,320
but it would be better if like you could pay your participants and you could like do things at at cost as opposed to like under cost.

1020
01:59:46,920 --> 01:59:50,190
And so I think a lot of times people get in trouble in this place because you

1021
01:59:50,190 --> 01:59:54,750
want to do it all and it's not like scoped appropriately for like the mechanism.

1022
01:59:56,080 --> 02:00:01,630
So that's important. And then here, like, who can give me advice and critical feedback in that collaborator piece?

1023
02:00:01,660 --> 02:00:05,950
So if you're talking about paying people salaries, that will run through your budget quickly,

1024
02:00:06,460 --> 02:00:10,780
if you're talking about just like your mentor or a training team.

1025
02:00:11,500 --> 02:00:15,700
Those are usually budget neutral, if not time neutral.

1026
02:00:15,700 --> 02:00:21,190
They're budget neutral. And again, so these these all kind of feed together.

1027
02:00:23,390 --> 02:00:34,160
And I think the other thing is that you definitely have to get current with the like the kind of pointed questions that you're answering.

1028
02:00:34,160 --> 02:00:41,030
And so you'd really need to like know the review broadly to be oriented like all your constructs.

1029
02:00:41,600 --> 02:00:49,550
But then you really have to know, like, okay, what's the cutting edge that people are doing right now so that I might be on that edge?

1030
02:00:50,270 --> 02:00:53,299
And this is that sponsored advanced database, that size database,

1031
02:00:53,300 --> 02:00:58,580
so that I feel like the last time I was checking in there, it was not working for me.

1032
02:00:58,580 --> 02:01:01,670
But that's another thing we've had in the past.

1033
02:01:02,900 --> 02:01:11,840
And I like this too, because it's like it's possible to be too niche in one's question, at least at this point, right?

1034
02:01:12,110 --> 02:01:15,950
And just like have zero results, be like, Oh, no, nobody's ever done any of this because you're like,

1035
02:01:17,120 --> 02:01:20,270
you know, focusing in on something that's, like, pertinent to like for people.

1036
02:01:21,380 --> 02:01:25,540
So then you got to like brought back a little bit of that.

1037
02:01:26,150 --> 02:01:33,950
And again, it's the same idea of like, am I in the ballpark of what people are looking at in this question,

1038
02:01:33,950 --> 02:01:37,339
like in my review of like kind of getting to the point where like, oh wow,

1039
02:01:37,340 --> 02:01:42,440
it seems like a lot of people are kind of like convening around this construct and there's

1040
02:01:42,440 --> 02:01:47,299
interest in this area and there's recent papers published here and then like how what,

1041
02:01:47,300 --> 02:01:50,300
what could I possibly do in my contribution?

1042
02:01:50,570 --> 02:01:56,210
And so again, like, you don't want to be like so narrow, but you want to be in the ballpark.

1043
02:01:57,440 --> 02:02:08,569
Look. And so here, like this contact the program officer is like a critical step and this is usually for bigger awards,

1044
02:02:08,570 --> 02:02:11,600
but definitely true for any training award, too.

1045
02:02:12,260 --> 02:02:18,710
So this is like, you know, the program officer in the in the context of like a summer writing award is like your advisor,

1046
02:02:20,030 --> 02:02:28,489
but specifically the program officer is going to be employed by the granting institution.

1047
02:02:28,490 --> 02:02:37,970
So like an age or a foundation, their job is really to get people funded by their program.

1048
02:02:38,600 --> 02:02:46,219
And I think that is so critical to remember because we've probably all and I don't know quite well from your experience,

1049
02:02:46,220 --> 02:02:55,040
but we've probably all heard this, you know, people talking like being a little intimidated by contacting program officers.

1050
02:02:55,040 --> 02:03:05,089
I think that's really, really super common to be intimidated. But if you have a program officer who's like really taking their job seriously of this,

1051
02:03:05,090 --> 02:03:09,770
like I want to cultivate relationships with prospective awesome applicants.

1052
02:03:10,310 --> 02:03:14,450
They want to be contacted and they want to talk to people and they want to hear from you.

1053
02:03:15,740 --> 02:03:22,430
What's intimidating maybe is that they don't want to hear like a total half baked idea because their time is really valuable and overscheduled.

1054
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:26,180
So you want to have some like talking points.

1055
02:03:27,140 --> 02:03:32,900
You could have a draft of a specific games page, which we'll talk about when you talk to the program officer.

1056
02:03:32,900 --> 02:03:41,000
But it's a really important step. But I feel like and I feel like people do a disservice to themselves if they don't take that step.

1057
02:03:41,270 --> 02:03:45,710
And I understand why it's stressful, but it's really important to to think about it.

1058
02:03:46,040 --> 02:03:52,369
And I put that phone up there because usually they want to talk on the phone and not only via email,

1059
02:03:52,370 --> 02:04:02,960
like an email is important and you're nodding that I say, is ideal because you can also either go to a central place or it'll go to the.

1060
02:04:03,610 --> 02:04:06,520
It was communicate the remote internally.

1061
02:04:06,590 --> 02:04:15,070
And I think that if it doesn't come in, I think, you know, it goes to a separate stock market here and a lot of those he to me.

1062
02:04:15,740 --> 02:04:22,219
So I love it. If you do call online and you get somebody who doesn't know what you're talking

1063
02:04:22,220 --> 02:04:26,120
about because I wasn't in the program office of the grant office sometimes.

1064
02:04:26,590 --> 02:04:34,380
Name and. Just keep going back until you get somebody that doesn't know a lawyer.

1065
02:04:34,480 --> 02:04:41,620
If you get, like, a short answer or something, it might be a day where they have like 60 meetings on their books and they're running around.

1066
02:04:42,070 --> 02:04:48,960
And if you call at a better time, they will answer until they start to know the names of the people that keep going.

1067
02:04:51,030 --> 02:04:54,050
The squeaky wheel. Got one time.

1068
02:04:54,060 --> 02:05:00,100
I have time to sit. So you really want to talk? Via the short density I service.

1069
02:05:00,110 --> 02:05:05,960
It's not I don't think there's anybody in the offices who I don't love these days and talking about it.

1070
02:05:05,990 --> 02:05:07,550
Yeah. It's just.

1071
02:05:11,620 --> 02:05:19,630
I think that's that's like such a good free information and that's totally consistent with when I've talked with program officers to be like,

1072
02:05:20,170 --> 02:05:22,780
what's help, like what, how should we engage with you?

1073
02:05:22,780 --> 02:05:27,159
We don't want to be a burden on your time, but like we know you have all this important information.

1074
02:05:27,160 --> 02:05:33,160
They're like, Oh, no, no, no. We want, we want to engage. It's just like, like you said, sometimes these systems are clunky.

1075
02:05:33,160 --> 02:05:40,120
And so having that that connection early on, figuring out like if any of these like brand announcements,

1076
02:05:40,120 --> 02:05:47,590
they're going to have contact people at the bottom. And so you can email those, contact people to see if you can set up a time to talk by phone.

1077
02:05:48,910 --> 02:05:54,790
The other thing to know is that like they can help you anticipate pitfalls like, oh yeah,

1078
02:05:54,790 --> 02:05:59,499
you got to put in some biological measures that would be much more responsive to whatever I am.

1079
02:05:59,500 --> 02:06:03,370
Each has priorities and you're like, Oh, okay, thank you.

1080
02:06:03,370 --> 02:06:06,280
I'm going to go back to my drawing board and put in some of those measures.

1081
02:06:07,570 --> 02:06:11,520
But they also can't tell you like, ooh, I think your question should be like this.

1082
02:06:11,530 --> 02:06:14,499
Like, I can't give you the guidance, but they can help you kind of like that.

1083
02:06:14,500 --> 02:06:19,090
Read between the lines is really kind of what they heard and can often do.

1084
02:06:20,260 --> 02:06:22,810
And then again, like you have to give them something to work with.

1085
02:06:23,380 --> 02:06:28,120
And I think this is kind of a good way to think about like structuring a conversation.

1086
02:06:28,120 --> 02:06:35,230
Like you're sort of saying like, is this responsive to or does it fit with program priorities and kind of look up what those priorities are.

1087
02:06:36,460 --> 02:06:41,980
You know, obviously, like do a phone call when you have access to like a, you know, a computer to be Googling.

1088
02:06:41,980 --> 02:06:44,980
At the same time, I think they're mentioning stuff, you know, what it is.

1089
02:06:46,390 --> 02:06:49,209
And then this idea of providing a specific aims page,

1090
02:06:49,210 --> 02:06:56,620
we can talk about the details of that and then some background on like where you are certainly in your training,

1091
02:06:56,770 --> 02:07:01,209
if you're talking them about an F 31, they'll be aware that that's where you are.

1092
02:07:01,210 --> 02:07:03,460
But like any other grant, they don't necessarily know.

1093
02:07:05,380 --> 02:07:11,650
Another good thing is that like you can get to know these guys and they can like follow you across your career again.

1094
02:07:11,650 --> 02:07:18,940
Like if you're kind of this like biomedical world because they've been like, Oh, I've known you since you were my f 31 awardee, you know?

1095
02:07:18,940 --> 02:07:23,649
And I think there is like there's like sort of, you know, and I think, you know, everybody's personality varies.

1096
02:07:23,650 --> 02:07:27,280
But like, I've had some people who are just like, oh, what else do you think?

1097
02:07:27,280 --> 02:07:29,950
You know, like, are you going to play down like, oh, come on, come on.

1098
02:07:30,340 --> 02:07:34,389
You know, and some people are just like a little more cut and dried because they're probably busier, you know?

1099
02:07:34,390 --> 02:07:42,640
But I think there is like a feeling of like they're kind of grooming in a good way, grooming like your research career or your science.

1100
02:07:42,640 --> 02:07:46,720
And so I think people get invested and so it's really good to do.

1101
02:07:49,060 --> 02:07:56,590
And so this is kind of again, like just another way to think about these big picture ideas, like how do we care?

1102
02:07:56,590 --> 02:08:05,590
Why do we care and why is it maybe fundable? And that's also where a program officer can kind of help you with scope a little bit.

1103
02:08:06,850 --> 02:08:14,259
Is this, you know what, our 21 sides idea is innovative enough for our 21 training?

1104
02:08:14,260 --> 02:08:17,500
Where specific? What skills do I need to acquire and why?

1105
02:08:18,130 --> 02:08:27,550
This is a less program officer and more like your advisor and your mentoring team and like the resources that a place like U of M would have.

1106
02:08:27,670 --> 02:08:30,670
Like, oh, they offer a great data analysis,

1107
02:08:30,670 --> 02:08:39,310
data visualization class that is really good to put on a training award and how you will do it and why it's important for you to do it.

1108
02:08:39,340 --> 02:08:46,569
It's not just like I think it's cool, but like it will allow me to translate this work to a broader audience,

1109
02:08:46,570 --> 02:08:55,600
which is important because they're at greater risk for this health problem that I'm researching this.

1110
02:08:55,600 --> 02:09:01,629
Like how much will it cost and scope? I've talked about that and then this like critical advice and critical feedback.

1111
02:09:01,630 --> 02:09:09,880
So it's kind of this the same types of topics, but it's like the advice and critical feedback part is both for the projects that

1112
02:09:09,880 --> 02:09:16,960
you're proposing and also for the writing of the writing about the project and then.

1113
02:09:18,790 --> 02:09:26,830
This question we've talked a little bit about, but like, do I need collaborators like either to train me or to help me implement the project?

1114
02:09:27,940 --> 02:09:33,670
And are they like mentors? Co-Investigators at my institution?

1115
02:09:34,300 --> 02:09:39,700
Are they consultants at another institution? Like, I want to get trained in this intervention.

1116
02:09:39,700 --> 02:09:44,140
So I'm going to ask the person who invented the intervention to be a consultant on my proposal.

1117
02:09:47,020 --> 02:09:51,860
So all of that. Because is important again and mutually informing stuff.

1118
02:09:54,140 --> 02:10:00,740
Okay. We talked a bit of already about budget, but these are kind of the categories to think about for budget.

1119
02:10:00,740 --> 02:10:06,979
And again, an F 31, it's mostly new as a training and like maybe some research costs.

1120
02:10:06,980 --> 02:10:13,350
Like maybe you could have, you know, you could pay 5%, you know,

1121
02:10:13,430 --> 02:10:17,840
a lab manager that is someone else's lab manager that can like help you with your project.

1122
02:10:18,740 --> 02:10:25,010
That would be a good cost to put in. Probably can't afford too much more than that unless they're really brand new.

1123
02:10:27,280 --> 02:10:31,860
Cost to get the work. So all that is like person time. Plus benefits.

1124
02:10:32,040 --> 02:10:37,559
38% of people salaried in addition to get your work done.

1125
02:10:37,560 --> 02:10:43,860
So like is it a good time to like invest in some cool software that you'll use computers,

1126
02:10:44,310 --> 02:10:49,740
you know, other sort of specialized things like people who study sleep like Stephanie Cook.

1127
02:10:49,740 --> 02:10:55,590
I'm not sure if people had been to her talk, but she and I had a conversation about look at graphs like below two watches,

1128
02:10:55,710 --> 02:10:57,360
you can measure sleep and physical activity.

1129
02:10:57,360 --> 02:11:05,370
And so like on a training award, it may be a good time to say like, I'm not only going to get trained in how to measure sleep in physical activity,

1130
02:11:05,370 --> 02:11:09,780
I'm also going to purchase ten devices so I can do more pilot study.

1131
02:11:09,930 --> 02:11:18,360
And so then you can like that in the cost participant costs, paying participants, any sort of travel is also a good category.

1132
02:11:18,480 --> 02:11:19,800
So again,

1133
02:11:19,920 --> 02:11:27,329
those of us who've like worked on budgets kind of know that categories but then like applying them to like them or homework that we might do,

1134
02:11:27,330 --> 02:11:31,320
which just feels like, like kind of like what Laura was saying. She's like, it's really cheap.

1135
02:11:31,440 --> 02:11:35,360
It's kind of just me. But there are some costs to sort of think through.

1136
02:11:36,990 --> 02:11:44,910
Okay, these are sort of details, but that's why it's helpful to sit and just talk with the budget person because like for example,

1137
02:11:44,910 --> 02:11:50,490
and postage is sort of becoming less and less relevant, but not for all populations.

1138
02:11:51,360 --> 02:11:54,989
But you like have to charge it in a certain part of the grant.

1139
02:11:54,990 --> 02:11:58,590
And so like there's just sort of certain things that are restricted items.

1140
02:11:59,760 --> 02:12:01,890
You do need a justification for all item.

1141
02:12:01,900 --> 02:12:10,500
So you can't just say, well, there's some, there's some there's something called a modular budget where you don't need to have a justification.

1142
02:12:10,500 --> 02:12:15,930
I don't know if anybody has work, but those but that's like a module of like $25,000.

1143
02:12:16,980 --> 02:12:23,790
If the budget is modular under a certain amount, you don't need to provide like a detailed justification.

1144
02:12:24,900 --> 02:12:29,550
But it's better to have a detailed justification so that you can scope out her budget.

1145
02:12:31,560 --> 02:12:37,860
The detail justification is like we're going to, you know, recruit 600 people and pay them each $10.

1146
02:12:37,860 --> 02:12:42,750
We're going to survey them three times. And so then you do that math and that's one of your participant costs.

1147
02:12:43,470 --> 02:12:47,850
We're going to be driving back and forth to Detroit and run this many community groups.

1148
02:12:47,850 --> 02:12:53,000
And the mileage is this and this is how many times are anticipated to do it pretty here that that that that

1149
02:12:53,020 --> 02:12:57,929
that and I'm sure you guys have dealt with this kind of stuff like we're going to provide them lunch.

1150
02:12:57,930 --> 02:13:04,440
Well you can't always do that. So like there's these weird categories that, you know, you have to have a little bit of flexibility there.

1151
02:13:05,670 --> 02:13:11,820
Okay. And I talked about the direct, indirect cost, but those that indirect plus direct is total costs.

1152
02:13:12,960 --> 02:13:17,990
Okay, so moving. It took a break and I was working.

1153
02:13:17,990 --> 02:13:23,450
I was like I said this, but like he always says proposal because it's not a grant until it's funded.

1154
02:13:24,230 --> 02:13:29,120
So we talked about grant writing. We hope to get a grant, but we're really writing proposals.

1155
02:13:30,740 --> 02:13:33,530
Okay. And so I think this is a key point.

1156
02:13:35,290 --> 02:13:44,350
We are all like into our jargon and our like nuance and our deep, you know, what our particular gap we're going to fill is going to be?

1157
02:13:44,710 --> 02:13:48,880
But we have to be able to put it in like layperson language, especially public health.

1158
02:13:49,990 --> 02:14:01,000
And so this idea of plain language, having a summary, having like a, you know, for different for different audiences,

1159
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:12,430
basically plain language summary, but also having visuals and a conceptual model for some massively simplified version of it is a key visual.

1160
02:14:12,430 --> 02:14:16,959
And often this can be even helpful to put on a specific James Page,

1161
02:14:16,960 --> 02:14:26,470
which is like that front page that states basically the whole significance approach and impact of your project.

1162
02:14:26,740 --> 02:14:31,719
The, the key themes, the key questions, often a conceptual model,

1163
02:14:31,720 --> 02:14:36,340
especially if you're in an area that is kind of new or you're bringing in new concepts,

1164
02:14:36,730 --> 02:14:45,160
it could be helpful to pop it up onto the specifications page, or at least early on in a significant section of the proposal, because that really.

1165
02:14:46,380 --> 02:14:51,180
Helps people. Helps reviewers to be like, where are we situated?

1166
02:14:52,100 --> 02:14:57,419
In this space. The other key visual that you might have.

1167
02:14:57,420 --> 02:15:02,580
I mean, there's also like tables of measures which, again, if any of us have been involved in grant writing,

1168
02:15:03,180 --> 02:15:06,660
you've maybe helped to put together tables of museums and that kind of thing.

1169
02:15:07,080 --> 02:15:15,000
So that's another whole visual component. But there may also be like statistical models that you put in the proposal to say like this is the

1170
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:20,730
statistical model that we anticipate more like a structural equation model or something like that.

1171
02:15:22,230 --> 02:15:26,160
So there's sort of like the conceptual visualization and then also the statistical.

1172
02:15:27,930 --> 02:15:34,620
Which is good to know. And then this idea of just short, sweet.

1173
02:15:35,770 --> 02:15:42,630
We're. Just so you have it there.

1174
02:15:43,840 --> 02:15:51,799
One thing. I will say is that if you have time and again, when I was first starting out in rap writing,

1175
02:15:51,800 --> 02:15:57,350
I would obsess about like having headings and having them be really clear and like going.

1176
02:15:57,380 --> 02:16:01,820
Like, I would not submit anything without perfectly done headings.

1177
02:16:01,820 --> 02:16:07,309
And then kind of as I've gotten more rushed frankly, and doing more things, I have not been able to do that.

1178
02:16:07,310 --> 02:16:14,030
But I miss being able to do that because it's really, you know, you can reference like in section two,

1179
02:16:14,030 --> 02:16:22,370
CB A to C one that we references and it's just it makes the grant reviewer's job so much easier because then they can be like,

1180
02:16:22,370 --> 02:16:31,400
oh yes, they really thought about how all these parts connect and they're consistent across the proposal, which is like a huge issue.

1181
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:38,750
And we can see why like inconsistency and changing of terms happens because like different people are

1182
02:16:38,750 --> 02:16:43,880
working on it or you think you're done and then change this and it has ramifications for over here.

1183
02:16:45,240 --> 02:16:51,980
So, you know, it's all about that, like allowing yourself enough time that like this is where you want to get to.

1184
02:16:54,300 --> 02:16:57,990
In your in your writing. Okay.

1185
02:16:58,170 --> 02:17:00,270
And headings I think always are fantastic.

1186
02:17:01,800 --> 02:17:07,950
Here's another like specific again, just like just kind of for your reference, but this is something that can drive reviewers,

1187
02:17:09,180 --> 02:17:17,850
not all reviewers, but a lot of reviewers comment on this and it feels like sometimes we need to write like this and I'm sure we all do this.

1188
02:17:17,850 --> 02:17:23,610
I do this all the time and then I try to go back and like hack it to make it simpler, simpler, but still accurate.

1189
02:17:23,700 --> 02:17:30,630
Right. And so sometimes this kind of wording can just be, like, difficult to get through if you're reading, you know,

1190
02:17:30,760 --> 02:17:37,210
12 applications and you've got like two days or like, oh, here's another one that's talking about facilitate, facilitate.

1191
02:17:38,100 --> 02:17:46,259
You know, and I think that this is the probably the most critical point is this if you must use specialized terms,

1192
02:17:46,260 --> 02:17:52,140
which we all do, someone define them upfront and use them consistently.

1193
02:17:53,610 --> 02:18:01,889
And. Those are two points, but. Those are really important and those are something I think the other the other

1194
02:18:01,890 --> 02:18:05,880
thing to note and I should add this but is also used them in the same order.

1195
02:18:07,140 --> 02:18:14,430
So like if you have a conceptual model and you're talking about like migrant status, stress and depression.

1196
02:18:15,570 --> 02:18:22,350
And then you start talking about depression. And then my dad says and stress like you want to kind of keep it in the same order if you possibly care.

1197
02:18:22,530 --> 02:18:25,769
I'm like, Of course there's going to be times when you're talking about this specific thing,

1198
02:18:25,770 --> 02:18:33,509
but whenever there's like a list of measures or you're talking about in your significant section,

1199
02:18:33,510 --> 02:18:39,690
all your different constructs, try to in your analyzes, try to do it in the same order.

1200
02:18:39,840 --> 02:18:46,620
That's like kind of follows your your veins so that the reviewer can just get that in their head.

1201
02:18:46,980 --> 02:18:50,660
These are the three things they're looking at. And this is oh, yeah, those are those three things.

1202
02:18:50,670 --> 02:19:00,680
That's how they're measuring them. So just like. Keeping those very tight kind of checks on yourself are important.

1203
02:19:01,880 --> 02:19:05,090
Reading that with an end to that order piece, because I think that is really important.

1204
02:19:06,350 --> 02:19:13,340
That's also true in papers. Definitely. And again, like hard to do because we're all in the weeds and we're like, but it's all interconnected.

1205
02:19:13,730 --> 02:19:18,950
But then it's like the grammar and things like such a precise. Like it's like a pitch, you know?

1206
02:19:21,740 --> 02:19:27,580
Okay, so. I think he's done a lot of things on like specific themes and stuff in that I'm just going to I'll

1207
02:19:27,580 --> 02:19:32,150
just kind of go through and I'll share these with you guys so you don't need to jot all down.

1208
02:19:32,170 --> 02:19:38,500
They're all sort of instructions, but just to kind of click through the different pages and sections.

1209
02:19:39,310 --> 02:19:45,120
So there's the specific James Page, which is really that overview, the whole thing ending with there.

1210
02:19:45,170 --> 02:19:50,220
Therefore, the current study will test the following evidence and illustrations.

1211
02:19:51,570 --> 02:19:53,790
And there's a lot of good examples of this around.

1212
02:19:54,420 --> 02:20:00,540
One thing to know about research strategy is that for our 20 ones are three smaller ones, it's only six pages.

1213
02:20:00,540 --> 02:20:06,480
And then for real ones it's 12 pages, single spaced or 11 point font.

1214
02:20:06,690 --> 02:20:09,990
Usually it's good. Just do it in that font.

1215
02:20:11,460 --> 02:20:15,690
These are all the sections of it. These are the things we need to address in those sections.

1216
02:20:15,690 --> 02:20:29,790
So like again and I age very specific guidelines and I focus on I age because of all those IDC reasons but also like their format is very clear.

1217
02:20:29,790 --> 02:20:34,950
And if you know how to if you train yourself in this format, you can convert to other formats, I think.

1218
02:20:35,430 --> 02:20:41,250
I think foundation grants are different because they're much more like tell a story to engage the reader.

1219
02:20:41,490 --> 02:20:49,260
A lot of the time, especially if you're talking about like small grants for like a nonprofit agency, tell a story that reflects their mission.

1220
02:20:50,470 --> 02:20:57,700
And age is very different from that. But I think it's easier to start here and then like gather additional skills.

1221
02:20:59,110 --> 02:21:01,630
Okay, so that's like overview.

1222
02:21:02,350 --> 02:21:10,239
This is just to note and I think again, if we've helped out with grant applications like because probably you're familiar with these other sections,

1223
02:21:10,240 --> 02:21:12,340
maybe even more than some of the science sometimes,

1224
02:21:12,340 --> 02:21:24,549
but like the science is 50% of the grant application and all these other sections are so important and there's many of them and they change format.

1225
02:21:24,550 --> 02:21:29,650
And that's again why like writing a grant at the University of Michigan in the

1226
02:21:29,650 --> 02:21:33,670
School of Public Health is very it's a very good place to do your first one.

1227
02:21:35,890 --> 02:21:41,890
Okay. So all of those things are awesome, just to note, not included in that science page limit.

1228
02:21:42,460 --> 02:21:44,390
So Grant that's my grant application.

1229
02:21:44,420 --> 02:21:54,130
When they used to be printed, they were like really big, but they're like, you know, 200 pages sometimes even though the science is 12 pages.

1230
02:21:54,580 --> 02:21:58,380
So as a reviewer, you're responsible for looking at all of these too.

1231
02:21:58,390 --> 02:22:02,860
So a lot of strategy baked into this for that.

1232
02:22:03,400 --> 02:22:08,170
So in aims, really it's this page and trying to do it all.

1233
02:22:09,190 --> 02:22:14,380
And your key thing is that your science is innovative, significant and will have an impact.

1234
02:22:16,250 --> 02:22:24,860
These are some things to avoid that overpromising that like I'm just going to explore.

1235
02:22:25,280 --> 02:22:32,510
Nobody would do that. But sometimes it's hard to sort of specify what hypotheses you might have about your question.

1236
02:22:33,980 --> 02:22:37,050
You want to reference what your actual outcomes are going to be.

1237
02:22:37,070 --> 02:22:41,420
This actually comes up, I think, a lot that people are like, I'm going to look at,

1238
02:22:41,420 --> 02:22:47,330
you know, the impact of, you know, mental health on, you know, physical health.

1239
02:22:48,470 --> 02:22:54,530
And that's kind of where the aim is. And and then it's not till the measures where the person gets to like what the outcomes are and you're like,

1240
02:22:54,620 --> 02:23:01,190
oh, well, usually a reviewer will look at the methods first, actually, just to sort of be able to kick it out.

1241
02:23:01,730 --> 02:23:07,940
But this isn't this is interesting because I feel like this is something that should be straightforward,

1242
02:23:08,990 --> 02:23:15,350
but it's like you have to aim it at the right level within your aims. Like you have to say, these are the kinds of things I mean by physical health.

1243
02:23:16,790 --> 02:23:21,829
It's usually too much to say. This is exactly how I'm going to measure it, because that will come in the methods.

1244
02:23:21,830 --> 02:23:27,740
But like you have to get to the level of like I'm going to be looking at, you know.

1245
02:23:28,790 --> 02:23:33,880
Suicidality or, you know, something more specific than like mental health.

1246
02:23:34,280 --> 02:23:36,770
So it's that can be a little bit tricky, Scott.

1247
02:23:37,610 --> 02:23:46,099
This is the other big thing about names that people might have heard is that if you have specific games that you're looking at,

1248
02:23:46,100 --> 02:23:56,690
you have like three games you want to try to avoid the situation where like in one has to come out right in order for 82 to be testable.

1249
02:23:58,520 --> 02:24:05,540
And that's a situation we often get ourselves in, like look for some to see if there is an association between like parent and child depression.

1250
02:24:06,410 --> 02:24:12,680
And then I'm going to see what modifies that associations if it's stronger for girls or stronger for boys.

1251
02:24:13,430 --> 02:24:22,130
And that's a totally reasonable set of questions. But, you know, if there's no association at the beginning, then does it dump the rest of your aims?

1252
02:24:23,270 --> 02:24:27,800
And that's really hard to to kind of think about sometimes.

1253
02:24:28,130 --> 02:24:34,190
And so people spend a lot of time crafting games that are not.

1254
02:24:36,110 --> 02:24:44,220
As little interdependent as they can be. And so I think we going to talk more about that.

1255
02:24:45,120 --> 02:24:48,480
But that's a that's a tricky one. I think sometimes.

1256
02:24:51,200 --> 02:25:04,909
In another example. Sometimes what you can do to avoid that is you can look at like what, two different outcomes in your aims.

1257
02:25:04,910 --> 02:25:10,400
You can say, I'm interested to see whether, you know, anxiety is associated with.

1258
02:25:12,580 --> 02:25:18,100
You know, sleep. And I'm looking to see where anything is associated with for like sleep duration and

1259
02:25:18,100 --> 02:25:23,290
sleep timing or some some way to chunk up your outcome so that it's not interdependent.

1260
02:25:24,280 --> 02:25:29,440
One way to do that. But that's just sort of something to to be alerted to.

1261
02:25:30,010 --> 02:25:33,760
Sometimes it's not always possible, but you want to be thoughtful about it.

1262
02:25:35,020 --> 02:25:38,770
Okay. More specific names, I think I've talked about most of these.

1263
02:25:39,250 --> 02:25:42,340
Summarize the hypotheses and expected outcomes.

1264
02:25:42,460 --> 02:25:47,500
Sometimes that's more doable than others. Usually two or three aims.

1265
02:25:47,860 --> 02:25:51,850
Here's your objectives that you're going to do, the aims that you're going to do in your aims.

1266
02:25:52,690 --> 02:25:57,940
And then that impact statement is usually at the end. Reminder, this is going to have a big impact.

1267
02:26:00,820 --> 02:26:06,370
Okay. So these are kind of the three other big parts of the science.

1268
02:26:07,700 --> 02:26:11,930
Significance is like, why we care? Why is this important?

1269
02:26:14,110 --> 02:26:18,690
You know, will, will, will will science be changed?

1270
02:26:18,700 --> 02:26:22,150
And that's important because that's the reviewer's.

1271
02:26:24,550 --> 02:26:32,730
Like Mission or call is. Describe how the science in this field would be changed.

1272
02:26:34,860 --> 02:26:44,130
Or, you know, impact made on this field. If this proposal were to take place, if this project were to take place, what would we learn?

1273
02:26:44,140 --> 02:26:50,460
What would the impact on the field be? And like the criterion for like scoring perfect one,

1274
02:26:50,580 --> 02:26:57,370
which is like a perfect score on significance is like textbooks will be rewritten if this finding turns out.

1275
02:26:57,390 --> 02:27:03,900
And so like, it's like a really, really high bar, but just sort of it's not like that's how reviewers are.

1276
02:27:04,880 --> 02:27:11,770
Instructed to review significance. And so, again, these are this is why I look in horror.

1277
02:27:11,780 --> 02:27:18,800
One is something that people don't do until, you know, more and more advanced in their career is I got to build up to it.

1278
02:27:20,660 --> 02:27:25,910
But even in a F 31, like, okay, the set, the scope, the stakes are not quite as high.

1279
02:27:25,910 --> 02:27:32,570
But like this is why it's really important I get this training because I'm going to become a researcher next thing,

1280
02:27:33,770 --> 02:27:39,319
okay, innovation is like my spin on this.

1281
02:27:39,320 --> 02:27:45,710
It's going to be new and different because it also the trick here, of course, is to be linked to what's been done before.

1282
02:27:46,700 --> 02:27:54,560
So innovation is one of those things like they're listed kind of equally, but it's really about significance and innovation is.

1283
02:27:56,080 --> 02:28:01,890
Important and kind of like sexy, but it's not as important as significance.

1284
02:28:04,210 --> 02:28:12,280
And then really, this is the place approach that is most easy to critique because we all look and we're going to talk more about peer review,

1285
02:28:12,280 --> 02:28:18,610
but like it's easy to critique approach because like you can always choose to do something one way or another way.

1286
02:28:20,020 --> 02:28:29,770
And I think what's important to keep in mind is that you let the reviewer in on why you decided to do it the way you decided to do it,

1287
02:28:30,730 --> 02:28:33,370
because there's always a different way or another way.

1288
02:28:33,370 --> 02:28:41,839
And you can be like, yes, we read there's actually a section where you have alternative strategies right about that, but basically an approach.

1289
02:28:41,840 --> 02:28:46,150
You're like, Here are all the good things we're doing in our approach.

1290
02:28:47,980 --> 02:28:51,220
And then an alternative strategies is.

1291
02:28:52,200 --> 02:28:58,739
Of course, we could have done it these other ways, but we chose to do it this way because there were existing measures.

1292
02:28:58,740 --> 02:29:07,410
So we didn't, like recreate or measure from scratch or, you know, we decided we are we could have recruited 300 kids and seen them one time,

1293
02:29:07,410 --> 02:29:15,660
but we decided to recruit 150 kids and see them twice for the same budget because it was important to get longitudinal data or something,

1294
02:29:15,660 --> 02:29:20,490
even though we might shrink our power, you know, we gain that data point.

1295
02:29:20,940 --> 02:29:24,750
And so that's those kinds of decisions that you make.

1296
02:29:25,830 --> 02:29:31,210
You just want to justify that. Okay.

1297
02:29:31,220 --> 02:29:39,920
And again, like approach because everybody like knows how to measure things and everybody has like a preference for how to like, measure things.

1298
02:29:39,940 --> 02:29:46,899
I mean, the other thing started that's really important for a coach is if you're recruiting people, who are they?

1299
02:29:46,900 --> 02:29:51,850
How are you sampling them or are they representative? Like all of that is an approach.

1300
02:29:51,850 --> 02:29:55,480
So there's a lot to talk about as an approach.

1301
02:29:58,150 --> 02:30:02,709
So again, don't even worry about this, but like this is kind of what I'm talking about.

1302
02:30:02,710 --> 02:30:12,170
So I get a good research design. You have to provide a microscopic level of detail so that they know what you're doing yet say in a succinct way.

1303
02:30:12,300 --> 02:30:19,990
Right. So that's a balance. And that approach is where you really go over in terms of words and also a place where you can hack stuff out.

1304
02:30:21,280 --> 02:30:29,050
That alternative strategies idea is like, yes, we know it will be difficult to recruit the number of kids we've talked about,

1305
02:30:29,500 --> 02:30:35,470
but we have all these community partners and we will engage them in helping to recruit and these are the specific ways we're going to do it.

1306
02:30:35,480 --> 02:30:40,480
So really just showing like you can still have things that are going to be hard,

1307
02:30:40,720 --> 02:30:45,160
but you have to just kind of show that you've anticipated that we've thought carefully about it.

1308
02:30:47,830 --> 02:30:52,930
Okay, let me move. I think.

1309
02:30:53,320 --> 02:30:57,240
Well, look, Mr. Trump said these things. I've said this already.

1310
02:30:57,250 --> 02:31:00,610
Try not to do everything. I do want to give enough detail.

1311
02:31:01,210 --> 02:31:06,910
Be realistic in your scope and timeline. And then this thing is at this point, it's up.

1312
02:31:08,930 --> 02:31:17,389
I feel like it comes up a lot in approach because people are like proposing a new method they haven't done or they're proposing something.

1313
02:31:17,390 --> 02:31:23,750
And it seems like this person doesn't entirely know what they're talking about and that's coming through in the writing.

1314
02:31:24,650 --> 02:31:31,580
So that's one again, like consulting with people that like, how do I who do I need on my team is a big question.

1315
02:31:31,580 --> 02:31:38,780
So like, for example, if you're doing qualitative studies and it's one particular part of your proposal or you can get training in it,

1316
02:31:39,440 --> 02:31:47,659
you want to have somebody who knows qualitative research like on your proposal listed as a consultant,

1317
02:31:47,660 --> 02:31:53,120
you know, somehow represented that you have expertize. So I think that's like a place where people can get caught up.

1318
02:31:53,810 --> 02:31:58,160
And and then I've mentioned this again, don't underestimate the resources.

1319
02:31:58,610 --> 02:32:04,930
And then this is kind of basic, but. Power analysis and recruiting details.

1320
02:32:06,040 --> 02:32:14,320
And some of that's an approach, but some of it is in a different section in NIH grants that's like all dedicated to those topics.

1321
02:32:17,750 --> 02:32:23,920
Okay. So those are just sort of like good like anchor points think and.

1322
02:32:28,940 --> 02:32:36,200
This. It's kind of similar to what I've said. Sorry to be a little repetitive, but I'm trying to be redundant.

1323
02:32:38,270 --> 02:32:44,520
But this idea of just. Writing succinctly, having a conceptual model,

1324
02:32:44,520 --> 02:32:51,720
and that you can number those sections and have headings and use tables where you can to like provide that visual.

1325
02:32:52,860 --> 02:33:01,560
And then knowing with reviewers there again this is like in an H space, but it's true for any reviewers of anything,

1326
02:33:02,130 --> 02:33:05,610
they're going to be tired and overburdened and reviewing lots of things at the same time.

1327
02:33:05,610 --> 02:33:08,760
And they need to be told multiple times what you're doing.

1328
02:33:10,800 --> 02:33:20,040
So make sure to build that into the proposal, that kind of key points, because you don't want them to be like presenting it to the frame of reviewers,

1329
02:33:20,040 --> 02:33:26,120
which is what happens and have them be like, Yeah, I don't think they had any qualitative person on there.

1330
02:33:26,850 --> 02:33:30,240
Hopefully reviewers too will be like, Oh no, no, no, no, they had a consultant.

1331
02:33:30,360 --> 02:33:36,510
But like that happens. And so you just want to like hammer home the key points.

1332
02:33:39,210 --> 02:33:48,160
Okay, let's get something. We talk a little bit about review and people say, okay.

1333
02:33:51,330 --> 02:33:54,600
Because I think it's I think it's helpful to just sort of like go through these all of these.

1334
02:33:54,600 --> 02:34:00,670
So it's talked of like how do you find how do you like locate where grants are, like what you want to do with them as background issues.

1335
02:34:01,330 --> 02:34:06,150
Bit about writing those have those slides. And then so this is like the review process.

1336
02:34:06,190 --> 02:34:17,160
Again, sticking with that, I h we've talked a little bit about this program officer role CSA review panels, which is what I pulled up earlier.

1337
02:34:17,580 --> 02:34:27,900
The SRO is the scientific review officer and so and Riley who popped up on our my CSR review panel,

1338
02:34:28,350 --> 02:34:37,410
she's the person who basically gets all the applications to that panel, which are like usually at least 100, often more.

1339
02:34:38,070 --> 02:34:46,860
She then like briefly scans them by like title abstract and says, okay, here are my 45 reviewers on this panel.

1340
02:34:47,490 --> 02:34:54,780
This, this looks like it should go to this person. And so she assigns where the proposals go.

1341
02:34:55,410 --> 02:35:03,480
So like, for example, I'd be sitting at this panel and I'm like stress, childhood obesity intervention, you know, emotion regulation.

1342
02:35:03,810 --> 02:35:07,170
And so I'd get, you know, proposals in all those spaces.

1343
02:35:09,110 --> 02:35:17,030
Now I'm may not I may get a bit that often happens to me and study such when I get a proposal like this does not seem like my area of expertize,

1344
02:35:17,030 --> 02:35:21,230
but I'm like and then I sometimes reach out to and be like, Did you mean to assign this to me?

1345
02:35:21,560 --> 02:35:24,650
To be like, Yeah, you're the closest that we have.

1346
02:35:25,040 --> 02:35:28,730
And so there were not that many people in this review panel that did anything health related.

1347
02:35:29,120 --> 02:35:32,839
So I got everything health related and I'm like, I'm also a psychologist.

1348
02:35:32,840 --> 02:35:35,840
So like mostly all psychologists now they're bringing in more MDs.

1349
02:35:35,840 --> 02:35:41,629
But anyway, it's very interesting because like you're always trying to provide like this guideposts

1350
02:35:41,630 --> 02:35:46,730
I guess for like where you want to match your proposal to like who's going to review it.

1351
02:35:47,300 --> 02:35:56,600
And so that's where like will that clear writing accurate title putting key keywords that will like direct your proposal is also important.

1352
02:35:58,460 --> 02:36:05,090
So each proposal was reviewed we talked about this cover letter may not always happen.

1353
02:36:05,240 --> 02:36:11,030
You want to go to a particular review panel. You can also say, please don't send it to this review panel.

1354
02:36:11,030 --> 02:36:15,160
If there's some reason to do that, I wouldn't say to do that all the time.

1355
02:36:16,580 --> 02:36:22,220
This is like a long video. I'm not going to play it, but literally this is what these rooms are like.

1356
02:36:23,180 --> 02:36:30,709
They are crowded and hot and like dim an internal window, like no windows, you know,

1357
02:36:30,710 --> 02:36:38,510
they're just and it's from like 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. with a few little breaks and

1358
02:36:38,510 --> 02:36:41,870
like a little bit of lunch that you usually bring back to the table to minutes.

1359
02:36:42,820 --> 02:36:46,390
And it's like a long slog. And it's for two and a half days.

1360
02:36:47,860 --> 02:36:59,530
And that those are the conditions under which that, you know, like are like soul sucking efforts of grant writing review occurs.

1361
02:37:00,190 --> 02:37:05,590
And so I just present that to be like that is why I get to make.

1362
02:37:05,680 --> 02:37:07,180
Yes, that's your audience, right?

1363
02:37:07,180 --> 02:37:16,479
And that's why we need to be like signpost heading clear language, consistent order of turns and terminology like you as a reviewer.

1364
02:37:16,480 --> 02:37:21,130
One Hopefully we'll talk about all the different reviewers, but like hopefully you've spent.

1365
02:37:22,880 --> 02:37:30,830
An hour with the proposal. Like when I first heard it, I'd spend like a half a day with a proposal on which I was.

1366
02:37:30,830 --> 02:37:38,360
Reviewer one And I got to the point where I could do it if it was close to my area of research and I knew like what the main things were.

1367
02:37:38,360 --> 02:37:44,900
If it was further from my area of research and I was sure Here you're one who's the person who has to like present the proposal,

1368
02:37:45,350 --> 02:37:49,040
then I'd spend more time, but like, there's just, you know, limited time.

1369
02:37:49,880 --> 02:38:00,820
Um, so what happens is basically your proposal is sent to three people on the panel.

1370
02:38:00,830 --> 02:38:08,930
Prefer one, two and three. Reviewer One is the person who like is responsible for kind of summarizing the project,

1371
02:38:09,080 --> 02:38:14,090
presenting it like this is a proposal about childhood obesity and stress.

1372
02:38:14,690 --> 02:38:20,690
It comes from a, you know, a young investor, a new investigator who's done a lot of research in this area.

1373
02:38:21,170 --> 02:38:26,030
And they're proposing to look at the relationship between obesity and stress.

1374
02:38:26,030 --> 02:38:29,570
And if they do a sleep intervention, will that reduce the sort of association?

1375
02:38:30,440 --> 02:38:38,749
But like you're trying to sort of give a big picture and then you sort of say they specifically they proposed to look at 500 kids,

1376
02:38:38,750 --> 02:38:44,989
whether this intervention will, you know, make a difference, followed by they're going to measure their outcomes using after graphs.

1377
02:38:44,990 --> 02:38:48,740
They're going to recruit from this population that are that it seems feasible.

1378
02:38:48,890 --> 02:38:57,110
It seems important that. So you have about 5 minutes to give that summary for a given proposal.

1379
02:38:58,220 --> 02:39:01,640
What's helpful is to like write out your summary on key points.

1380
02:39:03,960 --> 02:39:08,900
And then what happens is that reviewer to who's also read the proposal and you also

1381
02:39:08,900 --> 02:39:16,670
score the proposal to talk about as reviewer two chimes in with like an Anna who I like,

1382
02:39:16,670 --> 02:39:21,050
I love her. She's just like, we've got, like energy for this kind of thing.

1383
02:39:21,470 --> 02:39:27,770
She'll be like, Okay, review or two, anything to add, you know, because you have 2 minutes to add your part and then.

1384
02:39:27,770 --> 02:39:32,120
Reviewer three Anything to add to what reviewers want them to have already said.

1385
02:39:32,120 --> 02:39:43,159
And then you have discussion. So for our one, which is the five year 215 million sorry, $2.5 million project an hour,

1386
02:39:43,160 --> 02:39:50,750
one is supposed to get 15 minutes total of like four presentation, two like final scoring.

1387
02:39:51,740 --> 02:39:56,059
And that is not for some proposals that are like either knock you out of the park.

1388
02:39:56,060 --> 02:40:03,590
Amazing. Or if people have seen it before, it's like a very familiar, big known investigators.

1389
02:40:03,590 --> 02:40:07,130
They have like a three generation study and they're like really awesome.

1390
02:40:07,790 --> 02:40:11,060
Maybe that's less discussion, but 15 minutes is not long.

1391
02:40:12,510 --> 02:40:16,140
It's like sort of shocking us to realize like, oh, my gosh, something like that.

1392
02:40:17,220 --> 02:40:25,650
And so it's really a lot rests on kind of reviewer one and reviewer one's enthusiasm for the proposal.

1393
02:40:26,160 --> 02:40:32,489
And so kind of doing your homework again to like make reviewer one love your proposal, whoever.

1394
02:40:32,490 --> 02:40:43,049
Reviewer one may be. You know, so like you can review those panels and see who's on those panels and then you get someone you know.

1395
02:40:43,050 --> 02:40:48,510
And so I think that's like I often talk about like spoon feeding your points to the reviewers

1396
02:40:48,510 --> 02:40:53,430
and that's totally why because the reviewer is supposed to go over these key things.

1397
02:40:53,430 --> 02:40:58,890
They don't have a lot of time. Hopefully they've taken it and they take it seriously and are organized.

1398
02:40:59,580 --> 02:41:03,690
But you know, things happen and it doesn't always go smoothly.

1399
02:41:05,250 --> 02:41:08,250
And so you really want to make Reviewer one enthusiastic.

1400
02:41:11,830 --> 02:41:16,600
The scoring, so try that scoring. So like these are basically the.

1401
02:41:18,340 --> 02:41:29,410
The things that people consider for scoring and you actually get a score from your reviewers one, two and three in each of these areas.

1402
02:41:29,680 --> 02:41:35,230
So I don't know if everybody seen like they used to call them pink sheets because they were physically pink.

1403
02:41:36,160 --> 02:41:39,700
But they're now that it's like the grant reviews summaries.

1404
02:41:40,270 --> 02:41:45,760
So this these are the areas in which we're evaluated on our grant proposals from an age.

1405
02:41:45,850 --> 02:41:49,540
But that's broadly true across lots of different types of proposals.

1406
02:41:50,470 --> 02:41:54,130
And you get a score from 1 to 9. One is the best.

1407
02:41:54,400 --> 02:41:57,760
Perfect. Nine is the worst. And I will say it also,

1408
02:41:57,760 --> 02:42:02,799
I don't know if I've said this in that physical in person review session now

1409
02:42:02,800 --> 02:42:09,700
virtually they actually throw out the the bottom 50% are actually not discussed.

1410
02:42:09,850 --> 02:42:13,570
So if you've ever got a score that's not discussed, which happens to everybody,

1411
02:42:14,290 --> 02:42:20,110
it just meant that your proposal didn't score in the top 50% for that round of review.

1412
02:42:20,680 --> 02:42:25,450
And so it's just bumped back with the reviews from reviewers one, two and three written.

1413
02:42:28,380 --> 02:42:37,530
So you kind of emerge getting scored in each of these areas and then everybody has to give an overall impact for everybody on the panel.

1414
02:42:38,040 --> 02:42:44,920
So in that review, in-person process review were one, two and three also say their scores when they start.

1415
02:42:45,240 --> 02:42:51,080
I scored this one. And people also often say like, here are the strengths, here are the weaknesses.

1416
02:42:51,090 --> 02:42:57,780
You know, for one, you're not going to have weaknesses to report. But then, you know, you can also have discrepancies.

1417
02:42:57,960 --> 02:43:02,340
So sometimes, like I scored a two, I scored in a four, I scored in a five.

1418
02:43:02,790 --> 02:43:06,900
And then like those initial scores will sometimes go around and people are like, ooh,

1419
02:43:06,930 --> 02:43:10,020
like there's like sort of a reaction because like, that's a kind of a broad range.

1420
02:43:11,310 --> 02:43:14,640
A proposal that scored a five is probably not going to get funded.

1421
02:43:15,540 --> 02:43:20,760
A proposal that scores like two on average or above might get funded.

1422
02:43:22,050 --> 02:43:27,030
And so people will sort of say, like, the reason for my five were that I saw weaknesses.

1423
02:43:27,300 --> 02:43:30,870
They're addressable. They need to do it. And I've got to address them.

1424
02:43:31,380 --> 02:43:34,920
And and I will often say, like, you can't rewrite the proposal.

1425
02:43:35,280 --> 02:43:42,000
You can't wish that in three weren't there because in three is kind of a bad aim.

1426
02:43:42,540 --> 02:43:49,470
You have to evaluate it as written. So those are like things that reviewers might hear as they're getting a review of the proposal.

1427
02:43:51,300 --> 02:43:54,570
Here's the sort of descriptors for that scoring system.

1428
02:43:54,840 --> 02:43:57,150
And so, again, that corresponds to 1 to 9.

1429
02:43:58,950 --> 02:44:07,290
And basically what your proposal will and will emerge from that review session with is a score between 1 to 9,

1430
02:44:07,290 --> 02:44:09,320
and it's an average of everybody's score.

1431
02:44:09,330 --> 02:44:17,110
So after reviewers one, two and three have the presentation opportunity discussion for discussion and then all 40,

1432
02:44:17,130 --> 02:44:21,690
however many people on the panel vote, they score the application also.

1433
02:44:22,290 --> 02:44:28,920
So if someone's more convinced by reviewer one and reviewer one gave it a three, but reviewer three gave it a one,

1434
02:44:30,870 --> 02:44:35,550
and reviewer one made a stronger case than the reviewer than the proposal scored more like a three.

1435
02:44:36,030 --> 02:44:39,750
Excellent. But it's probably not fundable as opposed to a one.

1436
02:44:42,420 --> 02:44:47,010
Okay. And you might hear things like 23, a proposal that scored 23.

1437
02:44:47,460 --> 02:44:52,060
And that just means like, you know, to either 23rd percentile or a score.

1438
02:44:54,290 --> 02:44:57,320
So 15 is like 1.5.

1439
02:44:59,410 --> 02:45:09,360
Okay. I think, uh, that's one of the things we've talked about some of the stuff up front,

1440
02:45:10,500 --> 02:45:15,980
but I don't think I have a little video thing in there, but I think we've talked about most of that.

1441
02:45:17,890 --> 02:45:21,380
And I think this is kind of that same scene.

1442
02:45:21,460 --> 02:45:25,840
This is probably the time line from like the older version of the website that we just looked at.

1443
02:45:25,840 --> 02:45:29,140
That's hopefully I'm certain is typing. You sold like that.

1444
02:45:32,830 --> 02:45:37,719
And I think these are just like, again, those have a bunch of links here.

1445
02:45:37,720 --> 02:45:45,490
But like I think it's this is why I like to talk about the review process and kind of like just now that there are these like videos that sort of

1446
02:45:45,490 --> 02:45:54,430
have like a mock review and stuff just so you can get an idea of how this happens and have it and understand like it is a really rigorous process,

1447
02:45:54,880 --> 02:45:59,560
but there's also a lot of like human factors in the system that can kind of shift it around.

1448
02:45:59,560 --> 02:46:07,360
So you want to work towards spoon feeding those reviewers and like write with the review criteria in mind as it fits your idea.

1449
02:46:07,630 --> 02:46:12,930
And that's true like regardless of NIH. So like NIH, you don't need to worry about sustainability.

1450
02:46:13,000 --> 02:46:16,690
Like you could never mention it. Maybe not for some institutes, but for a lot.

1451
02:46:16,690 --> 02:46:23,610
You just doesn't. Nonissue for like Health Endowment Foundation, it's going to be a dealbreaker if you don't have that in there.

1452
02:46:23,620 --> 02:46:29,949
So that's that bigger picture. Yeah.

1453
02:46:29,950 --> 02:46:35,769
There's an I that's like a video where they kind of talk about the process and

1454
02:46:35,770 --> 02:46:40,509
then this is just sort of more and more links that are that are those key things.

1455
02:46:40,510 --> 02:46:46,960
And these are really the that's the review, the science, and that's the like grant application details and nuts and bolts.

1456
02:46:48,620 --> 02:46:52,670
So yes, I think that's all the slides I have.

1457
02:46:53,900 --> 02:46:57,780
Oh, you know what? I knew I wanted to do this at the beginning. Sorry.

1458
02:46:58,110 --> 02:47:05,399
Does anybody have. I know it's like tons of information, but I feel like it's a good overview of stuff.

1459
02:47:05,400 --> 02:47:16,530
But what I did also want to do, if we can quickly figure out what date people want to do presentation and what and do we want to.

1460
02:47:18,060 --> 02:47:22,650
What often happens is. We could.

1461
02:47:24,480 --> 02:47:30,810
Push the date around a little bit for those peer reviews and your best friends, peer scientists.

1462
02:47:35,000 --> 02:47:40,239
But. Like right now.

1463
02:47:40,240 --> 02:47:45,190
I have a final feature to do on this night.

1464
02:47:47,810 --> 02:47:51,370
And I totally understand that the prosecution.

1465
02:47:52,510 --> 02:47:57,150
Wiener you guys have dealt with like. Another deadline.

1466
02:47:59,150 --> 02:48:05,000
And we can also be concerned. The ninth is a primate.

1467
02:48:08,930 --> 02:48:13,100
No. Sorry, it's December. December. So I'm starting up a bath.

1468
02:48:13,100 --> 02:48:17,650
I'm starting in the bath with this. Yes.

1469
02:48:17,660 --> 02:48:24,740
Yes. Because the draft like I think that's where I put it here on November nine, about a month before.

1470
02:48:26,930 --> 02:48:30,550
December nine. Then I wanted to give you a little.

1471
02:48:30,760 --> 02:48:35,290
Flexibility between applicants. Justin Bieber, double down or something.

1472
02:48:38,510 --> 02:48:43,890
Yeah. From Pittsburgh for.

1473
02:48:53,710 --> 02:49:09,900
Of December, and I don't think. So that's something that's hard, not think of everybody.

1474
02:49:12,400 --> 02:49:23,250
Right? Right. Because I think. Course. We can also incompleteness.

1475
02:49:25,470 --> 02:49:31,770
For writing. One note, we're not going to declassify enough Facebook.

1476
02:49:33,400 --> 02:49:41,450
Just so you know. So we could stick with the sketch all of the time.

1477
02:49:42,050 --> 02:49:47,940
And then have you guys do this peer review of the elephant to each other?

1478
02:50:04,590 --> 02:50:25,350
I could put it. There's a date.

1479
02:50:52,290 --> 02:51:00,640
Yes, sir. Do you?

1480
02:51:02,000 --> 02:51:06,480
Yeah. I should be. It.

1481
02:51:07,840 --> 02:51:23,590
I think that to. For the district in the first referendum period.

1482
02:51:25,780 --> 02:51:33,770
Yeah. That one. Yeah. Because I right I think, I think the way that one feels reasonable for the final of the to turn on the television.

1483
02:51:33,900 --> 02:51:39,350
Okay. So if you guys kinds of questions and because I never seen you.

1484
02:51:39,970 --> 02:51:45,000
She's the first African American woman at the time of making.

1485
02:51:48,940 --> 02:52:05,720
Do you think that's all that happening? The final 16.

1486
02:52:09,640 --> 02:52:13,110
I'm sorry. The draft website. A peer reviewer and.

1487
02:52:14,880 --> 02:52:21,110
The paper. The two would be due at 12.

1488
02:52:23,340 --> 02:52:31,100
So here we. No.

1489
02:52:31,170 --> 02:52:36,960
Yeah, that's actually going to make that next week. Still submitted to.

1490
02:52:46,710 --> 02:52:49,710
Oh, yeah. Oh, I see what you're saying. Yeah, that. Which is it? It.

1491
02:52:50,970 --> 02:52:54,390
I know it doesn't. This was in the press on November 9th.

1492
02:52:55,390 --> 02:52:58,790
It was. His 16th birthday.

1493
02:53:00,410 --> 02:53:07,510
Oh, yes, that's right. But I don't know. See, I never. Right.

1494
02:53:08,710 --> 02:53:17,570
Well. I feel like there's always like a little bit of a hole in this section on how time winds up.

1495
02:53:17,570 --> 02:53:23,710
So. Training for staff peer review.

1496
02:53:27,340 --> 02:53:32,680
Then that would be based on your peers drafts.

1497
02:53:37,130 --> 02:53:40,420
At a time when we're not humiliating the state for giving.

1498
02:53:42,720 --> 02:53:46,090
Yeah. Yeah. Let me. I'll check that. I love these things.

1499
02:53:47,470 --> 02:53:50,860
This just looks amazing. It's nice. It's nice.

1500
02:53:53,550 --> 02:53:56,780
Can push all those things, but. That makes.

1501
02:53:57,700 --> 02:54:01,440
You guys said that what? We wanted to.

1502
02:54:03,370 --> 02:54:07,580
We can definitely do all the presentations. On the same day.

1503
02:54:07,630 --> 02:54:11,560
He. So I think.

1504
02:54:23,900 --> 02:54:32,610
That might be. Yeah, I, I'm it's to make those green light sweeping presentation.

1505
02:54:34,300 --> 02:54:38,880
We need to work on today's work, which allows full participation.

1506
02:54:42,040 --> 02:54:46,290
And you guys get to decide among yourselves, say yes to.

1507
02:54:47,490 --> 02:54:51,710
You on the 30th. We're happy to.

1508
02:54:58,760 --> 02:55:01,780
Am I connected to this crisis?

1509
02:55:01,850 --> 02:55:05,890
Oh, my gosh. Yeah. Sorry. Sorry. Oh, yeah.

1510
02:55:05,950 --> 02:55:10,930
Yeah. Well, some people suffer with their frustrations, and then.

1511
02:55:15,110 --> 02:55:20,090
Yeah. So. I think we could.

1512
02:55:21,530 --> 02:55:28,420
Have you guys. I mean only the defense that.

1513
02:55:29,620 --> 02:55:35,180
Yeah, I think it's worked well for light because there's a perception that business groups.

1514
02:55:37,180 --> 02:55:41,200
So it's not like I did it this time, choosing to do it this way.

1515
02:55:41,200 --> 02:55:48,260
And we're not done yet. I can.

1516
02:55:50,380 --> 02:55:55,320
So I can lean towards having presentations on Tuesdays as opposed to jams.

1517
02:55:56,060 --> 02:56:04,520
The French are naturally. Yeah.

1518
02:56:04,520 --> 02:56:08,380
So I. The 30th versus the 19th.

1519
02:56:14,590 --> 02:56:41,740
You know what? Their preference. Everybody knows that we're switching the.

1520
02:56:42,240 --> 02:56:49,510
Order also. So next time you need, we'll talk about like those social media sites, communications stuff.

1521
02:57:18,600 --> 02:57:24,050
Oh. I'm still working out.

1522
02:57:28,940 --> 02:57:40,580
You know, you're right. Yeah. That's.

1523
02:57:41,670 --> 02:57:45,360
Used to not having done that session, a lot of people did.

1524
02:57:45,500 --> 02:57:50,640
Very intimate passenger. That's not issue.

1525
02:57:51,960 --> 02:57:57,510
But also, there's no. Access to things during that time.

1526
02:57:58,470 --> 02:58:02,720
I can't imagine it.

1527
02:58:03,090 --> 02:58:17,319
Yeah. Yeah, that's true. This is Wednesday.

1528
02:58:17,320 --> 02:58:20,800
So just tell us. And I actually think the.

1529
02:58:22,230 --> 02:58:31,760
Not that day or today. Superman returning to do it might be a gift from their great great great.

1530
02:58:33,060 --> 02:58:39,520
Look, these guys are ready for this class. But if they are sorry, there's just a bit of a fight and they're making this.

1531
02:58:49,070 --> 02:58:57,110
But I'm leaving. Everything that I thought was right doesn't sound like the last thing I do.

1532
02:58:57,120 --> 02:59:01,010
That's true. Well, let me know. You don't have to decide.

1533
02:59:01,190 --> 02:59:07,180
Yeah, but let me know your best preference for the 30th birthday concert.

1534
02:59:07,880 --> 02:59:11,990
Or paper presentation or presentation. And then.

1535
02:59:16,820 --> 02:59:22,720
Right. Yeah.

1536
02:59:23,050 --> 02:59:31,460
Like I had o usually had my water. Oh, no, definitely.

1537
02:59:35,400 --> 02:59:48,370
I was. Yeah, that's true.

1538
02:59:49,780 --> 02:59:53,080
I think it's a concern for me because it's.
