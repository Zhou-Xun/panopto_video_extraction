00:00:05,935 --> 00:00:10,010
Do the pictures evoke any thoughts,
feelings?

5
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,940
What about some of the problems of
the world, one that you hope to solve?

This mural is in the lobby of
the Department of Health Behavior and

8
00:00:20,092 --> 00:00:24,827
Health Education and it's a collaboration
between our faculty, staff,

9
00:00:24,827 --> 00:00:26,268
students, and alum.

10
00:00:26,268 --> 00:00:30,930
It reflects our belief in identifying
root causes to solve health problems

11
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:35,598
facing families and communities across
the country and around the world.

00:00:35,598 --> 00:00:39,359
>> Welcome to Public Health 508,
Social Determinants of Health.

13
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:42,045
I'm Cleo Caldwell, your instructor, and

14
00:00:42,045 --> 00:00:45,396
I'm delighted that you've
enrolled in this course.

15
00:00:45,396 --> 00:00:49,368
I'm a faculty member in the Department
of Health Behavior and Health Education.

16
00:00:49,368 --> 00:00:54,487
And my colleagues and
I in HBHE work towards understanding and

17
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:57,146
reducing health disparities,

18
00:00:57,146 --> 00:01:02,075
especially across advantaged and
disadvantaged groups.

19
00:01:02,075 --> 00:01:06,876
My personal research focuses on
strengthening families within communities

20
00:01:06,876 --> 00:01:11,250
to improve health, especially for
African-American men and boys.

21
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,935
It addresses the significance
of the social environment,

22
00:01:14,935 --> 00:01:19,073
especially social support,
in addressing health disparities.

23
00:01:19,073 --> 00:01:23,936
The Social Determinants of Health course
is an outgrowth of the belief that social

24
00:01:23,936 --> 00:01:25,700
factors matters for health.

25
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,400
It focuses on identifying
factors that contribute

26
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,803
to poor health outside the healthcare
system, and beyond individual behaviors.

27

[MUSIC]

28
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:39,805
This course will expose you to social,
environmental, economic and

29
00:01:39,805 --> 00:01:43,539
political factors that
influence health inequalities.

30
00:01:43,539 --> 00:01:45,706
You will explore your interest and

31
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:50,722
health equity by examining the role of
societal factors in population health.

32
00:01:50,722 --> 00:01:55,652
This course is essential for any public
health professional to make a difference

33
00:01:55,652 --> 00:01:59,432
as the nation moves towards
achieving health equity for all.

34
00:01:59,432 --> 00:02:03,323
I look forward to working with
you as you complete this course.
