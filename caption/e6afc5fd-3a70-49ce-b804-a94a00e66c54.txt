1
00:00:05,355 --> 00:00:09,581
In this section, I'm going to talk
about Individual In-Depth Interviews.

2
00:00:09,581 --> 00:00:13,899
So individual in-depth interviews are when
you have one on one interaction between

3
00:00:13,899 --> 00:00:15,985
the interviewer and the participants.

4
00:00:15,985 --> 00:00:20,187
So some guiding the principles are to
think about really the goal is to go depth

5
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:21,038
over breadth.

6
00:00:21,038 --> 00:00:23,962
You won't be able to cover everything
that you want to cover but

7
00:00:23,962 --> 00:00:26,791
you're going in-depth on specific topic or
set of topics.

8
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:30,894
And also we'll think about that when we
talk about how many people to include in

9
00:00:30,894 --> 00:00:32,518
our study population as well.

10
00:00:32,518 --> 00:00:35,105
But the individual interview
is really this kind

11
00:00:35,105 --> 00:00:37,765
of engagement in
a choreographed conversation.

12
00:00:37,765 --> 00:00:42,088
So it's the interviewer who's
coreographing the conversation, but

13
00:00:42,088 --> 00:00:47,060
also being flexible and adapting to
the participants' needs, language style,

14
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:50,484
pace of speaking, etc.

15
00:00:50,484 --> 00:00:54,047
In qualitative research there are three
types of qualitative interviews,

16
00:00:54,047 --> 00:00:59,050
structured interviews, semi-structured
interviews, and unstructured interviews.

17
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:02,330
Structured interviews are when
you have a set list of questions,

18
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:05,130
so you ask the same questions
to all participants.

19
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:07,860
Usually in the order that they're
listed in the interview guide.

20
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,516
This is more like a series of
open-ended questions and answers.

21
00:01:11,516 --> 00:01:15,573
Semi-structured interviews are when you
have a set list of questions to guide you

22
00:01:15,573 --> 00:01:20,160
in the interview and perhaps even some
ideas about follow-up questions as well.

23
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:24,046
However, you know ahead of time that
you might not ask all of the questions,

24
00:01:24,046 --> 00:01:27,628
you might ask them in a different order,
and that you may adapt them for

25
00:01:27,628 --> 00:01:29,106
individual participants.

26
00:01:29,106 --> 00:01:33,134
Unstructured interviews are when you have
a topic which may be very broad, but

27
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:36,871
you don't have a set of questions in
mind when you go into the interview.

28
00:01:36,871 --> 00:01:41,339
Life history interviews are one example
of this type of unstructured interviews.

29
00:01:41,339 --> 00:01:44,421
So it's when you ask the participant
to just start telling you

30
00:01:44,421 --> 00:01:47,157
about their life and
then you ask questions as needed.

31
00:01:47,157 --> 00:01:50,254
In public health, we most commonly
use structured interviews or

32
00:01:50,254 --> 00:01:51,845
semi-structured interviews.

33
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:55,193
But this is really kind of due to the
nature of the questions that we have our

34
00:01:55,193 --> 00:01:56,600
research topics of interest.

35
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,442
Though I would encourage you as
you plan your own project or

36
00:01:59,442 --> 00:02:02,516
research study to think innovatively
of how you might be able to

37
00:02:02,516 --> 00:02:05,367
incorporate something like
an unstructured interview.

38
00:02:05,367 --> 00:02:08,355
So there's not a set
way to quote calculate

39
00:02:08,355 --> 00:02:11,180
a sample size in qualitative research.

40
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:14,970
But you do have to plan ahead to think
about how many participants you want to

41
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:15,519
include.

42
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:19,516
This is for both research study design,
budgeting, grant writing and

43
00:02:19,516 --> 00:02:20,858
hiring interviewers.

44
00:02:20,858 --> 00:02:24,928
So really the most important thing to
keep in mind is that generalization is

45
00:02:24,928 --> 00:02:28,885
not the goal of qualitative research,
the data saturation is the goal.

46
00:02:28,885 --> 00:02:33,130
So data saturation means that you have
reached the point in talking to people

47
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:37,505
when you notice patterns about what is
being said, or feel that you can start to

48
00:02:37,505 --> 00:02:41,930
draw conclusions about the research
questions that you set out to ask.

49
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:46,178
So when you plan for sample size,
I would encourage you to think

50
00:02:46,178 --> 00:02:49,867
about subgroups within
the population of interest and

51
00:02:49,867 --> 00:02:53,095
also the number of topics
you hope to engage in.

52
00:02:53,095 --> 00:02:55,120
So there are two main
sampling strategies for

53
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,045
thinking about in qualitative research.

54
00:02:57,045 --> 00:02:58,758
The first is theoretical sampling,

55
00:02:58,758 --> 00:03:02,792
that's when we start with the small number
of participants, conduct the interview,

56
00:03:02,792 --> 00:03:07,190
reflect on the information gained, maybe
conduct some preliminary data analysis.

57
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:09,676
And then based on those
preliminary results,

58
00:03:09,676 --> 00:03:13,128
we think about who would be most
interesting to interview next.

59
00:03:13,128 --> 00:03:16,440
So whom do we want to approach next and
recruit for our study.

60
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,967
The other sampling strategy is
what we call a priori sampling.

61
00:03:19,967 --> 00:03:23,253
And that's where we determine
the sample characteristics and

62
00:03:23,253 --> 00:03:26,167
the structure, and
base the number or participants and

63
00:03:26,167 --> 00:03:30,350
the categories of participants
based on our research purpose.

64
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:33,715
So really then you need to
think about whom to recruit and

65
00:03:33,715 --> 00:03:36,520
who to involve as
participants in your study.

66
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,870
So here, the guiding ideas are to
think about whose perspective and

67
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:43,540
lived experiences would really help
you answer your research question.

68
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:48,161
And I would also encourage you to consider
various stakeholders as you decide

69
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:50,019
who to recruit for your study.

70
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:54,480
So in summary, individual in-depth
interviews allow for confidentiality.

71
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,307
They allow for you to conduct
a conversation with another person in

72
00:03:58,307 --> 00:04:02,971
a private space where you can discuss
sensitive and confidential information.

73
00:04:02,971 --> 00:04:06,498
Individual interviews allow us
to learn the perspectives and

74
00:04:06,498 --> 00:04:09,018
experiences of individual participants.

75
00:04:09,018 --> 00:04:11,245
And that the goal of
qualitative research and

76
00:04:11,245 --> 00:04:15,530
conducting qualitative interviews is not
to generalize, but to explore in-depth.

77
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:19,242
So that includes both thinking about
exploring the topics in-depth, so that you

78
00:04:19,242 --> 00:04:23,240
have to limit the number of topics you
might be able to explore in one interview.

79
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:27,468
And then also thinking about our goal
of going in-depth about a certain study

80
00:04:27,468 --> 00:04:28,256
population.

81
00:04:28,256 --> 00:04:34,474
So that we don't have to interview
everyone about everything in one study.
