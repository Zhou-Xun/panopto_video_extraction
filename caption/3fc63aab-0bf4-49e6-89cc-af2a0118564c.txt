1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:05,640
I do not understand.

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,870
That makes me feel good about.

3
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:17,260
Well, do you think it's something that's going to help you?

4
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:32,580
Okay, so let's get started. So I was asked by our committee to advertise this this event for sort of a longer term vision.

5
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:40,440
About six years ago, maybe five years ago, the university underwent a pretty comprehensive reevaluation of the UI and how to

6
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,360
better teach it and respect it and and and infuse in every aspect of the school.

7
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,569
And so a lot of work had been done in the several surveys since that. So they're trying to now go to whatever the next step of that is.

8
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:56,070
And that's what a lot of these events you'll see over the next year sort of campus wide are, as they call it,

9
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:01,170
like the guy to point out, because they feel like they've already gotten some of the initial first steps.

10
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,019
So I definitely encourage you to attend this.

11
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:09,270
And at this, they'll talk a little bit more about some of the steps universities tried to take over the last four or five years.

12
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:16,440
Right. Okay. So today we are going to talk about like the problems this is going to represent our shift

13
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:20,940
from what happens to the glucose we eat to what happens if we're not eating glucose.

14
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:24,870
As I've said many times before, many cells in our body live glucose.

15
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:34,380
So we need to maintain a constant supply. And glycogen is the first part of that of gluconeogenesis and that is the next part of that.

16
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:38,969
So just as a little bit of a roadmap for your next few weeks, this is what it's going to look like.

17
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:46,890
So we're going to I'm going to finish lecturing for carbohydrates this week on Wednesday and then next Monday, your full break.

18
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:50,610
And then Wednesday, we're going to have a whole class devoted to review session,

19
00:01:50,610 --> 00:02:01,530
which has do it is going to lead to kind of review of as much of the material as we can that we've covered in the first six, seven weeks of class.

20
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:08,520
If there are particular concepts or learning objectives that you are, you want to make sure that we cover because you're like,

21
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,210
I'm still a little confused about this and please don't be like, I'm confused about like carbs.

22
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,520
Like I would like a little more specificity.

23
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:19,589
Email them to Stephanie because she's preparing sort of sample sets and questions related to these topics.

24
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:23,230
So if there are things that you really want to make sure we covered, let her know and we'll make sure of that.

25
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,530
So it's almost two and a half week break between Wednesday's class and the midterm.

26
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:33,839
So there's lots of time in between. And so hopefully you reach out to us if you need any more help.

27
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:40,379
And like I said, we'll have that review session over on Monday for possible, but more of that on the review session,

28
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:48,120
but it'll be the last time and that will want to live limits for the next the next few days right through to Thanksgiving.

29
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,840
Oh, I regret to say, happy Canadian. Thanksgiving is Canadian Thanksgiving.

30
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:59,310
I do not get the day off. I will have a turkey somewhere. Okay, so on to on the glycogen.

31
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,979
So these are the learnings back to today.

32
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:09,810
Just as a reminder, if you're wondering what do I need to know for the exam, start with the objectives on every slide, even if I don't them.

33
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:16,110
Okay, so this is a visual representation of what glycogen might look like in two dimensions.

34
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,560
So it's got a pretty interesting structure. A couple of things I want to point out here.

35
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:27,420
So one thing is that every glycogen particle actually has it. The root of it weirdly of a protein that's called like a Jenin, which is right.

36
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:32,610
You see it right there. So what and then affect like a jammed in there is the chain structure.

37
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:38,760
There is a lot of Alpha one for linkages just like AMLO's which are the long chains here.

38
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,829
And then there's brand points, other one six linkages. Glycogen is much more branched than amla packing, right?

39
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:48,780
So this branch structure is what really gives like units power. It's got a lot of three reducing ends.

40
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,710
And so as you break down glycogen, you're chewing off glucose from the ends, right?

41
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,310
So the more energy you have available, the faster you can liberate glucose, right?

42
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:02,009
So if you didn't have that, you just had one long glycogen molecule, you only have really one end you can chew off, right?

43
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:05,550
So that would be very, very limiting because you can only break down one glucose a time.

44
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:11,729
You can see here a glycogen could have tens of thousands of molecules, can have tens of thousands of different producing ends.

45
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:15,800
That means it can be liberated effectively as quickly as as it needs to be.

46
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,770
Right. That's its main advantage, is it can be broken down very, very quickly.

47
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:24,840
Now, we actually, as a scientific community, only discovered glycogen in about ten years ago.

48
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,649
And at the time people were like, oh, this is super important. It must be really relevant.

49
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:31,470
It turns out there are people who just don't have like a gen and they still love glycogen.

50
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:37,810
So even though this protein is the root of most people's glycogen products, we actually don't even know what the what the role is.

51
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:40,740
We're going to talk a lot today about things, complex storage diseases.

52
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:48,270
There is no glycogen storage, which is a sort of, you know, what percentage of the general population doesn't know it.

53
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:52,950
It's pretty rare, but like quite large scale genome sequencing, we've quite large scale genome sequence.

54
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,030
We found all sorts of people that should be set based on like, oh, they don't have this like super important thing.

55
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,129
And, and then people like. Yeah.

56
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:03,650
It's one of the interesting things about, you know, something.

57
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:11,150
In fact, I think the reasons that I heard is the average person has like ten mutations that should get you get the average.

58
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:15,380
And so obviously, there's a lot we don't know about this.

59
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:19,250
Okay. So we zoom in a little bit more. This is kind of what it looks like at the molecular level.

60
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:24,350
Of course, these are all glucose molecules. There is no event or glycogen.

61
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:26,990
The only storage form of carbohydrates is glycogen.

62
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:33,379
If we are going to store excess fructose or glucose or galactose, we have to convert it to glucose first, in which case it can be stored.

63
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:37,880
Grams you've got one six linkages, which are the branch points in the one four linkages which are beans.

64
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:44,000
And then again, to reorient you on a road map, this was glycolysis in divide.

65
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,690
Here's the TCA cycle we are working up here. So there's really only two enzymes here that are critically important.

66
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:56,090
There's one enzyme for making glycogen, hopefully called glycogen synthase and one enzyme for breaking down glycogen,

67
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:02,479
but it's only called glycogen first for release. You'll notice as you go through here, the biochemistry is pretty straightforward.

68
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:09,920
You start with glucose using ATP to add one phosphate molecule, use another ATP during this glycogen or this UDP glucose step.

69
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:14,090
And then you end up with like when you break it down, you'll notice there's no actual ATP released.

70
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:22,820
So the breakdown of glycogen is not energy releasing. It just really becomes this all these branch points that actually it's unlike that

71
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:26,180
the branching has a really important benefit in terms of accessibility and density,

72
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:33,440
but to get rid of the branch point, it actually we need another whole separate enzyme is called HDL and that name is so useless.

73
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,540
I'm not even going to tell you what that name is. It's just it's sure it stands for something, but we're just calling it ideal.

74
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:43,760
And what it does is to get rid of a branch point it actually undergoes is pretty complicated set of biochemistry.

75
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:51,410
So the collection calls for all these will start queuing up. The glucose is until it gets near ish to a branch point when there's four carbons left.

76
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,780
And then rather than just getting rid of the branch,

77
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:59,269
what it does is actually transfers the branch except for one molecule off to the end here and then

78
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:04,520
it clips off this one glucose and then glycogen phosphorylation can go through the rest of it.

79
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:10,159
So this whole activity, of course really transferase and of course it is all of that is catalyzed by this enzyme called AGL.

80
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:17,420
So AGL is extremely important for getting rid of these these branch points and it does a bunch of different steps in the process.

81
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:23,120
If you couldn't get rid of the branches you would just end up with all your black to get the juice down to something like this.

82
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:26,690
Right. You get reduced down to very short highly branch collection.

83
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:35,110
Okay. So where is glycogen in our body? So this I think is a sort of helpful figure.

84
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:40,240
We think of sort of hypoglycemia and diabetes as being a disorder of having too much glucose.

85
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:43,690
But if you look at this, you can see we have almost no glucose in our plasma glucose.

86
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:47,440
That's what causes diabetes. That's the problem, is having too much glucose in our blood.

87
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:54,309
But if you compare that to normal glucose that is stored in the rest of our body in the form of glycogen, it's like infinitesimally small.

88
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:59,140
So we store a lot more of it orders of magnitude more glucose in the form of glycogen than we do in liver.

89
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:04,120
Overall, the higher density location of glycogen is the liver.

90
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:09,130
So in terms of weight, a liver can be about 10% by weight of glycogen.

91
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:15,030
But almost every person I'm going to go out on a limb as you probably every person has much more muscle mass than they do liver mass.

92
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:20,800
So if you normalize it to the amount of actual muscle you have, most of the overall glycogen is in muscle.

93
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:29,510
Now, it turns out that's actually not that hopeful for some things because we cannot use the glycogen in our muscle to maintain homeostasis.

94
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:34,120
Right. Like glycogen, what's it's in our muscle that glucose stays in our muscle, it doesn't get back out.

95
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:39,910
It's used for energy. So it's useful if you're using it for energy, but it is not useful for maintaining glucose homeostasis.

96
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:45,520
Look it in the liver, on the other hand, can be released because it's got the activity of the enzyme glucose phosphatase.

97
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,280
It can be released into blood glucose if needed.

98
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:53,650
Then I noted this and also a few comments on perusal, but I was to make sure everybody pays attention to this part.

99
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:57,550
Glycogen binds water great within its structure and has a lot of water bound to it,

100
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:06,639
which means that this 500 grams of glycogen is not just 500 grams of mass, it's actually more like two kilograms of mass.

101
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:11,630
And so people who go on glucose reducing diets like low carb diets, a ketogenic diet,

102
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:15,160
one of the reasons why people find it so attractive is very quickly,

103
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,340
like within two or three days of them going on one of these diets, Bill,

104
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:21,310
deplete their glycogen and they'll have a pretty dramatic loss of weight, right.

105
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:25,840
Because they'll lose several kilograms of glycogen and all the water that was bound to that glycogen.

106
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:31,180
And so they'll be like, this is great. This guy is going to work and I'm going to lose like £5 a week for like ever.

107
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,719
And that's not true because absolutely not lost at this point.

108
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,730
Any fans, right? They've only lost that water.

109
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:42,520
And if they have a bagel, it'll just come right back and look like a jewel replete and the water will come with it.

110
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:46,840
There's also one of the reasons why people go on low carb diets often have this malaise.

111
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:51,790
They call it like the keto flu, because as you lose all that fluid, you lose a lot of electrolytes at the same point.

112
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:54,970
And also in this case, particularly, magnesium is important.

113
00:09:55,270 --> 00:10:00,489
And so people will often feel nauseous and have indigestion because they'll become temporarily

114
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:07,440
magnesium deficient as they flush out of this I that there's not a lot to do before they show I think

115
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:12,430
produce on the conversation strip on the water out so you can just see everything and collegiate

116
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:16,509
wrestlers and I mean a lot of people do this it's a very quick way to reduce your weight very,

117
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:20,340
very quickly. But it's not weight in the way that I think any of us think.

118
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:27,819
So the glycogen in the liver and muscle is, you know, chemically the same, but it has two pretty different purposes, right?

119
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:33,550
So in the liver its main role is storage to maintain your glycemia and the muscle, its main role is energy.

120
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,980
And that's actually reflected by some pretty subtle differences in their zoology.

121
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:43,270
They have two different enzymes, a glycogen synthase in the liver and it like in some parts of the muscle,

122
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:48,820
the liver glycogen synthase is activated by glucose six phosphate,

123
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:53,870
that's its primary activator and it's inhibited when you have high levels of glucose, right?

124
00:10:53,890 --> 00:11:01,810
So if you have lots of glucose in your liver, it's electrically inactivated such that you get because it's sensing glucose because

125
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:05,379
its main thing is to make sure that glucose levels do the same on the muscle.

126
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:11,230
On the other hand, unlike the liver, there's a binding pocket for amp, so that's a signal of energy depletion.

127
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:17,530
So muscle has the ability to respond to energy needs in a way that the liver isoform doesn't respond as quick.

128
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:24,940
Right. And so again, these two little differences, the glucose here and the amp here are what allows the muscle to be really responsive

129
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:29,680
to energy needs and what allows the liver wanted to be more responsive to typical.

130
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:39,990
In terms of response to hormones, glucagon and adrenaline both affect glycogen analysis or the breakdown of glycogen in the liver.

131
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,950
In the muscle. It's only adrenaline and not glucagon.

132
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:49,440
Welcome back to this in a few slides when we talk about that, that's because the muscle does not have any glucagon receptors.

133
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,669
So glucagon is a hormone that goes up when you are like glucose drops and your

134
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:56,670
muscle does not carry it because it has no role in maintaining your blood glucose.

135
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:57,810
Right. It just completely.

136
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:06,299
And again, the key thing here is the the glucose six phosphate that's liberated from the glycogen is not released in muscle.

137
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:14,010
It always undergoes glycolysis. So over time, if you look at glycogen levels, they'll deplete during exercise.

138
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:19,220
That's why it's there, right? So as you exercise, this is just a rad study showing that if you put a rat in a pool,

139
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:26,910
that's an obligatory swim twirls all around and you can see there's sort of a nice linear decline of a glycogen in their muscles.

140
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:33,660
Okay, so I'm going to take a minute and take a step back to a couple of hormones here just to refresh our bodies a little bit.

141
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:37,140
So there's two hormones and they're going to sound pretty similar, right?

142
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:42,360
There's going to come up for both glycogen ulcers and gluconeogenesis because of those hormones.

143
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:47,040
Now glucagon is released when blood glucose is low.

144
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:52,470
So its result naturally is to raise your blood glucose. That's why it exists, is solely to raise your blood glucose.

145
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:59,220
So it really only works on the liver. It does not really have any effect on the muscle and doesn't really have any effect on adipose tissue.

146
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:07,560
That's what that's what neither of those are major source of usable, usable glucose.

147
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:08,099
Right.

148
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:14,580
So if you look at how that happens, if you look at where the receptors for grouping on are, almost all the receptors are primarily in the liver.

149
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:18,060
Right. So that's how you get specificity of glucagon in the liver.

150
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:22,440
In the case of epinephrine or adrenaline, same thing.

151
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:24,270
There's actually a little more of a complicated thing.

152
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:29,820
So there are adrenaline receptors in the liver, but there's also adrenaline receptors in the muscle and in the fat.

153
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:34,710
And the reason for that is because the goal of epinephrine is to provide glucose to muscle.

154
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,400
So it does that by allowing for glucose break down.

155
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,380
These are glycogen, all of which are gluconeogenesis.

156
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:45,330
That's going to raise the blood glucose temporarily, but that's immediately going to get used up in the muscle.

157
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:53,309
So if you go back to the regulation of fossil fractal kinase one, you'll remember or you may not remember,

158
00:13:53,310 --> 00:14:00,420
but hopefully you remember by the time we get to the exam that we do not turn off glycolysis by adrenaline in the muscle.

159
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,710
Right. Because there's no reason to.

160
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:07,050
But we do turn off glycolysis in the liver because the whole idea is to get the glucose out of the liver and to the muscle.

161
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:12,480
So that's why the muscle in this case is is generally read as we transition to the lipid unit.

162
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:17,669
You'll see that also epinephrine but not glucagon can liberate fatty acids as in cortisol.

163
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:24,990
And that again, that is helpful for getting energy to the muscles because that's the goal of okay, so that's the difference between glucagon.

164
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,080
And again, this will come up a few more times in the next couple of hours.

165
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:33,420
So this is just sort of a summary of all the different effects of what's going on with glucagon and epinephrine.

166
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,459
The key thing is glucagon plays very little role in liberating fat and very little role in affecting muscle,

167
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:43,440
whereas epinephrine has roles about the liver and muscle.

168
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:49,770
Okay, so how does it do this? The pathways actually benefit from once you get inside the cell.

169
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:54,239
So in the case of getting inside the cell, there's a protein kinase called protein kinase.

170
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,730
And and it is activated by both glucagon and epinephrine in the liver, but only epinephrine in the muscle.

171
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,190
And it causes the activation of the another kinase called glycogen phosphorylated kinase,

172
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:09,030
which then adds a phosphate group to glycogen phosphorylation.

173
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,079
So in this context, kinase always means as a phosphate group, right?

174
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:17,760
So this is glycogen phosphorylated, this is glycogen phosphorylated this kinase.

175
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:21,690
It puts a phosphate group on the glycogen phosphorylation in this diagram.

176
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:25,290
Green means that means it turns on glycogen phosphorylation, right?

177
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:30,839
So you get a signal, adrenaline or glucagon goes through this pathway, activates phosphorylated phosphatase, gold,

178
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:37,200
and starts clipping off those glucose molecules so they can be either used if they're in the muscle or released if they're in the liver.

179
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:42,960
Now, at the same time, pKa also causes phosphorylation of glycogen synthase,

180
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:47,970
which we'll talk about after this next activity here that now turns off glycogen cells.

181
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,720
Right. So there's going to be a parallel diagram you're going to see in a couple of slides here,

182
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:57,880
where when you turn off this system and turn on this system, this becomes active and this becomes, you know, all right.

183
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,630
And that's because you only want to be doing one of these things at a time.

184
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:06,960
You either want to be breaking down glycogen or you want to be making it, but there's no context where you'd want to be doing both at the same time.

185
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:14,340
And so that's a hormone regulation. So in the case of like if you break down, the most important hormones are epinephrine and glucagon.

186
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:20,730
In the case of glycogen synthesis, which we'll talk about in a minute, the most important signal is, is insulin.

187
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,580
Okay? Did you have any questions about that?

188
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:28,510
Realize it's a little bit confusing in terms of what's phosphorylated and what's turned out and was turned off now.

189
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:34,090
So glycogen phosphate. At least it is present in both the liver and muscle.

190
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,930
Yeah. Oh, yeah. There is a slightly different isoform. There's a muscle isoform in the liver.

191
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:43,020
But as president. Yeah, that's because both tissues need to be able to break those glycogen molecules down again.

192
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:47,510
Okay. Actually, that's a good transition.

193
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:55,020
So it turns out that there are people out there that have deficiencies in almost all of these enzymes that I've talked about so far, so synthase,

194
00:16:55,200 --> 00:17:02,849
phosphorylation, AGL, glycogen branching enzyme, which is the thing that has the branches for least kinase two which lets the glucose in.

195
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:08,220
So all of these people out there that have variants that cause complete loss of function and

196
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:13,020
all of these different enzymes and these collectively are known as glycogen storage diseases,

197
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,090
which I think they're like 11 or 12 or something.

198
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:21,719
So what we're going to do for the next 15 minutes or so is you're going to get into groups and you're going to be

199
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:29,370
assigned I will assign you a glycogen storage disease and you are going to investigate just that one randomly design.

200
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,969
Actually, you can pick the one you're going to pick out of that and you're going to research that.

201
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:38,160
And there's a few questions I want you to ask. I want you to predict what is going to happen to the glycogen.

202
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:44,520
You can have a glycogen storage disease where you have more glycogen or when you have less glycogen, or are you going to have like unusable glycogen?

203
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:48,660
Those are all possibilities, what phenotypes might occur.

204
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:53,860
So try to do that before you get on the Google. Like I think this would cause this phenotype, right?

205
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:59,460
So I have no glycogen, therefore I think that might make me like fat an exercise or something in the muscle.

206
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:05,370
And then I want you to go on to the Internet and try to figure out, did you catch all the right phenotypes and try?

207
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:08,550
The most important part of this is can you explain the phenotypes?

208
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:16,370
Right. So if you're going to say this disease causes high risk of hypoglycemia, low blood glucose, you should be able explain why that's the case.

209
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:19,170
Right. If you see something on that, on the Internet which talks about it,

210
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:23,969
then you should go to figure out and then hopefully have time after that to look in what is the management,

211
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:29,010
either dietary or lifestyle of that disease and then what you do with your aspirin.

212
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:40,440
Okay, so I'm going to go around and distribute these, make sure you submit your group first so we can agree with those people.

213
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:46,320
Because it's very interesting.

214
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:50,250
Because it's so funny.

215
00:18:52,290 --> 00:19:06,480
Yes, Mr. President. Mr. President, I would like to hear from you.

216
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:29,410
You know, so this is not something, Mr. Speaker, I stay out of, but I don't know how he gets up front about anything.

217
00:19:29,640 --> 00:20:11,250
There might be something that, you know, like that was the last thing I think, you know, which one would you agree with?

218
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:36,630
That does not turn out to be working things out.

219
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:41,700
Oh, yeah.

220
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,650
Actually, I was really surprised at how.

221
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:59,720
Yeah, it's really easy for you on the show already.

222
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:10,720
I think so. Yeah, I think there's a thumbs up.

223
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:17,730
Yeah, you actually you guys.

224
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:25,290
So you got think. Yeah, that's good. I do better. Yeah, you're right.

225
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:38,800
Okay, this might be allowed.

226
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:42,190
And then I guess I.

227
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:50,950
Not that much more than that, though, what you're talking about.

228
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:55,330
Like I know a little bit. So there's a brainstorm that we have.

229
00:21:56,470 --> 00:22:01,000
Yes. It would be high efficiency.

230
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,770
Yes. Which one did you guys get? Yes.

231
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:12,510
Oh, so the lack of French.

232
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:17,650
So that's why this is so silly.

233
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:22,620
Yeah. Yeah, it's like with like one.

234
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:34,760
I mean, it's funny that, you know, this is funny that like, the picture isn't actually feel like it's like I don't love the Wikipedia choice for that.

235
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:53,050
I don't know. I mean, I feel like I don't know the name I like.

236
00:22:54,490 --> 00:23:00,160
It's kind of the same place in the liver.

237
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:09,940
And so there's not like a muscle specific thing, like it's thing because if you like, you know.

238
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:14,500
Yeah. No. Miles from me. Yeah.

239
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:26,680
I think that liver collection seems to be on that.

240
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:35,500
Yeah. And it should say on the brakes.

241
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:39,790
Nobody thinks that's the table is always in the state.

242
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:50,470
Yeah. I mean, I think that's one of the things that really causes.

243
00:23:50,730 --> 00:24:02,049
Oh, oh, I don't know how you're not able to break down.

244
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:06,520
Like, just you're not able to actively exercise anything like that for us.

245
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:15,140
Good. So then you should look at that. Actually, you're not able to stay the course.

246
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:19,680
We'll be discussing that.

247
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:29,500
We'll start with the. But could you just get approval and just say that I know what I'm saying?

248
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:37,120
So like what is what is has been nothing seems to die but you know.

249
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:44,350
Right. So if you can't get rid of it but you're going to have like a ton of foot, like probably really short change, a lot of people.

250
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:51,310
So then, then think about like, what would that do? Not like very short lived experience.

251
00:24:54,910 --> 00:25:04,450
Yeah, well, maybe topic, but it'll be like heart to heart to get anything out of it like that because there's only so much you could see.

252
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:08,640
This makes me scared of every single discovery that I was. I just.

253
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:12,010
I never thought it would be.

254
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:21,220
I guess I could see.

255
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:33,670
I don't know what else it's not like.

256
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:53,230
Right. There were times when it was just like, you know, so it's just like, okay, here we go.

257
00:25:53,230 --> 00:26:03,360
Like, oh, it's just. It's just like.

258
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:33,310
So there's a point where like and so for both people, I mean, you don't have to ask, is there any other questions with what I was doing?

259
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:42,790
And if I. I just want to know.

260
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:48,090
Oh yeah, three seasons in Channel five.

261
00:26:48,120 --> 00:27:01,730
And I was like, oh, I think, I think it's probably not helpful.

262
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:11,640
No, I'm not outside your building.

263
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:32,560
Okay, so that's a good question. I think so. I don't know whether or not it wasn't the one time I was going to like indirectly is that she has died.

264
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:38,670
But I've noticed there's no like concerts or maybe that.

265
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:42,540
But I think it's quite a different question.

266
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:53,610
Why would it have been like that?

267
00:27:53,650 --> 00:28:00,120
Because it was just like one of those things like the most well researched.

268
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:05,760
You are right. There is so much on there.

269
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:18,760
All right. Whereas here in the muscle for your stuff, even if you get pregnant, like I was thinking about it,

270
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:32,030
like it wouldn't be very interesting to know, oh, boy, you're not listening to this.

271
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:36,750
You know, these are different sorts of language.

272
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:46,680
So. So I don't I don't have the answer that I. I'm going on with one by also.

273
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,560
So can you imagine the lives of people?

274
00:28:50,580 --> 00:29:03,930
I don't know what would be more likely to have it because it's required so that maybe you and you're behind alerts like, I can't do this at all.

275
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:37,260
I think that's why it's nice to have you guys can write something that increases the security of the United States.

276
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:50,040
Yeah. And it's like not sort of like Libya or what.

277
00:29:50,070 --> 00:30:04,610
It's like they give you an idea of how they are going to assess what you do.

278
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:25,130
So how are you doing is leading to the management.

279
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:41,010
It's not like actually one of my good friends, I say, Well, can I just tell you what is super weird?

280
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:48,060
But you know, I'll do it because I don't know why. That just doesn't mean something.

281
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:54,360
Okay, get out of here. If one of you end up being one of you, that could be similar.

282
00:30:55,140 --> 00:31:04,840
However, like, you know that I have absolutely nothing to tell you how I felt.

283
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:18,030
I mean, that is what I say something about.

284
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:23,280
What? I mean, like, it wasn't even.

285
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:33,120
Okay. That's good.

286
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:40,880
Yeah, I like the guitar.

287
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:54,270
So how does that sound?

288
00:31:56,350 --> 00:32:04,560
Yeah, that. That's what I thought.

289
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:20,970
Okay, so looks like most people are, like, more or less done ish or like, at least on the road to being done.

290
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:26,280
So what I think I'm going to do is I want you could read everybody else's enters if you wanted,

291
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:31,079
but I think what we'll do is I'm going to kind of go around the room and I want I'm going to ask individual

292
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:35,220
group some sort of thoughts about their disease to kind of narrow down some of the phenotypes here.

293
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:40,920
So the first thing I want to start with, who which group thinks they have the most common of these incidents?

294
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:56,780
Lowest one in. You ought to look just like was there anybody who was like around one in a thousand?

295
00:32:57,530 --> 00:33:02,360
Oh, right. There you go. Okay. So which one was your disease?

296
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:07,030
Hers. Hers? It's actually it's actually Harry's does is.

297
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:10,730
But he's German. He is German.

298
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:14,290
Here was the tongue.

299
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:17,780
So tell me a little bit about Harry's disease. What happens? Like, what gene is it?

300
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,010
What happens is look like a gene.

301
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:31,070
So it affects the ability of like, in fact, where we spend time, it doesn't have the gene code for it, so it can sound like good, whatever.

302
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:38,390
So that results in people having low blood glucose and a build up of ketone bodies, right?

303
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:39,739
Yeah. So low blood glucose.

304
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:46,460
And the reason they would have a buildup of ketone bodies is because now they can't undergo the analysis that we'll talk about next class.

305
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:50,590
Okay, that's great. Okay. So who thinks they have the rarest?

306
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:55,840
That was like around 1 to 1000. You guys think you have the rarest. So how common is your find?

307
00:33:55,870 --> 00:34:04,460
It was a very rare disease. I'm looking on Fanconi anemia, so we know that the true incidence is unknown.

308
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:12,800
But until like from 1946 to 2002, 106 cases from 88 and just 1.6 cases.

309
00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:18,800
Okay. So incredibly, incredibly rare. Yeah. So you said 106 cases from 88 families.

310
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:24,500
Okay. Yeah. So that's pretty rare. So tell me a little bit about your case disease.

311
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:33,650
So in this disease, we have a mutation in the in the in the end and C2 and two.

312
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:41,660
So it is autism, a recessive gene and we have accumulation of nitrogen, meaning that there's a number.

313
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:50,629
And as I mentioned, it's very rare. And the common features usually identified in young children after they are after they are born.

314
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:58,370
And usually the common features are frequent. So what do you recall, which is excessive urination, rickets, which is very weak bones.

315
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:04,130
And if I don't make any because of that combination of the of the fine content and also kidney enlargement.

316
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:09,410
Okay. So I don't maybe you said missed it. What what does the gene do so mutation.

317
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:15,830
No, the gene what does it normally do? SLC two or two. So it affects the glycogen.

318
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:21,770
That's why it's here. It's the transporter, it's the glucose track, it's Bluetooth.

319
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,550
So it's the transporter, what's in it? So now that I've told you that, why do you think there's more glycogen?

320
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:29,480
Now that I've told you it's a defect in the transporter because I'm going to break it down.

321
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,600
No, it's a transporter. So it has to do with transport. It's not like significant.

322
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:37,879
You're not allowed to get it right. So maybe it's hard time to even getting it right.

323
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,530
So that's why that one's a tricky one. Right?

324
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:44,959
But it turns out when you go through gluconeogenesis, you make your own glucose and that glucose cannot get it right.

325
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:53,120
And so then you went through sort of the rest of the hepatic and and presumably a failure to thrive is related to the low, low blood glucose.

326
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:58,700
My guess is it would be hypoglycemia if they started up that would such a severe disease that people generally don't get long that long.

327
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:04,790
Okay. All right. So we've done one liver one and another liver one.

328
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:08,840
So how about a muscle one? I know you guys are going to have a muscle one.

329
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:15,530
So can you tell me a little bit about your disease? We had McArdle or avocado disease.

330
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:23,810
The incidence of it. Yeah, the incidence was one in 100,000.

331
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:28,250
So rare, but not as rare as what they just discussed.

332
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:36,260
And this is due to a lack of or just like not working muscle phosphorylation or myo phosphorylation.

333
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:47,090
So that causes a buildup of glycogen or a like it's not able to be broken down into glucose to be used by the muscle.

334
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:55,819
So some of those like phenotypes look like loss of muscle ability to respond to amp

335
00:36:55,820 --> 00:37:02,000
signals so you don't have enough energy to work out rhabdomyolysis like symptoms.

336
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:04,700
That's kind of like when your muscles are like breaking itself,

337
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:12,530
like breaking itself down and you could have like red colored urine and any other complications due to muscle loss.

338
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:17,120
And then we talked about like some ways that we could help.

339
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:28,460
That would be through creatine supplements to increase energy reserve consuming sucrose before a workout instead of like a glucose source.

340
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:33,500
High protein, low carb diet. Vitamin B6 supplement.

341
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:40,050
Okay. So the Peace six summit, which may seem like that's a little, little out there,

342
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:44,610
there's certain types of McCardle disease where the defect is actually in the B6 binding pocket.

343
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:51,580
Right. And so there is a some, some subset of mercados is B6 deficient mercados.

344
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:56,219
And so they can be treated by having like super high amounts of B6 because if they have a high enough amount of it,

345
00:37:56,220 --> 00:38:03,240
then it can still get into the pocket, the pockets still there because it doesn't work, but not all points to be like, okay, it was great.

346
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:09,600
Okay, so let's do, let's do one more. How about the group that's kind of in the middle section?

347
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:18,420
One key point because we're all living. Yeah. So can you tell us a little bit about what your disease was and what the phenotypes are?

348
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:24,600
Our diseases cause disease. The phenotype infected is HDL.

349
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:33,629
So HDL is used to deep break the glycogen.

350
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:40,890
So without this engine and zem so the glycogen, the branch points of light content cannot be broken down.

351
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:48,120
And that's why we partially break down glycogen.

352
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:54,299
You'll be stored in the cells, either in liver and also in the muscle.

353
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:58,890
So there will be a glycogen build up in the body cells.

354
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:07,500
And the manifestations of this gene mutation is fatigue and also muscle weakness.

355
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:20,670
And for the infant it's the same with the functioning vehicle like automobile and also failure to thrive.

356
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:26,340
And so that's that's a good point. So Eagle, there's only one version of the Eagle Gene, right?

357
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:28,860
So that's why that affects muscle and liver together.

358
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:32,670
The same thing was also true, I think for the fast release there's not a muscle specific version,

359
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:38,100
whereas the force for Lays and the glycogen synthase or muscle and liver isoform, so they have sort of different roles.

360
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:42,270
Okay. Right. So let's get so we'll move on to the next part here.

361
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:47,730
So again, these diseases are pretty rare. I used to say they're so rare that you would never actually come across a patient.

362
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:54,839
But last year, one of the former 630 graduates had had a terrific disease patient that they were they're doing more for.

363
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:58,709
So they're rare. But if you're a dietitian, you see a thousand people. Chances are you're going to see one.

364
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:02,150
In the previous year, it was one of the figures on it.

365
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:07,440
The other reason I think these are instructed is isn't what it tells you.

366
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:11,970
You can imagine somebody who has a complete loss of function, one of these genes, and they're going to have a very strong phenotype.

367
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:15,380
But you could also imagine somebody who was like maybe a slight loss of function in that you

368
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:19,230
think maybe they are just an athlete that's not able to store as much glycogen in the muscle.

369
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:23,310
Maybe there's somebody who's a little more prone to hypoglycemia because they're not there.

370
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:28,580
ACL, for example, works but not not optimally or it doesn't quite work as well as a brain.

371
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,959
Okay. So I've already talked about this sort of briefly.

372
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:37,320
So there's two energetic steps. We're going to move on to the synthesis part here.

373
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:45,330
There's two energy requiring steps to make glucose look like the phosphorylated and the Hetzel kinds of the Kuka kind of step,

374
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:49,590
which are, you know, chemically equivalent steps. And then you need another ATP in this.

375
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:52,140
You run a transfer step here to use to Atpase.

376
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:59,790
Every single time you put a glucose onto a glycogen, every time you take a glucose off of like it, you generate zero, right?

377
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:04,290
So this is, as I've said before, a very inefficient process.

378
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:04,619
Right?

379
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:11,040
So if you just make a bunch of glycogen and break it down, you started with glucose and then you ended up with glucose and you've burned some ATP.

380
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:13,079
And that too. ATP may not seem like a lot,

381
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:18,510
but if you imagine a glycogen molecule has hundreds of thousands of glucose molecules attached to it, that could be a lot of ATP.

382
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:22,620
So I did some some math to figure out what that looks like in terms of calories.

383
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:29,100
So to replenish 500 grams, which is about the normal body glycogen store, would take about 66 calories.

384
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:36,209
Right. So that's what that inefficiency translates to in terms of the total daily energy expenditure on this inefficiency.

385
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:42,630
So if you had a let's say you consumed by high carbohydrate meal and your body

386
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:46,620
made a bunch of glycogen and you burned this 66 calories to store that glycogen,

387
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:50,100
how would that appear like? What part of energy expenditure would that be?

388
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:57,420
Of the four parts of energy expenditure we talked about probably seemingly like 50 years ago, but I swear this.

389
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:06,329
Mr. Thermal thermal effect, thermal effect or ninetieths, thermogenesis.

390
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:14,070
Right. So I mentioned way back in that class that just doing digestion and storage of food can burn energy.

391
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:18,479
This is an example of that, right? This is an example of your burning energy to store the glucose molecules.

392
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:23,430
Right. And so that's what that 66 calories. But of course, there's other parts of this in terms of transport, things like that too.

393
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:26,510
But just the ATP part to make glycogen with the thermal effects.

394
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:33,050
Okay. I was sidetracked.

395
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:40,550
Okay, so how does a consultant do this? So there's a couple of different ways by which insulin promotes glycogen synthesis.

396
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:45,020
So the first similar to PFOA one is Alice Eric activation.

397
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:49,969
So again, that's very, very quick. That's because of a positive feedback from glucose six phosphate.

398
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:54,500
So glycogen synthase has a quirk that can buy the glucose six phosphate as you have a

399
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:59,600
buildup of glucose six phosphate that feeds forward to tell glycogen synthase to activate.

400
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:04,849
So if you remember back to Warne's lecture, he talked about feedforward circuits in terms of perceptions of food,

401
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:09,230
and that makes you anticipate food, maybe make you hungry down road. This is sort of the biochemical equivalent to that.

402
00:43:09,410 --> 00:43:15,260
So your body has a bunch of glucose, six phosphate that's building up and it tells glycogen synthase you should do something with this glucose.

403
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:18,050
It's positive, right? And so that's the first a first step.

404
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:27,680
The second step is, as I alluded to before, the opposite of the phosphorylation steps we talked about in the in the case of the activation here.

405
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:34,100
So now what you're going to have is defaults for this, both like gene phosphorylation and glycogen synthesis.

406
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:37,469
And in this group of colors now these colors are reversed, right?

407
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:43,190
So now like a gene synthase one, it is green, which in my presence means it's active,

408
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:48,080
whereas glycogen synthase when it's phosphorylated is now inactive.

409
00:43:48,350 --> 00:43:55,100
Right. And so that's how in some forms. So we know insulin works through this protein kinase called active and we know

410
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:58,820
that works roughly to turn off two of the things that possibly got into this,

411
00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:09,409
GSK and AMPK, but exactly how insulin causes the default correlation aside from turning off the kinases is actually not totally known.

412
00:44:09,410 --> 00:44:16,790
So we think right now this has something to do with a protein phosphatase that is specifically targeted to the glycogen molecule.

413
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:22,429
But exactly how that happens, you don't actually know right now. So there's some signal by which insulin activates this phosphatase.

414
00:44:22,430 --> 00:44:27,919
But right now it's it's a little unclear. But we do know and we've known for like 50 years that this de phosphorylation occurs.

415
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:32,830
And so that shifts the balance toward synthesis and away from glycogen breakdown.

416
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:37,759
Okay. So now we've talked about all three of these, right?

417
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,740
So there's three routes for glucose before.

418
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:45,799
If we count people's solution of the phosphate, the first great living step we're going through, glycolysis is plaque.

419
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:50,690
It's regulated by these things that or it can go through the Pintos phosphate chunk, which we talked about on Wednesday.

420
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:56,150
It's regulated by these things or it can become glycogen and it is regulated by by those.

421
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:59,149
Right? So now we've covered sort of all three of these these pathways.

422
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:03,470
So again, hopefully now given the cellular state of the hormonal state of a cell,

423
00:45:03,590 --> 00:45:10,190
you should be able to predict which pathway any given glucose molecule might go down.

424
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:19,220
Okay. So I'm going to switch to sort of a bigger picture view of what's happening when you when you elevate glycogen in the body.

425
00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:26,209
So this study here, which I don't have a reference on, but I'll add I'll add later, is a carbohydrate over feeding study.

426
00:45:26,210 --> 00:45:30,980
So what they were doing here is they were trying to tell people, normal,

427
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:35,300
healthy individuals, if you overeat carbohydrates, what happens to those carbohydrates.

428
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:41,540
So they used a variety of different are stable isotopes follow what happened to the carbohydrates.

429
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:47,839
So what you can see first is if you look in the dash line, there's a in diet whether they're eating it says zero carbohydrates.

430
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:53,780
But what they mean here is zero excess carbohydrates. And the dash line is how many carbohydrates they need.

431
00:45:53,930 --> 00:45:59,690
So the goal of this study was actually they were going to stepwise increase carbohydrate intake by 500 grams a day, which is a lot.

432
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:06,200
Right. That's like 2000 calories. So that's that's why they had the alternate slots for Olive Garden size fettuccine.

433
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:10,460
Alfredo split it and then we're going to keep increasing it by 500 grams a day.

434
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:11,870
They want to do that for like five days.

435
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:18,050
So they're going to keep pumping them with more and more carbohydrates to figure out what else by day to the participants were like,

436
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:23,959
No, no, I'm good at 800 grams, which is, like I said, like still a lot of carbohydrates.

437
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:26,960
Right? So that's 3200 calories is required at that point.

438
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,430
The participants just stop eating. All right.

439
00:46:28,430 --> 00:46:34,640
So that's why that's the sort of level of the more interesting thing is sort of what happens to out to the carbohydrates.

440
00:46:34,850 --> 00:46:38,450
So the first thing that happens when you have an increase in carbohydrates is you have oxidation.

441
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:45,440
So this is your glycolysis a.k.a cycles. So that's the body's first response to excess carbohydrates as it tries to oxidize as much as they can.

442
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:53,210
Right. And so based on the increasing glucose, six phosphate and ideally some energy needs, that's going to happen first.

443
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:59,420
What can't be oxidized is they're going to go into glycogen storage. That's just like, wait, it's a pass up here, right?

444
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:00,889
So as soon as you can't oxidize it.

445
00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:07,250
So at this point, shortly into the second day, they're already massively increasing their glycogen stores from here.

446
00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:11,120
And then that became sort of diminishing returns over time.

447
00:47:12,110 --> 00:47:17,299
Glorious glycogen storage can't just keep increasing indefinitely. And at some point the glycogen storage is max.

448
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:20,690
You can see here now there's not even any more glycogen storage from this point on.

449
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:24,889
So now most of those excess carbohydrates end up as lipids, right?

450
00:47:24,890 --> 00:47:29,900
So they end up in excess lipids. Right. So that's through a process of the noble of a genesis.

451
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:34,600
And amelioration of lipolysis, which we'll talk about in the next year.

452
00:47:34,790 --> 00:47:38,769
Right. So that's what would happen with the carbohydrate overfeeding. As first you make, you try to oxidize it.

453
00:47:38,770 --> 00:47:45,040
Once you kind of max out the oxidation, then you sort it's glycogen. Once you start that, then you end up with an equilibrium storage.

454
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:49,330
If we look at this under like a slightly different time course here,

455
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:55,360
there's this phenomena that people have known in the athletic world for like 20 or 30 years of glycogen super compensation.

456
00:47:55,510 --> 00:48:01,820
So what that means is if you start with glycogen, just there's a lot going on here, but focus just on the salt.

457
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:06,610
The white circles here is that you exercising depletion like any rice, you undergo some exercise.

458
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:08,390
Your glycogen goes, goes way, way down.

459
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:15,010
When you come back, when you need food or you recover, you actually recover above what you had in the first place.

460
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:19,330
You started off at 100%. You depleted it and then you recover past 100%.

461
00:48:19,690 --> 00:48:25,750
Right? You recover beyond what you need. Now, of course, you might be like, Hey, Dave, tell me some biochemistry about this.

462
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:29,920
And what that is, is you notice in all of the regulatory things we talked about glycogen,

463
00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:35,470
there was no negative feedback, there was no were glycogen said feedback stopped glycogen synthesis, right?

464
00:48:35,470 --> 00:48:40,360
Like in a lot of the enzyme pathways we talk about, there's some product that feeds back and inhibits the synthesis,

465
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:45,429
but there was no there's lots of glycogen here feedback and inhibited glycogen feedback in at

466
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:51,300
least the skeletal muscle is largely just based on having no more space forth like right.

467
00:48:51,310 --> 00:48:52,870
So it's like a space restriction.

468
00:48:53,050 --> 00:48:58,390
It's not that there's sensing of glycogen at least that we know of sensing of glycogen levels that tells us to decrease.

469
00:48:58,570 --> 00:49:03,820
So that's why it looks like what happens is you make more glycogen and then then you start with, right?

470
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:10,180
So people come here to here, you know, 20% were glycogen. And if you were doing some exercise, it requires you have more glycogen in your muscle.

471
00:49:10,390 --> 00:49:15,610
That seems like a good idea. Now, interestingly, that does not happen in the right.

472
00:49:15,610 --> 00:49:21,470
So the liver at some point just releases that extra glucose and doesn't oversaw glycogen.

473
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:27,280
So there's no super compensation in the liver, there's only super compensation in in the muscle.

474
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:31,630
But the reason I brought this figure out, which is a newer version of the figure that people know for a long time,

475
00:49:31,810 --> 00:49:36,370
is they also, in this case, looked in the brain and actually does turn out you can super compensate in the brain as well.

476
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:36,630
Right.

477
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:41,709
So if you're looking for having worked like a junior brain because maybe there's like a midterm coming up, this is something you could potentially do.

478
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:46,300
I have no data that this improves midterm forms at all. But you do get this super compensation.

479
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:51,010
And people have been really interested in the super compensation as a training adaptation for a really long time.

480
00:49:51,010 --> 00:49:57,940
And so we'll talk about this again after the food of the day. But the idea here is you start off with some glycogen depleting exercise activity.

481
00:49:58,010 --> 00:50:01,930
You do something that is going to focus on burning glucose and glycogen.

482
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:06,850
Usually that's some sort of very high intensity exercise which oxidizes glucose pretty effectively.

483
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:12,730
Then you like rest and you eat a lot of carbohydrates. So you need very, very large meals and you try to relax as much as possible.

484
00:50:13,030 --> 00:50:18,070
And then 24 to 48 hours when your glycogen levels are much higher than they were at the beginning,

485
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:21,849
not you go off and exercise and now you've got more energy in it, right?

486
00:50:21,850 --> 00:50:26,350
So that's the idea that I'm sure probably anybody who's ever run cross-country has heard of the idea of carb loading.

487
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:32,590
Right. But remember, this happens over the course of days. So people who just get up in the morning, a huge plate of pasta, it's not as effective.

488
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:39,040
You have to deplete first and then you overcompensate as opposed to just depleting and then and then building back up.

489
00:50:39,730 --> 00:50:53,720
Okay. One down for today's food of the day, which is one way that you might want to increase your high carbohydrate meals, which is what might happen.

490
00:51:01,990 --> 00:51:15,000
Yeah. Hi, my name is Yanjing and today I'll be thinking about that on the radio and to the content.

491
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,290
I'm here as a stand up guy today for it.

492
00:51:18,310 --> 00:51:24,630
I think I'll do like a short introduction about video and some nutritional fact about it,

493
00:51:25,170 --> 00:51:32,160
and I'll also introduce some commonly off competition and some health claims that is prevalent and on the Internet.

494
00:51:32,670 --> 00:51:41,310
I will also go through a systematic review article on think potentially, in fact, potato on hypoglycemia and also dyslipidemia.

495
00:51:41,670 --> 00:51:49,710
And lastly, I will share about my favorite symptom. You don't make anything yet for your information, I'm actually from Malaysia, so yeah.

496
00:51:51,900 --> 00:52:00,080
So Potato and its scientific name is from Out of the Shadows and it actually belongs to the morning glory.

497
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:09,870
Natalie this is not the sweet potato doesn't come from like a Natalie, although they have to be like, you know what?

498
00:52:09,890 --> 00:52:17,550
They're not see. And it is actually a very starchy and you're very rich use as a root vegetable.

499
00:52:17,910 --> 00:52:22,770
And one interesting that is like the least of these different you know,

500
00:52:22,770 --> 00:52:33,120
it is actually quite new consumed in Asia as vegetables and the picture below is naturally one of my favorite dish like stir fries that,

501
00:52:33,390 --> 00:52:39,840
you know, was back in the home. And some history about movement.

502
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:47,740
You know, it's actually native to central and also certain America where like it's topical.

503
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:56,560
And it was widespread to the other region when Columbus came here in like 1492.

504
00:52:56,950 --> 00:53:03,060
And after that, it was introduced to like Western, you know, and Western like the Western European world,

505
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:09,130
where they're like, pass it down to like South Asia, Southeast India, India and other places.

506
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:20,440
And one point about depicting it as it actually produced more pounds of food per acre compared to any cultivated plant,

507
00:53:20,710 --> 00:53:31,360
that was also one of the main reason why it was so prevalent during like World War Two in Asia, where rice production decreased a lot.

508
00:53:31,510 --> 00:53:38,710
And something happens. But they replaced it, you know, with rice because, you know, it was easily grown.

509
00:53:39,010 --> 00:53:48,770
And I still remember like when I was young, my grandparents will always share with me that during World War II, they actually consume a lot of potato.

510
00:53:49,270 --> 00:53:58,280
Yeah. This is turning out to be 98 and in Asia, and it's actually most impressive.

511
00:53:58,590 --> 00:54:03,540
You know, as for news in Asia, it's around like 63% of the whole world.

512
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:09,720
And particularly like China is the main producer of like Sweet Potato.

513
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:13,500
It produced like 49 million tons of.

514
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:15,380
You know, and then think.

515
00:54:17,670 --> 00:54:25,810
And there's a lot of varieties and growth areas like orange, green with orange, whereas redskin with orange went yellow skinned with white,

516
00:54:25,830 --> 00:54:27,870
black and then purple to begin with like white, black,

517
00:54:28,110 --> 00:54:36,450
purple and with different colors of it actually contains all different antioxidants, fertilizer, flashlight.

518
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:42,150
And it was important to have like higher levels of phenolic compounds and the more

519
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:47,760
intense yellow one is associated with higher carotenoids like method carotene.

520
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:58,950
And the yellow and orange flesh are rich in like the holy assets, while the purple ones is very high in like for one night, the antioxidants.

521
00:54:59,190 --> 00:55:08,430
And with all this antioxidants, it actually play a very important role in the health and when I clean in the Internet.

522
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:14,980
And one thing that very interesting when I came to America, when I went to grocery shopping,

523
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:20,690
I saw something like it looks like some potato to me that like it was legal.

524
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:30,560
And I graduated, learned that like in the U.S., sometimes a grocery shop will label sweet potato as yes, but actually say potato and young.

525
00:55:30,610 --> 00:55:39,040
They are not the same yam as actually originated from Africa where like sweet potato is from like South or Central America.

526
00:55:39,310 --> 00:55:43,270
And Yemen is like more starchy, more neutral flavor.

527
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:47,590
And it's not really what local in U.S. grocery store.

528
00:55:47,890 --> 00:55:54,040
So it was something that really mindblowing to me when I look at a potato label, I think.

529
00:55:56,100 --> 00:56:01,910
Here are some nutritional facts about soup. Know the ground.

530
00:56:01,950 --> 00:56:08,070
I think it's a little bit small, but proportionally that portion is like 100 grams of it.

531
00:56:08,310 --> 00:56:16,620
101 of stick potato actually contains 1986 kilocalories with 2020 around 30

532
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:24,150
grams of carbohydrates 1.57 grams of protein and a very small amount of that.

533
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:31,320
And of course, they know because it's tasty it actually contains like.

534
00:56:31,470 --> 00:56:37,800
Word around program of total sugar in which like around three grams comes from sucrose,

535
00:56:38,010 --> 00:56:44,730
which also explains why they actually think it's sweeter compared to like potatoes.

536
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:52,500
And one thing that I want to highlight is the better carotene and also vitamin E content in potatoes.

537
00:56:53,310 --> 00:57:06,030
For second, they actually contain like 8500 micrograms of white matter carotene, which is more than like paragraph per gram of carrots.

538
00:57:06,390 --> 00:57:14,010
So now of carrots is around like 82,000, 8200 micrograms carotene.

539
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:20,040
And because of this high beta carotene and also vitamin E content on that potato,

540
00:57:20,490 --> 00:57:29,640
it also leads to the health impacts that play by the Internet and also other reason Chinese studies also support it, which will be explained later.

541
00:57:32,010 --> 00:57:36,720
Yeah. And some of the common ways of preparation.

542
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:59,400
It's about. You know, some of the variation of potato, you know, like steaming, boiling, roasting, frying, really stir fry needs doing.

543
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:03,870
They simply like it can be prepared in any creative way.

544
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:14,610
And interestingly, I think in South Asia, it's really prevalent for done using that potato to cook like curries and stuff like that.

545
00:58:15,570 --> 00:58:23,190
Yeah. These are no different held frames of superhero that I found when I was searching through the Internet.

546
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:32,610
And Chris, I mean, it included like lowering the rays of cancer, controlling the blood sugar, lowering the bad cholesterol,

547
00:58:33,030 --> 00:58:38,460
protecting our eyes, and also reducing inflammation which might be beneficial for weight loss.

548
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:44,790
But because of our larger focus on carbohydrates, so my study, I mean,

549
00:58:44,790 --> 00:58:51,240
the study that I will be going through the book is on like how sweet potato help to control our blood sugar.

550
00:58:52,710 --> 00:59:03,120
So I when I was studying about the study of the potential effects of, say, potato in hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia,

551
00:59:03,510 --> 00:59:11,460
if you don't know what this is, it is actually a condition of high blood lipid in your body.

552
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:18,920
Yeah. And it is actually a systematic review that summarized the signaling mechanism,

553
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:24,120
mechanism of action and also by the constituents responsible for the activities of the

554
00:59:24,150 --> 00:59:31,020
data in treating like hypoglycemic glycemia based on in vitro and in vivo studies,

555
00:59:31,230 --> 00:59:36,450
which means that the studies they go through are mostly done on animals or on cells.

556
00:59:38,710 --> 00:59:50,050
Here are the methods some like the studies they actually after selecting this study was actually reviewing around 23 studies.

557
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:59,240
So I also included a few slides of your results, which brings to your conclusion.

558
01:00:00,580 --> 01:00:12,790
So potato is in fact effective as an anti hypoglycemic agent and as early as like six days after treating diabetic rats with zinc potato extract,

559
01:00:13,090 --> 01:00:22,810
they are we can see that, in fact, of how you extract can lower the blood glucose in the mice.

560
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:26,610
And after 28 days of continuous treatment with, you know,

561
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:34,090
extract and it's considered like an ideal duration for the extract to estimate a maximum level of decay.

562
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:40,990
And experimental studies conducted for like more than ten days also observed

563
01:00:40,990 --> 01:00:46,510
that there was like regeneration of beta that are cell switches like that.

564
01:00:47,590 --> 01:00:51,670
So that responsible is responsible to produce insulin.

565
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:55,210
And regardless of the method of extraction,

566
01:00:55,450 --> 01:01:03,670
potato extract are able to reduce plasma glucose level related to protein and also increase the level of insulin.

567
01:01:05,590 --> 01:01:15,610
Potato is also a regulator in vision and they found that 0.3 millimeter Aquis extraction

568
01:01:15,610 --> 01:01:21,720
is actually enough to disclose that underlying mechanism of regulating density.

569
01:01:21,790 --> 01:01:27,699
And in my study and there was also a decreased double of Paraguay Cigarets was a

570
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:33,220
cholesterol and what wasn't in plasma while the level of yellow starts to rise over time.

571
01:01:33,670 --> 01:01:38,530
And if you're wondering like why is it bring this effect?

572
01:01:40,750 --> 01:01:43,840
And from what I read in the article,

573
01:01:44,110 --> 01:01:56,110
it was mentioned because there was not much evidence like support the underlying signaling mechanism for the whole regulation,

574
01:01:56,410 --> 01:02:02,830
but it's potentially due to like because potato contains like bioactive compounds like

575
01:02:03,130 --> 01:02:09,459
love Benoit plus 13 and polyphenols that are able to suppress different accumulation.

576
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:23,870
What to the downregulation of like with Jimmy Lee and and because of the activities of this bioactive compounds that leads to how they like.

577
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:36,050
Right. The reactive oxygen species that gradually brings to the increase of insulin production.

578
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:43,160
But it is a very complicated mechanism which I don't really understand.

579
01:02:43,170 --> 01:02:50,570
So yeah. Now I will also share some of my favorite sweet potatoes nights or desserts in Malaysia.

580
01:02:51,230 --> 01:02:54,230
The first one is actually the fried sweet potato.

581
01:02:54,710 --> 01:03:00,770
It is actually coated with my fingers and then it's fine and it is very good when certainly not.

582
01:03:02,300 --> 01:03:11,300
The other one is called potato balls or pyro balls and it is actually a shaved ice and plays with different toppings.

583
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:15,770
And the taro or sea balls is one of the companies.

584
01:03:16,070 --> 01:03:23,840
And the potato balls is made with mashed potato mixed with different starch like potatoes.

585
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:27,799
Not to make it very chewy. It's really nice.

586
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:33,680
And especially Malaysia is like a tropical country with no winter and only summer the whole year.

587
01:03:35,150 --> 01:03:39,220
And lastly, it's the soup. What Ginger?

588
01:03:39,230 --> 01:03:43,490
It's actually just a potato ball with like sugar water and some ginger on it.

589
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:46,850
It's super warm when during winter.

590
01:03:46,850 --> 01:03:53,900
But Malaysia doesn't have winter and it will be a nice change to happen and very it's it's already super cold now.

591
01:03:54,140 --> 01:03:59,240
Yeah. Yeah. And here is some reference for my presentation.

592
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:07,910
Thank you. I will invite some questions from you.

593
01:04:11,530 --> 01:04:17,620
You said that like up to 28 days and mouse models like with that.

594
01:04:18,130 --> 01:04:24,940
You know what that would equate to like within like human years I guess 28 days like a year of sweet potato extract.

595
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:32,490
Yeah. For that study because like it is actually from sympathy extract.

596
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:41,530
So I don't, I don't think they study about how many like human use equivalent.

597
01:04:41,890 --> 01:04:55,200
So. Yeah, not really. Yeah. So you have mentioned being in the House claim of the sweet potato.

598
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:59,250
That potato is relative to protecting our I house.

599
01:04:59,550 --> 01:05:04,560
So I want to know, how does this work? Is this just because there are many?

600
01:05:04,940 --> 01:05:09,720
Where to me, Azi, this week? I don't know. Why not?

601
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:16,350
The main reason is because the back of your table continues to work because like I does that so many different

602
01:05:16,350 --> 01:05:25,560
things and I think there is a lot of like oxidative stress because off the beaten track and stuff like that.

603
01:05:25,950 --> 01:05:29,210
That's why I like the I mean, the carotenoids.

604
01:05:29,220 --> 01:05:38,490
They they they are good antioxidant which help to do you need to sort of take the eyes.

605
01:05:38,820 --> 01:05:42,090
From my understanding. Yeah. Thank you.

606
01:05:45,030 --> 01:05:48,390
I also have a question regarding the 28 day experiment.

607
01:05:48,750 --> 01:05:59,489
So if we want to like lower our glycemia, can we just eat sweet potatoes more often in our diet to achieve that?

608
01:05:59,490 --> 01:06:09,660
Or just or like we have to eat like sweet potato extract supplements because more difficult to extract and for deeper study,

609
01:06:09,660 --> 01:06:14,580
they are actually interested in the different antioxidants and psychosocial data.

610
01:06:14,910 --> 01:06:23,220
But I also mentioned like that these human studies there are also very, very, very little human studies on this.

611
01:06:23,730 --> 01:06:28,230
But the human study showed that people who have hey, I mean,

612
01:06:28,230 --> 01:06:37,920
they eat potato with plates of rice because it was a study that was done in Taiwan where it rises like there's people who those subjects once

613
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:48,690
show they have decreased blood glycemia while also reduce weight compared to the control group because it's a randomized control study.

614
01:06:49,230 --> 01:06:53,460
Yeah. Thank you very.

615
01:06:56,390 --> 01:07:21,830
Q So. It's not like it's going to be barely, barely like in school.

616
01:07:24,230 --> 01:07:31,400
Okay. So I want to finish off with just a little bit more about glycogen and and things like that.

617
01:07:32,750 --> 01:07:38,540
So I guess one thing I want to sort of start with is we know for quite a lot of time that if you bury the

618
01:07:38,540 --> 01:07:46,100
intensity of any kind of physical activity and the types of macronutrients we burn are changed quite a bit.

619
01:07:46,490 --> 01:07:50,360
So if you've ever been on the treadmill and you select the abundance, I think that's pretty good.

620
01:07:50,510 --> 01:07:56,240
All that's basically telling you is like run really slowly. And then if it says energy earning zone, it might say run away.

621
01:07:56,750 --> 01:08:01,190
So if you look at the oxidation levels of these active nutrients, you can see that low intensity.

622
01:08:01,190 --> 01:08:07,490
So 25%, which is sort of like the proxy for that is like normal for you can kind of be like basically forever.

623
01:08:07,730 --> 01:08:10,000
You're burning primarily free fatty acids.

624
01:08:10,010 --> 01:08:16,070
Once you've sort of gotten moving and gotten warmed up, you can see almost all your energy is coming from from fatty acids.

625
01:08:16,430 --> 01:08:25,490
But as you increase the intensity of your exercise, the proportion that you're burning of very acid, somewhat paradoxically, might to decrease racing.

626
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:32,620
So you're burning with less fatty acids as you go on. And now you're using far more far more glucose and glycogen.

627
01:08:32,930 --> 01:08:36,530
So the exact reasons for this are known.

628
01:08:36,530 --> 01:08:41,180
But I'm not going to get into until we get to fatty acid oxidation. So I'll come back to the slide in in like three weeks.

629
01:08:41,690 --> 01:08:48,220
But the idea is as you increase your activity, you're, you're earning this like less fat burning zone.

630
01:08:48,230 --> 01:08:51,530
So people will go on a treadmill and be like, well, I want to lose that. That sounds good.

631
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:57,200
It's almost been like the fat burning zone. So do you think that working out here would make you lose more weight than working out here?

632
01:09:01,010 --> 01:09:05,180
Lose weight, produce more effects, lose more.

633
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:16,110
Let's say I'm. Low intensity, steady state would cause more bad.

634
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:23,500
Maybe more intense training helps you lose more weight just because it's more calorie burn and probably more water loss.

635
01:09:24,620 --> 01:09:29,220
Okay. So I think I agree with I agree with pretty much almost everything, Senator.

636
01:09:29,340 --> 01:09:37,630
Yeah. I would say at the lower intensity, the first one side overall is also higher intensity.

637
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:43,780
I mean, depends on how long you work out. You're going to be building more muscle mass and muscle mass weighs more than that.

638
01:09:43,780 --> 01:09:53,930
So if you're going for like overall weight loss, like that's not the way to go if you want to not lose more than 2%.

639
01:09:55,550 --> 01:10:04,580
Okay. So I think we have one for all three now. But I do I do like your your let's just say the middle thing that seems like it seems like all of

640
01:10:04,580 --> 01:10:12,380
the above seems like a good answer is we also have you thought about this was like VO2 max like.

641
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:24,650
Weightlifting like produce like gives you a higher muscle mass and lean body like lean body mass burns more calories like more effectively.

642
01:10:24,980 --> 01:10:32,580
It's like depending on like the type of beyond two max activity that you're doing, it can also have higher that.

643
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:37,550
Break it down like if you're doing like walking versus weak.

644
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:42,290
Right. Yeah. So I think that I think that's both your point. I think that's that's a reasonable thing.

645
01:10:42,290 --> 01:10:44,929
Right. So if you're doing a reasonable all of the time of this training,

646
01:10:44,930 --> 01:10:50,569
if you're doing a reasonable amount of of sort of body recomposition and you've got much more lean mass, then that would help some healthy people.

647
01:10:50,570 --> 01:10:56,209
I think and we'll talk about this a lot more. People tend to like wildly overstate how much that matters because it turns out like

648
01:10:56,210 --> 01:11:01,190
putting on like a kilogram of muscle mass is like very difficult in a very long time.

649
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:04,970
And that one kilo will increase your energy expenditure by like 70 calories.

650
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:09,980
Right. So like it's kind of indistinguishable from from say, just being a regular physical activity.

651
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:17,300
Okay. So the answer to that, which is a bit of a trick question, is, what do you mean by burning fat?

652
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:20,900
Right. So unambiguously, if you do this, you're burning more calories.

653
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:24,800
And if you're burning calories, you're burning fat. That's going to happen no matter what.

654
01:11:24,830 --> 01:11:31,459
Right. So if you get these three, this one is burning two and a half times more calories than the low intensity per per unit time.

655
01:11:31,460 --> 01:11:34,880
And of course, you can't do 85% activity for the same amount of time.

656
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:40,730
But if you could, you would burn more calories and you lose weight by burning calories in the period you do not lose weight by burning fat.

657
01:11:40,910 --> 01:11:44,180
It may seem like you would lose weight by burning fat, but you actually don't. You do it by burning calories.

658
01:11:44,390 --> 01:11:46,280
Now, part of that might be fat, might be helpful or not,

659
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:52,580
but the only way you could lose fat selectively here is if you did that for a long enough time that eventually you would deplete your glycogen, right?

660
01:11:52,730 --> 01:11:57,470
So all the other points that people made of like when you do this, you're going to lose a little bit of water way is fine.

661
01:11:57,620 --> 01:12:01,280
You actually generally if you're doing high intensity training,

662
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:05,330
you generally will not build much muscle mass because there's such a high cortisol response.

663
01:12:05,330 --> 01:12:10,129
When you do high intensity training, that that cortisol response will actually degrade your muscle pretty rapidly.

664
01:12:10,130 --> 01:12:14,120
So if you do like long term high intensity training without sort of low intensity training,

665
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:21,920
you get you end up getting muscle loss generally more muscle, which is fine because most people can't do more than 10 minutes at a time.

666
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:27,770
Okay. So what this is sort of led to is sort of a combination theory,

667
01:12:27,770 --> 01:12:33,049
this sort of model that people come up with the last five or ten years, which is this idea period of training.

668
01:12:33,050 --> 01:12:46,640
So we know that if you are doing exercise, especially very low intensity exercise like this, like like this, you're burning more exclusively fat.

669
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:49,110
Right? And so even though that's not going to just like cause you lose weight,

670
01:12:49,110 --> 01:12:53,630
cause you're not necessarily more of a calorie deficit, you're actually become more efficient over time, burning fat.

671
01:12:53,690 --> 01:12:58,820
Right. And so people know this as they train for a long distance thing if you want to train yourself to be able to use that more efficiently.

672
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:05,540
So if you train under conditions where you're fasted and you're doing relatively low intensity training where you're not engaging your glycogen,

673
01:13:05,750 --> 01:13:08,310
that causes all sorts of adaptations in your muscle,

674
01:13:08,330 --> 01:13:13,130
your mitochondria that are going to say increased mitochondria, biogenesis and fatty acid transport,

675
01:13:13,730 --> 01:13:17,570
and then upregulate things like your TCA cycle, also things like antioxidants.

676
01:13:17,570 --> 01:13:21,380
So those are all the induced if you do this low intensity training thing.

677
01:13:21,470 --> 01:13:25,970
But that actually generally doesn't help that much in terms of in terms of your

678
01:13:25,970 --> 01:13:29,690
to Max right deal to Max is like how much when you're at a very high intensity.

679
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:32,690
So the idea is you do this when you first wake up,

680
01:13:32,690 --> 01:13:37,249
you do this low intensity exercise and then you eat a whole bunch of carbohydrates, you build up your glycogen.

681
01:13:37,250 --> 01:13:42,530
So now you're doing sort of a glycogen super compensation thing here, and then you do your high intensity training,

682
01:13:42,530 --> 01:13:45,830
which is going to be at a higher VO2 max, which is where you're using the glycogen.

683
01:13:47,330 --> 01:13:52,549
You do that sort of in the afternoon. And then since you've done this high intensity exercise where you've burned all this glycogen,

684
01:13:52,550 --> 01:13:56,600
now you're back down to your depleted glycogen storage thing and you repeat this cycle.

685
01:13:56,600 --> 01:14:05,230
So there's this model here which, which, like I said, is kind of becoming more popular is this thing called sleep low train hop.

686
01:14:05,390 --> 01:14:09,830
So it gives you your high training when you have lots and lots of glycogen because that gives you the best performance.

687
01:14:09,950 --> 01:14:14,960
But then you try to also a lot of low intensity training where you are anti glycogen depleted state.

688
01:14:15,140 --> 01:14:21,320
So there isn't been a ton of studies on this since it was kind of first proposed maybe four or five years ago.

689
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:25,250
But this is just one example study here. So you can see there was a31 ten period.

690
01:14:25,250 --> 01:14:30,440
This is all based on cycling and then people were randomized small number of people into

691
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:35,509
either the high carbohydrate or the low carbohydrate diet intervention before they did thing.

692
01:14:35,510 --> 01:14:41,569
And you can see that the ten day time decrease for the sleep load group and it was basically study these are these are

693
01:14:41,570 --> 01:14:47,840
already trained athletes here so the idea here is trying to leverage using glycogen when you need to use glycogen,

694
01:14:48,350 --> 01:14:51,740
right. So when you want to do something that's high intensity, have as much glycogen and possible,

695
01:14:51,890 --> 01:14:57,960
but then do most of your training at as low glycogen level as possible because then you're optimizing your fat tissue.

696
01:14:58,100 --> 01:15:04,219
And so usually these sorts of things, the studies are actually a little bit behind sort of performance athletics.

697
01:15:04,220 --> 01:15:08,700
So my guess is this is probably used more in performance athletics even though the studies are are pretty small pre.

698
01:15:10,280 --> 01:15:18,139
Okay. So that's all I have for you guys today, just like I said. Wednesday with a couple of just remembered things.

699
01:15:18,140 --> 01:15:19,700
You want to make sure we cover the word recession.

700
01:15:20,930 --> 01:15:27,440
And if you're interested in doing peer review on either today's presentation of sweet potato or if you remember life in prison thinking on race,

701
01:15:27,650 --> 01:15:31,130
their due diligence will be last weekend.

702
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:36,380
This is what I have to say.

703
01:15:38,870 --> 01:15:39,190
Yeah.
