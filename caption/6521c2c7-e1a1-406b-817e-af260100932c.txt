1
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:10,420
The hope is that the research will be translated into clinical trials and then into practice.

2
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:24,160
And I talked about how one particular strategy with using peanut flour was being used to treat kids and adults who had peanut allergies.

3
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:36,490
And today we're going to be talking about its effectiveness. So this was a meta analysis and this is different from some of the studies you've seen.

4
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:44,980
And it was published three years ago, and the results are really interesting.

5
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:49,120
So let's just start and get into this.

6
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:53,650
We've already talked quite a bit about food allergy the last time that we met.

7
00:00:55,330 --> 00:01:01,840
And the first question is, you know, how how common or food are food allergies, peanut allergies in particular?

8
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:11,790
Anybody. Anybody is there and is there in the paper. Yeah.

9
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:17,220
I had one of my students and children. 1% of the middle and high income.

10
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:22,840
Yeah. Yeah. And you'll see different numbers for these estimates.

11
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:29,770
These are estimates. So we had a bigger number before, you know, from, from that particular website that I gave you.

12
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:33,880
And then this paper gave you other statistics. More than 6 million.

13
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:40,179
8% of children. 2 to 3% of adults. In this paper I gave you had different statistics.

14
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:49,720
And these are estimates, and that's why there's some variability here. Um, so in terms of, um, uh, can you outgrow food allergies?

15
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:56,750
So that's something that happens and you can, but it's not across.

16
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:01,300
All right. It's right. It's more with what kind of foods.

17
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:07,870
Eggs? Yeah. Eggs and dairy are more common. The kids, a lot of them by ages five and ten years of age.

18
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:12,990
So you don't have to worry so much because as you can imagine, milk is all over the schools.

19
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,050
I mean, it's part of what's given to them in the school lunch program.

20
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,300
So the kids usually after it when they get to that age.

21
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:31,209
Peanut allergies, in contrast, are lifelong in most cases, 80 to 85% cases.

22
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:36,850
If you had a peanut allergy as a child, it will persist throughout adulthood.

23
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:44,050
Yeah. Have there been any studies where they've compared people who've have grown out of the peanut allergies in person to those who haven't?

24
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:50,499
I'm not aware of that, but it would be interesting to see why they're different and what's going on there,

25
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:55,900
whether or not their allergy was less symptomatic than people who have lifelong allergies.

26
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:06,190
But that's a good question. I'm not sure. So here's some more information about food allergies.

27
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,489
And this is a food allergy study. Here are the results.

28
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:21,080
And this was done in schools. So this is a survey of 204 schools and students with food allergies is about one in 12 or 8%.

29
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:23,300
You know, that's where the number comes from.

30
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:29,950
And then they looked in regions of the country in terms of where this food allergies were most prevalent.

31
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:36,710
And the numbers are pretty even across the board. If anything, the higher highest prevalence is in the Northeast.

32
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:40,310
And nine and a half percent. The others are around eight. Yeah.

33
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:48,800
Abbie, I always wonder if that's because there's a link with a shellfish allergy, like, since there's so much.

34
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:54,700
Looks like a lobster consumes like a phone. He's going back to prison.

35
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,210
Possibly. I'm not. I'm not certain about that, though.

36
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:11,110
If you do see still peanuts and tree nuts in this survey being the most prevalent forms of food allergy mentioned, some uncertain about that.

37
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:26,740
But this gives you a more complete list of allergens that the people in school said that they were allergic to and people who had one food allergy.

38
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:35,380
The people of those who had a food allergy, 32% of them said they had more than one food allergy.

39
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:40,820
So just because you remove something from their presence doesn't mean they're going to react.

40
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:48,430
And as I mentioned earlier, reactions to food allergens happen quite frequently in the school setting.

41
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:58,809
So here's all of the different things I've heard about reactions to sulfites and sesame,

42
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:02,020
which you don't hear a whole lot about, but I didn't realize it.

43
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:06,280
Some people are allergic to mustard, so that really, really surprised me.

44
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:17,610
That was an interesting finding because when you go to a restaurant, that's like the standard thing that they have on the table, right?

45
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,860
Ketchup, mustard and maybe some other things and so on.

46
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:27,430
So anyhow, I thought this was interesting in terms of looking at this demographic in another way.

47
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:31,299
All right. So a next question.

48
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:36,550
What is allergen immunotherapy and how is this approach used in people with peanut allergies?

49
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:47,380
It is the repeated exposure to um to a certain allergen and just increasing the dosage.

50
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:52,000
Yeah. So the idea here is to desensitize them.

51
00:05:52,870 --> 00:06:02,770
So you give them a little bit of the allergen and it's hope that you develop a different kind of immune response to this kind of allergen.

52
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:11,350
And you hope that by giving them a certain dose that you reach over a long period of time,

53
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:17,770
that it desensitizes them, so that when they encounter that antigen, again, it doesn't provoke a response.

54
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:23,750
And so this is the the overall framework.

55
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:27,790
Here's the graph. So oral immunotherapy for food allergy,

56
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:38,680
you have dose in the Y axis and initial escalation in time on the X axis and the time at which you desensitize

57
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:48,040
somebody to a particular allergy and can be they can be given a dose of a particular antigen from food for,

58
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:53,500
you know, one time every other week or every week or so on, up to a year or longer.

59
00:06:54,160 --> 00:07:04,600
And you build up the dose and then you give them a maintenance dose and then to test to see if that food would provoke an allergic response.

60
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,680
You do a challenge.

61
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:15,550
And then after that challenge, you would watch somebody very closely and then take blood samples and to determine if there were biomarkers of allergy.

62
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:22,660
And this is what's typically good done to assess the effectiveness of these types of approaches.

63
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:32,559
So initially you have somebody who qualifies for this therapy and their food allergic

64
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,210
profile is that they're clinically reactive to milligram doses of the allergen.

65
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:41,680
If you were to do a skin prick test, you show that it's positive.

66
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:49,030
So I showed you a picture of the the welts on that person's back so they would be positive.

67
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:58,149
So that another thing that is part of the profile and then they have these antigen specific basic build granulation.

68
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:09,100
So if you take a blood sample and you take the basic pills out of that blood sample and you expose it to an antigen found in the food.

69
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:17,380
And if those basically do granulation, this is an indication of the having a food allergy, you get the particular antigen.

70
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:22,809
You might also find high levels of IgG that are specific to a particular antigen,

71
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:31,470
and there's tests that you can do for that in low specific IgG and IGG igg4.

72
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:40,210
I'll describe in detail what that why that's significant here in a moment and then to the biased responses.

73
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:45,250
So if you remember a few response was an immune response.

74
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:57,820
That is the basis for allergy where you have cells that are being produced that direct their attack against a food antigen instead of a pathogen.

75
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:04,240
And then after the therapy, after the oral immunotherapy treatment,

76
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:18,070
that person is supposed to be desensitize to the antigen and that you it takes a much higher dose of that particular antigen to provoke a response.

77
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:23,680
And then if you do a skin prick test or the basic felt test,

78
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:30,340
you'll notice that the responses have declined or it takes a higher dose to get the same response.

79
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:39,130
You'll have lower levels of antigen specific IgG and you'll have increased levels of IgG and

80
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:48,490
Igg4 than the amount of two cytokines will decrease and another type of cell type will appear.

81
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:54,310
This is the T regulatory cell. We'll talk about that here in a second.

82
00:09:54,910 --> 00:10:02,830
So here's the profile and food allergy. You have a t h to dominant response.

83
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:08,980
And again, this is the dominant t cell repertoire,

84
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:21,160
I should say t cell pathway in in young children where you have th2 cells that produce these cytokines that provoke these type of responses.

85
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:27,760
So you've got two cells telling the bone marrow to make more eosinophils.

86
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:32,079
You've got THQ cells secreting these cytokines.

87
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:38,020
So that's five pathway. You've got to cells secreting these.

88
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:49,560
Cytokines which enhance their B cells ability to produce IGG and when mast cells are coated with this IgG that specific for an allergen.

89
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,570
They do granulation. And these are all over the tissues in your body.

90
00:10:55,590 --> 00:11:03,900
The Senate bills are circulating in your blood. You also have basic bills that are circulating in your blood that can do granulation as well.

91
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:12,000
And then you have in some circumstances like in the lung, you have more mucus producing cells.

92
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:15,960
So that's part of this two cell response as well.

93
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:26,790
You get more mucosal hyperplasia within the airways that they can make more mucus when you're exposed to an allergen.

94
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:47,130
And then after immunotherapy, what happens is you have a subset of the genetic cells now that are challenged with a particular antigen,

95
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:51,510
and this changes the immune profile.

96
00:11:52,920 --> 00:12:14,129
So these DC subsets have a profile now that shifts from ath2 to ath1 type of a response so that this t h this T cell now produces interferon gamma.

97
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:23,340
And the interferon gamma is thought to inhibit the ability of the t cell to make these cytokines to provoke an allergic response.

98
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:31,980
Another type of T cell that appears after this desensitization period is a T regulatory cell,

99
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:42,120
and that T regulatory cell secrete cytokines that can also inhibit the ability of the T to cell to make these two cytokines.

100
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:48,270
And that's IL ten and the AL ten making.

101
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:52,200
Here's the cartoon about what the IL ten does.

102
00:12:52,530 --> 00:13:01,620
So here's the T regulatory cell after its exposure to that dendritic cell that's been desensitized to the antigen,

103
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:12,210
the B cell instead of making it, it's making it T A.G. four And when mast cells are coated with IGE 84,

104
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:24,480
they don't produce they don't release the granules there, that this causes a different kind of an immune response,

105
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:32,520
that it takes a higher concentration of food allergy to provoke an inflammatory response.

106
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,370
So this is the theory behind an oral immune tolerance therapy.

107
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:53,040
So you would ingest small amounts of protein powder and or I should say, antigen or in the case of peanut allergies, peanut flour.

108
00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:00,780
And some of the studies mentioned in the meta analysis weren't ingestion, they were sublingual.

109
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:11,700
So you would take a little bit of that peanut antigen and put it underneath your tongue, and that would supposedly do the same thing.

110
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,880
So this is a different paper than what you've seen so far.

111
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,990
So what's the meta analysis and how is it different than other research papers?

112
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:30,640
It's where a group will look at multiple papers that are all about.

113
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:36,150
Talk about the explain. Yeah.

114
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:40,410
So it's a group of primary studies that are included in the analysis.

115
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:53,610
So how important is it to collect studies that have similar experimental designs and experimental approaches?

116
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:58,650
I think it could be a way to. What?

117
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:05,000
It's not going well. Yeah, but what else?

118
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:08,190
What else do you need to have to draw those conclusions.

119
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:14,250
Yeah, right. Yeah. I think you need to have like low that their unity.

120
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:19,010
So when you remove that you're able to compare them actually.

121
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:24,690
Absolutely. They need to be kind of standardize with very similar endpoints,

122
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:32,370
very similar subject populations and preferably large populations with a diverse group of participants.

123
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:44,630
Okay. So to do that, you have to have some kind of a way to collect the studies, right?

124
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:48,980
So how did they do that? How did they collect the studies for this meta analysis?

125
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,890
Go ahead with searching databases?

126
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:02,380
Quite a few of them. Yeah, it was specifically for random controlled trials,

127
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:07,839
comparing the oral therapy to their to see those who are just allergenic of

128
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:12,700
what you specifically peanut allergies in this case and then the eligibility

129
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:23,500
eligibility analysis for studies that were the wrong type have the wrong intention or other inappropriate formats and ended up with 12 trials.

130
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:35,350
Yeah. So they had a fairly robust means to discriminate between studies that were would fit well within this analysis and those that weren't.

131
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:40,900
So they have 12 trials included in 16 records.

132
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:45,340
Why is there a different number there? But does that mean 12 trials and 16 records?

133
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:55,900
Means that there was a trial or two that had, like a complicated publication, I think.

134
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:04,720
Right. Yeah. So the clinical trials will be published, you know, online and find the trials.

135
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:12,850
And then you can find out which of those trials have completed publications associated with them as well.

136
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:16,990
So you can have more than one publication per clinical trial.

137
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:27,400
Yeah. For an analysis in general and daily, like the number of studies concluded to have enough power to make conclusions.

138
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:34,960
Yeah, that's a really good question. I'm not a biostatistics statistician, so I can't give you that answer,

139
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:42,700
but I can tell you that you would want to do a power analysis to figure out, you know, okay, based on that,

140
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:47,229
based on the variability you get in, the things you're measuring,

141
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:59,650
how many studies or participants are you actually going to need to draw a conclusion based on a reasonable statistical analysis?

142
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:04,870
Right. Yeah, I think I'm I'm still kind of confused with the records.

143
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:11,380
Is that so there's 12 trials and they were published like in total 16.

144
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:16,690
You can you can publish more than one paper from a clinical trial.

145
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:23,850
Got it. Okay. So you can have different outcomes from one trial.

146
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:27,220
So they're published in different they come out in different publications.

147
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:32,510
I think that's what I think that's what they need to do in this particular matter.

148
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:40,840
Analysis paper. So I mentioned nine and I was referring to a table and it's actually 12.

149
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:48,350
So describe the oral therapy strategy protocol methods used in these 12 different studies.

150
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:53,840
And here's the 12 different studies in table one.

151
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:13,970
So they said that ten of those trials had been vetted like roasted peanut flour.

152
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:20,810
Mm hmm. And the remaining use, like a paste, an extract on the ground and the like.

153
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:26,840
They all started with or sorry. The mean dosage at start was one five milligrams.

154
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:33,110
Yeah. Mm hmm. And then I think they increased up to 4000.

155
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:38,960
Right. Yeah. So what are there were other some, some different cuts, you know.

156
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:49,280
Yeah. Also I think that that type of deal, I mean they do a therapy fix some of them were surprised by the other ones just was underdeveloped.

157
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:57,720
These two different types of. Okay.

158
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:04,080
So what about the control groups?

159
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:13,760
How are they different? Some of them use it for within their business.

160
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:23,020
So yeah. So in regard to the placebo, the use of the placebo and not having a placebo,

161
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:30,100
do you think that may have affected their interpretation of their results somewhat?

162
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:50,720
I mean, most of them had a placebo. So how does the placebo effect an endpoint in terms of some of these endpoints that they mentioned later on?

163
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:59,650
Ah, you know they are very clear clinical endpoints are and they're kind of subjective.

164
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:07,730
But some of the stuff like talking about the quality of life you could potentially be someone didn't like

165
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:15,020
receiving the treatment even if it wasn't actually doing anything about some of the other end points.

166
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:19,130
And this is in regard to the use of a control group.

167
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:32,770
I think I'm a little bit torn with what you think about the the control groups,

168
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:42,520
because it would be better to have like a placebo group, but ethically, you might need to treat the patients.

169
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:48,640
Yes, that would indeed entail that you need to remove the peanuts from their diet.

170
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:52,990
Yeah. Yeah, it's it's it is a conundrum, isn't it.

171
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:57,190
So the idea, but behind the, um,

172
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:06,760
these types of clinical trials is you want to provide as a recommendation for everybody who's in the study has the, what's the standard of care.

173
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:10,480
Right. And the standard of care is what it's avoidance.

174
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:18,460
Okay. So from a research standpoint, it kind of makes things messy because if you have a lot of placebo, you don't know what you've got.

175
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:22,899
And the placebo itself can affect some of the reporting of the outcomes.

176
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:31,479
But at the same time, if that they're recommending avoidance, you know, that's really that's that's the standard of care.

177
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:37,640
And it's not a good idea to tell somebody who is very sensitive to peanuts that it's okay to eat peanuts now.

178
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:44,860
Right. And this was some of the recommendations, too, in terms of strictly avoid treatment of peanuts.

179
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:49,870
And there was some that said, yes, some of that said no and then some they didn't even mention them in the studies.

180
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:55,750
So this is the the issue that you're going to have with a meta analysis.

181
00:22:56,290 --> 00:23:01,300
They're not only the exact same types of studies, so it's kind of a mixed bag.

182
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:09,880
And if there's a huge effect of the treatment, even though there's some variability in the treatment, you'll see a difference.

183
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:15,460
If not, you'll see so much variability that you won't see a big difference.

184
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:26,620
So and there were some other things here. So you talked about that the this the dose, the type of exposure.

185
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:31,510
There were some that were proprietary studies and some that were not.

186
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:38,470
How would a proprietary study be influenced by, uh, the investigators?

187
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:45,310
Proprietary study would be a study that's funded by the drug company.

188
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,480
Conflict of interest is a conflict of interest. Absolutely. Yeah.

189
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:52,270
So that's an issue.

190
00:23:53,200 --> 00:24:04,300
And then other restrictions, how might other restrictions, whether or not there were there were not other restrictions enter into the equation?

191
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,380
So that's another way that there's differences between the studies.

192
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:19,610
And also, you wonder if those restrictions were applied in both groups,

193
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:28,650
since it didn't specifically ask that if that was just people who received the therapy or if like if they got to see.

194
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:33,440
But they also supposed to avoid whatever.

195
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:41,790
Yeah. Right. Good. And I was I was thinking like, those are the ones that have restrictions mentioned exercise.

196
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:50,479
So I feel like those settings that don't have those restrictions that people are exercising that would obviously could I know like

197
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:59,720
increase your risk of having in an aquatic event or like an immune response by the people that are in that or El Nino therapy group?

198
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,170
Yeah. So if you're reporting, yes, there's that risk there.

199
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:06,170
But if you're reporting, one of the things that you're reporting is a symptom.

200
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:13,760
Right. Like a nasal congestion. Most people have other allergies who have food allergies.

201
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:22,519
Right. So just because they develop a symptom doesn't necessarily mean it's because of exposure to the food allergy.

202
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:26,899
And it could be they were out running and it was the time of year where there are lots

203
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:33,050
of allergens or or the exercise itself could have heightened the some inflammation.

204
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:37,610
And that could have been part of the symptoms that they could have experienced.

205
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:49,219
So how did they assess the effectiveness based on symptoms after a challenge event or something else?

206
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:53,410
Challenge or something else? Okay.

207
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:08,650
So what's a challenge test? Also the incidence of adverse reactions.

208
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:16,960
Yeah. So some of the some of them, they don't describe this very clearly in the paper.

209
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:22,420
So they just they talk about a challenge or provocation test.

210
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:36,330
And this is done to determine whether or not in a clinical setting there's an effect of that oral, oral immuno tolerance test.

211
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:46,950
So after they get to the stepwise increase and remember there was a challenge test or in a clinical setting to see if they responded.

212
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:53,010
And a lot of times they're looking for symptoms associated with that somebody might experience.

213
00:26:53,490 --> 00:27:00,210
Sometimes they'll take a blood test and they'll look for the endpoints that I mentioned, the IGAD, G-4.

214
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:06,960
They'll do some individual tests with cells that they recover and that sort of thing.

215
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:13,560
But. Over the patient.

216
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:24,660
Important events that they described. You remember?

217
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:32,100
Yeah. Like it's like this race for the future that I've never used.

218
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:35,670
Yeah. For a person who's. Yeah.

219
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:44,010
So patient. Important outcomes are, you know, did you experience an anaphylaxis involving two or more organ systems?

220
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:48,660
Were there serious adverse effects? Did you have to use your EpiPen?

221
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:52,740
Um, did you experience vomiting?

222
00:27:52,740 --> 00:28:03,300
You know, and a period of time after the, the, uh, or ibuprofen or immunotherapy did they experience nasal congestion,

223
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:08,240
um, angioedema, peanut allergies, allergic reaction and so on.

224
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:13,290
So these are the, these are what they're calling the patient important outcomes.

225
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:24,030
Yes. You want to measure some kind of an objective endpoint to indicate that the immune response has been changed by the immunotherapy.

226
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:37,170
But, um, that's all well and good to the investigators, but to the patient, you know, you go in and you do these stepwise, uh,

227
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:47,010
tolerance therapies and you want to know if that's really going to benefit you in, in the end in preventing these types of symptoms.

228
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:54,300
So how well did the strategies work to prevent peanut allergy symptoms?

229
00:28:55,050 --> 00:29:06,160
And this is table two. They had the symptoms on the table all the way in the left hander at the table,

230
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:15,820
and then they put the sample size in the next column and then the anticipated absolute effects per 1000 individuals.

231
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:27,940
So they kind of changed the numbers such that the values that they would get could be standardized across the different studies,

232
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:35,020
so that they're working with the same value to see if the changes are statistically significant.

233
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:43,090
And they came up with a risk difference in grades and evidence and then main findings.

234
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:49,120
And how well did these studies work? Yeah.

235
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:59,420
I want to say not only, but I also think it's really interesting the table around like for anaphylaxis when it has 232.

236
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:04,320
People under the age or on the therapy, as I say, like.

237
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:10,110
To look like. That's a really cool experience. Okay.

238
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:13,559
So then, yeah, these studies didn't really achieve the whole.

239
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:23,630
But what is their risk ratio tell you if the therapy actually increase the chances of especially all of those.

240
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:29,430
Yeah. With a lot of them having high evidence, not just little changes, but actually significant.

241
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:41,340
Yeah. So here we're comparing the incidence of those effects regardless of what the control is.

242
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:47,170
Right. So you have the controls, the placebos and whatever.

243
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:52,110
Third. So I don't know if that was, like, the best idea.

244
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:56,680
Yeah, a little bit confusing. It is. It is. They show another I'll show another guy.

245
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:00,500
Show the figure here in a minute. Yeah. I might have missed that. Yeah.

246
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:06,450
They put in. Nope I didn't put in. Shame on me. I didn't show you the fourth the plot.

247
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:10,200
Right. Well, let's look at the fourth plot.

248
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:21,600
So the fourth plot, what is the fourth plot show you? Where do those values fall close to in regard to zero?

249
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:34,150
Is there a did the studies show an effect that's in favor of, oh, i t or in favor of no or I t for all in favor.

250
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:38,880
No. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

251
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:51,299
So that's kind of frightening. I have never seen a meta analysis that showed results that were this bad in terms of testing a therapy

252
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:58,710
and trying to say that after examining something that's actually FDA approved and demonstrating,

253
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:11,790
um, a bad outcome based on lots of different studies that with peanut allergy now years ago before 2020 when they were developing these strategies,

254
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:19,140
I was kind of following the literature every now and then. And at that time it appeared to me, Oh, this is going to work.

255
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:25,020
This is going to help kids who go to school not have to worry about peanuts anymore.

256
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:37,500
And then at the I'm in a graduate program in immunology and I bumped into one of the directors of the, um, the Food Allergy Center,

257
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:46,950
and I was talking to him about this and he said, you know, I was of the opinion, oh, this, this oral immunotherapy is working, right?

258
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:50,550
He said, no, no, the results are terrible.

259
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:55,230
They're really disappointing. We essentially have no tools.

260
00:32:55,410 --> 00:33:00,210
It's treating symptoms and avoidance to deal with food allergies.

261
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:06,510
So I went and I looked and I hunted down this meta analysis and I thought, Oh my gosh, this is terrible.

262
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:18,600
So if I were with the FDA and the NIH, I would recommend stopping all of this stuff and saying, okay, this doesn't work.

263
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:23,510
Based on 12 different clinical trials.

264
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:27,360
The numbers are kind of small per se, per number of participants.

265
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:35,640
But, you know, I would say there's enough evidence here to tell me that this is going to be a lead to more harm than anything else.

266
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:46,049
Okay. So how did they describe the effect of the provocation test?

267
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:52,620
Here I go back. I'm going back. Here we go. Roger Federer.

268
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:57,020
Okay. So here's the thing.

269
00:33:57,020 --> 00:34:07,070
Here's the the differences here in terms of the the symptoms and then the main findings and.

270
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:15,200
Uh, they're they're. They're looking at here.

271
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:21,470
Number needed over here to show this difference in the different studies.

272
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:25,820
And the number needed to show a difference was fairly low.

273
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:33,650
But again, some of the numbers of participants in the studies, we're also, you know, not very many.

274
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:37,520
But this one really struck me. Okay.

275
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:43,220
So guidance, good grades of evidence, moderate for severe adverse events.

276
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:49,640
And when you when you look at a treatment and you want to have a treatment that's effective,

277
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:55,520
and then it would have to minimize serious adverse events.

278
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:58,690
You'd want this grade of evidence to be.

279
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:09,290
You wanted to say that it's you're either well in favor of the treatment saying that that it reduces adverse events.

280
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:19,720
But here we have that peanut allergy probably increases serious events such as death,

281
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:26,890
life threatening disability, requiring urgent medical attention or hospitalization to prevent these events.

282
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:33,650
So, you know, if you're if you're somebody who works at the FDA and you see this kind of data unfolding,

283
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:38,920
the minute we need to stop this, we need to put a hold and put a stop on this particular therapy.

284
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:42,790
So I find this, you know,

285
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:54,460
shocking in terms of the outcomes here that would lead me to believe that this is not working and this is making things worse.

286
00:35:55,180 --> 00:36:03,220
So is this a case where older therapies, like for older allergies that are in the extreme, the allergy?

287
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:09,580
You know, there are other therapies that use this, you know, immuno tolerance type of approach.

288
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:19,840
And I'm not familiar with how effective they are. I haven't looked at large bits of data and analysis.

289
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:26,680
So I don't know. I would assume that their results are better than this, but I'm not certain.

290
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:36,929
Yeah. This is a kind of ground zero for. The question was, what about, you know, we talked about dairy and eggs and people's attitudes,

291
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:41,969
but there were also people who were attracted to dairy eggs.

292
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:45,860
And I wonder if they've done experimentation with them as individuals as well.

293
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:49,620
They've just written it off as like, that's going to be a lifelong thing.

294
00:36:49,860 --> 00:37:01,980
Yeah, I have not heard about an 0it use for those types of allergy biologists, but in theory it should work.

295
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:09,989
It should have the same benefit whether or not you get a result like this versus something you know.

296
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:20,790
But a decrease in symptoms, I don't know. So this is you know, there's a lot of data here showing that it makes things worse.

297
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:31,710
Okay. So we're dealing with a meta analysis now and we have a protocol to select this data based on looking at the literature.

298
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:38,370
Right. And we have a way to assess experimental design.

299
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:50,880
Either it's robust or it's not robust. Um, how do they when they make these selections of studies, how do they make sure that they're not biased?

300
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:58,210
I mean, I answer that. I mean, you can hear everything.

301
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:06,780
Everything's fully revised, but I don't think this stuff is right, as they used a lot of like criteria,

302
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:19,570
like they worked their way through the concrete risk of bias toward hardcore modification activities like the Olympic Dream Study.

303
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:23,950
So I feel like they try their best to be as unbiased as possible.

304
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:30,220
Yeah, it's good. I did notice that all the studies were in Europe or North America,

305
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:41,230
and I wondered if that was just based on how they found these studies or if there just aren't studies done with this therapy outside of Europe.

306
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:46,260
So this question I don't know. You know the answer to that.

307
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:50,700
And I think that there was a mention of something like this period.

308
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:57,050
Asian cultures are. Places they would have there or.

309
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:05,390
Record it there. Yeah. And that could have resulted in the selection of these studies that they show.

310
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:10,219
So here's an example of what they used to prevent bias.

311
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:16,700
And they said they used the Cochrane Risk of bias tool for randomized trials with modified responses.

312
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:24,919
So they looked at that based on the the criteria that they used to get a random sample of these

313
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:33,210
studies they used more of an objective assessment of is that in the studies that they've chosen.

314
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:36,680
Bias in some way. Yes. Probably. Yes.

315
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:48,800
Probably no. Definitely no. And they they looked at things like if the if they were looking at a particular study,

316
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:53,990
was the study protocol followed to the T like they described it?

317
00:39:54,530 --> 00:40:01,370
And if somebody didn't continue in the study protocol, why was that part of the analysis,

318
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:06,649
the intention to treat analysis where you had people dropping out and there's a way to control

319
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:11,510
for that with the intention to treat including the data and not just throwing all of that out,

320
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,660
which could have bias, these kinds of results as well.

321
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:26,269
So I would imagine, you know, I didn't I didn't look up one the studies, the trials and see how many people dropped out of the study.

322
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:29,630
But I can imagine there were a few that dropped out.

323
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:33,920
Can you imagine? Especially for your little kid. Okay.

324
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:37,730
We're going to go to the doctor's office and they're going to give you something that's going to make you throw up.

325
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:44,180
You know, you would you would assume that there's going to be a lot of kids dropping out of the trial.

326
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:51,590
Right, because of that. Now they do. They're very careful about selecting the dose of this peanut flower.

327
00:40:51,590 --> 00:41:01,100
So that doesn't happen. But I imagine with with some on study subjects, it's going to happen or they experience some other type of unpleasant.

328
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:06,049
And that that's going to that in itself could bias the results.

329
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:10,040
And they did their best to control from this. But still, that's always in the back of your mind.

330
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:19,310
Are we only seeing the people that completed the study because they didn't have an adverse event occurred during the step up period?

331
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:29,560
Okay. Now let's get to the interpretation of the studies.

332
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:43,479
So first of all, what did the authors mean when they said these data show the disconnect between passing an in-clinic supervised crew challenge,

333
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:51,190
a provocation test, and an out of clinic allergic and anaphylactic reactions to everyday exposures.

334
00:41:56,260 --> 00:42:06,850
Go ahead, General. So I think that people treated it, though, like they had better responses to those testimony, including testimony.

335
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:16,900
But they follow up the other day of the defense that there were more adverse effects events in their lifetime.

336
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:23,560
So maybe it can. Can mechanistically works.

337
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:30,830
Can desensitize themselves in response, but just clinical awfulness.

338
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:34,890
Worse? Yeah. It could be different. Why do you think that might be?

339
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:51,020
So what exactly do you are you exposed to during the clinical and clinical

340
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:57,200
supervised food challenge versus an out of clinical allergic anaphylactic reaction?

341
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:05,210
So it's like what means including moving a certain dosage and I expect it to be like isolate it.

342
00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:13,700
So when you are out in the world, you cannot adjust for dosage or other potential treatments.

343
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:18,190
Yeah, that's an important point. So two things that you brought up.

344
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:24,650
So a dose dose of the challenge, right. In clinic controlled, they're going to give you a low dose, right.

345
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:32,180
Something that is theoretically relevant and then other things that might provoke a response,

346
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:40,310
because 37% of people and schoolchildren in that particular survey, they're allergic to other things, too.

347
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:48,470
Right. So they may have gotten exposure to something else that led to this some of these bad outcomes.

348
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:55,840
So that's a concern. Okay.

349
00:43:55,850 --> 00:44:00,140
We're racing through this, and I thought we'd be a little short today, but not this short.

350
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:05,480
So what are the recommendations described for future studies?

351
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:20,770
So high and moderate certainty evidence that current approach is to align to effectively achieve a modest degree of decentralization.

352
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:31,269
Do you agree with that? So in the case of the clinic, yes.

353
00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:35,020
But not actual experiences outside.

354
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:39,340
Yeah. Yes. So I was I was really surprised when I saw it.

355
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:49,899
I thought, wait a minute. I'm like reading the same paper that I mix up the pages here or something like that based on other studies in clinic, right?

356
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:54,720
The In-Clinic tests would say, yeah, you get this desensitization a modest degree of business,

357
00:44:55,180 --> 00:45:00,399
but in terms of the real life, the patient outcomes, however,

358
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,570
and this is the point that I underlined and and put in bold,

359
00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:10,540
however clinically they promote more allergic and anaphylactic reactions instead of preventing them.

360
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:19,790
And that there's a need for improved food allergy treatment approaches with an

361
00:45:19,790 --> 00:45:27,770
enhanced safety profile focused on patient important outcomes in that work.

362
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:35,240
Those were the, um, the symptom related, um, outcomes that were mentioned that occurred outside the clinic.

363
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:47,590
So another point here, note that was it. So if you were going to do another study of this, what do you what do you think you would do?

364
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:52,100
Would you. First of all, who would you recruit to the study?

365
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:55,530
For peanut allergy.

366
00:45:55,530 --> 00:46:03,810
Let's narrow down who would you want to study who has a peanut allergy and included in one of these types of oral immunotherapy trials.

367
00:46:04,950 --> 00:46:11,790
Yeah, Abbie, I think was trained brain. So that only happens in their origin and don't have any other avenues to.

368
00:46:12,510 --> 00:46:17,030
Yeah. Um, just about like, you know, that's the only other key.

369
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:22,500
Yeah. So it's a focused treatment and that would be you would, you would use that data.

370
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:31,829
So it was clear to physicians who prescribed this treatment and to the patients that this is all this is going to work for you.

371
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:37,050
If you just have a peanut allergy, if you've got other allergies, other things might happen to you, right?

372
00:46:38,370 --> 00:46:42,090
Who would you work with in terms of the the demographic of people?

373
00:46:43,890 --> 00:46:47,970
Yes. Both adults and children.

374
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:55,829
Right. Because this is what we're really worried about, what happens in the school where a lot of these events occur,

375
00:46:55,830 --> 00:47:01,050
where they get a bad outcome because of that exposure to something from food.

376
00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:09,330
So kids, adults, you talked a little bit about where the studies were conducted.

377
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:15,810
Where would you want to where do you see where where is where?

378
00:47:15,810 --> 00:47:22,830
Peanuts available worldwide just to North America or other places to everywhere.

379
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:30,120
Right. So you'd want to have, if you could, a multicenter study.

380
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:34,670
So this gets really complicated now.

381
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:44,059
So you have many different sites where the research is conducted and you usually recruit.

382
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:50,570
You would have a bunch of pediatricians who do or other types of allergy physicians who do this kind of work.

383
00:47:51,230 --> 00:48:01,310
And they take part in the study and they try to recruit patients and they're participating in the study.

384
00:48:01,970 --> 00:48:12,320
And there needs to be some kind of an incentive to have the physician scientist run these studies of the different study sites.

385
00:48:12,950 --> 00:48:19,250
If they're academic physicians, they're going to want to do research, get research, funding, publish and so on.

386
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:24,110
What's that going to do to your your study population,

387
00:48:25,610 --> 00:48:36,440
especially if we're talking about trying to get a large number of people and something where you have subjects all over the world,

388
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:41,690
you're just using university type physician scientists.

389
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:49,380
How is that going to affect your population? No.

390
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:56,990
Not everyone who had food allergies would see those physicians or have access to the providers.

391
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:03,530
Right. Go ahead. Or maybe the patients have more severe symptoms than others.

392
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:08,700
Yeah. Yeah. You're only getting the ones that have the most severe symptoms.

393
00:49:08,770 --> 00:49:16,200
Well, that's a good point as well. But what else? What about, um, talked about the hygiene hypothesis.

394
00:49:18,030 --> 00:49:24,750
And so you're doing your recruitment. Where are you going to get people from?

395
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:31,860
You're only getting people who are physician scientists working at academic medical centers.

396
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:38,640
How is that going to affect your study population? Getting the sickest ones.

397
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:42,840
Um. Not everybody has access. Why don't they have access?

398
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:56,790
It could also be cost in terms of if you're not getting people who don't have as much money, which certainly could impact exposure.

399
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,180
Yeah. Yeah. Outside of the clinic. Good point.

400
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:09,210
And if you have centers in some U.S. cities like Boston, Philadelphia, New York or Los Angeles,

401
00:50:10,230 --> 00:50:21,660
you're likely to get a different demographic than Iowa City or Fort Collins, Colorado or some other places.

402
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:32,130
Right. Or how about we have this I mentioned earlier that a raise seem to be a factor with the prevalence of childhood allergies.

403
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:42,960
And you want to know, is it because there's some kind of effect of the environment in the US or those numbers were in the United States?

404
00:50:43,650 --> 00:50:53,700
Or is it something else? Is it a combination of things besides race, ethnicity, genetics, gene environment or interactions?

405
00:50:54,450 --> 00:51:04,850
Wouldn't you want to do the studies in Africa? Are you going to get lots of physician scientists who are allergy?

406
00:51:05,310 --> 00:51:13,410
We have practices and allergy over there that are going to help recruit subjects for this kind of study.

407
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:21,840
Probably not.

408
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:32,790
It's a hard thing to do to get, you know, participation globally with these types of studies for the number of limitations that you've mentioned.

409
00:51:33,210 --> 00:51:41,480
And then you have the same issues there. You have urban and rural issues in terms of who's that exposed to things,

410
00:51:41,490 --> 00:51:48,030
a dirty environment that might affect their t h, their t cell skewing and so on.

411
00:51:48,990 --> 00:51:58,110
So when you want to get a large population of people that you want to test the efficacy of this type of an approach,

412
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:08,670
you've got to think about all of these things. And the data that's generated from these studies can be massive and very useful,

413
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:20,910
but it's very difficult to get all of these bases covered and trying to rule out bias and trying to get a representative sample.

414
00:52:22,090 --> 00:52:26,830
I'm from different demographics and trying to to reach everyone.

415
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:34,630
So. Clinical trials are important because they test these hypotheses on a larger scale.

416
00:52:35,230 --> 00:52:40,629
And the fact that they can't control for everything is a good thing, right?

417
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:43,780
We can't control for everything that we are exposed to.

418
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:51,160
We don't. You don't have human populations who live in highly controlled environments

419
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:55,600
where their only difference between one population and another is one variable.

420
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:58,330
There's a million variables that can affect their outcomes,

421
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:09,490
and you want to see if that difference is strong enough in a large population sample to show differences and a health effect.

422
00:53:10,930 --> 00:53:13,120
So we're going to get done a little bit early today.

423
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:27,550
I'll mention that the next paper we're going to talk about is that fish oil trial and in patients at risk for cardiovascular disease.

424
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,170
We're going to talk about that on Tuesday. That wasn't a meta analysis.

425
00:53:32,170 --> 00:53:43,239
That was a trial that was done, the strength trial. So we're going to go over that and to see, you know, I said, okay, you up clinical trials,

426
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:49,120
people are using EPA as a way to reduce their risk of cardiovascular disease.

427
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:54,609
Let's see how that works in a clinical trial. And then as I introduce this,

428
00:53:54,610 --> 00:54:04,300
I'll introduce some introductory material and then we'll walk through some questions and see how well this works in a larger population setting.

429
00:54:06,620 --> 00:54:10,160
Okay. Any questions about the next quiz?

430
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:15,650
It's going to be due next week, not on Monday. It's going to be a do at the end of the week next week.

431
00:54:16,610 --> 00:54:20,150
Does that mean it's going to okay? I know. Is it early in the week?

432
00:54:20,630 --> 00:54:24,680
Does that mean like Monday, Monday? Tuesday? Yeah, Monday, Tuesday.

433
00:54:25,070 --> 00:54:32,639
My goal was to have three quizzes for the first half of the semester and three quizzes in the second half of the semester.

434
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:35,750
And that will do it right from the break. Okay.

435
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:43,280
All right. I look forward to seeing papers and ideas from those of you who haven't shown anything yet.

436
00:54:43,910 --> 00:54:49,220
Okay. Can I show you something?

437
00:54:49,370 --> 00:54:54,000
Sure. That.
