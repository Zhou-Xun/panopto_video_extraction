1
00:00:00,567 --> 00:00:04,417
In this module, we're going to be talking about healthy relationships and communication.

2
00:00:04,417 --> 00:00:09,967
We've been talking about interdependence, what belongs to other people what to us.

3
00:00:09,967 --> 00:00:14,167
We've been talking about what boundaries are

4
00:00:14,167 --> 00:00:19,017
and how do we adjust them, what does it look like?

5
00:00:19,017 --> 00:00:28,767
And now we're going to talk about the communication. So we could kind of group communication

6
00:00:28,767 --> 00:00:33,717
into three categories, assertive, passive and aggressive.

7
00:00:33,717 --> 00:00:40,947
We'll talk a little bit about nuance there. But basically when we're being passive

8
00:00:40,947 --> 00:00:47,487
we're downplaying our needs, wants and thoughts and feelings, and we're really prioritizing

9
00:00:47,487 --> 00:00:58,017
the other person. So kind of whatever they say goes.

10
00:00:58,017 --> 00:01:06,007
With aggressive communication. We're really prioritizing in kind of only thinking about our needs once, our thoughts,

11
00:01:06,007 --> 00:01:14,787
feelings and were often enforcing our boundaries and communicating them to people in ways that harm or disrespect

12
00:01:14,787 --> 00:01:19,057
their needs, wants, and thoughts.

13
00:01:19,057 --> 00:01:30,227
So this can be useful to think about in terms of who are people that you know who kind of one of these is their main way of communicating.

14
00:01:30,227 --> 00:01:38,237
But it can also be useful for thinking about in yourself, because most of us have behavior that falls in all of these, it's just kind of ratios.

15
00:01:38,237 --> 00:01:43,987
So when am I passive and what does that look like and what usually triggers.

16
00:01:43,987 --> 00:01:47,567
When am I aggressive and what does that look like for me? What do I feel like in my body,

17
00:01:47,567 --> 00:01:54,157
how do I know that that's like about to be what starts to come out of my mouth and how to make.

18
00:01:54,157 --> 00:02:03,907
And then, the last one is the one that we're shooting to try to have most of our behavior show up here is that we honor our needs,

19
00:02:03,907 --> 00:02:14,147
wants and thoughts and feelings. We also take into consideration other peoples and again, what is our role, what is our responsibility with those?

20
00:02:14,147 --> 00:02:19,757
And we communicate to them in a way that says these are my needs, wants.

21
00:02:19,757 --> 00:02:26,867
These are my thoughts and feelings. But I get to communicate them to you in a way that doesn't harm or disrespect you.

22
00:02:26,867 --> 00:02:32,447
It doesn't dismiss or minimize yours. That's kind of where we want to be.

23
00:02:32,447 --> 00:02:34,037
Some people have described this,

24
00:02:34,037 --> 00:02:43,867
I think this also shows up Brene Browns work, about kind of having like a firm solid spine or back and a warm hearted open front.

25
00:02:43,867 --> 00:02:49,907
And we have this balance of being able to think about ourself and others, communicate what we need,

26
00:02:49,907 --> 00:02:58,527
want that set that falls in our goiter ball that we're responsible for, but doing it in a way that does not harm or disrespect other people.

27
00:02:58,527 --> 00:03:01,987
And this can get a little interesting because often we're socialized to think

28
00:03:01,987 --> 00:03:06,287
that sometimes just saying what we want or think is harmful to other people

29
00:03:06,287 --> 00:03:12,567
and that's not always the case a lot of times it's how. So let's look more at this.

30
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:19,647
The other thing I do want to say here is a lot of people

31
00:03:19,647 --> 00:03:31,647
are trying to say assertive things, but their body language may be passive or aggressive, their tone of voice may be passive or aggressive

32
00:03:31,647 --> 00:03:39,357
and so there's kind of a mixed message one of the things that the research has shown us is that most of our message gets conveyed nonverbally.

33
00:03:39,357 --> 00:03:43,377
So what our body language is saying matters, and times

34
00:03:43,377 --> 00:03:51,417
people will wonder like, it's almost like playing poker when people are bluffing or they have a tell that lets you know what's really in their hand.

35
00:03:51,417 --> 00:03:53,907
If we're trying to be assertive,

36
00:03:53,907 --> 00:04:00,327
but our body language is immediately going too aggressive and it still have an aggressive affect and we're trying to be assertive,

37
00:04:00,327 --> 00:04:07,737
but our body language is more passive, and then other people aren't responding to the boundaries.

38
00:04:07,737 --> 00:04:12,897
It's often because you're not conveying assertiveness and it goes both ways.

39
00:04:12,897 --> 00:04:15,507
People should respect our boundaries no matter what.

40
00:04:15,507 --> 00:04:24,127
We want to make sure that we're conveying them in a way that gives them the most likelihood of being heard.

41
00:04:24,127 --> 00:04:31,087
So a different way to look at these same behaviors and communication styles.

42
00:04:31,087 --> 00:04:36,607
Is thinking about it a little bit and how it works in our in our nervous system, so especially when there's conflict,

43
00:04:36,607 --> 00:04:42,707
a lot of us have learned to be afraid of conflict and so we can become fearful

44
00:04:42,707 --> 00:04:46,937
,or worried, or anxious, and so our fight or flight system gets

45
00:04:46,937 --> 00:04:53,327
going. Most of us have heard a fight or flight, but there's some other pieces of it.

46
00:04:53,327 --> 00:05:00,657
So we'll talk about those. One way that we can be passive is by moving away.

47
00:05:00,657 --> 00:05:05,277
And this literally is like somebody a conflict starts

48
00:05:05,277 --> 00:05:12,497
and I just leave a conflict starts and I just shut down and have very little to say at all.

49
00:05:12,497 --> 00:05:17,517
A conflict happens in a relationship and we just ghost people.

50
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:26,167
That's that's one way of moving away, we guess we never really communicate what we want, what we need, what we think we just move away.

51
00:05:26,167 --> 00:05:31,427
And this can kind of be the flight system coming into our body.

52
00:05:31,427 --> 00:05:36,407
Like we're just feeling a lot a lot is happening we just want out of there as soon as possible.

53
00:05:36,407 --> 00:05:40,847
It can also be freeing, like our brain just kind of goes offline. We can't think.

54
00:05:40,847 --> 00:05:47,557
And so we say nothing or we feel overwhelmed and so we just shut down.

55
00:05:47,557 --> 00:05:54,437
Another way that this can show up is moving toward, now that might sound like it's a assertive but you'll hear why it's not.

56
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,897
This is basically a fawn response.

57
00:05:56,897 --> 00:06:03,647
So this is what it means is that we're interacting in a way where you started accommodate and people we started to start

58
00:06:03,647 --> 00:06:10,097
trying to be nicer and start trying to be more perfect and we try do whatever we can do to keep the other person happy.

59
00:06:10,097 --> 00:06:14,047
But we may be working ourselves to death, we may not really be taking care of ourselves

60
00:06:14,047 --> 00:06:21,387
You're not really thinking about what we really want to say, what we really want to communicate, because we're just

61
00:06:21,387 --> 00:06:27,907
kind of as a survival strategy and as a coping strategy, trying to keep the other person happy.

62
00:06:27,907 --> 00:06:32,887
So both of these things fall with the passive end of the continuum.

63
00:06:32,887 --> 00:06:40,547
Both of them don't help us get our needs met they tend to just mostly focus on the other people.

64
00:06:40,547 --> 00:06:46,727
And the thing with our fight or flight system are sympathetic nerve of our nervous

65
00:06:46,727 --> 00:06:53,057
system is that it often kicks in before our front brain even thinks about it.

66
00:06:53,057 --> 00:06:58,187
This is where it becomes really important. You know, you typically fall.

67
00:06:58,187 --> 00:07:03,357
And what does it feel like before you go into flight or freeze or fawn?

68
00:07:03,357 --> 00:07:12,927
Because we want to use the strategies that we've been using any other sections to slow down our response to become more aware.

69
00:07:12,927 --> 00:07:21,977
Eye out new behaviors and to slowly start to make shifts so that more of the time we're staying in the assertive space.

70
00:07:21,977 --> 00:07:25,747
We want to have good relationships, safe relationships

71
00:07:25,747 --> 00:07:34,847
where we can practice assertive behaviors. A lot of times we've learned these other behaviors and situations where either we had people modeling

72
00:07:34,847 --> 00:07:41,207
behavior that wasn't the healthiest or we were on the receiving end of behavior that wasn't the healthiest.

73
00:07:41,207 --> 00:07:50,267
And so we want to get out of these kind of unhealthy habits that we've learned and unhealthy relationships and start trying to practice new behaviors.

74
00:07:50,267 --> 00:07:55,337
But we often need safe places to practice and we need social support that will cheer for us

75
00:07:55,337 --> 00:08:01,727
when we're saying no and not just get mad at us when we're saying no or being assertive.

76
00:08:01,727 --> 00:08:05,957
So it's it's I'm gonna in a second shift over to the progressive box.

77
00:08:05,957 --> 00:08:11,267
But as we're talking about this, I think it's really important to think about

78
00:08:11,267 --> 00:08:16,787
in your relationships, what have you learned about conflict? What have you

79
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:22,757
like a lot of us have learned like avoid it. So that's going to often lead to that flight or freeze.

80
00:08:22,757 --> 00:08:26,087
Or just be the peacemaker at all costs, no matter what.

81
00:08:26,087 --> 00:08:30,967
That's going to lean more toward the fawning.

82
00:08:30,967 --> 00:08:34,667
Sometimes some of this can do some of our social identities.

83
00:08:34,667 --> 00:08:41,987
Sometimes women are more socializing, you have to be nice even if other people are unsafe or making you uncomfortable have to be nice.

84
00:08:41,987 --> 00:08:49,167
We can have different messages about this in our culture and our family. We want to think about what we learned.

85
00:08:49,167 --> 00:08:51,667
Have we seen people work through conflict well

86
00:08:51,667 --> 00:08:59,947
and it actually lead to them being closer, is that their hope when we deal with conflict, when we communicate, hopefully

87
00:08:59,947 --> 00:09:06,697
we're getting more healthiness, more connection. But if we've never seen that, it can be hard to try new and assertive behavior.

88
00:09:06,697 --> 00:09:15,807
So what have I seen? Have I seen examples where people can work through conflict affect.

89
00:09:15,807 --> 00:09:19,377
One thing that we know from the research is that a lot of us avoid conflict,

90
00:09:19,377 --> 00:09:26,547
we think conflict is bad when in fact, that conflict is a healthy part of getting to know people.

91
00:09:26,547 --> 00:09:30,897
I'm going to express what I need and somebody else is going to tell me back oh ok that's how that strikes me,

92
00:09:30,897 --> 00:09:37,887
that's how I learned about this. We're going to hit a bumpy patch, some turbulence.

93
00:09:37,887 --> 00:09:42,387
They may do something that doesn't feel good to me or vice versa.

94
00:09:42,387 --> 00:09:43,597
We're going to communicate about it.

95
00:09:43,597 --> 00:09:50,007
You may feel uncomfortable for a while, but hopefully we're gonna reach a new understanding where we now know more about each other.

96
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:59,397
And so our connection is deeper and more authentic. But if we haven't seen that, we we may have beliefs or fears about being assertive.

97
00:09:59,397 --> 00:10:05,287
And so we want to unpack and know what those are and where they came from.

98
00:10:05,287 --> 00:10:13,237
Had I been taught it's OK to disagree, had I been taught that it's OK to be firmly and confident?

99
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:21,087
Had I been taught that it's OK if so, my emotion is in my voice, that it's OK to be angry

100
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:26,257
anger isn't always harming other people. These are things you've got to kind of think about.

101
00:10:26,257 --> 00:10:33,957
And sometimes you just learn from our peers and from our friends who've had different experiences than us and sometimes healthier ones.

102
00:10:33,957 --> 00:10:39,537
But it can help us to see maybe what we've assumed to be true. That might be getting in our way.

103
00:10:39,537 --> 00:10:49,317
Another thing is, what do we do and how do we deserve? And this is where one of the previous modules I talked about Googling assertiveness, Bill of Rights.

104
00:10:49,317 --> 00:10:55,837
Some of us have haven't been taught that It's OK to express our feelings, OK to disagree.

105
00:10:55,837 --> 00:11:02,247
And we need a kind of fact check that and see what's true, what's going to work best for us,

106
00:11:02,247 --> 00:11:06,287
what's going to lead to the most happiness in our relationship.

107
00:11:06,287 --> 00:11:13,837
And the other thing is, if we've had a lot of really harmful and negative consequences for being assertive, it's going to be scary to try so.

108
00:11:13,837 --> 00:11:19,067
And so, again, that's where having a safe place is it's really important.

109
00:11:19,067 --> 00:11:26,787
And also, if people aren't honoring our assertiveness, it's a good sign that we probably need

110
00:11:26,787 --> 00:11:30,687
different people closer to us in our social support

111
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:37,067
and we also may need to have someone respecting our assertiveness.

112
00:11:37,067 --> 00:11:43,117
So we talked about what this looks like on the passive side, on the aggressive side

113
00:11:43,117 --> 00:11:46,777
often maybe we're having conversations, somebody thinks something we don't or

114
00:11:46,777 --> 00:11:53,707
that feels disrespectful and it immediately sends us into a kind of fight defensive mode.

115
00:11:53,707 --> 00:11:58,477
This may look like us creating arguments before just trying to have discussions.

116
00:11:58,477 --> 00:12:05,997
This may lead to sometimes we'll be physically aggressive or using harsh or dehumanizing language.

117
00:12:05,997 --> 00:12:11,977
And sometimes if this is us or other people, In the aftermath, we can see like, eesh

118
00:12:11,977 --> 00:12:16,937
I didn't need to do all of that. But what we want to do is to be able to slow it down

119
00:12:16,937 --> 00:12:31,357
communicate that what's happening is not OK in a way that doesn't physically or emotionally harm or disrespect anybody else.

120
00:12:31,357 --> 00:12:35,667
So one way to just even think about coming to

121
00:12:35,667 --> 00:12:43,677
conversations and to conflict is first we want to use our mindfulness strategies, we want to get calm in our body and grounded in our body.

122
00:12:43,677 --> 00:12:51,337
Research shows that once our heart rate is over a certain level. We don't hear very well, we don't hear very accurately.

123
00:12:51,337 --> 00:13:02,307
We often become like adversarial and are thinking about just being right and winning, as opposed to really hearing and connecting.

124
00:13:02,307 --> 00:13:07,677
And so we want to use those strategies to be calm before we come to communication.

125
00:13:07,677 --> 00:13:14,527
Can use a strategy to take a break if we need from communication. It's not bad to say I don't know if we're hearing each other

126
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:20,237
I think we've talked us out as much as we can right now. How are we? Just like, take a break, come back to this tomorrow

127
00:13:20,237 --> 00:13:25,957
we'll come back to this later and just reflect. Now, what's key when you do that is that when you're in that break time,

128
00:13:25,957 --> 00:13:29,557
you're not just fuming and trying to figure out how to you righ, you're trying to get

129
00:13:29,557 --> 00:13:40,397
calmer. You're trying to use empathy and perspective thinking and here's kind of a way to look at it with these two circles.

130
00:13:40,397 --> 00:13:45,237
For when we're talking to myself or when we're talking to other people who want to hold them accountable,

131
00:13:45,237 --> 00:13:53,537
you know, we want to say this is is the impact of the things that you're saying are the things that you're doing.

132
00:13:53,537 --> 00:13:59,027
But it's hard to hold ourselves and other people accountable and it really be heard and digested

133
00:13:59,027 --> 00:14:05,567
if we're not having that accountability, if curiosity and compassion.

134
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:12,207
Curiosity is as as, OK, what might be happening here if their late what might be happening?

135
00:14:12,207 --> 00:14:17,757
Let me not just assume that they're bad. We know that that's shame, shaming.

136
00:14:17,757 --> 00:14:21,147
But let's see what's happening. See what's contributing to it.

137
00:14:21,147 --> 00:14:26,097
Let's be open minded first to just kind of problem solve and see what might be happening.

138
00:14:26,097 --> 00:14:32,097
Doesn't mean that the behavior isn't still a problem that we need to address. But let's be curious and hear what's happening.

139
00:14:32,097 --> 00:14:38,627
And the compassion is just acknowledging that everybody has limitations,

140
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:43,067
weaknesses, and so we want to bring those together, we're going to hold them accountable

141
00:14:43,067 --> 00:14:49,527
we're going to keep those things together. And we can look at

142
00:14:49,527 --> 00:14:55,167
you can look at the difference between kind of like blaming and shaming versus healthy accountability.

143
00:14:55,167 --> 00:15:00,567
So think about when you're when you're communicating with yourself.

144
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:10,787
Due to all curiosity and compassion, there's no accountability or do you hold yourself highly accountable with no curiosity and compassion?

145
00:15:10,787 --> 00:15:18,607
Hopefully we bring the two together. Also, when we're talking to other people, we can go straight to accountability with no curiosity and compassion.

146
00:15:18,607 --> 00:15:24,747
And that doesn't typically help that tends to make our communication more aggressive.

147
00:15:24,747 --> 00:15:33,537
Or we can just be all curiosity and compassion and not really communicate the things that we need to see different or that are having a negative impact,

148
00:15:33,537 --> 00:15:38,567
and that kind of tends to lead to really passive communication.

149
00:15:38,567 --> 00:15:47,217
So think about this and try to bring the blend to your communication with yourself, your communication.

150
00:15:47,217 --> 00:15:52,377
In this last just slide kind of has it's an another acronyms,

151
00:15:52,377 --> 00:15:58,267
DEARMAN, nd it just gives some practical strategies.

152
00:15:58,267 --> 00:16:02,077
So when you're communicating, you want to describe what you're seeing.

153
00:16:02,077 --> 00:16:05,957
You don't want to say you're lazy your roommate.

154
00:16:05,957 --> 00:16:17,867
You can say, you know, I've noticed that you've been leaving the sink that dishes in the sink, and that makes it really hard to

155
00:16:17,867 --> 00:16:21,497
live here and feel comfortable and relax or, you know, different things like that.

156
00:16:21,497 --> 00:16:29,057
You want to describe what you're seeing in behavioral and specific terms and not just labels that

157
00:16:29,057 --> 00:16:34,817
tend to activate people's defensiveness and make it harder for them to hear what you're saying.

158
00:16:34,817 --> 00:16:46,707
You also wanted to use language thats specific, like not things that are like always or never, but things like I've seen this happening more recently

159
00:16:46,707 --> 00:16:54,257
things that are just more descriptive, less of these kind of broad, sweeping generalizations.

160
00:16:54,257 --> 00:17:01,137
You want to express how it impacts you personally, and when you do that, you want to use I feel.

161
00:17:01,137 --> 00:17:08,167
When you do this, I feel X, Y and Z way ,and

162
00:17:08,167 --> 00:17:15,497
when you do that you're owning that this is it's being vulnerable, but it keeps  you out of saying, you know, you did this.

163
00:17:15,497 --> 00:17:19,767
you do that, you do that, you think this is what's happening this is how it impacts me.

164
00:17:19,767 --> 00:17:24,607
That's usually easier said than done.

165
00:17:24,607 --> 00:17:30,667
You want to be assertive and not watered down your language, so you don't want to say things like, I don't know well maybe.

166
00:17:30,667 --> 00:17:39,147
I mean you might you may say some of those things, but when something clearly has impacted you, you want to see what clearly has impact.

167
00:17:39,147 --> 00:17:43,757
You want to try to not bubble wrap it or cushion it too much.

168
00:17:43,757 --> 00:17:50,357
Want to put out there clearly and concisely, this is what I'm noticing.

169
00:17:50,357 --> 00:17:57,667
Often we put in filler words like, well, only or just, when in actuality what happened really bothered us.

170
00:17:57,667 --> 00:18:02,887
So we want to communicate it in a way where that makes it clear.

171
00:18:02,887 --> 00:18:09,757
One of my favorite examples of this in music is the song The Artist Her

172
00:18:09,757 --> 00:18:18,157
It's the acronym ETR. She has a song called Focus and she's saying basically, I would like you to focus on me,

173
00:18:18,157 --> 00:18:27,307
but the tone of the music is so soft and so sweet that you would almost not even know how hurt or frustrated she is.

174
00:18:27,307 --> 00:18:33,697
And so that can be a good example. Like, you can go in and listen to it. When I'm telling somebody, something bothers me.

175
00:18:33,697 --> 00:18:41,897
Does it come across so soft and fluffy that they don't hear the meat of what I'm saying, and this is,

176
00:18:41,897 --> 00:18:47,717
again, one of those ones where you may have to practice a little bit ahead of time. What are the key things that I want to say?

177
00:18:47,717 --> 00:18:53,257
OK break it down to like two sentences that are just clear into the point.

178
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:58,197
Reinforce, so especially after the conversation.

179
00:18:58,197 --> 00:19:04,257
We want to let people know when they're when they're communicating with us in ways that are helpful, when they're changing in ways that are helpful.

180
00:19:04,257 --> 00:19:08,477
So we want to let people know. You know, I noticed that you did this. I really.

181
00:19:08,477 --> 00:19:15,397
I can kind of keep change and things happening in the direction that we want them to.

182
00:19:15,397 --> 00:19:20,167
We want to be mindful, and so this is a word I know you've heard it a gazillion times in our curriculum,

183
00:19:20,167 --> 00:19:23,927
but it's so key when we're in the conversation.

184
00:19:23,927 --> 00:19:28,027
Are we reading or noticing our heart rate? I mean, noticing our body language?

185
00:19:28,027 --> 00:19:37,467
Are we noticing the self talk that's happening? And are we able to coach yourselves to come down to really here and not just get lost in the emotion?

186
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:40,307
So, you know,

187
00:19:40,307 --> 00:19:49,777
we can have a story about how the other person is awful and against us or they can do or say one thing when we get lost in kind of a spiral about that.

188
00:19:49,777 --> 00:19:51,647
And if that's happening, it's normal,

189
00:19:51,647 --> 00:20:02,007
but it's probably a time for us to pause or to at least revisit the conversation after and say, like, what did they actually say?

190
00:20:02,007 --> 00:20:13,107
What did it actually mean? And am I still able to hear the important pieces or am I just kind of lost in that shaken up glitter bottle or glitter ball?

191
00:20:13,107 --> 00:20:19,657
Because if that's the case the conversation felt like. Appear.

192
00:20:19,657 --> 00:20:27,827
So this, you know, again, sometimes and it may feel really weird to have a conversation in a mirror or to have a safe and best friend and say,

193
00:20:27,827 --> 00:20:39,277
Ok, what are you noticing? How do I come across? Are we making eye contact, are we kind of getting smaller in our body, or are we

194
00:20:39,277 --> 00:20:48,227
upright and taking up space in a way that it communicates, that we feel confident in what we're expressing.

195
00:20:48,227 --> 00:20:55,857
This can be really difficult. And so you want to just become more aware of it and slowly try to make chips.

196
00:20:55,857 --> 00:21:03,467
And the last thing is trying to wherever possible and this is going to vary a little bit by situation.

197
00:21:03,467 --> 00:21:08,537
You see yourself as on the same team with the person, like there's a problem out here

198
00:21:08,537 --> 00:21:11,237
we kind of like sit on the couch, look at the problem,

199
00:21:11,237 --> 00:21:18,887
figure out how to address it as opposed to like across the table as adversaries trying to win, trying to be right.

200
00:21:18,887 --> 00:21:24,447
We approach a conversation and say let's let's see how we can get this right.

201
00:21:24,447 --> 00:21:32,517
Knowing that often it's not about you just getting all of what you want or the other person, not that there's going to be

202
00:21:32,517 --> 00:21:37,527
a shared conversation, perspective taking, hopefully both people walk away with

203
00:21:37,527 --> 00:21:49,587
increased understanding, connection, and feeling like to the degree possible, both people's thoughts and feelings have been heard.

204
00:21:49,587 --> 00:21:56,247
And to the degree possible that both people got

205
00:21:56,247 --> 00:22:02,047
something of what they needed out of the conversation. And it may be that

206
00:22:02,047 --> 00:22:07,537
the one person, let's say let's say they've been using really aggressive language or not cleaning up.

207
00:22:07,537 --> 00:22:09,037
Maybe what they got th

208
00:22:09,037 --> 00:22:16,987
They just felt respect it as a human while they were being held accountable and that they were going to be communicated with nonjudgmentaly,

209
00:22:16,987 --> 00:22:22,317
while they were trying to take that maybe the thing the behavior thing

210
00:22:22,317 --> 00:22:26,227
the thing that the other person feels like they walk away with.

211
00:22:26,227 --> 00:22:32,437
And so just knowing that if you go into the conversation with this only works if I get everything that I want out of it.

212
00:22:32,437 --> 00:22:34,907
That's not likely to usually happen.

213
00:22:34,907 --> 00:22:43,687
And so what's most important that you want to focus on and if you're not able to do those things, how are you gonna take care of yourself?

214
00:22:43,687 --> 00:22:52,487
How are you gonna maybe adjust your boundaries so that you're less affected? Either you're seen as harm.

215
00:22:52,487 --> 00:22:57,867
Think about these things, practice these things, kind of thing you know, go through and say what is this often look like

216
00:22:57,867 --> 00:23:03,557
go back to your last conflict go back to your last conversation.

217
00:23:03,557 --> 00:23:07,067
It's almost kind of like sometimes after a football game going back and kind of dissecting it.

218
00:23:07,067 --> 00:23:10,007
And this is where we can really get a lot of important information about

219
00:23:10,007 --> 00:23:17,357
what we're doing really well in our communication and where we want to improve to make it more effective.
