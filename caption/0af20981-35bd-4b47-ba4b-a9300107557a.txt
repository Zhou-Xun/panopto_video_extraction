1
00:00:05,727 --> 00:00:09,507
So my goal for this lecture is to
convince you that culture is relevant to

2
00:00:09,507 --> 00:00:12,840
designing health communications or
interventions.

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,050
So much so

4
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:19,440
that one of the foundational public health
program competencies is this, to describe

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:25,370
the importance of cultural competence
in communicating public health content.

6
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:27,560
So what's cultural competence?

7
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,490
Here's a definition from the US Department
of Health and Human Services.

8
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:36,730
Cultural competence is the capacity to
function effectively as an individual and

9
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:41,370
an organization within the context
of the cultural beliefs,

10
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:47,520
behaviors, and needs presented by
consumers and their communities.

11
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,304
Now typically,
cultural competence is talked about

12
00:00:51,304 --> 00:00:55,677
as demonstrating a mastery of
some finite body of knowledge,

13
00:00:55,677 --> 00:01:00,400
which can then be assessed as
either being present or not, right?

14
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,530
Do you know this fact about your audience?

15
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:05,770
Do you know about this culture?

16
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:10,380
Do you know about the expectations, etc.?

17
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:15,530
So for example,
cultural competence might involve using

18
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:20,270
examples of a type of food
that somebody might eat, or

19
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:25,660
a behavior, or a situation
that's familiar to an audience,

20
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:29,750
using the names or terms that
are commonly used by a community.

21
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:34,930
So if you're talking about let's
say sexual behavior between men

22
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:39,460
who have sex with men, what are the terms
that are commonly used in that audience.

23
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:44,280
And they might be very different terms
than an academic might tend to use or

24
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,460
a medical professional might tend to use,
but

25
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:52,450
being familiar with those terms represents
an aspect of cultural competence.

26
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:54,640
It's also involved in acknowledging and

27
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,870
respecting the beliefs that
are commonly held by an audience.

28
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:00,520
So are you aware, let's say,

29
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:06,330
of the prevailing religious faith in
a particular community or in a country?

30
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:11,280
And how might those beliefs interact
with the health messages, or

31
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,100
the scientific communications
that you're trying to get across?

32
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,610
Another aspect of cultural competence?

33
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:20,680
Providing information
that's actually useful.

34
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,260
If you're providing information about,
I don't know,

35
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:28,510
access to foods that are not
available in that community,

36
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:33,120
you're not culturally competent because
they're never gonna see those foods.

37
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,650
So why are you talking about them?

38
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:41,460
However, cultural competence
in the practice of anything,

39
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:46,372
communication included,
is not an endpoint itself, right?

40
00:02:46,372 --> 00:02:48,061
You're not done.

41
00:02:48,061 --> 00:02:52,329
You don't get to check the box and
say, yes, I'm culturally competent,

42
00:02:52,329 --> 00:02:56,802
when you know certain facts about your
audience, when you use words or phrases

43
00:02:56,802 --> 00:03:03,640
from that cultural language, when you use
examples from a particular community.

44
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,059
If at all possible, to start,

45
00:03:06,059 --> 00:03:11,178
you need to recognize the importance
of involving members of your

46
00:03:11,178 --> 00:03:16,778
target audience to check your own
assumptions, to learn their needs.

47
00:03:16,778 --> 00:03:18,510
What do they want to know?

48
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,930
What kinds of examples make sense to them?

49
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:26,880
What kinds of words do they need the
communication to be put into in order for

50
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,120
it to be understandable?

51
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,530
When you involve members of the target
audience, you can pilot test.

52
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:36,690
You can draft your communication,
your images, your words.

53
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:39,076
You can give it to them and
you can see how do they react.

54
00:03:39,076 --> 00:03:42,017
Do they go, yeah,
that's a really great example.

55
00:03:42,017 --> 00:03:46,180
Or do they go, what is this,
I don't get it?

56
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,691
Or, and this is the one you
really want to be worried about,

57
00:03:48,691 --> 00:03:50,700
do they they react negatively?

58
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:55,290
Did you unintentionally provide
something to them that's gonna evoke

59
00:03:55,290 --> 00:04:00,140
negative feelings or
reactions that's gonna really inhibit your

60
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:04,280
ability to be effective in
communicating with that audience.

61
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,620
And when you involve members of the target
audience, you can consider the alignment

62
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:15,810
of the language, or examples, terms,
etc., with what they're using.

63
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:19,610
Furthermore, learning more about your
audience enables you to target and

64
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:23,940
even tailor your messages
in very specific ways.

65
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:27,990
And in fact, there's growing evidence that
the more tailored your communication is

66
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:33,310
to the particular characteristics
of the group or ideally the person

67
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:36,305
that you're trying to reach,
the more likely it is to be effective.

68
00:04:36,305 --> 00:04:42,250
Now, doing all of these things can help.

69
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:47,250
But here's the key point,
only the audience will truly know

70
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:52,230
if those examples, or terms, or
other things that you're doing

71
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:57,590
in an effort to align culturally,
are actually gonna be helpful?

72
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:02,820
And therefore, more than anything else,
you need to commit yourself to learning.

73
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,930
In order words,
this is an audience focused process.

74
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,240
It's not about you.

75
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,450
It's about them.

76
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:12,140
You don't assume, you learn.

77
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:15,020
All of which relates to
a slightly different concept,

78
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:18,470
the concept of cultural humility.

79
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:22,380
So there's lots of definitions and lots
of issues that are involved in cultural

80
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:27,970
humility, but here's a short phrase that
I think captures a critical piece of it.

81
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:32,790
Cultural humility is about being
flexible and humble enough

82
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:39,140
to say that you do not know
when you truly do not know.

83
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:43,350
The process of cultural humility, and
it is a process, involves many things,

84
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:46,372
more than I can possibly go into here.

85
00:05:46,372 --> 00:05:50,350
However, there's a few key
ideas I do wanna touch upon.

86
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,480
Cultural humility is a lifelong process.

87
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,590
You're not done with it.

88
00:05:55,590 --> 00:06:00,040
It's a process that requires commitment,
and engagement, and

89
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03,784
continued work,
throughout your professional life.

90
00:06:03,784 --> 00:06:09,482
It requires self-reflection and
honest self-critique to reflect upon,

91
00:06:09,482 --> 00:06:15,930
what am I doing or saying, and
to critique is that appropriate.

92
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:21,400
And that process leads then to developing
mutually beneficial partnerships

93
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:28,720
that address, in a humble way,
the needs of your target audience.

94
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,840
I'm not gonna pretend that it's easy,
easy.

95
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,390
And I'm not gonna pretend
that this short overview

96
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:37,620
captures anything close to the broad
ideas of cultural humility.

97
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:41,850
But I want to introduce it to you because
it's important, and it's important for

98
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:43,880
many reasons.

99
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,090
But if there's none else
I want you to hold on to,

100
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:47,930
I want you to hold on to this one.

101
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:53,945
It's important because being humble
about what you know about your audience,

102
00:06:53,945 --> 00:06:59,973
being honest about what you don't know,
will make you a better communicator.

103
00:06:59,973 --> 00:07:04,481
Because it makes you focus not on
what you know, but on their needs and

104
00:07:04,481 --> 00:07:10,664
that's always a critical step in
being effective at communicating.
