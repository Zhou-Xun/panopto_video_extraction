1
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:52,800
This was a technical working here, and there are several different analysis points where you have one.

2
00:02:54,950 --> 00:03:03,970
One is overall cost effectiveness. The top arguments that are common to the of.

3
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:20,590
Interventions appear to be just focusing on minimal results, just like we did to a similar level.

4
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:29,310
Mortality used to be.

5
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:36,860
Just to be clear, what's going on is. At the time.

6
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:51,780
And each year to do this per year, it was like everything else.

7
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:07,470
With. One. Presenter Personal life begins at the very beginning of and in one person.

8
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:15,750
To answer your calls A, B and C.

9
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:24,370
The cost of students costs five years mortgages.

10
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:34,450
This comes after the cost of Greece, which is to have cost 1000 appearances.

11
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:39,730
This is one simple example.

12
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:57,610
So you're committing something white goods to counterfeit conservative with experience here, looking just like this one.

13
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:04,860
This is exactly what he looks like.

14
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:15,820
So you have. Isn't there a line here for supercomputers when you're.

15
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:30,630
So you kind of deal with these things once.

16
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:46,080
Next year, you might want to just leave because you don't have a clue what you're meant to be.

17
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:52,360
How many people are in terms of quality of life for the year?

18
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:58,570
One is basically poverty in this country.

19
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:03,190
80% life is someone's living.

20
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:13,020
It's democracy. You're always with equality and true.

21
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:25,240
Here is something. Here we have.

22
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:32,040
So this people want certainty. This is like.

23
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:40,520
Here's just weakness in. 114 shows disappointing results.

24
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:48,100
Just to recap, this actually is pretty interesting.

25
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:53,390
It's basically just because of the classroom at the very beginning.

26
00:06:54,650 --> 00:07:03,560
This is because it costs more to presenting.

27
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:09,490
So there's nothing really to disturb is good concerts.

28
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:18,200
However, we do see a difference between the two groups and this is true performance.

29
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:26,620
And first. He.

30
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:34,520
Yeah, that's right.

31
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:58,900
So this is the first year there's been this stream of disappointment proving to people all the subsequent years they need to be this now.

32
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:06,600
So. Any questions?

33
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:22,630
So this is we have a procedure and Rick is right, it's exactly the same script.

34
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:30,610
So the differences between these numbers here, over time,

35
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:51,760
the cost is higher and the relative risk of dying is the risk of dying and the costs for you just because those numbers.

36
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:02,870
The same kinds of results down here, Rose.

37
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:15,550
All we've done here has taken those positions, which is new to the state.

38
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:25,790
During the war is transportation those cars?

39
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:43,410
And then in 2012, like someone reconsidering plans to listen to my responses.

40
00:09:45,190 --> 00:10:04,980
Recent. And then if we do something, it is more costly and also has one liners and all the interesting thinkers in Austin.

41
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:14,450
Even though the cost here is good. This is 23,500 points.

42
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:24,020
$10,000. The police this.

43
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:33,549
So this is 1.8. This is the key thing.

44
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:49,040
And consider this. This is you're hearing something to dance past this piece of.

45
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:56,030
It's expensive. Is it? How many for quality, doesn't it?

46
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:14,140
It basically explains how much the war contained as the U.S. long anticipated by choosing this case.

47
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,920
We're spending 5000 546,000.

48
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:29,560
Here is most Americans really this is complementary to this table.

49
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:42,700
This graph shows this vertical axis of the positive axis of this positive axis.

50
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:57,640
I think that your compliance with this terms was 4 minutes.

51
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:24,950
So that's what's going on here with the time we have or whose territories we use that information to calculate costs all these years.

52
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:34,380
And this is on this final table at this point.

53
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:56,410
Sounds like it was pretty straightforward. Let's move on next to some more scenes.

54
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:06,220
Just to recap of 20% of people die each year if they're untreated, coming out with several different interventions.

55
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:17,950
We have the surgery. This is a 40% chance of dying as we do here.

56
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:22,480
Reduces your risk of dying as.

57
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:32,080
And of course, you can choose to not remember which one that's.

58
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:44,080
Like surgery, medication or something to make sure he wasn't following you.

59
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:49,990
Raise your hand to hear if you prefer the surgery.

60
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,580
Here. You can do it for medication.

61
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:07,870
What was their communication before you?

62
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:27,560
But it's difficult to remember what it looks like. And so this is one reason why we do this.

63
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:32,060
We like to associate with this as a treatment.

64
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:36,410
Maybe someone might have something to say later.

65
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:53,690
Let's say the surgery becomes something important out of you and we have costs as so I suppose this is a way to get through.

66
00:14:55,340 --> 00:15:11,030
The surgery is pretty specific if you're successful with the you're not the 5000 seconds down the road.

67
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:22,840
And there is assumptions here. Results of transparency.

68
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:41,640
Recall this with your effects analysis worksheet and also ask which assumptions of epidemiology assumptions here about mortality.

69
00:15:43,440 --> 00:16:03,490
Intervention, risk integration prevention, service intervention, epidemiology reference is to come in simple terms.

70
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:10,120
In the economist's terms.

71
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:33,990
All of our instructions with all of our conversations, top to bottom observations and visions.

72
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:43,530
Things like what's the matter with no intervention?

73
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:56,870
So you have 21% to 20% this season, 17%.

74
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:06,090
If you survive this one 3% chance, if you see that the surgeon.

75
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:13,460
I'm going on a serious charge against him.

76
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:21,690
You're going to see if you survive this.

77
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:48,910
We have the answer to this very similar was the one with the security interests and concerns for both of you.

78
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:57,750
He is also also calculating annual poverty adjusted life years that are really you.

79
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:11,020
And this example we're showing you, for example, one 1000 people or is the reason we're using representative, what is the one hypothetical person?

80
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:22,950
What's the probability of each when you're doing this morning, what you're doing is remember,

81
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:33,580
this is also actually the same population size for each of the 6000 people.

82
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:42,500
So it's a few years experience where you just stick to the street.

83
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:48,250
It's just one of the responses.

84
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:59,000
So where there is evidence for each policy to be.

85
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:04,060
I mean, the State Department's being.

86
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:11,790
So we ought to just use this right here.

87
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:23,940
What are the average, even just like disabilities or responses if someone.

88
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:48,310
Which is the. We have for us the outcomes for intervention and it was really great results for disease when.

89
00:19:52,440 --> 00:20:02,790
So point one security. One thing that's slightly different is this for the first time because it has those was one of the sort of.

90
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:17,550
What is important is he is here to see the results.

91
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:22,500
And we're all at this table.

92
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:26,010
At this table. Here's what we just saw.

93
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:35,780
For each intervention, if possible. It just seems like we're starting with the cheapest intervention.

94
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:39,020
First intervention.

95
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:43,940
It's the least expensive. The lowest.

96
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:55,200
If you choose a city where you're spending more money is going to be sorry you.

97
00:20:56,970 --> 00:21:05,340
And people are living longer because people want them because of your business.

98
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:12,700
And so your cost to be in this.

99
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:21,740
But they also have split. So we've got about $2,500 for the process.

100
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:30,630
And also, again, is just. So do.

101
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:49,580
One of the tricky things to do here is the most expensive intervention is here.

102
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:55,040
It's $52,000. This is because of the second surgery.

103
00:21:55,910 --> 00:22:13,760
And then one over $2,000 is the cost requires a patient who will be receiving care for two weeks.

104
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:20,840
So that is we have more of the adjustments with the.

105
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:32,710
So what is the cost of. And in this case, the surgery.

106
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,920
In this case, it's $1,000.

107
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:42,790
You just keep reading.

108
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:46,940
This is your reasonable question.

109
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:51,320
Why do we compare it to diseases like cancer?

110
00:22:54,010 --> 00:23:00,200
You're thinking about the surgical procedure. You want to use.

111
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:09,590
It is easier for this person to take the decision instead of the surgery.

112
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:18,130
Which is how much better is the surgery your choice?

113
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:29,800
Which is the decision? And there you're you're spending almost $30,000.

114
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:35,740
You're not getting any you just seem to be just like.

115
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:44,360
So ends up being $28,000 for this audience instantly.

116
00:23:47,350 --> 00:24:01,090
In another way. We look at the figure, we see, we have mention.

117
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:16,990
No intervention here because this was a long, slow.

118
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:25,000
But then we go from disease waiting to eyes.

119
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:34,900
And that suggests that looking for third party, this disease way to be ready and familiar with the disease.

120
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:58,350
We're getting a lot of bang for our buck. We choose to do a lot of digital quality aggressively into the service and the things we're

121
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:05,360
spending a lot of money in for a relatively small incremental increase or even sometimes.

122
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:22,820
We pause for a second. It gets worse.

123
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:32,810
So what if we have a patient? He's not eligible to get it through anything.

124
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:45,320
We think about it through procedures.

125
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:50,740
Application for he is still is not an option.

126
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:20,160
You know. Have you. Okay they just thinking that we would get rid of that right where it game space from no introduction to green.

127
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:29,930
It's pretty serious. Can you hear me okay?

128
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:37,320
Yes. Okay. So you would just be removing the disease weight option from the table or the chart

129
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:42,230
would be looking at it and you would just be looking at the back to back games, going from no intervention to get rid of it.

130
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:51,980
Exactly. So that's exactly what you can do. Say, well, for someone who's not eligible, this is way off the table.

131
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:57,380
So we should get rid of it, too.

132
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:04,220
You know, when you say, well, what's an additional positive here?

133
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:19,790
It's 3581, so that would be 28,000 for people to get rid of it.

134
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:28,040
Actually, it's pretty positive because when you compare it directly to the intervention and for some,

135
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:34,580
maybe some patients, it really is the appropriate person because they can feels.

136
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:44,160
However, for some patients who really can't take the test, this is where you get rid of those symptoms.

137
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:48,960
Maybe you'll see sleepers asking questions.

138
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:53,190
So which one, if any of these interventions is it possible?

139
00:27:53,460 --> 00:28:08,740
If you were to make a recommendation to do Medicaid, which interventions would you say to which.

140
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,680
So they take 4 to 6 weeks to do it.

141
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:30,060
You'll take a chance. So who would say that we should only pay for diseases?

142
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,000
So either we get rid of the servant.

143
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:58,910
Both. And then, of course, you could answer.

144
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:07,310
Yes, it could. Insurance companies doing a little bit of optimization.

145
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:13,490
So they might say, we're going to pay for this.

146
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:23,120
Maybe we pay for prostate cancer screening in the age of 40.

147
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:36,500
Major systems will need to pay for labor rooms in women with family history or women over the age of three,

148
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:44,620
sometimes to be some population specific recommendations for getting authorization.

149
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:59,440
So making sure we're not going to get rid of it unless you can show me allergic to the disease and even pay for it.

150
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:03,600
And we will see that.

151
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:18,920
We will talk about PCSK9 induced variations of hospital medication and prior authorization for those who can't get the permission to show you.

152
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:26,370
Try to understand this. And also you might have been misled.

153
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:41,110
This is not restricted to humans. It's possible that you might be required to try physical therapy before for an emergency situation.

154
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:48,400
So sometimes the reason these things occur and this is also in this hypothetical,

155
00:30:49,240 --> 00:31:04,660
hypothetical medical solutions, but right now is the survival profile looks like this.

156
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:18,690
So if you get this early, you will get severe disease.

157
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:30,700
In ten years we will be serving 171 season.

158
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:37,070
Technically, it adds up to longer life expectancy with the surgery.

159
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:49,800
So this is how many of you sent me to ask you to get rid of the criticism?

160
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:54,240
How many of you would prefer it? So these.

161
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:09,560
Maybe it was for the surgery. For many of you, it's difficult to choose.

162
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:22,400
And one of the reasons is you might be just the expected decision maker and say, I just got a 3% and so I don't care.

163
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:31,450
I really value those two years. And this is 3%.

164
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:40,729
So 40% chance of dying really is something that a lot of you answer.

165
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:51,480
Sure. When you think about this realistically for yourself in that initial 40% mortality, because you see, I'm not sure I'm ready for cancer.

166
00:32:52,220 --> 00:33:04,960
I think I might try to do so. Individuals with slightly different answers based on preferences to another year and graduate degree.

167
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:08,150
So around my diploma, University of Michigan.

168
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:16,930
So there might be some reason for the in the next four months or six months or 18 months, whatever it is.

169
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:25,790
And so is mortality risk, which I think is what you find is it's really fine,

170
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:40,820
but this is the cost of this analysis is going to assume we are that we don't have those very specific preferences except for the three specific,

171
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:48,880
specific schools. We want to be aligned with our opinions.

172
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:54,270
So individuals with different concerns for these things.

173
00:33:54,430 --> 00:34:09,740
So individuals when they say, look, really, we don't like this disease or want to be over it, I do want to die on the table, some disease negative.

174
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:17,870
So there might be some things for individuals that are going to be slightly

175
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:23,700
different preferences than we would see this particular plastic surgery measure.

176
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:39,470
So there might be some some reasons why we would pay for both of these, acknowledging that individuals might have slightly different preferences.

177
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:49,880
And by the way, we will see this in the future. Some people might have a slightly different quality associated with the different options.

178
00:34:50,390 --> 00:35:01,340
So someone might say, Well, we think we already like the possibility that I would be some changes and then also changes some results.

179
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:06,140
And the cost ratio now is about $30,000.60.

180
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:16,120
Is one of the things was really here is it was classifications.

181
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:20,270
Let's let's assume we have patients for the season.

182
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:32,720
We should be rid of it. Both legitimate options on the table is 4006 is not to give value for money not.

183
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:43,920
Mr. Panzer says $4,652 is a good value would.

184
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:53,030
It is too expensive.

185
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:59,680
It's not a good. It's like everyone's got their hands there.

186
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:07,380
You know, I would agree. For just getting on the plane. I was in search of 60 hours to find you.

187
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:12,290
It's a pretty good angle. It is easy.

188
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:20,720
Is it money? On the other hand, 228,000.

189
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:26,990
This is a little more close to Washington area here.

190
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:36,230
There's no consensus on this. It's interesting you were speaking with something else that was definitely pretty much there.

191
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:49,040
Things are changing in response to events, which is really interesting,

192
00:36:50,410 --> 00:37:07,550
is a since this is believed to possibly be interesting to see and also be considered.

193
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:19,360
But it's not. There is no official solution.

194
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:26,790
So as to what you should be prosecution.

195
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:34,750
Anything should be seen from this. It was used to my own interest.

196
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:52,280
Do not miss your recordings to become a U.S. senator and 30 years since, it is an agency.

197
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:12,240
So maybe when it comes. But I would say you think you can make something much more interesting?

198
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:24,420
There's no clear answer to this. It is what it this is about, what the decision is.

199
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:39,150
How should we use public resources to communicate what we want, the resources with who we are paying tribute to and accomplishments?

200
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:57,110
Britney Spears to make a decision not to go through with their injuries, which we didn't get to see.

201
00:38:57,830 --> 00:39:23,950
It's a big, wrong decision. Presumably they would lose residency visa to Sydney, which is not operating consistently through Canberra's existence.

202
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:31,900
It is always difficult to make these decisions against the tourism industry.

203
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:40,280
It's possible to find some of these consequences.

204
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:44,600
So it's a tricky do issue. There's no consensus.

205
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:51,750
With that said, to be broad consensus, you know something in this area is any response.

206
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:55,940
It's a little bit controversial and some people would say yes.

207
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:10,460
Any person. So this is.

208
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:17,960
There's a new a couple of different answer. Sorry, a couple different ones.

209
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:27,910
Now I want to show you to give you a little more of the. If you recall.

210
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:42,550
Regorafenib is the expensive new medication for cancer treatment.

211
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:50,550
This is interesting. We just run through the numbers here.

212
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:55,380
This works for these modules.

213
00:40:55,820 --> 00:41:01,830
First of all, it's a relatively simple.

214
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:15,100
So all this and this is how a lot of cancer research be suggest advanced cancer.

215
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:25,680
We start off. He escaped to Chelsea.

216
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:38,570
And what is he having for breakfast and progressing his business nowadays?

217
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:44,180
It means you can get going. So you can see his work in progress.

218
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:56,460
So you start off. Any for in here.

219
00:41:57,270 --> 00:42:04,740
Business in the purpose of lung cancer treatments is to slow the progression of the disease and also the purpose of the cancer treatment.

220
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:14,420
What is the mortality? This is a relatively simple person faced with the biggest one.

221
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:17,780
You just don't want to do it progressively.

222
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:23,590
Progressively. And so clinical trials start.

223
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:35,010
People need to stay inside the data for what's bigger case.

224
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:45,590
The disease is proving a huge problem is how long do you think before you answer questions?

225
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:59,320
How long do you have before you answer? So we try to save the lives of these charities.

226
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:07,450
We see it for breast cancer.

227
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:11,890
So from cynical salvation,

228
00:43:11,970 --> 00:43:22,830
you can see a testament with their support to give someone a random person to get past the point of care where they get to do anything,

229
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:35,280
whatever, and then we can. How quickly progress people progress going to be going with this important.

230
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:43,820
And one thing you notice here is the progression rate is about is.

231
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:56,910
Here we also have some costs. So these are costs and these rates are also easing.

232
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:04,700
So actually one of the highlights of this is the very severe disease with advanced cancer.

233
00:44:05,130 --> 00:44:13,590
So they have even without any treatment and we will get through this.

234
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:28,470
It's pretty serious. And also, given the progress, 45% progressed and you can progress to have 2% chance of dying each week.

235
00:44:28,990 --> 00:44:52,280
So the cost here is about $174,000 on a three year facilities with the progression free.

236
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:59,490
And then this and these are in the next few days.

237
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:10,820
If you're here, just copy it down here to have a look.

238
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:25,110
Very similar to what we considered. Very similar to the way people experience three different medicines.

239
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:38,490
If progression free survival in these three rates moving three times and then we can do that,

240
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:47,350
what fraction of the population is progressively progressed in each of these roles year?

241
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:53,730
So we can see here, we can go down this remember 52 races in a year.

242
00:45:54,270 --> 00:46:06,420
So in this case, support here is 52 weeks. Less than 1% of the population is progression free, but 30% is breast and 70%.

243
00:46:07,950 --> 00:46:13,980
This is a very 70% in year now be to please.

244
00:46:19,370 --> 00:46:23,870
And then we spoke to Greg about. Here.

245
00:46:23,870 --> 00:46:27,110
We can look at survival in one year, for example.

246
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:35,210
Very similar structure to this model here. Here we can see of 70% in one year is 56%.

247
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:43,540
So we have 30 something percent who live here.

248
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:47,810
We have 40% among at the end of one year.

249
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:58,160
So it's not acute, 56% in Sweden.

250
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:07,300
And when we. So it's really going to slow the progression or is not a story.

251
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:25,060
Mark Colvin. To the workable next week.

252
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:36,380
When it comes to quality, this is able weeks of supplied with life like yours.

253
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:41,680
This is simply progression free improvements.

254
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:53,660
You're not in. Comedy B and C, are you alive?

255
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:59,550
And if so, you have some reasons why that is.

256
00:47:59,590 --> 00:48:05,919
We can comment on five different years of your life.

257
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:23,620
We want to support you if you want to support supportive care on average, including 43 weeks, but it works out to be within three years.

258
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:32,030
We can look and see. Every five years.

259
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:36,230
Three weeks was one of 1.1.

260
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:45,290
Perfect, but. It's not on.

261
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:49,350
So let me just sort of work here.

262
00:48:49,350 --> 00:48:53,080
Here. Bring in Reynolds.

263
00:48:55,600 --> 00:49:00,760
Hundreds of people have been working on the place.

264
00:49:01,090 --> 00:49:05,800
Making the progression of the disease. Rest of.

265
00:49:11,390 --> 00:49:28,110
Right here on this. Probably the costs for the week zero the first week for.

266
00:50:00,310 --> 00:50:12,460
So I guess I'll the separation. So do you want to let us know your comments?

267
00:50:12,970 --> 00:50:16,130
I will be honest with you.

268
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:26,950
I think we would multiply the weekly cost by the number.

269
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:39,099
We're not hundred dollars times what you would in this case this year.

270
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:49,690
The sum of this example is the same when you see the receipt.

271
00:50:52,720 --> 00:51:05,920
And so when we see them and when I did this, we have noticed to put in dollars $0.20.

272
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:18,610
So it's always going to point to that particular weekly cost. But is it because the formula is down food stamps or isn't simply the consequence

273
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:24,670
of the price but then hands together the people like that particularly want to do.

274
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:49,660
We have to understand that because the number of people in poverty dying so their lives are going to lose some caring for people with to care.

275
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:54,360
In average, it cost us 7600.

276
00:52:00,310 --> 00:52:08,430
You know, it's only just some of these things and you're just like, it's first, first.

277
00:52:14,330 --> 00:52:23,070
This time its. Album material for.

278
00:52:28,170 --> 00:52:34,530
How do you think we should calculate all like can it first?

279
00:52:38,590 --> 00:52:48,770
So yes, of course we did. One of the big and people are going to.

280
00:52:57,210 --> 00:53:03,120
Sorry. I'm blinking. Please do me.

281
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:17,860
No, I'm sorry. I already. I don't know what we know how many people were right.

282
00:53:18,910 --> 00:53:26,550
We know how many people are progressive in region. And we also know what's progression for disease from this disease.

283
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:39,180
Okay. So then it would be like regression sees seven, six times a year people in the city and six times the people in the state.

284
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,780
Yeah. 3.76 is the 41.

285
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:56,400
How many people in the inner circles in terms of what it would mean less than one person to increase the rate?

286
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:06,560
And then we see the transition back to the business when we were at the zero six.

287
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:11,370
What's what is of this is intriguing.

288
00:54:11,610 --> 00:54:18,380
What is the chance for the populations in the desert?

289
00:54:21,390 --> 00:54:38,670
So well, let's assume that this progression here is what I want to calculate how many what interested me when we're in this first time period.

290
00:54:38,770 --> 00:54:48,630
This was first. So we live in a number and we kind of see it here.

291
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:52,730
We see in this case it's one representative again.

292
00:54:53,710 --> 00:54:59,640
Again, you see. Let me ask you, what do you think?

293
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:08,440
Typically, we need to formulate your case now and then.

294
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:21,759
We can't resolve this because it's we easy for them to say that this is a matter.

295
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:29,950
It's basically doing the same thing as that person gets a taste of what it wants to be, who's going against this person.

296
00:55:31,330 --> 00:55:50,890
And these people are dying right after one year, one year, 73% in Pakistan, 70% of the world's populations,

297
00:55:51,170 --> 00:56:03,020
it was 70% died after one year, 90 something percent of the year, and 90% of reasons.

298
00:56:03,730 --> 00:56:13,300
How could we do this? We were doing 3340 just because we remind you of this purpose here.

299
00:56:15,930 --> 00:56:30,300
This is quality time and all these time.

300
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:37,350
This area was.

301
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:55,690
How can this area think when people are not ready for this is this time is less than one year and the only place is three points to six.

302
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:08,080
We won't be living in the theory for this reason.

303
00:57:14,110 --> 00:57:29,980
Sorry. Go ahead. So we're up with seven, six, which is kind of all these numbers out and we're getting reported just like it's people are dying.

304
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:42,120
That's what we've really invested is not taking into account the people that are leading that state,

305
00:57:42,490 --> 00:57:49,360
that when it's when it is in the state, because over time you're multiplied by sports.

306
00:57:49,360 --> 00:58:00,490
Over here, for example, you know, most of that one, it's because 90% to 10% of them.

307
00:58:01,090 --> 00:58:13,120
So equal time is much more it wasn't one but doesn't include don't point to just because I mean because then you anticipate the dead as well.

308
00:58:14,060 --> 00:58:26,950
Yes. So you just if you have progression free, life wise progression and then the number progressed was the point where the difference.

309
00:58:28,070 --> 00:58:33,410
He is one of the things here that's a little bit tricky.

310
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:40,490
This is. At the time.

311
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:51,879
It's an instance where there are tiny increments a year.

312
00:58:51,880 --> 00:59:02,200
Right. So what it is, it's being used as a tool to get into use.

313
00:59:02,950 --> 00:59:11,860
Exactly. So we were calculating. Each one of these people used to be vehicles.

314
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:16,770
And so what we need to do is exactly that.

315
00:59:16,790 --> 00:59:24,400
We need to see if you're allowed to be seven, six years.

316
00:59:25,810 --> 00:59:33,250
And you we want a 50 square meter because you don't need any more paper.

317
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:41,150
So now. So what do we do?

318
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:46,400
Here's the point. Since three, it's less than one.

319
00:59:46,710 --> 00:59:55,170
This makes sense because when you see life expectancy 8.83 years.

320
00:59:56,340 --> 01:00:02,640
The boys should be in school as people with this condition.

321
01:00:04,670 --> 01:00:13,530
So we want to 40 just. Thanks for helping with that.

322
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:25,650
I'm sorry I didn't get it because no one else can use to hear me use.

323
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:32,310
You were this proposed?

324
01:00:57,110 --> 01:01:00,480
This is also a live interview through the end of the first time.

325
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:05,700
Your response? Somebody else is in the audience.

326
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:21,390
She was coming to the first part of it is the great.

327
01:01:22,030 --> 01:01:28,350
This is the district. That is this is the.

328
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:41,290
I mean, a few people are here.

329
01:01:57,010 --> 01:02:11,100
It's just it's almost doesn't make it easier for us hearing these accounts these.

330
01:02:15,890 --> 01:02:23,760
Implying that this company's. All those small items.

331
01:02:27,820 --> 01:02:31,550
Does anyone see here?

332
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:52,040
We have more time here with audiences like.

333
01:02:58,590 --> 01:03:09,780
The discount rate was not exactly discount rate.

334
01:03:10,540 --> 01:03:22,069
You see how much less valuable is something one year that's 3.3% is what is my model.

335
01:03:22,070 --> 01:03:28,180
Here's the thing, for instance. I don't discount things like 3%.

336
01:03:29,740 --> 01:03:37,370
Basically 3% demand percent would make in the future is much smaller.

337
01:03:38,260 --> 01:03:44,140
If the second, whatever it is, you're so lucky to escape this business.

338
01:03:48,970 --> 01:03:58,990
And one thing you'll notice here in this example is the value is very different from what all these.

339
01:04:03,660 --> 01:04:11,570
So the are basically the same policies are very similar to the Clintons.

340
01:04:13,590 --> 01:04:26,830
Why do you think that is? Basically. We think the discount values are similar to previous.

341
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:37,820
Yeah. It was right after the time periods of the recent.

342
01:04:38,990 --> 01:04:43,870
Everyone is dying really, especially with supportive care.

343
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:49,840
And you have this for years. 99% of the population is dying.

344
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:58,780
So there is a projected we are all of the things are happening, the cost of living in the very near future.

345
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:04,700
So just hope that sort of the future.

346
01:05:07,740 --> 01:05:11,310
So this is those are the results for care.

347
01:05:12,210 --> 01:05:25,140
It's going to cost us dollars in the audience for these things.

348
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:38,650
And this is because these spreadsheets, which are basically to see just be able to use everything, the difference in their own infrastructure.

349
01:05:40,170 --> 01:05:53,310
Because in your state, you're saying, hey, can I be this spreadsheet?

350
01:05:55,870 --> 01:06:01,630
He's still to see things, you know.

351
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:14,440
It's 4000 hours. This is to see what it's the rest.

352
01:06:17,980 --> 01:06:21,290
And most of the time.

353
01:06:24,740 --> 01:06:38,660
So during the holidays, we have to through $17000 to $7 million or something.

354
01:06:40,820 --> 01:06:44,570
But we're also getting .8.6.

355
01:06:44,570 --> 01:06:57,110
Three point. It's about what's going to be watching here, at least some of our numbers here.

356
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:05,380
Let's skip this stuff here.

357
01:07:14,980 --> 01:07:22,270
Happening. You just.

358
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:37,090
So what are our incremental costs in support of care?

359
01:07:37,130 --> 01:07:47,660
What are the proposals? So.

360
01:07:48,890 --> 01:07:56,170
As opposed to. You can track down an expert here.

361
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:18,220
So let's get to the numbers. It seems that we're already living in this one.

362
01:08:18,610 --> 01:08:22,060
We want some sort of incremental.

363
01:08:24,130 --> 01:08:29,460
This is going to.

364
01:08:33,030 --> 01:08:55,650
If there's any good quality things like workouts in the evening, the other stuff like the white ones or you just wait.

365
01:08:56,250 --> 01:09:04,830
So this is spending a lot of money to do so even though the money you just.

366
01:09:08,580 --> 01:09:20,210
So is this really good value? Once be.

367
01:09:27,710 --> 01:09:30,790
By the way, if you want to see the crown.

368
01:09:35,210 --> 01:09:42,440
It's going to be. Okay.

369
01:09:42,770 --> 01:09:46,070
So scatterplot here.

370
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:56,980
The band's debut. Two series is supportive care.

371
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:28,810
I'm going to stay here and you have to do your best work here is giving you quality, just like your business class.

372
01:10:32,570 --> 01:10:42,230
All of this is. There's lots.

373
01:10:46,950 --> 01:10:52,030
Like most Americans, we. There's resistance to.

374
01:10:55,300 --> 01:11:02,790
Do you? What those points.

375
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:15,750
Costs. It's.

376
01:11:29,340 --> 01:11:32,520
So that's pretty good.

377
01:11:36,760 --> 01:12:05,540
His presentations and extended presentations on the opportunities and activities supporting the mission seeks to present funding points to support.

378
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:20,930
I wanted to present your student. Might be able to bring some excellent work.

379
01:12:28,870 --> 01:12:59,500
So this is the dating site for teens to wonder what's his presentation going to be compared to how useful reviews would be?

380
01:13:00,940 --> 01:13:12,660
So we'll have to see if this is true.

381
01:13:14,670 --> 01:13:33,640
You can use this because you think this is what you get paid to do anything.

382
01:13:36,410 --> 01:13:56,260
So what's the poverty rate as opposed to like 41?

383
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:35,640
Think that's one, two, three sources, which is why I think the analysis is looking to use all these this.

384
01:14:48,510 --> 01:14:54,120
Receive a sense of what that's all about.

385
01:14:55,480 --> 01:15:00,840
I'm sorry to be interested today.

386
01:15:01,950 --> 01:15:07,270
So your questions, first questions. Question, would you be speaking with the decision?

387
01:15:09,980 --> 01:15:35,770
What so have to do is to one of these systems.

388
01:15:35,910 --> 01:15:39,210
Daniel. It's impossible.

389
01:15:42,860 --> 01:15:57,650
It could be good for screens, instigate positive systems, screens.

390
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:17,660
These are differences, of course. So the first part of this is to try to solve this issue and foster positive.

391
01:16:20,260 --> 01:16:27,900
Or to increase the costs.

392
01:16:28,090 --> 01:16:32,230
Costs to reduce costs.

393
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:45,870
Commander in Chief, you don't have to see the results of a peace treaty if the U.S. military.

394
01:16:50,030 --> 01:16:59,940
We saw the cost of these.

395
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:05,950
I just wasn't used.

396
01:17:24,860 --> 01:17:27,880
Okay. It's more than 40.

397
01:17:28,730 --> 01:17:47,010
It's nothing to me. It's just that your presence is simply because there's a difference.

398
01:17:47,750 --> 01:17:59,030
I did it once and I didn't want to see it in person.

399
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:50,690
It's. It's.

400
01:19:17,110 --> 01:19:48,240
It's. It's.
