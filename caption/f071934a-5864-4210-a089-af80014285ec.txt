1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,480
Yes. Are we doing it? Yes, we're doing it. Sure.

2
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,550
Open a presentation. I don't need you to. Okay. So.

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,880
So, first of all, hopefully you're here for Epic 679. I am. At least so.

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:24,840
And what I'd like you to do, as I'm kind of talking you through the list, your first few items are go to poll everywhere and do this.

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,970
So I want to remind you,

6
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:35,220
you have to write all ten words first and then hit submit or it will like there won't be enough options for us to do the class.

7
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:40,740
The university doesn't pay for the real version. So the free version has some cap.

8
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:46,860
And so I would just type all ten words and then hit submit. Otherwise not everybody will get to participate.

9
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,560
So the first thing I would say is. Hi. Happy New Year.

10
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:59,580
My name is Brianna Isaac. You can call me Professor or Professor Magic or Dr. Magic, whichever you prefer.

11
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:06,390
The I one will do introductions in a minute.

12
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:13,449
And you know, I've been teaching this class for a long time, but it's always good to see you all also.

13
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:17,999
So your your you know, this will be a good it's about a little bit bigger class that we typically have.

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:29,910
So I'm excited to see the interest. The the item with the dark green top is our course syllabus.

15
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:36,360
The thing that probably matters the most to you all is a little box that's on the bottom of page two.

16
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:42,150
This is everything I need you to do in this class. So all of your assignments when they are due,

17
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:48,389
the as I'm going to talk about in a minute and if you've already if if some of the what I'm going to talk about

18
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:54,120
the top is a is a repeating what the welcome lecture online which about 20 minutes if you haven't watched that.

19
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,500
Yeah please do but if you haven't that's okay. You're not going to be lost.

20
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:01,950
How about I kind of give you the key highlights of that, but it's always good to kind of know what's coming.

21
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:08,700
So this is what's coming here. The other thing the other thing I want to say, this is a long class.

22
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:15,490
We're in the basement, dungeon slash the basement of the Alamo, you know, that you didn't know existed there.

23
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,430
You don't even know what I'm talking about. So you don't.

24
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,679
Please tell me. Do any of you know what I'm talking about when I say the basement?

25
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,120
Well, okay, so you need to watch. Pee-Wee Herman is big adventure, and then you will know, okay,

26
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:35,600
so this is we're going to work and we will always take a 20 minute break to stretch at least 20 minutes to stretch.

27
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:38,610
Go get you know, eventually they're going to open up that cafe and it's page one.

28
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:43,139
It'll probably be like April 5th when it opens. But anyway, we will.

29
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:47,970
We will. I you know, I have a caffeine dependency and I will need to go and caffeinated.

30
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:55,319
The the other thing is that the course schedule is on this page.

31
00:02:55,320 --> 00:03:03,209
For those of you who if you look at the announcement, you know that I've asked you to fill out which week you like to present the weekly reading.

32
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:06,990
So I kind of want to work on assigning that to folks this week.

33
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:10,170
So if you're sort of on the fence about the class,

34
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:15,299
just let me know that in the survey or if you kind of if you got looking at a couple of different classes, just let me know that in the survey.

35
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:20,000
And I can kind of just I mean, there's no problem.

36
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:28,530
Like I'll be able to adjust as, as we go. But um, this is kind of the course is organized, roughly the kind of thirds I am pretty certain,

37
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:33,530
although I'm confirming that we're going to be going to the Washtenaw County Mental Health Court.

38
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:37,290
Note that this starts at 130. I don't control what time court starts.

39
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:43,110
So if you are available at 130, we would love I will be there at 130.

40
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:47,879
If you are not if you can only join us at 230, that's okay. But you're going to miss part of the proceedings.

41
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:54,990
Okay. But we are going to take a field trip and then we'll get a chance to talk to the judge and to all the people that are involved in the court,

42
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:59,700
all the staff and things like that. So this is something I always do for my undergrad course.

43
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:03,390
And then last year we started doing it for the grad course and it was a good experience.

44
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:12,030
Okay, so I'm not going to go over the details, I guess, but I'll ask for questions and we'll do introductions.

45
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:24,780
All right. So I guess please. Yes, of course. Well, the table and the school said that the project check points three, four, five.

46
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:28,470
You want to make that the course schedule has to do on Wednesdays.

47
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:31,740
I just want to go do that. Supposed to be a Friday.

48
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:37,950
I'm so sorry. So they should. So this has to do on Wednesdays, the course schedule.

49
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,910
Yeah. So the so thank you for that.

50
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:47,100
So whatever it is on canvas, which I think matches this, this table is correct,

51
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:52,559
but I will double check that there are two that I need you to have them due on Wednesday because we're going to talk about them in class.

52
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:58,650
So that's checkpoints one and two and the rest of them should be due on Friday.

53
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:03,100
So you have a little bit more time. And then the sixth is your class presentations.

54
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,089
That's also Wednesday.

55
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:16,070
So there's this table on the bottom of page two is correct, but I will double check to make sure Canvas has got those dates in this class.

56
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:21,970
That's the 100. Thank you for that. Other questions.

57
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:34,210
So so I'd love us for to do introductions. By doing that, I'll ask you to say your name and then what program you're in and then an unpopular opinion.

58
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:37,809
So by that I mean something everybody else likes that you don't like. So I'll start.

59
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:45,350
So my Instagram is like I am a professor here in epidemiology and I do not like the band U2.

60
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:51,580
I really don't. I can't I just cannot stand them. So I know.

61
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:58,059
So then you're like, maybe that's not unpopular. I think that's I mean, that record sales would have you believe that's an unpopular opinion.

62
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:02,620
So you want to start? You're like, you took mine.

63
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:06,990
Hi, my name is Jackie. I am a second year general a bit.

64
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:18,130
And each student, it's very hard to come up with a unpopular opinion and quickly something that you like that other people don't like.

65
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:28,960
It can be a food, maybe a movie going to a place like maybe you don't like hiking or I have to like it.

66
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:36,150
Okay. Yeah, I'm a big fan of, like, terrible last name puns.

67
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:39,880
Oh, so Walker. So, like, I just like, early thinking.

68
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:43,569
Oh, gotcha. So you are so you're unpopular.

69
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:47,140
Opinion is that you like bad puns. Yeah, that's a good, unpopular opinion.

70
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:50,920
Okay, bad puns. That's what I'm right. This is going to help me remember people's names.

71
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:54,280
Jackie. Bad Walter Walker. It's going to be fine. Okay. Yeah.

72
00:06:54,290 --> 00:07:01,890
Here. Good. Could it be the opposite?

73
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:07,740
No, it's an unpopular. Oh. A popular opinion.

74
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:13,800
Is that. How am I going to know what you. Everyone is going to like it. I mean, something everyone likes, but I don't like.

75
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:18,570
Yes, yes, yes. Okay. So my name is Araba.

76
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:24,450
I'm in the general food truck, and my own path is.

77
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:31,259
I don't think you should sleep with your kids in a bed. In the bed.

78
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:36,620
She lets you across the line at this point. Well, my mind will be very sad, so.

79
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:39,780
But that's okay. And that's a very good. I'm heartbroken. I appreciate that.

80
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:43,230
Yeah. Okay. So is our our Araba.

81
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:47,700
Am I saying it correct? Okay. Yes, Cynthia. Okay. My name is Cynthia.

82
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:53,879
Second year general. I've been a student and I don't really know if this is the proper time to go with that.

83
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:59,430
I don't like hamburgers right now. Yeah, I you know, they are made up.

84
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:03,659
Disgusting. They don't eat. So I think that's. Yeah, yeah, that's very bad for beef.

85
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:09,149
Yeah. So it sounds good. Yeah. Hi, I'm Jordan.

86
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:10,979
I'm a dual degree student,

87
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:18,510
so I'm doing an M.S. in the environmental school and conservation ecology and then the MPH and the environmental sciences track here.

88
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:22,710
Um, this is my third year of my master's program, but particularly a seven year gap.

89
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:31,030
And my unpopular opinion is I don't like chocolate hazelnut, lot of stuff.

90
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:36,180
So that's I just feel sad for you. I presume that's not a voluntary thing.

91
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:40,079
It's just like. It's like these folks who can't have cilantro. Yeah, it's just like water.

92
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,100
Oh, my God. I'm sorry if there's anybody here or something.

93
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:45,780
Okay. My name is Burnley.

94
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:54,900
I'm the second year in the Environmental Sciences Department, and this is very unpopular here, but I think my love for them is growing.

95
00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:00,570
I do not like cats or dogs. Oh, I know reptiles like urban turtle.

96
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:06,420
Oh, and yet, you know, having more friends around there, they're they're not anymore.

97
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,690
But I do something bigger with my toes, so I know.

98
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:13,049
Well, they don't they don't come with like the salmonella that the turtles come with.

99
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:16,740
So I had a turtle growing up, so I'm an owner.

100
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:21,180
So we also we had an iguana and a snake too.

101
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:31,000
But now we've moved to the good parts of Burnley. You said, okay, yeah, I live there and I'm actually in the nutrition classes.

102
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:35,819
Mm hmm. Mm. I do not know.

103
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:39,150
So should I feel bad myself that you should?

104
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:46,170
It's a really important thing. I mean, I it's. And if it tastes the way that people who can't even tell me that I get it, but it's.

105
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:50,010
It is a miracle or possibly some people like it because.

106
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:54,210
Yeah, some people get that. I get that right. Yeah.

107
00:09:54,450 --> 00:10:01,499
Oh I'm sorry. What a weird y y you know where that meets the genetic sort of evolution?

108
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:06,270
They're like, and then some minor evolutionary advantage to thinking this tastes like some of them.

109
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:10,499
So yeah, I am. I'm Caitlin. I'm here.

110
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:15,500
I'm a general up in student and then my opinion system is Jordans.

111
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:20,520
I also don't like chocolate and before I you have to come up with a new and popular kind of cause.

112
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:25,190
It's another one that by definition, that's making it popular, I thought.

113
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,440
Do you come back to me? You can have no more.

114
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,360
No more. No chocolate. Okay. That's right. I have like I could.

115
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:39,930
I mean, I can probably come up with 50 unpopular opinions, but I have a lot of opinions.

116
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:43,380
So that's, you know. Yes, go ahead.

117
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:47,820
I'm Nick. I am in the general MBA program as well.

118
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:56,100
I'm stuck in year and my unpopular opinion, it doesn't have anything really to do with her as a person.

119
00:10:56,310 --> 00:11:02,110
Oh, it definitely does. But go ahead. Yeah, I, I, I don't understand that type of Taylor.

120
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:10,529
Oh, well, she's not that great, and I definitely do find her a little insincere.

121
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:15,890
I was going to say, I think this is somewhat personal.

122
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:22,320
Well, I would say I would say your opinion safe in here about I think you that's that

123
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:25,570
I would have agreed with you until her latest album which I think is amazing,

124
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:29,339
but. Yeah, my name is Jonathan.

125
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:32,460
I also go by on my second year general student.

126
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:37,250
My unpopular opinion is coffee is atrocious. I know they're wrong.

127
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:46,470
You just you you've been you've been drinking bad coffee and I tell them to make me their favorite drink.

128
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:52,050
So I, I, I drink it like an espresso black every day.

129
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:55,650
So, like, I'm just I'm. I'm beyond help, you know what I mean?

130
00:11:55,650 --> 00:12:00,630
So I also just have a dependency. So, like, my body just is, like, just mainline it for me, so.

131
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:12,100
Oh. Hi, everyone. My name is the Chain and I also go by Katherine Hobby Cab and I'm a second year general AP students.

132
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:21,000
And my opinion is that I don't like competitive gaming and I mean, yeah,

133
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,480
all my friends like wake up out of the game, but I like my favorite game right now is that Elden ring.

134
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:29,880
So I am my own world, [INAUDIBLE] my own home.

135
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:38,280
And this is the is are these like PC games or like I don't know.

136
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,139
Yeah, yeah, I have a I have an 11 year old.

137
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:46,370
So that's like my level of but although I used to play The Sims a lot, so like a similar, like noncompetitive.

138
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,250
Yeah. So, yes, yes, that sounds good.

139
00:12:51,030 --> 00:13:02,460
My name is Marie. I am a first year global health student and my, um, popular opinion is that I love when animals have human things.

140
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:12,930
Oh, I like that they're animals for you to have.

141
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:18,540
And just think, okay, that's fine. You're like, This is my dog, Mike.

142
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:23,220
I mean, Michael, but you got to find like. Like I would name a dog.

143
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:27,000
That's sorry. That is a perfect and probably we're going to thank you so much.

144
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:32,759
That is sorry but that that one hit home. Okay. My name is Rachel.

145
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:36,200
I'm also a first year student and global health immunology.

146
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:42,479
Um, I don't know if it's as unpopular up here. I'm from Alabama, and so at home, it's really controversial.

147
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:52,000
I don't like sweet tea, which is I blacked out when you said your name because I was still thinking about the, um.

148
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:56,730
Rachel. Thank you. I was talking about all the mikes out there.

149
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:01,380
It's just a confusing conversation. And so. Ah, Rachel, you are in the program.

150
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:06,629
A lot of concern. Yeah, sweetie. Can be too sweet, but that's a hard.

151
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:10,350
That's a hard. So. So Alabama.

152
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:14,970
Okay, well, I lived in Georgia for a while, so we do chat in Virginia, but, um.

153
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:23,010
Hi, everyone. I'm Lauren. I'm a second year general student, and my unpopular opinion is I don't like American cheese,

154
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:35,490
I like other issues, but I was raised on that and I will have any other cheese than I was raised on that trash.

155
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:40,110
And so, I mean, I want to find it, but, you know, it's childhood memories.

156
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:48,630
Hi, my name is Meghan. I'm also a second year John AP student and mine's kind of like a spin off of the undertones.

157
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:59,219
Um, I like tea better than coffee, and the more options I have to add more than just my husband.

158
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:04,850
But, you know, French too. So, I mean, I can tolerate it as a as a I can understand it.

159
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,979
We went through like multiple years of marriage counseling, but I've been able to come to an understanding.

160
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:14,850
Yeah, go ahead. Hi, I'm Maria.

161
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:21,659
I'm a second year global health EVA students my and popular opinions and nothing against James

162
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:27,620
Cameron but I hate the movie Avatar and I hated it since I watched that you know and I don't.

163
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:31,910
And I didn't watch the second one. I'm not going to they're going to watch the third or fourth.

164
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:35,430
Fourth. He's really going to he's really going to be hurting him financially.

165
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:40,620
I know. Because actually he really is just watching. And he's going to be he's going to be on the street.

166
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:44,790
So I guess I say, yeah. Okay.

167
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:48,569
All right. Last one. Go ahead. I'm Quentin. I'm a second year.

168
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:52,649
Jackie and I also have a regional advisor opinion.

169
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:56,880
But I am always against all forms of seafood I don't like.

170
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:02,070
I don't know what that is. Here it is from Washington State.

171
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:06,060
Oh, yeah. No, not having salmon and stuff. That's okay.

172
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:08,790
All right. So hopefully I'll try that. So this is fun.

173
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:14,579
I will try to remember your names and not your unpopular opinions, but sometimes, you know, who knows how it's going to go.

174
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:17,730
So. All right.

175
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:21,090
So okay, that's good. Welcome, everybody.

176
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:28,710
The other thing I guess I don't I guess I'm going to get to this in a second, but let me let's let's kick off here.

177
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:34,500
So today, what I want to do is I want to review the course organizational activities.

178
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,870
We've talked a little bit about syllabus already in the schedule.

179
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:43,710
And then if you have questions either today or next week, you can let me know where you can always message me through canvas.

180
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:47,820
Oh, that's that's why I want to say please always. There is a there's a I think it's called inbox.

181
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:52,500
So it's the on your screen, the function within canvas.

182
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:56,490
Please, please, please try to remember to use that. When you're messaging me.

183
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:03,090
I get an email when you do that, but it flags it special and so I know exactly where it is and I try to respond to those right away.

184
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:12,660
I don't want you to ever have to see my inbox. It's a mess. And so just it really helps me be able to provide a timely response to you so

185
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,290
long after we're done talking about logistics because we only meet once a week,

186
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:22,350
we got to get right into it. So we'll talk. We're going to talk about what does it mean to even take a public health approach to mental health.

187
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:25,560
I know many of you have taken courses in psychology. What is how is this different?

188
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,330
Is it just like psychology of a bunch of people?

189
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:36,659
And then we'll talk about what mental disorders are and sort of the tools that we use to understand that to have a common nomenclature.

190
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:40,290
I will also kind of questioning the validity of that and then we'll close.

191
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:47,389
We're talking about social stigma. So we're going to talk to the course is kind of roughly organized into three modules.

192
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:52,100
The first part will we're going to kind of introduce some big ideas like what are mental disorders?

193
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,900
Why is that such a hard question to answer?

194
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:59,930
What is stigma and how does it relate to public mental health and how two social factors influence mental health.

195
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:06,530
So we'll kind of talk about those and the generic and then will in module the third or the second third of the course,

196
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:12,590
which is the majority of the course. We'll talk about sort of illustrations of those ideas through specific case examples.

197
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:18,889
So these are the ones that we're going to talk about in in class as well as I'll talk about when I talk about the project.

198
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:22,430
You're welcome to do your project on anything that's kind of relevant to this course,

199
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:27,530
but these are the ones that we're going to talk about in this lecture, and then we'll close out.

200
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:31,040
We're talking about prevention, health services and the criminal justice system.

201
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,110
I have to let you know, I'm trying to condense.

202
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:40,429
So I went to I went to a program for five years, and I'm trying to condense all of that into one course for you.

203
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:46,999
So it's not going to really work. But hopefully, you know, so I took an entire class on like prevention and intervention in mental disorders,

204
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,500
and I started class on the criminal justice system in mental disorders. But I'm going to try to give you the highlights.

205
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,530
And if there's more that you want to read about with this one, I'd encourage it.

206
00:18:54,530 --> 00:19:00,970
It's like, message me. I have tons of extra readings that I can give you all book recommendations, but then also, you know,

207
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:06,140
do your project on whatever topic you're interested in and that way you'll be able to do a deeper dive.

208
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:11,149
So the other thing I want to spend just a minute on is speaking of the readings,

209
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:18,770
is that one of the things that is I know hard to do but is very important to do is actually do the readings and

210
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:27,480
so to encourage you are encouraged to mandate that you at least do the readings one week you will do a each,

211
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:34,429
one week you will do a presenting the weekly readings and you will use this document to guide your presentation.

212
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:41,450
So each week we'll have two students. We might have three some weeks depending on sort of how the how the preference survey works out.

213
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:45,500
So and there's. Three things you need to do.

214
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:49,930
So the first is you need to before class,

215
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:55,700
you need to write a discussion board post that is reflecting which student role you've been assigned and I will sign you.

216
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:58,850
So when I sign you two readings, you'll be assigned both the week and the role.

217
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:05,239
And the roles are identical except for student. One's job is to try to find.

218
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:12,110
They have to review the readings, provide a summary, and then they have to find a layperson or nonacademic stakeholder.

219
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:18,140
So this is basically anything that is not a journal article is what I need you to get here.

220
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:23,870
This could be a government report, a TED Talk, a community organization, even something like a performance piece,

221
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:28,670
you know, things like that, depending on if it's relevant to the topic for that week.

222
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:36,760
And then in your discussion board post, you'll also post 2 to 4 questions for the rest of the class to respond to.

223
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:39,430
And when you're not presenting the weeks that you're not presenting,

224
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:43,129
you need to respond to one of those questions, either from student one or student two.

225
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:50,720
You don't have to respond to both. So that's what's going to happen asynchronously, and this needs to be done by Monday before Monday at noon.

226
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:54,200
Okay. So our class meets at Wednesday at 230, Monday at noon.

227
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,710
This is for the week, the one week you are presenting. This needs to happen.

228
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:02,059
Okay. And then we come to class.

229
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,610
And when for every week, starting next week,

230
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:10,310
we will begin the class with the students who have been assigned to present that week presenting the readings.

231
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:13,490
And the way they're going to present it is they're going to create a quiz.

232
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:18,950
And I will. You'll send it to me. I will send it to the class using the announcement function.

233
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:23,030
And so people will fill out the quiz. It's not a graded quiz. You're not going to get graded on it.

234
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:28,850
But that's this is how you need to complete it in order to get like full credit for your responder week.

235
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:35,750
And then the student's student one and student two will have created a little just PowerPoint presentation together.

236
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:38,700
Just make sure you put your as I detail this here, you know,

237
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:46,159
put your initials next to your your questions that you wrote to talk about the readings, right?

238
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:54,799
So part of it is it just gives the responders a chance to reflect on their knowledge.

239
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:59,030
Do they pick up what they use, what what what was in the readings, the important ideas?

240
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:05,030
And then it gives the presenters a chance to sort of think about like if you were a professor,

241
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:09,169
how would you sort of assess people's knowledge about what was important in the readings?

242
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:12,469
And so, you know, you only write two questions. You're not writing a whole quote.

243
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:16,760
So you need to write 2 to 4 prompts and then people are going to respond to your prompt.

244
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,790
You need to write two questions and then you'll create like I said,

245
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:27,110
you'll create a Google text that you both work on and you each work on your own questions and use that to do your presentation.

246
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:33,200
And then once you're done reviewing the answers, each student should then explain their additional reading that they found.

247
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:39,799
So again, student one is finding this nonacademic stakeholder. Student two is going to find an academic or scientific article.

248
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:45,260
And so you kind of talk a little bit more about because and the reason for that is that most

249
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:49,100
of the other students in the class will not have read that additional thing that you found.

250
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:52,459
Right? They're going to be reading the required readings. You're going to have found some new reading.

251
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:56,630
And I want you to kind of talk to people say, well, this is how I this is what made me think about it.

252
00:22:56,630 --> 00:23:04,520
This is why I think it's useful. And yeah, and then four again when everybody else the weeks that you are not presenting,

253
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:09,259
you need to respond again to at least one of the questions you need to fill out this quiz.

254
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:15,799
Again, it's not the score on the quiz, but just that you do it and you can mess up two, two of these without it affecting your grade at all.

255
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:20,570
Because I know that life happens. Okay. Questions about this.

256
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:26,460
I know this is like a multiyear multipart thing.

257
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:32,980
Once we get into it, it'll be like clockwork. You just have to do it once. Okay.

258
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:39,380
So if you haven't already. In the announcement that I already provided to the class, there's a link to the the welcome survey.

259
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:43,900
That is how you're going to tell me your preferences. I need you to do that today so I can assign you tomorrow,

260
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:47,800
because we got people who are going to be presenting next week, which means they have an assignment due on Monday.

261
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:54,080
Okay. Okay.

262
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:59,079
And I also just want to remind everybody, you should see the way that this discussion board is set up.

263
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:02,830
It's like each week the presenters. And so you need to subscribe to every week.

264
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:09,490
So then you'll know when the presenters have posted so you can get get to it as quickly as possible.

265
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:13,749
If you're the responder you just need to respond to before class so you don't have to respond.

266
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:19,270
So the post will be up by Monday at noon and you need to respond by 230 on Wednesday.

267
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:24,110
So. Okay.

268
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:31,250
So any questions about this guy? All right.

269
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:38,690
So the last thing is this last packet, which is, again, everything that I'm showing you here is on canvas.

270
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:42,310
This is the entire packet all all together.

271
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:48,679
But it's of your main semester long course. So you're you're going to work on a project that's got multiple check points that

272
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:52,520
are already divided up that are going to help you work towards that project.

273
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,189
And the topic is of your choosing.

274
00:24:55,190 --> 00:25:04,969
And so you're but within the parameters that I either want you to talk about a controversy in the field or a kind of misconception.

275
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:06,760
So these are just some examples there.

276
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:13,640
So there's lots of different things that you can imagine or you can at least situate within something as a controversy or a misconception.

277
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:22,069
Again, these are just some examples here. The here are some examples of student what students did last year.

278
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:26,760
So like prenatal genetic screening for autism, how stigma is, you know,

279
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:33,510
sort of develops in children like when the young children start experiencing stigma, attitudes, the implications of it.

280
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:39,740
So if you've ever used these adverse childhood experience skills or seen them, one of the items is has you have a parent with a mental illness,

281
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:44,930
you know, so like the idea that like just having a parent with a mental illness is itself a adverse child experience.

282
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:54,260
But almost every year we have somebody do something on climate which has been interesting, mental health and within indigenous populations,

283
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:59,570
online eating disorder communities are kind of online communities in general in order to help people get information.

284
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:06,020
In this case of eating disorders every year, we always have had people doing work on psychedelics.

285
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:10,820
It's actually like a center here on psychedelics for treatment of depression.

286
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:19,519
This kind of like the NIMBY, not in my backyard stigma towards sober living houses and then also work on telehealth.

287
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,790
So just some examples, right? So it's not so it doesn't have to be.

288
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:28,249
You can position there's probably lots of topics that you can position as a controversy or misconception.

289
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:31,490
But the reason I want you to position it as that is because I want you to be engaging with

290
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:35,959
people who are like supportive of whatever thing and also people who are not supportive of it.

291
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:39,800
Right. So it doesn't have to just be like, I don't want you to just say like, why?

292
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:45,650
You know, people believe this or this thing that's wrong. It's like, well, what what evidence do they have for that wrong belief?

293
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:49,459
I'm like, where how does that engage with this this other this other evidence?

294
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:57,200
So, you know, we've all just lived through or continuing to live through a pandemic where it's very clear that both misconceptions about,

295
00:26:57,390 --> 00:27:02,990
you know, things, but also just a lack of ability to converse with people who have different opinions.

296
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,210
Right. That that really would have been helpful.

297
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:11,629
You know, in terms of how we thought about like policy responses to what to what has happened and what we continue to live with.

298
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:15,720
And so, you know, and okay.

299
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:21,889
Oh yeah. I said download this today. You already have a hard copy here, but again, just download it.

300
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:25,010
And again, they're going to do these six checkpoints.

301
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:35,450
Your checkpoint number one is due next week. It is a just list of three topics that have if you look on this is page three of this document.

302
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:43,280
So what I need from you next week before class starts is a list of three topics and it needs to look in this format here.

303
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:50,569
So you can see on page three of this document so that your potential topic might be legalization of recreational marijuana.

304
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:56,000
You're going to tell me why this topic is important to public mental health. What's controversial or misunderstood about it?

305
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,999
Or are you interested? And then what concerns do you have?

306
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:05,059
And so those concerns might be, you know, I've had students say things like I've done papers on this in the past,

307
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:11,959
and so I'm not that interested in it or, you know, maybe I've already played it out or I don't know, I don't know anything about this topic, you know,

308
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:19,400
and it just kind of helps me understand you're I'm going to give you feedback on that, too, on your topics, both in terms of all of your three topics,

309
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:23,809
what do I think are the strengths that I'm going to tell you what I think are the strengths of them or the weaknesses of them?

310
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:28,370
And so this kind of helps me just to understand a little bit more about how to provide that feedback for me.

311
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:31,970
So you will get feedback on every single checkpoint that you turn in.

312
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:37,820
The only way to not do well in this on your final project is to ignore all the feedback that I give you.

313
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:41,569
That is the only way to not do well. Right? So I'm going to give you suggestions.

314
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:44,030
I'm going to try to point you to resources that I think are useful.

315
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:55,310
But ultimately, like, I'm I'm not interested in what you end up saying, but how you justify whatever it is that you say, okay, questions about this.

316
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:16,550
This isn't this is just the beginning. So no other questions about logistics, huh?

317
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:22,590
All right, let's go. So I.

318
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:25,780
Time to lose. All right, so we'll go for.

319
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:30,520
All right, so the first thing now. Bracket. New paragraph.

320
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,049
Let's talk about what it means to take a public health approach to mental health.

321
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:42,520
And so the most important, I guess, in general, when I'm getting introduced to feel it's important to understand the history of that field.

322
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:49,840
So the first thing I want to sort of disavow view of is that is the belief that you may have that mental health

323
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:55,980
specialties are specialists of people like psychiatrists or psychologists are sort of the core of public mental health.

324
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:56,770
This is not true.

325
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:03,549
So most people in our country or in other countries, if they get help for a mental health problem, they're getting help from a generalist.

326
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:09,250
They're not getting to see a specialist. Most psychiatrists in this country do not take health insurance.

327
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:11,920
And so the only way you're seeing a psychiatrist is by paying out of pocket.

328
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:20,079
There is there are massive shortages of mental health specialists, you know, so there's a huge workplace problem, etc.

329
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:25,150
But but also, I would more generally, when we think about public health, we think about prevention.

330
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:29,980
And psychiatrists and psychologists as clinicians have very little to do with prevention.

331
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:35,130
As you're going to learn in this class, most mental health problems onset by age 15.

332
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:42,760
And so that means that the people that are most involved in prevention or intervention are in schools.

333
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:48,129
They might be in government or social services, health care might be part of it.

334
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:55,360
Certainly prescription medications are the primary treatment that we have for most mental disorders, but also settings like workplaces.

335
00:30:55,870 --> 00:31:01,930
And as all of this doesn't go doesn't go well because there isn't really like a mental health service system.

336
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:06,819
The criminal justice system, which unfortunately is a is as a way that many people get access to care for

337
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:10,870
the first time in their life because of being arrested for something that,

338
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:15,760
you know, would not have happened had they had their mental health condition appropriately treated.

339
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:22,569
So the other thing is that the reason sort of why we care about mental disorders and I

340
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:27,940
probably don't need to convince you of this since you're sitting in this classroom, but the mental disorders are they they typically don't kill you.

341
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:36,700
Thankfully, anorexia nervosa is the exception to that, which has a quite high mortality rate, but they are the leading causes of disability.

342
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:42,159
And we'll talk about what disability means, what I mean by that term and what the means by that term in a minute.

343
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:47,260
But this is just data from this is data from NIH showing you that neuropsychiatric disorders.

344
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:53,470
So this is your behavioral this is everything we're going to talk about except for dementia and illnesses.

345
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:54,550
We're going to talk about dementia.

346
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:04,620
So if you added everything up that we're going to talk about in this class, it's socially with more sort of impairments relative to all,

347
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:10,269
you know, circulatory system, you know, cardiovascular disease, cancer, etc., etc.

348
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:16,300
And that's just sort of the the the sort of assignment we give just to the mental disorders.

349
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:25,810
Unintentional injuries include things like overdose, accidental overdose, which is obviously very highly correlated with substance misuse.

350
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:33,819
And you can see self-harm and interpersonal violence. Right. So even this is an underestimate because they've pulled out these to these two things.

351
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:38,469
And so both from the perspective of these are very common conditions.

352
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:42,430
They onset early in life, they are associated with impairment.

353
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:49,870
They all those things together make them leading cause of disability, not just in the United States, but also globally.

354
00:32:52,270 --> 00:33:00,700
So the other thing that I guess I should also say, like just as a matter of course, you should always feel free to interrupt me and ask questions.

355
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:05,139
You should always, always, always feel free. So just kind of flag it. I talk a little fast.

356
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:10,090
So like, I just I know that I was a debater in college and so I like the pace of speech is a little quicker.

357
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:12,700
So just kind of a me me to repeat something just like, okay,

358
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:21,249
so the other thing that makes a population approach to mental health different than like a psychology course is our sort of philosophy of science.

359
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:28,329
And so by philosophy of science, I mean two things. The first is how do we know how do I know anything that I'm going to tell you in this class?

360
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:36,430
Right. And so that is epistemology. So how do I generate information at a population level that is rigorous, reproducible and robust?

361
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:40,479
The way that we do that is through the tools of public health.

362
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:48,340
So typically the tools of epidemiology and biostatistics, what are kind of broadly referred to as the science of public health, these are predominant.

363
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:51,069
You're going to see predominantly quantitative studies in this class.

364
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:56,220
That does not mean in any way an indictment of qualitative work that's very useful, especially in.

365
00:33:56,310 --> 00:34:03,360
That's part of indeed why I ask you to find a non academic stakeholder because I think the lived experience of these conditions is really,

366
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,419
really important to understanding what it's, what it's like.

367
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:11,640
And in fact every week you will have some sort of like lived experience layperson reading to do.

368
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:17,160
And in addition to that, like the qualitative studies can also be really important to understanding that.

369
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:19,290
So I guess I but I want to tell you that at the top,

370
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:24,860
most of what we know about public mental health is coming out of quantitative epidemiologic studies.

371
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:32,580
The other thing is like, what are we even generating knowledge about? So that has to do with sort of like what is the nature of mental health?

372
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:40,589
What is that like? What does it mean to have a mental disorder? What I'm in the position I'm going to take in this class is that mental disorders

373
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:45,569
and mental health more broadly are a phenomenon that incorporates biological,

374
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:52,110
behavioral, psychological, social and cultural aspects of health, and that this is an inherently interdisciplinary enterprise.

375
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:58,260
And so no one discipline, no one approach is has got the answer in terms of in terms of this.

376
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:07,650
So in terms of kind of conceptually, what is it where did psychiatric epidemiology come from?

377
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:14,189
So as epidemiology students, as many of you are, you've probably heard of people like John Snow or other epidemiologist.

378
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:20,069
I don't know. Usually when I heard of it, my program, which is focused on mental health, has nothing to do with what we're going to talk about.

379
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:24,000
So the heroes of epidemiology are not the heroes of psychiatric. Patrick epidemiology.

380
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,290
Instead, our heroes are the people you're going to hear about today are almost all sociologists.

381
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,570
Now, why why would sociologists be interested in mental health?

382
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:42,930
Well, the answer is because almost all of the sort of established risk factors for mental disorder are in some way social factors.

383
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:47,550
So that might be something like trauma and violence, disruptions in social relationships,

384
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:54,149
disruptions in social roles, or your transmission through social networks and family relationships.

385
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:56,910
And we'll talk about different examples of these throughout the course.

386
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:04,709
In addition, the actual expression of distress, that is the expression of disorder or psychopathology.

387
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:07,920
I'm going to use these terms interchangeably, even though I know they're coming from different disciplines,

388
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,110
but they're kind of broadly kind of talking about the same thing.

389
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:16,290
That expression is also influenced by social factors, and I don't mean just like the words we used to describe it,

390
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:19,650
you know, so I mean, literally and we'll talk about this.

391
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:20,520
We talk about depression.

392
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:28,890
And Christina, the idea that there are experiences that literally do not have a that cannot be translated, you know, they cannot be translated.

393
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:39,120
So the you know, and so both the experience of the symptoms, the way we describe them, but then also how we understand them is this.

394
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,520
And when we talk about depression in neuroscience,

395
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:48,600
one of the things we're going to talk about is the idea that a disease is in your body versus in your mind,

396
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:55,379
and how that would relate to social stigma and cultural expectations or something, even a disease.

397
00:36:55,380 --> 00:37:01,110
Or is it just a problem of living? Right. There's no line in the sand between, like, depression and, you know, stress.

398
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:05,160
But but one of these we treat and one of them we don't know. Right.

399
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:13,740
So one of which was medication. And one of them we don't. So so these are two reasons why the sociologists are are the folks at the forefront

400
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,550
because the epidemiologists could care less about either of these things,

401
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:22,770
at least back then. Now they care about them, but they certainly didn't when the field was starting.

402
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:30,480
The other thing that's important is that measurement is has always been and remains

403
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:36,090
a core part of what it means to understand mental disorders in the population.

404
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:45,449
And as I'm going to tell you about the history of our field, the way that we measure mental disorders has changed over time.

405
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:56,760
And that change in measurement has reflected our ideas about what a mental disorder is and who has the most valid information about it.

406
00:37:57,030 --> 00:38:00,870
So that is the concept of what depression is.

407
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,229
And how you measure depression are intricately linked.

408
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:09,510
You cannot you cannot talk about like what is depression? And then and separately talk about what and how do you measure it.

409
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:11,670
These are the same these are the same conversation.

410
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:20,370
And so these historical periods are defined by both what we were measuring and how we were measuring.

411
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:32,460
And I think that's yes, I mean, we know so we kind of talk broadly about three generations of kind of psychiatric epidemiology.

412
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:38,220
The first generation is everything before World War Two. So World War Two is like 1940 ish.

413
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:47,640
So the way that we do that and this is an example of a psychiatric epidemiology report from this first generation.

414
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:56,100
So the way that we identified how much mental health or how much mental disorder was in the population was by asking key informants.

415
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:59,639
And at the time the key informants were clinicians or clergy members.

416
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:06,440
And so you would go to these sort of key stakeholders and say, like, is there anybody in your parish or anybody in your, you know,

417
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:12,930
that you take care of or anybody in their families that has some sort of and of course, we these are the words we have.

418
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:17,670
We don't have any. The word like depression did not exist. Right. These were not words that people would have been asked about that.

419
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:23,280
And so and the reason that you were talking to the clergy member or the clinician

420
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:27,959
was because the assumption was that if you had some form of mental disorder,

421
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:33,570
you could never tell me about it. Right. That you were not a reliable reporter about your own mental status.

422
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:40,710
So I needed to ask someone else that that had like, you know, could be trusted for having useful information.

423
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:45,090
And so this is an example of that called the Jarvis Report from 1855.

424
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:53,160
This report did essentially like the largest descriptive epidemiologic study in the Boston or in the Massachusetts area.

425
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,670
Almost all of its findings have been borne out by better stuff.

426
00:39:57,090 --> 00:40:02,040
So like what they found is that if you're poor, you're more likely to have mental disorder if you live in an urban area.

427
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:06,550
More severe mental disorder if you're. Yeah.

428
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:10,950
So, I mean, so these are, you know, that that type of mental disorder varies by gender, etc.

429
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:17,040
So like these are things that we knew even back even before we had the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual,

430
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:21,839
even before we had words like schizophrenia, which at the time was called dementia praecox, right?

431
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:26,219
So we didn't like none of the words that we're going to use in this class existed when this report happens.

432
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:33,210
And yet some of these things we were able to did, some of the insights from that were able to be retained.

433
00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:38,890
So. All right. So that's pre Osaka.

434
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:43,470
Yes, that's pre-World War Two. So now World War One happens is 1914, 1918.

435
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:50,969
And as many in so many important sort of technological advances, the military is like, man,

436
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:56,190
I really need to figure out who is going to be at risk for this condition called shellshock at the time,

437
00:40:56,190 --> 00:41:00,240
which we would now call post-traumatic stress disorder or just being traumatized.

438
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:08,670
So the sort of the military like we need to be able to find out if there's a way we can identify people before we're at the point

439
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:16,860
of enlistment to screen them out so they wouldn't be enrolled in the military because there's a military readiness sort of issue.

440
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:23,850
So in before right around World War Two, the Department of War, which now is called the standard defense,

441
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:27,360
implements what they call the neuropsychiatric screening adjunct for Selective Service.

442
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:34,500
This is still in use today. This type of test is still in use today with the goal that we should that we should not enroll people

443
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:41,130
in or enlist people in the military if they have what they call intellectual or emotional liabilities.

444
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:46,110
What's fascinating about this idea is that this is also, I think,

445
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:49,889
just an interesting kind of like military sort of thing is like they're like, you know,

446
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:52,770
because at the time the psychiatrist, like, why you have to do like a, you know,

447
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:56,520
I need to talk to people for 12 years and then I can figure out what's going on with them, right?

448
00:41:56,550 --> 00:42:01,080
Like we're coming out of like the psychoanalytic tradition at this time and their military is like, I don't got time for that.

449
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:02,780
You can have 10 minutes.

450
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:11,249
And so they come up with this scale, which is not so psychiatrist might score it, but they're not doing the kind of work that they would typically do.

451
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:17,610
And so we first, beginning in the 1940s, get the idea that I actually don't need a specialist to figure out,

452
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:21,060
at least in this question, should you enroll? Should you be allowed to enlist or not?

453
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:25,469
Okay. So so we get this the screening and again,

454
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:32,850
this this major development is that I could train someone I didn't need a specialist to be able to say enlist or not enlist,

455
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:37,160
but that that advancement that I don't need to talk,

456
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:41,880
I don't need a specialist to talk to somebody to figure out if they have some sort of mental health concern.

457
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:48,210
Or rather, I could develop a survey essentially and train someone to give it,

458
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:54,260
and then I could be able to know what what's going on with them and oh, sorry, this is not the nurse.

459
00:42:54,260 --> 00:43:02,639
Like this is a screenshot from the midtown I met hands and that same approach that is training a layperson to administer a survey is what was used.

460
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:07,020
This is now in the 1960s, the Midtown Manhattan study, which is a very famous study.

461
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:08,460
These are all sociologists here.

462
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:17,130
This study was was famous for at the time, generating the estimate that one in two New Yorkers had some sort of mental health condition.

463
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:22,920
Right. And it was like lambasted, like this is insane, you know, how could they possibly we now know that number is probably true.

464
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:26,520
So if you add up everything, everything that could be go on. Right.

465
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:31,950
So anxiety, depression, substance use, tobacco, everything is about 1 to 2 over your whole life span.

466
00:43:32,370 --> 00:43:35,490
So again, but the idea now is like you don't need a specialist.

467
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:40,620
I can train a layperson and I can send them into the community and I can talk to the person directly.

468
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:45,870
So generation one is I can't talk to the person. I got to talk to their doctor or their their priest.

469
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:49,979
Here is I can talk to the person and I don't even need a psychiatrist to talk to the person.

470
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:53,280
I can talk to them using a training somebody and using an instrument.

471
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,340
Oh, yes. Oh. So again, what did they quantify?

472
00:43:58,350 --> 00:44:04,070
Not mental disorders, but mental distress. In 1962, we still do not have the nomenclature that we're going to use in this class.

473
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:08,780
Okay. So 1962, the DSM, which does exist at this time, is about 40 pages thick.

474
00:44:08,870 --> 00:44:16,490
It's about this thick. And everything in it is coded like. Like ADHD, what we would now call attention deficit hyperactivity disorder at the time.

475
00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:20,209
It's called hyperactive reaction to childhood. Why does it have that weird reaction?

476
00:44:20,210 --> 00:44:25,610
Because it's coming out of the psychoanalytic tradition. Right. And the word reaction then is a cycle that was term the psychoanalysts use.

477
00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:28,040
So none of the stuff we're going to talk about exists yet.

478
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:33,470
But they can still go out and try to figure out like, okay, well, how much distress is there in Manhattan?

479
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:42,560
So then the 1980, 1980 rolls around. Beyonce is and then yes so anchor everything to be had said.

480
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:46,340
Okay so DSM three comes out. This is a revolutionary.

481
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:50,730
So prior to this time, prior to the news, prior to the DSM three coming out,

482
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:55,790
psychiatrists could not agree with each other about what a case of depression look like.

483
00:44:55,880 --> 00:45:01,540
You have you have you put somebody in front of the psychiatrist here? They say they've got this thing, put them in different psychiatrist.

484
00:45:01,550 --> 00:45:05,150
They got this whole another thing. There's no reliability in terms of measurement.

485
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:08,510
Right. Because people are coming out of all these different disciplines where you got the behaviorists,

486
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:13,490
you have the psychoanalysts, you got these kind of social kind of learned psychiatrist people.

487
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:18,770
Right? You've got all these different traditions. They all they they don't have agreement.

488
00:45:18,890 --> 00:45:22,520
So the American Psychiatric Association is like enough of this.

489
00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:27,530
At the time, Carter is he's this is this is Reagan.

490
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:35,330
But like Carter is also really supporting all this, which is the president for Reagan is supporting developing this initiative.

491
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:39,350
He's the one who gives money for it anyway. So we get a major overhaul.

492
00:45:39,350 --> 00:45:43,129
The DSM, the DSM, which one?

493
00:45:43,130 --> 00:45:48,350
It becomes completely theoretical. So if you look at this book today, it does not say depression is caused by stress.

494
00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:50,900
Instead, what it says, even though stress is a cause of depression.

495
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:58,700
And so what it says is depression is a syndrome lasting two weeks or longer, consisting of at least consisting of anhedonia or dysphoria,

496
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:08,689
accompanied by five of the following nine symptoms appetite disturbances, sleep disturbances, fatigue, agitation, cognitive problems.

497
00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:12,589
Thinking a lot about death. What am I any one more at six weeks?

498
00:46:12,590 --> 00:46:16,770
The other seven, they say Wait, wait.

499
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:21,410
Disturbances. No, that would be the same weight. Little more guilt.

500
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:25,489
There we go. Okay. So that's what it is. That's what it says.

501
00:46:25,490 --> 00:46:27,740
Have to last at least two weeks or more and it has to have impairment.

502
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:35,240
There's nothing in the description of depression in this book that says anything about what causes depression or anything like that.

503
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:42,290
But what? Why, why were they doing it? I was trying to create criteria that I could implement.

504
00:46:42,830 --> 00:46:47,690
Now we implement them using a computer, but at the time they were implemented using an instrument that you would actually

505
00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:50,879
sort of like go through this interview as though you were a psychiatrist.

506
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,870
If we're going to do this activity in class in a couple of weeks next week,

507
00:46:54,140 --> 00:47:00,310
you're actually going to go through this process and what it was how we used to collect data with this to create that

508
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:05,360
what we call fully structured and semi-structured instruments that basically operationalized all the criteria that,

509
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:08,630
again, I could train you how to interview someone in the in the field.

510
00:47:08,990 --> 00:47:15,230
And you can come out and say, according to my questionnaire, this person meets criteria for depression.

511
00:47:16,590 --> 00:47:23,440
Does that mean they had depression? Well, we're not we don't know if this is what depression is, right?

512
00:47:23,470 --> 00:47:29,450
Depression, like maybe lots of different things. But like the DSM says, it's at least five of these nine symptoms lasting at least two weeks or more.

513
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:30,220
Right. They haven't.

514
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:39,730
But so that the goal was to generate reliable assessments that I could put one person in front of one psychiatrist or not even a psychiatrist,

515
00:47:39,730 --> 00:47:44,620
a trained person. They could get asked these questions. I could take that person, put them into in front of another person.

516
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:46,910
They being ask the same questions and they should get the same answer.

517
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:52,240
That's all I'm trying to get out of the generation three and again, psychiatrist cost too much money.

518
00:47:52,450 --> 00:47:57,939
So we are all like there's no there's no effort to make these instruments.

519
00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:02,919
So they could be administered by mental health professionals, but rather they could be administered by trained laypersons.

520
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:07,239
And I did this myself when I talk about that work in a minute.

521
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:12,520
But, you know, we trained people for 2 to 3 weeks and how to do this, this isn't like a half hour of training right there.

522
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:15,760
Like in like it's a lot of work to train people.

523
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:17,260
Okay.

524
00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:24,610
And the last thing I'll tell you before we'll go to break, because it's also a sauna in here, is that we potentially are in the fourth generation.

525
00:48:24,730 --> 00:48:32,770
So so if I asked you to go in, like figure out how much depression there is in Ann Arbor today,

526
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:36,850
you would almost certainly be using the tools that were developed when Beyoncé was born.

527
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:42,850
Right. That's what you would do unless you had a lot of money and then you might be doing what then?

528
00:48:42,850 --> 00:48:49,300
I h in 2010 releases, which you might be using tools from what's called the research domain criteria.

529
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:51,249
I don't know why it's called this. It's a terrible name.

530
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:58,660
It's totally non descriptive, but what in 2010 and I am sure it introduces those research domain criteria,

531
00:48:59,050 --> 00:49:04,560
which is they refer to as a research framework that is trying for understanding mental disorder,

532
00:49:04,570 --> 00:49:09,670
a mental phenomenon, pardon me, that's going to integrate everything from genetics to self-report data.

533
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:15,910
Now that sounds like a big problem. But there was an important innovation, which is true.

534
00:49:15,970 --> 00:49:20,860
So I told you, there's not like a line in the sand between like stress and depression or a lot of stress and depression.

535
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:29,139
But there's also we know that like what the DSM calls depression, like the five nine symptoms.

536
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:36,850
Right. That is just a heuristic. And this is like that is this is a tool that we can use or you and I can have a conversation about depression

537
00:49:36,850 --> 00:49:41,650
without having to have like a 12 hour conversation prior to that conversation about what depression is.

538
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:46,960
Right. So but we know that this stuff in the DSM is not the reality.

539
00:49:47,410 --> 00:49:56,680
What is reality is that the signs and symptoms that themselves are not unique to each disorder.

540
00:49:56,690 --> 00:50:02,650
So sleeping problems, for example, are pretty much part of every single condition in the DSM.

541
00:50:03,090 --> 00:50:06,999
Well, schizophrenia has sleeping problems. People with ADHD have sleep well, substance use problems.

542
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,960
They're sleeping problems, right? It doesn't mean they're part of the diagnostic criteria, but they go along with it.

543
00:50:10,990 --> 00:50:18,270
Same thing with like cognitive problems, like having trouble thinking ADHD and, you know, schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, all of them.

544
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:26,410
Okay. So again, the idea is that the DSM diagnosis has little it it's sort of a way to categorize those symptoms.

545
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:33,580
But moreover, the diagnosis itself doesn't tell us anything, really doesn't tell us anything about what's actually happening in the brain.

546
00:50:34,090 --> 00:50:42,400
Like, there's there's no correlation. I know there's very little correlation between what is the symptom of somebody is experiencing

547
00:50:42,730 --> 00:50:48,070
and our very crude kind of modern day phrenology measures of what is happening in the brain.

548
00:50:48,790 --> 00:50:53,560
So the idea is like, okay, well, not only do I want to, but this is what I care about.

549
00:50:53,570 --> 00:50:57,309
Like if I'm going to develop a new treatment for depression, what I care about is what's actually happening in the brain,

550
00:50:57,310 --> 00:51:02,530
not just the, you know, this checklist of five of nine symptoms get better.

551
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:07,990
The other thing that there are doctors is it calls, again, the idea of these trans diagnostic domains.

552
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:16,000
So rather than saying like depression is feeling sad and mania is feeling happy and bipolar disorder is feeling sad than happy.

553
00:51:16,210 --> 00:51:20,620
Right. But rather saying like there's just domains of like negative balance when people feel lousy positive,

554
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:25,630
so people feel good cognition, social friends, etc. And those are across all the different disorders.

555
00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:37,570
Let me give you an example of this. So we have known for a long time or there's been a hypothesis that what one of the causes of anxiety

556
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:45,330
is the idea that you are your brain is getting activated in a situation that it thinks it's in fear.

557
00:51:45,350 --> 00:51:48,170
It thinks that you're going to die, but you're not actually going to die. Okay.

558
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:57,550
So the idea is that like anxiety and anxiety disorder is a situation where you are you think you're in a very dangerous situation.

559
00:51:57,790 --> 00:52:02,250
But actually the situation is uncertain or not actually dangerous at all.

560
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:05,920
And so if you you know, I don't know how many of you get a panicked. I actually do know it's about 20%.

561
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:09,350
But anyway. So I guess so.

562
00:52:10,270 --> 00:52:18,100
So but I sort of panicked. All right. So one of the things that that happens when you have panic attack is that you start breathing really shallowly.

563
00:52:18,790 --> 00:52:24,040
All right. And what happens when you breathe for the pager, your blood decreases.

564
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:28,210
It becomes more acidic. One of the way you can get your blood more acidic is by having somebody breathe CO2.

565
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:36,100
And so these are this is a study that was done of parents and kids who had some of them had anxiety disorder, some of them didn't.

566
00:52:36,370 --> 00:52:40,840
And they were all given a little bit of carbon dioxide, 5% not going to kill you in any way.

567
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:46,740
But what's going to happen is you're going to feel a little weird and some of these people might develop a panic attack within that setting.

568
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:48,129
So this is the idea of like, okay,

569
00:52:48,130 --> 00:52:56,440
what I'm interested in is what's happening in the brain when what is generally what most people experience as a unpleasant but benign stimulus,

570
00:52:56,440 --> 00:53:00,190
like hyperventilating, suddenly turns into a panic attack, right?

571
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:03,249
So like that's an example of an art study.

572
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:08,930
So that's really helpful. Spoiler alert, this hasn't really been borne out in future studies, but anyway.

573
00:53:08,950 --> 00:53:14,200
But the idea is like it's an interesting. Right. And the point is it's getting us to the heart of it, like what's actually happening in the brain.

574
00:53:14,530 --> 00:53:17,469
You're not asking people about like, do you feel anxious when you hyperventilate?

575
00:53:17,470 --> 00:53:20,680
You're just you're actually like putting them in a situation to see if this happens.

576
00:53:21,490 --> 00:53:23,260
Okay. Let me summarize what I just told you.

577
00:53:23,890 --> 00:53:29,680
So, pre-World War two, our method of case detection is forget about asking the people wants to ask the conformance.

578
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:33,880
These are this again at the time. Here are typically third members or clinicians.

579
00:53:34,390 --> 00:53:40,060
Our innovation is that we basically got our first descriptive studies of psychiatric epidemiology.

580
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:44,850
Many of these relationships have held up to this day after World War Two.

581
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:49,810
We need to we need to get an innovation. Or innovation is we're going to talk to people.

582
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:56,260
But I'm also going to I'm going to talk to people directly, but I'm not going to have a specialist do it.

583
00:53:56,260 --> 00:53:59,889
And I'm not going to be assessing specific diagnoses because they don't really exist yet.

584
00:53:59,890 --> 00:54:04,600
I'm just going to be talking out like high symptoms. Low symptoms, because from the military's perspective, that's all they care about.

585
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:08,410
They don't care if you have schizophrenia or depression. They just want to know, do you have a lot of this or less of this?

586
00:54:09,610 --> 00:54:14,380
And again. Innovation is that we develop standardized tools that could be administered by a trained, trained layperson.

587
00:54:15,610 --> 00:54:19,959
Generation three Beyonce was born. We get now our standardized diagnostic personal interviews.

588
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:23,140
I'm going to use this to anchor everything in class because that's a very important year.

589
00:54:23,890 --> 00:54:27,460
So standardized interviews, again, administered by trained laypersons,

590
00:54:27,730 --> 00:54:32,810
but now we actually have reliable criteria that we can say something about how much depression is there,

591
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:37,419
not just how much distress is there, but how much depression, how much anxiety, how much substance use?

592
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:41,950
Because we've developed these reliable criteria, it doesn't mean that they're valid.

593
00:54:41,950 --> 00:54:47,440
We'll talk about that later. And that is operationalized by the DSM three and its later iterations.

594
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:54,880
And then potentially we're in generation four currently where we have this is the art of criteria where cases are irrelevant.

595
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:57,279
The idea what the DSM says is irrelevant,

596
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:03,519
but what matters is sort of how are you you do on this like CO2 challenge test or how do you do in like a stress reactivity test?

597
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:06,879
And I'm trying to like basically or how does how is your sleep, right?

598
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:13,330
So these kind of like objective measures that I'm trying to understand these trans diagnostic dimensions of what's going on in the brain.

599
00:55:13,930 --> 00:55:21,130
And this is a move away from self-report and more towards objective tests of of neuropsychiatric functioning.

600
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:31,030
I will say just as my way of closing is that the DSM, DSM five came out in 2012.

601
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:36,430
This this came out in 2010 when the DSM five, which is the latest version that we're on now,

602
00:55:36,430 --> 00:55:43,960
came out in 2012 and I image issued a real cute, very short statement that said basically like have fun with that.

603
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:50,799
So so it's it has they've reconciled a little bit now but it is important to kind of consider that

604
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:57,160
what the what the IMH is the primary funder of psychiatric or mental health research in this country.

605
00:55:57,730 --> 00:55:59,590
And they're going in this direction.

606
00:56:00,010 --> 00:56:10,480
And but psychiatry APA are the people who that book the DSM is what determines if your insurance will pay for whatever care you need so that health.

607
00:56:10,570 --> 00:56:16,300
So there's a potential to create a disconnect between what research is finding and what clinical care experiences have.

608
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:23,090
So I will pause us here for questions.

609
00:56:23,090 --> 00:56:27,570
Then I will give us our 20 minute break because it is to dam on your religion.

610
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:33,330
Those were questions. Yes, yes.

611
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:42,010
And some other classes. I really get that impression that, you know, the social determinants of health in public health is kind of this new field.

612
00:56:42,220 --> 00:56:51,310
Like, Yeah, I look at the age as we learn about developmental origins of disease, all the societal factors that can influence your condition.

613
00:56:51,910 --> 00:56:55,629
But it sounds like from this maybe they were doing that from the very beginning.

614
00:56:55,630 --> 00:56:59,440
So it's not as revolutionary in this there may be.

615
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:03,759
No, no, no. And the psychology, you know, I think it's a it's it's a very good point.

616
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:11,380
And I mean, I don't know. It's because the sociologists were I don't know.

617
00:57:11,740 --> 00:57:17,830
But I would agree completely that the the term I in my training, which was only completed in 27,

618
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:24,160
I've never heard the term social German stuff like it just it did not exist in terms and

619
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:28,600
yet like what I studied was why did people get depression right as we were talking about.

620
00:57:29,110 --> 00:57:32,860
And I guess what I would say is like I think the field of the challenge with

621
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:36,230
social determinants of health is tell me something that's not associate term,

622
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:44,650
like it's pretty much everything you can. Whereas here we're going to talk about like, you know, trauma within this popular the life force.

623
00:57:44,950 --> 00:57:52,690
That's what's been associated with risk of X, Y or Z, right? Or you know, we'll talk about like social transmission of behavior.

624
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:57,190
We're talking about suicide. Right? So like, how do how do ideas get transmitted within groups, right.

625
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:04,479
Or, you know, the so so I think it's it's or we talk about like substance use, for example.

626
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:08,510
And that's something that's very like based in place. People don't get drugs from like ten states away.

627
00:58:08,530 --> 00:58:11,290
They can drugs within like within a very close area.

628
00:58:11,650 --> 00:58:18,310
So that all those sorts of ideas of like what clusters in space and stuff like that are are have been present.

629
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:25,460
I. I think that I mean, I would also say just that this is I guess a hot take is like,

630
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:30,560
you know, I mean, Kelly Mikulski, an epidemiologist, studies autism and dementia.

631
00:58:30,890 --> 00:58:35,690
I don't know that she would consider itself like a psychiatric epidemiologist, probably considers lot more like an environmental epidemiologist.

632
00:58:35,690 --> 00:58:40,700
So like when they hired me, I'm like, you know, you don't have anybody who studies suicide or substance use,

633
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:44,780
which are the two the two leading causes of death in the top ten, you're like literally no one.

634
00:58:44,810 --> 00:58:49,000
You know, how many people do you have for the study? Obesity? How many people do you have here that study cancer?

635
00:58:49,010 --> 00:58:53,839
Right. You know, and so it's there's a there's a disconnect.

636
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:57,770
And for those of you sorry, you're you're but you're not.

637
00:58:57,770 --> 00:59:02,330
The MSW is my MSW. You're here.

638
00:59:02,750 --> 00:59:06,320
Yes. You're doing the MSW. Yes. And that's I'm I'm sorry.

639
00:59:06,410 --> 00:59:09,920
Oh, sorry. So there's nobody doing a dual MSW. Oh, sorry. I just listening to that.

640
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:15,380
Okay. Well, the point is about like where I was going with this is that a lot of where that work has happened is in schools, in social work,

641
00:59:15,770 --> 00:59:19,820
like there's been I forget what you're used to be kind of social work and public health are kind of much more combined.

642
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:26,329
But as public health got more professional and social work got more sort of socially engaged,

643
00:59:26,330 --> 00:59:29,860
I would say like in some ways I think like we need to kind of come back together.

644
00:59:29,870 --> 00:59:35,449
We have a very, very good school social here, the best one in the country. But like the in terms of like performance,

645
00:59:35,450 --> 00:59:41,540
in terms of like it's sort of like the best the top five and then like everybody else in terms of like research, like rigor and things like that.

646
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:47,870
So it's this is not a typical school in social work. And so there's a lot of questions.

647
00:59:50,330 --> 00:59:55,440
All right, I'm going to set a timer for 20 minutes, so I'll see you then and I'll be here.

648
00:59:55,740 --> 01:00:08,790
I got to go get some water or something like that. So I'm. I think so, yes.

649
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:13,320
Yes. Thank you. Thank you for asking this. I don't know what the rules are.

650
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:21,540
Okay. Yeah, for sure. Thank you.

651
01:00:26,220 --> 01:00:33,060
I just want to actually.

652
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:40,830
Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Right.

653
01:00:47,590 --> 01:00:52,480
Yeah, yeah. They're just kind of like a place to stay.

654
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:55,750
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

655
01:00:57,160 --> 01:01:20,860
I'm like. I say, it's an environment where you're in all the times, but right now we're gearing up for the there's nothing that give where.

656
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:56,580
Yeah. Yeah, just the displacement is doing.

657
01:01:57,970 --> 01:02:26,310
So I just think that all their actions at some point in time so that the train would.

658
01:02:37,180 --> 01:03:03,700
I. Trump and third parties need to have.

659
01:03:51,890 --> 01:04:11,590
Even. And.

660
01:04:30,010 --> 01:04:38,550
For. It's.

661
01:04:58,710 --> 01:05:05,830
I've seen those jobs. I used to live for jobs like myself.

662
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:46,180
Until you can tell me more. Yeah. Well, I think that's one of the things that I like sometimes is like, Yeah, well, this is good for you, too.

663
01:05:47,410 --> 01:05:54,520
So I was like, Oh, I'm fine. I'm 100% Muslim.

664
01:05:54,520 --> 01:06:06,320
I definitely can't be more than that.

665
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:19,930
And if I'm not really, I'm just not that good.

666
01:06:20,330 --> 01:06:28,000
I mean, I. Did you know I took the bus?

667
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:34,150
Okay. I'm just curious, especially if that's true.

668
01:06:35,740 --> 01:06:41,559
I was a student of the firm, and Davis even dropped me off there.

669
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:45,600
And that's the equivalent of, like, going to the bus for me.

670
01:06:45,610 --> 01:06:52,030
So that worked. What do you mean, your way?

671
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:55,250
Yeah, I guess I have the journey over to the library.

672
01:06:55,290 --> 01:07:01,300
I'm kind of too lazy to go to the library, search for it, check it out.

673
01:07:01,390 --> 01:07:08,080
I'd rather just put it on hold and clean up, which is what I do for fun.

674
01:07:09,370 --> 01:07:14,050
In the same way it's that you can really go out on the actual work.

675
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:20,410
I mean, I'm going to get one on one time during this time.

676
01:07:20,460 --> 01:07:46,400
And I just I do want to still do like physical books on the computer that you can just do that because then you kind of go a little bit.

677
01:07:50,620 --> 01:07:55,970
Series. It wasn't easy either way.

678
01:07:57,310 --> 01:08:01,060
I guess the next point, Grizzly.

679
01:08:03,540 --> 01:08:10,240
Yeah. It was so good to see, like.

680
01:08:13,270 --> 01:08:26,890
You don't want to do it because it's free and it's ready for action in.

681
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:36,010
I hope that it doesn't happen.

682
01:08:40,270 --> 01:09:10,090
I know I didn't realize it was a permanent part, but it's a much needed promise to make sure that can happen, she said.

683
01:09:11,070 --> 01:09:20,530
Yes. Yeah.

684
01:09:27,990 --> 01:09:37,960
As of this year, it's 103.

685
01:10:01,220 --> 01:10:20,570
I. Old.

686
01:10:23,780 --> 01:10:49,560
Citizens question. I am the one who would love to pack a bag or a big bag and I have to do something as I was like 32 guys.

687
01:10:49,630 --> 01:10:52,640
You can just see two things.

688
01:10:53,860 --> 01:11:03,900
Another the beach of but I like this because I time is very different under them

689
01:11:04,230 --> 01:11:09,010
as in put it back in that world either for the body to have an expression.

690
01:11:10,090 --> 01:11:16,380
So that's how I was getting to see how people somehow become in that state.

691
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:21,339
So I was on my side, which is like, [INAUDIBLE] it.

692
01:11:21,340 --> 01:11:25,750
And it just went down, up my head.

693
01:11:29,210 --> 01:11:36,340
And it's clear that this is what it is, that this is water.

694
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:43,620
Was and I was like, okay, so now I'm the business.

695
01:11:44,460 --> 01:11:48,520
And that helps that whole picture message to you.

696
01:11:49,780 --> 01:12:02,560
It's still good to know that that is something really does jump on it.

697
01:12:03,190 --> 01:12:08,150
So I try.

698
01:12:33,220 --> 01:12:49,180
And, you know, that just isn't happening now with the war in Iraq.

699
01:12:49,210 --> 01:12:56,350
Exactly. That's what I was like. That's right. Oh, that's cool.

700
01:12:57,020 --> 01:13:21,240
Oh, God. That's funny. I have always been a person just like myself.

701
01:13:22,590 --> 01:13:27,650
I live here.

702
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:35,400
I have closely associated with the public sector.

703
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:50,390
I see this stuff around the person that everybody is that I'm hopefully in the room.

704
01:13:50,770 --> 01:13:54,510
Why? Well, apparently it's on one time class. It's actually people.

705
01:13:54,990 --> 01:14:04,380
Which one? I'm sorry to tell you, one isn't usually one that's useful to me having taken this class until it was my fault.

706
01:14:04,460 --> 01:14:12,450
And it's not one person that's analyzing cluster data, stuff that I just will be using.

707
01:14:13,860 --> 01:14:24,060
I mean, I'm sorry you learn something from your 20 to my 40 seconds is a series of like.

708
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:30,350
Just so that the lab notes. You said Susan was great.

709
01:14:30,380 --> 01:14:34,610
Oh, yeah, she is. It was the one thing that was really hilarious.

710
01:14:35,330 --> 01:15:06,720
I should have done this. As soon as look at the electorate at the moment, just kind of.

711
01:15:07,810 --> 01:15:15,190
I don't do that. I always thought, oh, I don't need to know.

712
01:15:15,590 --> 01:15:19,690
Good to know. Well, it's good information, especially those like.

713
01:15:20,060 --> 01:15:24,490
I mean, I just I think literally the last day to have a plan.

714
01:15:24,580 --> 01:15:32,080
Yeah, I know, she said. Yeah, well she can't.

715
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:38,880
She really. She doesn't. Yeah. So the administration, I guess, chooses that time.

716
01:15:39,510 --> 01:15:48,630
Right. Well, that's what you're doing is you're example calling the question of a test because we didn't have to.

717
01:15:49,330 --> 01:15:55,090
Right. Right. That's American citizen.

718
01:15:56,910 --> 01:16:11,340
I just think it was interesting to hear an urgent.

719
01:16:18,550 --> 01:16:24,500
Pretty simple.

720
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:50,520
Actually. What?

721
01:16:56,380 --> 01:17:00,650
I didn't know that she turned it over.

722
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:37,490
Oh. You know, and we.

723
01:17:41,890 --> 01:18:01,360
Just doesn't work so well.

724
01:18:03,130 --> 01:18:07,240
I'm sorry. I think that's a lie.

725
01:18:08,050 --> 01:18:13,660
But it doesn't turn the page.

726
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:22,160
That's the sun and all the cooling trends.

727
01:18:22,900 --> 01:18:27,410
I wish it could include that.

728
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:37,990
So I think it's quite a bit.

729
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:51,040
You know what I mean?

730
01:18:56,120 --> 01:19:00,730
You know, so the.

731
01:19:02,100 --> 01:19:11,250
Oh. Yeah, I know.

732
01:19:12,170 --> 01:19:18,040
Funny stuff. Yeah. The.

733
01:19:26,620 --> 01:19:30,640
I was working in India and.

734
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:56,780
Having that know, they'll tell you that, you know, I was talking to my family.

735
01:19:58,970 --> 01:20:12,210
This was the third stimulus that I was given in the Senate that this man planned to move on to New York.

736
01:20:14,870 --> 01:20:20,960
All right. And we're back. Any questions come up?

737
01:20:20,990 --> 01:20:28,750
Well, we were. All right.

738
01:20:31,510 --> 01:20:40,329
So the what I want to turn to now are some kind of give me a little bit of a historical periods,

739
01:20:40,330 --> 01:20:44,379
and I don't walk you through some really important historical studies, what you're going to,

740
01:20:44,380 --> 01:20:47,860
again, plant ideas that we're going to revisit throughout the course.

741
01:20:48,070 --> 01:20:56,170
That's kind of specific case examples. So the first one I want to talk to you about is email Durkheim.

742
01:20:56,170 --> 01:21:01,990
Samuel Durkheim is sort of credited with essentially founding the field of sociology.

743
01:21:03,010 --> 01:21:05,890
He studies lots of things, but one of the things he studied was suicide.

744
01:21:06,070 --> 01:21:17,200
And he essentially did a the first sort of geospatial study of suicide in Europe and found that suicides

745
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:25,660
are much less common in Catholic areas of kind of Western Europe than they are in Protestant periods.

746
01:21:26,890 --> 01:21:30,730
And what makes that sort of where the sociology part comes in?

747
01:21:30,730 --> 01:21:33,879
So that's sort of like that's a kind of standard epidemiology finding, right? Okay.

748
01:21:33,880 --> 01:21:39,910
Well, this is more here versus elsewhere, but he actually comes up with a the field of sociology,

749
01:21:39,910 --> 01:21:45,580
not simply from taking this finding, but from proposing a potential mechanism.

750
01:21:45,580 --> 01:21:51,910
So how many of you are Catholic? Anybody Catholic? How do you get absolution from sentence if you're Catholic confession?

751
01:21:51,940 --> 01:21:55,270
And what is confession for those of us in the room who have not had the pleasure?

752
01:21:57,190 --> 01:22:03,920
Terrible. Yeah, go ahead. You sit in my room sometimes you're, like, parted from that, sometimes not.

753
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:12,579
You, like, say everything you place, then all of your sins from the left side, you can kind of just feel like a catch.

754
01:22:12,580 --> 01:22:19,510
All Yeah, sure. Yeah. And then they absorb the obvious, and then you have to do a paradox.

755
01:22:21,370 --> 01:22:26,350
It's like my prayers are do something here. Yes, yes. So I'm also raised Catholic and so.

756
01:22:26,440 --> 01:22:31,120
So but for you, the point is you got to go through the church.

757
01:22:31,810 --> 01:22:38,290
So what in your and Protestant religions, you just got to kind of ask for it, you know, so you don't you don't have to go through a priest.

758
01:22:38,890 --> 01:22:44,530
So the his argument is that part of the reason why Catholic areas have less suicide

759
01:22:44,530 --> 01:22:47,679
in Protestant areas is because of the social control that the Catholic Church has,

760
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:52,810
which is different than the social control that the Protestant Church has over over its practitioners.

761
01:22:54,160 --> 01:22:58,030
And this is an example of social control in this case having a good effect.

762
01:22:58,030 --> 01:23:00,520
We don't necessarily think about social control as being a good thing.

763
01:23:00,790 --> 01:23:05,740
Now, this is what this is you maybe you maybe you've heard about the study like I heard, that's an ecological study.

764
01:23:06,220 --> 01:23:07,930
But all those things are also true. Right?

765
01:23:07,930 --> 01:23:19,089
But this this finding that the fact that people who are engaged with social sort of relationships, whether that's church,

766
01:23:19,090 --> 01:23:23,790
whether that's work, whether that's family, do have lower risk of suicide than people who are more isolated.

767
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:27,910
And so the the kind of core idea has been has held up.

768
01:23:27,910 --> 01:23:34,630
And so, again, he he begins the field of sociology. We're trying to understand why does the rate of suicide vary by religious denomination

769
01:23:34,690 --> 01:23:38,889
when especially when both of these religions consider suicide like a mortal sin?

770
01:23:38,890 --> 01:23:43,810
Right. So, like, it shouldn't be like that somehow. It's less of a big deal if you're a Protestant than it is if you're Catholic.

771
01:23:44,530 --> 01:23:49,690
Although the other way that the Catholic Church exerts social control and this has actually only just recently changed in,

772
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:55,690
in Ireland at the time, if you committed suicide, you could not be buried in a Catholic cemetery.

773
01:23:55,690 --> 01:24:04,719
You could not have a funeral mass. So not only would you not only was it stigmatizing, but your entire family was stigmatized.

774
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:11,500
So this is, again, an example of social control with the idea of like how social factors relate to something in this case like suicide.

775
01:24:13,250 --> 01:24:18,980
So another important study was done by Joseph Goldberg. So this is one of the first identified causes of mental disorder.

776
01:24:19,730 --> 01:24:24,920
You probably never heard of the word disease. Pellagra. The reason you haven't heard of it is because it doesn't really exist anymore.

777
01:24:25,220 --> 01:24:32,660
But it was a disease that affected about 3 million people in predominantly poor and marginalized groups, particularly in the southern United States.

778
01:24:33,470 --> 01:24:39,950
It was described at the time of a disease of the three D's dermatitis, dementia, which they didn't mean dementia like what?

779
01:24:39,950 --> 01:24:44,630
We mean dementia. They essentially meant like hallucinations and delusions or psychosis and death.

780
01:24:45,860 --> 01:24:51,190
It was Goldberg that did these experiments in prison.

781
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:53,960
So you can just already know these were not ethical.

782
01:24:54,260 --> 01:25:01,410
But what he noticed was, is that prisoners in prisons tended to get polygraph, but the guards didn't get telegram.

783
01:25:01,430 --> 01:25:06,190
And at the time, this isn't where we're getting germ theory. So everybody thought this was an infectious disease.

784
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:09,800
But he's like, well, if it's infectious disease, then the guards should be getting it, too. But they weren't getting it.

785
01:25:10,310 --> 01:25:17,750
And so what he found was that the meals that prisoners got, particularly in the South, were just basically completely missing niacin.

786
01:25:18,290 --> 01:25:23,059
And so they and it is a disease that's caused by massive niacin deficiency.

787
01:25:23,060 --> 01:25:27,650
And so all of our foods or many of our foods are fortified with niacin now and again.

788
01:25:27,650 --> 01:25:31,430
So we don't get we don't have this disease.

789
01:25:31,430 --> 01:25:37,940
But this is an example of essentially a nutritional problem, resulting in a mental what was understood to be a mental disorder.

790
01:25:38,540 --> 01:25:42,469
We're going to revisit this when we talk about the relationship between celiac disease and schizophrenia.

791
01:25:42,470 --> 01:25:49,190
And. So there was an earlier question about kind of social patterning.

792
01:25:49,190 --> 01:25:52,910
So this is another very famous study is Paris and Dunham. This is Chicago.

793
01:25:52,940 --> 01:26:01,130
This is Lake Michigan right here. So in 1939, they geo coded all hospital admissions in the city of Chicago.

794
01:26:01,460 --> 01:26:07,730
And specifically at that time, most of what was what people were admitted for was schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

795
01:26:08,240 --> 01:26:12,860
And what they observed was that people who were admitted for schizophrenia were

796
01:26:12,860 --> 01:26:17,809
far more likely to live in the urban center of Chicago versus the outskirts.

797
01:26:17,810 --> 01:26:24,110
But for people with bipolar disorder, which is, again, a very serious form of mental illness, they the pattern was just sort of all over the place.

798
01:26:24,140 --> 01:26:27,770
So there's an urban concentration for people who have schizophrenia.

799
01:26:27,770 --> 01:26:30,139
There's no urban population concentration.

800
01:26:30,140 --> 01:26:37,520
People have schizophrenia or cited for bipolar disorder, despite the fact that both of these conditions are very impairing.

801
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:39,469
Both of them have an early onset in the life course.

802
01:26:39,470 --> 01:26:49,400
They actually have a very strong genetic correlation of between the two and this observation that they first made in 1939 that either living in or

803
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:57,049
growing up in an urban environment is associated with increased risk of schizophrenia specifically has been replicated literally hundreds of times.

804
01:26:57,050 --> 01:27:04,610
And we still don't know why. We don't know why this happens. But this is a finding that has has held up, at least in Western nations.

805
01:27:04,610 --> 01:27:05,629
When we're talking about schizophrenia.

806
01:27:05,630 --> 01:27:09,860
One thing things might tell you is that almost everything we know about schizophrenia comes from about four countries.

807
01:27:10,280 --> 01:27:18,829
So most of it's actually not the United States. So another important study I already mentioned to you is the Midtown Manhattan study.

808
01:27:18,830 --> 01:27:25,910
So this is we can consider this sort of like one of the first studies to examine stress, like what is stress and what does it mean for mental health.

809
01:27:26,810 --> 01:27:31,490
So they again, they don't have mental disorders. This is Beyonce who's not born yet.

810
01:27:31,490 --> 01:27:35,870
We don't have the DSM three. So instead, what they're just looking at what they call like mental health risks.

811
01:27:35,870 --> 01:27:39,680
This is an actual figure from their from their table or from their book.

812
01:27:39,950 --> 01:27:47,599
So on the x axis, they have stress score. On the Y axis, they have mental health risk again, which is just again, no, it's not depression symptoms.

813
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:51,130
It's not anxiety. It's just worse. Better, right.

814
01:27:51,140 --> 01:27:52,070
That's all they've got here.

815
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:58,129
And what they observe is that there is a positive correlation between the more stress you tell me about in the worse your mental health.

816
01:27:58,130 --> 01:28:02,150
And they also observed that this relationship is stronger among people who have lower socio economic status.

817
01:28:02,150 --> 01:28:08,600
So they both to the earlier comment about like where were the social determinants while they were always baked into this this type of study,

818
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:14,640
a few years later we get Browne and Harris who, you know.

819
01:28:14,660 --> 01:28:17,750
So there's something like this stress score not very helpful.

820
01:28:17,990 --> 01:28:22,670
Who among you is not stressed? Is that not what we. That's probably not what we're talking about.

821
01:28:22,670 --> 01:28:27,530
And we're talking about like how stress relates to mental disorder, at least not not all of what we're talking about.

822
01:28:28,070 --> 01:28:37,940
So Brown and Harris in London now do this very important work on really trying to bring develop a typology of stress

823
01:28:38,390 --> 01:28:45,890
as it relates to getting more clarity about under what conditions is stress a cause in this case of depression.

824
01:28:46,460 --> 01:28:51,530
So we know for lots of reasons, like some stress is good for you and it motivates you to do things.

825
01:28:51,530 --> 01:28:54,200
It helps sort of like, you know, you're in dangerous, you should get out of the way.

826
01:28:54,200 --> 01:28:58,250
Or for example, but not all events are sort of lead to depression.

827
01:28:58,340 --> 01:29:05,879
And what they found was that this was a study of lower income women in London, is that events that were characterized by loss.

828
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:12,100
So like this is a bereavement or humiliation or change or.

829
01:29:12,370 --> 01:29:19,779
Humiliation, which is, you know, you've you've lost all your family's money and gambling, you know, or entrapment.

830
01:29:19,780 --> 01:29:22,930
So this would be like you're in a marriage that you can't leave.

831
01:29:23,230 --> 01:29:27,309
These are the types of events that are particularly strongly related to risk of depression,

832
01:29:27,310 --> 01:29:32,620
whereas being in a dangerous events like being in a car accident, for example, is really not related to risk of depression.

833
01:29:32,620 --> 01:29:36,579
And they developed this really extensive inventory called the Life Finance and Difficulty Scale.

834
01:29:36,580 --> 01:29:38,920
That probably takes about 45 minutes to administer.

835
01:29:40,780 --> 01:29:47,620
There's no study, no big population based study that I know of that administers anything like that level of detail for stress measures.

836
01:29:47,620 --> 01:29:51,939
And fortunately, typically you get like four items which we'll talk about later.

837
01:29:51,940 --> 01:29:57,600
We're talking about measurement. But the point is, is like these other measures, these more nuanced measures do exist like this.

838
01:29:57,610 --> 01:30:02,559
These are things that were on people's minds when they were trying to understand how it is something like stress,

839
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:09,200
whatever we mean by that, relate to mental health. In 1979.

840
01:30:09,210 --> 01:30:12,990
We are back in the United States and we're at the University of Michigan.

841
01:30:13,080 --> 01:30:19,280
So. This is a this is a book called Life in Black America.

842
01:30:19,310 --> 01:30:27,379
This is edited by James Jackson. It describes the National Survey of Black Americans, which was the first national survey of the person.

843
01:30:27,380 --> 01:30:30,890
And he goes on to do the replication of this, the National Survey of American Life.

844
01:30:31,490 --> 01:30:37,819
Prior to this time, there had really been no effort to sample the heterogeneity within the black population in the United States.

845
01:30:37,820 --> 01:30:44,480
And James Jackson, who passed away in 2020 and was here, he was the director of the Institute for Social Research for two decades.

846
01:30:44,630 --> 01:30:51,200
And a good friend and mentor of mine did all of this work, which is I really encourage you to this is it's just incredible.

847
01:30:52,310 --> 01:30:56,180
I think he's trained more black psychologists than anyone else on the planet.

848
01:30:56,600 --> 01:30:59,210
Actually, he was just an incredible mentor.

849
01:31:00,230 --> 01:31:07,460
Anyway, so we what's interesting about this method, so this is again, Beyonce is not born yet, so we don't have the DSM three.

850
01:31:07,940 --> 01:31:12,980
But not only that, we're trying to like, you know, he's comes to the world or he comes to this problem like,

851
01:31:13,490 --> 01:31:15,470
you know, how to draw a nationally representative sample.

852
01:31:15,620 --> 01:31:19,130
How do you know how to draw a nationally representative sample of a specific racial ethnic group?

853
01:31:19,190 --> 01:31:21,110
Nobody had ever done it before. No way.

854
01:31:21,650 --> 01:31:29,690
So so they they actually came up with one and he came up with this name two WASP, which is you ask white people where the black people were.

855
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:36,530
And they literally only had to ask like two people in every neighborhood for in these very rural places to find out where they were.

856
01:31:36,530 --> 01:31:39,200
They didn't miss anybody. So again,

857
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:47,270
so the idea of like using racial discrimination and racial surveillance to like do your sampling that I think was lost by that was definitely so.

858
01:31:48,740 --> 01:31:52,160
And this is also the very first national survey to field items on racial discrimination.

859
01:31:52,160 --> 01:31:56,629
They were written by a man named Philip Bowman. You may know the name Bowman because he is our dean of the School of Public Health.

860
01:31:56,630 --> 01:32:01,520
So his father wrote the very first questions on racial discrimination, which I feel about this survey.

861
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:04,280
I know. Look at this tribute you've got. You can impress all your friends.

862
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:09,950
So it also was one of the first surveys to really address the roles of family, spirituality, coping.

863
01:32:09,950 --> 01:32:15,590
So that is health promotion factors of mental health. Prior to this time, most people are just interested in things that cause poor mental health.

864
01:32:16,430 --> 01:32:21,860
As I'll tell you about in this class, African-Americans and actually all other groups, with the exception of Native Americans,

865
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:25,370
they have all other minority groups in the United States,

866
01:32:25,370 --> 01:32:31,669
other than American Indians or Alaska Natives, have better mental health than non-Hispanic whites.

867
01:32:31,670 --> 01:32:35,649
So that part of what the study was trying to has by DSM criteria.

868
01:32:35,650 --> 01:32:38,900
And so what we're trying to understand is sort of like what are these protective factors

869
01:32:38,900 --> 01:32:42,080
that are more common in this population and how do we how do we understand those?

870
01:32:42,440 --> 01:32:49,220
So this has been followed up over time with the National Survey of American Life, which I'll tell you about in a in a few minutes.

871
01:32:50,300 --> 01:32:55,850
Okay. So now B.A. is born, we get the new epidemiologic catchment area project.

872
01:32:55,850 --> 01:33:05,450
This is the first effort to understand or to start to quantify how much mental

873
01:33:05,450 --> 01:33:10,520
disorder is there in the US population as a function as defined by the DSM three.

874
01:33:10,850 --> 01:33:15,560
So this is the very first effort to figure out how many people have depression,

875
01:33:15,740 --> 01:33:19,910
how many people have anxiety disorder or generalized anxiety disorder, how many people have panic disorder?

876
01:33:19,910 --> 01:33:23,810
How many people have bipolar disorder? How many people have substance use disorder? This is the very first effort.

877
01:33:24,410 --> 01:33:31,160
It's not a national study. It's five sites. It's and then they do a every site that a one year incidence study.

878
01:33:31,160 --> 01:33:35,450
So both point prevalence and lifetime prevalence and then one year incidence,

879
01:33:36,830 --> 01:33:40,129
it was the first to employ these fully structured diagnostic instruments that

880
01:33:40,130 --> 01:33:43,970
were basically operationalizing the DSM criteria that I told you about earlier.

881
01:33:44,690 --> 01:33:51,950
They did pioneering fieldwork methods that have basically formed the basis for every other statistic I'm going to tell you about in this class.

882
01:33:52,040 --> 01:33:58,990
Everything came from the methods that were developed by the ACA, a study of what people call the project of easy study.

883
01:33:59,630 --> 01:34:05,360
The only study that continued follow up and is actually still in the field today is the Baltimore site.

884
01:34:05,360 --> 01:34:10,580
So the Baltimore site has had a continuous follow up of this cohort that was originally sampled in 1980.

885
01:34:10,970 --> 01:34:17,540
Since 1980, I was fortunate to be the project coordinator for the fourth wave of this re-interview.

886
01:34:17,540 --> 01:34:24,739
So my when I was 22 years old, my job was to find all these people again and reinterview them.

887
01:34:24,740 --> 01:34:31,790
And it changed my life because it was at the time the idea that something that happened to you earlier,

888
01:34:32,060 --> 01:34:35,810
like in your teens or whatever, these people were now in their forties, right?

889
01:34:35,810 --> 01:34:39,140
So I'm like it's like I literally was watching my future or studying my future.

890
01:34:39,890 --> 01:34:42,469
So the idea that something that happened to you when you were 20 could have anything

891
01:34:42,470 --> 01:34:45,290
to do with your health when you're 40 was literally a mind blowing idea to me.

892
01:34:46,970 --> 01:34:51,590
And so this study, the Baltimore side of the project is is essentially our Framingham study.

893
01:34:51,800 --> 01:34:56,209
It is the longest continually enrolled cohort study trying to specifically

894
01:34:56,210 --> 01:35:00,950
understand the causes and consequences of mental disorders as defined by the DSM.

895
01:35:03,740 --> 01:35:07,930
Okay. So some of the stories that I just told you about, so for example, the NSA.

896
01:35:07,940 --> 01:35:13,850
L there's also two other surveys that are part of this, what's called the collaborative psychiatric epidemiologic surveys.

897
01:35:14,240 --> 01:35:17,270
One. The NSA holds a sample of African-Americans, Caribbean blacks.

898
01:35:17,270 --> 01:35:20,479
The National Committee Study is a nationally representative sample, and the National,

899
01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:25,280
Latino and Asian American Survey is, as the name implies, a national survey of Latinos and Asian-Americans.

900
01:35:25,490 --> 01:35:29,840
You're going to use those data to do your homework. Number one, you'll get some exposure to this.

901
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:36,680
And I say this to you now, because for your check point number four, you're going to have to find a data set that's relevant to your topic.

902
01:35:36,680 --> 01:35:39,140
It might be this one. It might be something else. Right. I don't you know what?

903
01:35:39,290 --> 01:35:44,509
I will help you find one, but I just I want you to kind of already start getting that idea in mind.

904
01:35:44,510 --> 01:35:48,320
And this is through I CPR. How many know what that is?

905
01:35:48,530 --> 01:35:58,030
I've just changed your life. Can you so this is like literally Google like stop shopping and go Google like I see PSR this is all pre data.

906
01:35:58,590 --> 01:36:01,610
Free data is run here down the street at the University of Michigan,

907
01:36:01,880 --> 01:36:11,750
all free literally like millions of data points free for you to analyze all the code books it's do they have it in says yes they have it in art.

908
01:36:11,750 --> 01:36:17,060
Yes. Do they have it in SPSS? Yes. They have an Excel? Yes. Okay.

909
01:36:17,340 --> 01:36:21,360
So let's find something. All right. So what does history taught us so far?

910
01:36:21,390 --> 01:36:25,709
So we know that mental disorders or severe mental distress are common in the general population,

911
01:36:25,710 --> 01:36:30,900
that they are systematically distributed by factors like age, gender, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic says in urban city.

912
01:36:30,900 --> 01:36:34,620
And that social factors, stress and trauma in particular, are important determinants of mental disorders.

913
01:36:34,620 --> 01:36:38,790
So we knew all of that prior to without sort of having any of what we would

914
01:36:38,790 --> 01:36:43,830
consider like modern modern methods in terms of measures or things like that.

915
01:36:44,100 --> 01:36:47,280
So let me pause here for questions.

916
01:36:47,700 --> 01:37:00,610
The history. Okay.

917
01:37:02,740 --> 01:37:07,360
Okay. So. Now I want to talk about the question.

918
01:37:08,080 --> 01:37:11,380
Like what? What do you mean? Is a mental disorder and what is the DSM?

919
01:37:11,390 --> 01:37:14,740
So some of you have some familiarity with this claim. You've taken a course in psychology.

920
01:37:14,740 --> 01:37:19,420
But but don't worry if you have it. I'm going to explain what this book is and what it is and what it's not, which problem more important.

921
01:37:21,700 --> 01:37:28,269
So the first thing I want you to understand is that people will have a historic both in conversation, but even in writing referred to.

922
01:37:28,270 --> 01:37:31,600
This book is like psychiatry's Bible. Psychiatry does not have a Bible.

923
01:37:31,780 --> 01:37:34,629
Okay, there is this is not a biblical text. This is not a religious text.

924
01:37:34,630 --> 01:37:40,480
Nobody believes that what is in this book is somehow like ordained or the truth.

925
01:37:40,600 --> 01:37:45,150
Nobody, nobody who's worth anything believes that. Instead, what is it?

926
01:37:45,160 --> 01:37:51,250
It's a handbook. It's a handbook in the same way that you might have, like a travel guide that would,

927
01:37:51,250 --> 01:37:55,330
like, advise you about how to see the sights of West Michigan or whatever.

928
01:37:55,630 --> 01:37:59,140
Like, this is a handbook for helping you understand the rainbow of misery.

929
01:37:59,140 --> 01:38:04,000
That is the human experience. Now, why isn't a classification system like why?

930
01:38:04,210 --> 01:38:07,930
Why? Why do I say that? It's it's this kind of cheap word handbook.

931
01:38:08,020 --> 01:38:15,880
Well, the reason is because a classification system is organized by some ideal pathology.

932
01:38:15,940 --> 01:38:17,379
And I'll show you an example of what I mean by that.

933
01:38:17,380 --> 01:38:24,040
So the international classification of diseases is organized by ideal pathology, that is, for example,

934
01:38:24,040 --> 01:38:29,380
to be diseases of the heart, diseases of the liver, diseases of the circulatory system, etc.

935
01:38:29,950 --> 01:38:35,830
What this book is organized by is what is by according to what things look like each other.

936
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:41,020
That has nothing to do with whether they have the same causes, whether they have the same treatments,

937
01:38:41,020 --> 01:38:46,870
whether they have the same pathology or anything else that might be happening underneath the hood.

938
01:38:48,340 --> 01:38:51,360
So let me set an example.

939
01:38:52,840 --> 01:38:55,930
Oh, yeah. So here's to you. So, yes, I'll come back to that. So here's an example.

940
01:38:55,930 --> 01:39:00,760
So these are all this is an example of a of a classification system.

941
01:39:00,970 --> 01:39:06,879
If you go to the ICD and you go to the Section I, section I are the diseases of the circulatory system.

942
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:14,140
So you have everything from rheumatic fever to hypertension to pulmonary heart disease to a stroke.

943
01:39:15,150 --> 01:39:18,740
These do not have the same symptoms. They do not affect the same people.

944
01:39:18,750 --> 01:39:26,190
They don't have they don't they're organized because they are all affecting the the circulatory system.

945
01:39:26,940 --> 01:39:35,580
If you go to the DSM and you look up mood disorders, what you're going to find is this disorder is a Category two, who's the primary symptom is mood.

946
01:39:36,180 --> 01:39:39,989
And so it includes things where people are like really sad but also really happy.

947
01:39:39,990 --> 01:39:46,590
And it includes things like bipolar disorder, which has a very strong genetic correlation to schizophrenia, psychodynamic disorder,

948
01:39:46,590 --> 01:39:51,840
which is like a version of this dysthymia, which we know almost nothing about major depressive disorder,

949
01:39:51,840 --> 01:40:01,379
which is a very strong correlation translating. Okay. But so these these are do not have the same risk factors and they don't look the same.

950
01:40:01,380 --> 01:40:06,270
And the drugs that we use to treat people with major depression are not the same drugs that we use people to treat bipolar disorder.

951
01:40:06,750 --> 01:40:10,260
And yet they're all organized under the same the same thing.

952
01:40:10,270 --> 01:40:14,399
So again, in the why, because they all have the same symptom in the same way you might think.

953
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:20,670
Like they all like these are all I'm trying to imagine like a, you know, these are all songbirds type of thing, right?

954
01:40:20,670 --> 01:40:23,850
They're not related to each other. They just sort of like all makes pretty music.

955
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:32,040
Okay, so what what is the purpose of this handbook? The purpose is to provide reliable assessment.

956
01:40:32,040 --> 01:40:40,619
So, again, prior to the onset being born, there were no consistent, widely accepted operational criteria of what constituted each disorder.

957
01:40:40,620 --> 01:40:44,219
If you went to ten different psychiatrists, you could get ten different diagnoses.

958
01:40:44,220 --> 01:40:51,820
That is not acceptable. So like without reliability, we can never say anything about reality, right?

959
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:55,229
We have to be like this. The basis of science is reproduction.

960
01:40:55,230 --> 01:40:59,550
Reproduction. You do a study and you get an answer. I do the same study as you get the same answer.

961
01:41:00,060 --> 01:41:09,000
So but the and and and beyond that, I have to have even though you think like, well, I want to know the truth, make sure I do too.

962
01:41:09,420 --> 01:41:12,510
But like without reliability, I can never even approach the truth.

963
01:41:12,660 --> 01:41:19,260
Why? Because this is this is the world that we were living in prior to the DSM three.

964
01:41:19,350 --> 01:41:24,660
So you get six different or five different diagnoses.

965
01:41:24,930 --> 01:41:28,260
None of them are the truth, which is the middle, but they're also not the same.

966
01:41:29,550 --> 01:41:34,440
This is the world that we live in. So I you go see five different people.

967
01:41:34,440 --> 01:41:37,860
You get about the same diagnosis. But it's not the truth. The truth is you're right.

968
01:41:37,860 --> 01:41:40,470
But at least you're getting the same answer no matter who you go to see.

969
01:41:40,950 --> 01:41:49,290
But I need this grouping to happen, so then I can start to move it, you know, figure out how do I actually get closer to the truth and maybe,

970
01:41:49,290 --> 01:41:52,290
like the Orthodox stuff will eventually help us get here, you know what I mean?

971
01:41:52,290 --> 01:41:56,249
Because we'll kind of figure out that the things that are the things that look

972
01:41:56,250 --> 01:41:59,639
like this have this other kind of biomarker or something or something else,

973
01:41:59,640 --> 01:42:04,740
like maybe that will help us get there. But with until we until we can all say that's depression.

974
01:42:05,610 --> 01:42:08,790
And then try to pull it apart. We're never going to. We can't go anywhere.

975
01:42:09,750 --> 01:42:12,390
We can't have a scientific conversation. We can't generate knowledge.

976
01:42:13,290 --> 01:42:18,390
So also, I call it a handbook, not because that's a hot take, but because it calls itself a handbook.

977
01:42:18,480 --> 01:42:23,790
Okay. So this is from the DSM website says the Diagnostic Statistical Manual is a handbook

978
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:27,030
used by health care professionals in the United States and much of the world.

979
01:42:27,030 --> 01:42:35,810
In fact, most of the world they use the ICD. But the ICD just just in this one section is identical almost to the ice to the DSM.

980
01:42:35,820 --> 01:42:41,670
So it is it is still even though it's called the classification system, the section on mental disorder is organized just like this.

981
01:42:41,680 --> 01:42:48,510
So don't don't be fooled by that. The again, it contains descriptions, symptoms and criteria.

982
01:42:48,840 --> 01:42:53,190
It provides a common language for people to communicate about what they're seeing.

983
01:42:53,490 --> 01:42:57,360
It establishes consistent policy about that, but reliable diagnoses.

984
01:42:58,380 --> 01:43:02,400
And again, this common language for researchers to kind of, you know,

985
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:08,969
whether it's like this is the list we're going to develop a drug for, you know, this this group of people that have this this condition.

986
01:43:08,970 --> 01:43:14,580
So like these are it is a baby step that helps us have a common language.

987
01:43:14,580 --> 01:43:25,649
Because prior to this and there's a very famous study that was that was that kind of helped really show how necessary this was, where basically,

988
01:43:25,650 --> 01:43:28,620
if you were reading papers from the 1960s and 1970s,

989
01:43:28,620 --> 01:43:34,920
you would have learned the following Americans get schizophrenia and people in the UK get bipolar disorder.

990
01:43:35,220 --> 01:43:38,220
That's what you would have learned because that's what it was.

991
01:43:38,220 --> 01:43:42,330
There was almost no schizophrenia in the UK and there was almost no bipolar disorder in the United States.

992
01:43:42,780 --> 01:43:47,309
And a guy named Norman Sartorius did a very famous study where he brought a group of psychiatrists.

993
01:43:47,310 --> 01:43:51,810
Some of them were British, some of them were American. And he trained them on a set of criteria.

994
01:43:51,810 --> 01:43:55,260
These not that they would do some criteria, but a set of criteria that they all agreed on.

995
01:43:55,650 --> 01:44:01,440
And then they sent them blindly out into the world. And guess what? The random prevalence of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder is almost identical

996
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:05,670
in those two settings when you actually train people on the same assessment.

997
01:44:05,910 --> 01:44:10,920
All right. But prior to that, you know, you had all these people saying, like, what's going on in America that's causing all this schizophrenia,

998
01:44:10,920 --> 01:44:14,970
what's going on in the UK that's causing all this bipolar disorder, but also somehow protecting from schizophrenia.

999
01:44:15,240 --> 01:44:19,200
But you had people sort of believing this was the truth and then having entire like

1000
01:44:19,260 --> 01:44:23,700
lines of research that was founded on nothing because there was no reliable assessment.

1001
01:44:23,970 --> 01:44:29,520
Okay. So that's that's. I feel a little bit of a Debbie Downer episode,

1002
01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:34,800
but I feel bad about that because this is probably one of the best lectures, uplifting lectures I'm going to give you.

1003
01:44:35,460 --> 01:44:38,490
But the but the point is, I guess, that we learn from our mistakes.

1004
01:44:38,790 --> 01:44:42,300
And now it's not perfect, but it's better than it was. How about that?

1005
01:44:42,330 --> 01:44:46,889
I'll leave it at that. Okay. The other thing that's important that you don't really see,

1006
01:44:46,890 --> 01:44:54,030
especially in most epidemiologic surveys that assess mental disorder, is that most are that assess mental health symptoms.

1007
01:44:54,270 --> 01:44:58,089
So for example. Let me think of one.

1008
01:44:58,090 --> 01:45:05,220
That's breakfast. So for breakfast, for example, the behavioral risk factors for the survey includes a measure of the Q eight.

1009
01:45:05,260 --> 01:45:06,880
We'll talk about this next week.

1010
01:45:07,540 --> 01:45:14,350
And they they actually don't know if they include the impairment item that they may now because people have given them enough trash about it.

1011
01:45:14,770 --> 01:45:18,340
But it's not just that you had the symptoms, but they had to be impairing.

1012
01:45:18,610 --> 01:45:22,899
And that's sort of the this very important element that kind of gets lost.

1013
01:45:22,900 --> 01:45:28,900
Depression is not just feeling sad and being tired and having difficulty thinking,

1014
01:45:28,900 --> 01:45:32,200
it's having all those things impair your ability to live the kind of life you want to live.

1015
01:45:32,830 --> 01:45:36,010
And so it's this other component.

1016
01:45:36,220 --> 01:45:47,170
And this is important because people get there's a lot of kind of sensational language out there, like psychiatrists want to like diagnose everybody.

1017
01:45:47,170 --> 01:45:49,090
And when the DSM five came out,

1018
01:45:49,090 --> 01:45:56,290
one of the things they did is they removed the was what was called the bereavement exclusion to the diagnosis of depression.

1019
01:45:56,290 --> 01:46:05,499
So at the time, prior to the DSM five, there was a specific said, it said depression is all of these symptoms and they have to cause impairment.

1020
01:46:05,500 --> 01:46:10,030
They have to happen together. But if they happen after a death, then it's not depression.

1021
01:46:10,520 --> 01:46:12,220
All right. That was called the bereavement exclusion.

1022
01:46:12,880 --> 01:46:19,360
Well, that's kind of silly because lots of things cause depression, losing your job, cause of depression, getting divorced causes depression.

1023
01:46:19,420 --> 01:46:23,320
Right. So they removed it. They removed the bereavement exclusion.

1024
01:46:23,470 --> 01:46:28,540
And there were if you go back and read article like news articles from 2012, people were like,

1025
01:46:28,540 --> 01:46:32,290
Oh, psychiatrists are going to be like just diagnosing everybody with depression and like that.

1026
01:46:32,290 --> 01:46:36,430
And like, none of that happened and nobody was even talking about that. They're just like, it doesn't make any sense.

1027
01:46:36,970 --> 01:46:45,880
Like to be like depression can happen after a death. Most like a reasonable psychiatrist is not going to say, your son just died.

1028
01:46:46,120 --> 01:46:49,479
Why are you so sad? Like you should take it. Like they're not going to do that, right?

1029
01:46:49,480 --> 01:46:50,590
But like, that was the idea.

1030
01:46:50,590 --> 01:46:59,140
And like so it's an what I'm trying to say is that there is this element of judgment, but that judgment is often at this point of of impairment.

1031
01:47:00,160 --> 01:47:05,080
What's interesting and we'll talk about this a lot is that when people get care for mental disorder,

1032
01:47:05,560 --> 01:47:14,049
oftentimes what has happened is that they they've sort of decided to accept that if they've tried to say,

1033
01:47:14,050 --> 01:47:17,680
well, we'll talk we'll talk about how impairment relates to treatment, taking it a little bit.

1034
01:47:17,680 --> 01:47:22,600
Right. So I think that actually next week, two weeks for them. So because this is another important piece of it.

1035
01:47:24,700 --> 01:47:30,459
Okay, I'm going to speed through this real quick because I want us to we have a fun game that we're going to play.

1036
01:47:30,460 --> 01:47:33,760
So but you've probably or maybe you haven't, but I'll show you this now.

1037
01:47:34,090 --> 01:47:40,840
So this is 2017. JAMA, according to Joe, says that depression is the leading cause of disability around the world right now,

1038
01:47:40,870 --> 01:47:45,130
which is, you know, anytime you see sort of like the most, the best, the first, you should always doubt it.

1039
01:47:45,160 --> 01:47:51,309
Like that doesn't make any sense, you know. So how do they know so? But like, what does that even mean to say the depression is disabling?

1040
01:47:51,310 --> 01:47:57,840
What does that even what that statement even means? You know, so.

1041
01:47:59,690 --> 01:48:06,469
I'll tell you what it means in terms of what the it means. So as I told you at the very beginning, most mental disorders are not.

1042
01:48:06,470 --> 01:48:11,450
This is relaxing time for your toaster. So most mental disorders are outside most of public health.

1043
01:48:11,450 --> 01:48:18,440
We use mortality statistics. And if we only looked at mortality statistics, for example, similarly, COVID mortality, you would you know,

1044
01:48:18,680 --> 01:48:25,100
that's one measure of population burden, but it's missing all these other things that don't kill you or at least don't kill you right away.

1045
01:48:25,250 --> 01:48:26,840
Right. And so disability metrics,

1046
01:48:26,840 --> 01:48:32,360
the idea is that this is a way for us to measure conditions that don't cause mortality or at least don't cause it right away.

1047
01:48:32,600 --> 01:48:36,320
And in this case, all they mean by disability is a decline in function from some prior.

1048
01:48:36,590 --> 01:48:40,870
That's all they mean. And they don't. They're sort of peak Gnostic as to what caused it.

1049
01:48:42,230 --> 01:48:50,330
The Global Burden of disease. Study by the W.H.O. has created these disability like metrics that they publish constantly,

1050
01:48:50,330 --> 01:48:54,110
which are I don't even know who funds these things because it's just like so pointless at this point.

1051
01:48:54,530 --> 01:49:00,960
But I mean, it just it's not only that actions in a couple of years ago I was at a this this like

1052
01:49:00,980 --> 01:49:06,080
joint school of Public Health School of information luncheon and somebody there without

1053
01:49:06,470 --> 01:49:09,680
I don't think they meant it to be like funny but like they're like we are working on

1054
01:49:09,680 --> 01:49:14,239
a project where we're trying to figure out how many minutes of life you lose by,

1055
01:49:14,240 --> 01:49:18,319
like, having a piece of bacon or like how many you gain from having like a piece of broccoli.

1056
01:49:18,320 --> 01:49:23,330
And I'm like, how many minutes I lose from, like, listening to this? So it's, I'm just like that.

1057
01:49:23,330 --> 01:49:27,950
I'm like, you're doing a good thing. So they're like, and then people will then change their diet.

1058
01:49:27,950 --> 01:49:33,410
I'm like, Have you talked to anyone? Have you ever spoken to anyone about why they eat what they eat?

1059
01:49:33,600 --> 01:49:40,429
Actually, anyway, so I feel that way a little bit about these disability adjusted life years and so.

1060
01:49:40,430 --> 01:49:44,240
But what's interesting about these disability adjusted life years is they're very contentious,

1061
01:49:44,510 --> 01:49:50,150
but the idea is that we're going to compare apples to apples. And so they do this in part by having what they call a disability weight.

1062
01:49:50,390 --> 01:49:53,320
They generate this disability weight by getting a group of people together.

1063
01:49:53,330 --> 01:50:00,620
Maybe it's like a group of people and you say, Hey, I want you to rank order the most disabling things on this list for most disabling.

1064
01:50:00,620 --> 01:50:01,880
The least disabling. Okay.

1065
01:50:01,910 --> 01:50:06,410
And then we're going to like I'll just add them up and then that's going to be your number and then going to do that across a bunch of countries.

1066
01:50:06,740 --> 01:50:11,870
So literally, like this is an example of a study that goes that fed into the world over for gum disease study.

1067
01:50:11,870 --> 01:50:16,880
So you get to rank all of these things in terms of most disabling, the least disabling.

1068
01:50:17,830 --> 01:50:25,840
Okay. And that's how they're done. And like the people who do this ranking, some of them are practitioners, some of them are like policymakers.

1069
01:50:26,410 --> 01:50:31,120
Interestingly, very few of these studies have people who actually have the condition in question in the room.

1070
01:50:32,350 --> 01:50:40,120
So you can see here and this what I'm showing you is for alcoholism. So which is one of their outputs listed is alcohol dependance here.

1071
01:50:40,120 --> 01:50:45,120
That's my words. They called it alcoholism in the study. And so you can see that in some countries.

1072
01:50:45,130 --> 01:50:48,820
So, again, the 17 is the is the least disabling.

1073
01:50:48,820 --> 01:50:54,610
So in places like the Netherlands, they think alcohol dependance is the fifth most disabling thing on this list.

1074
01:50:55,240 --> 01:51:02,320
You can compare that to Nigeria and Romania, where it's not seen as the most disabling thing or it's or it's seen as is less disabling.

1075
01:51:02,590 --> 01:51:11,169
And what's interesting is that the they did find that higher reports of stigma were positively

1076
01:51:11,170 --> 01:51:17,740
associated with with the ranking so far as a condition was seen as more stigmatized or you know,

1077
01:51:18,010 --> 01:51:20,830
stigmatizing to have it were seen as more disabling.

1078
01:51:21,370 --> 01:51:27,279
Now, from a disability rights perspective, what that means is that society needs to change, not the not the health condition.

1079
01:51:27,280 --> 01:51:31,419
Right. Because what this means is like society is part of what makes alcohol dependance

1080
01:51:31,420 --> 01:51:35,290
disabling is the way that society responds to somebody who has alcohol dependance.

1081
01:51:36,970 --> 01:51:43,810
So this leads us to the last thing I want to tell you about, which is about social stigma and public policy, about mental health.

1082
01:51:44,470 --> 01:51:52,900
So the first is and one of the readings you're going to are when you you're going to listen to a talk by link for this week.

1083
01:51:52,900 --> 01:51:58,209
And he's going to talk much more lucidly about these two relationships.

1084
01:51:58,210 --> 01:52:02,530
But I guess I want to show you two different definitions, one of prejudice and one stigma.

1085
01:52:03,100 --> 01:52:07,780
To illustrate sort of the the idea that, like, there is a lot of overlap.

1086
01:52:07,780 --> 01:52:16,089
It's not that they're identical, but there is quite a bit of overlap in terms of the what what Bruce calls the function of stigma,

1087
01:52:16,090 --> 01:52:22,180
like what is the purpose of stigma in the same way you think about like what is the purpose of discrimination?

1088
01:52:22,250 --> 01:52:29,260
Right. So the argument here is to again, the function, it's not that people have this consciously in their minds,

1089
01:52:29,260 --> 01:52:31,870
like I'm trying to do X thing, although they might.

1090
01:52:32,860 --> 01:52:40,209
But the idea of I am trying to either separate myself from this person, I am trying to deny them and try to keep them down.

1091
01:52:40,210 --> 01:52:41,560
Or I'm trying to I'm trying to keep them away.

1092
01:52:41,560 --> 01:52:47,020
I'm trying to keep them down or try to keep them in, which is kind of a little bit more of like stigma versus discrimination that I'm like.

1093
01:52:47,020 --> 01:52:52,900
Their behavior is unusual and I don't want that unusual behavior. So stigma is a way to prevent people from engaging in that.

1094
01:52:54,190 --> 01:52:56,700
Just like discrimination. There's a process.

1095
01:52:56,700 --> 01:53:03,120
So we have sort of these things that tell us that I should discriminate against somebody, just like the signals or the stimulus.

1096
01:53:03,130 --> 01:53:08,690
This might be the label that I give something, right? Schizophrenia or something like insanity, right?

1097
01:53:08,710 --> 01:53:11,630
Whatever. Those labels are the symptoms that the person's actually experiencing.

1098
01:53:11,650 --> 01:53:17,410
So they might be hearing voices, they might be having difficulty expressing themselves,

1099
01:53:18,040 --> 01:53:21,589
the skill, deficits or something they maybe can't do, and then their appearance.

1100
01:53:21,590 --> 01:53:27,610
So especially if somebody is, you know, having a severe depression or a psychotic episode, they may not be hygienic.

1101
01:53:27,610 --> 01:53:32,730
They might not be taking regular baths, for example. Now, that signal is not the problem.

1102
01:53:32,740 --> 01:53:39,049
The problem is that that signal now gets interpreted and that interpretation is coming through either authoritarianism.

1103
01:53:39,050 --> 01:53:45,190
So I need to control this person benevolence. I need to help this person social restriction.

1104
01:53:45,190 --> 01:53:50,350
I need to stay away from this person. Or the big one that comes in with mental health is this person is a threat to me.

1105
01:53:50,950 --> 01:53:59,920
Okay. And then the way that that gets where that is, I get to express those stereotypes is either by denying people employment,

1106
01:54:00,550 --> 01:54:03,100
housing, denying people affiliation, as will hang out with you.

1107
01:54:03,100 --> 01:54:08,560
I will have you on my family or denying people or just more broadly speaking, how I treat someone.

1108
01:54:10,030 --> 01:54:17,110
So mental disorders in general are associated in the public mind with pretty much every negative attribute you can have.

1109
01:54:17,530 --> 01:54:24,040
So whether this is being dangerous, being dirty, being cold, being aloof, being worthless, being ignorant, being weak,

1110
01:54:25,780 --> 01:54:33,969
the ways that those stereotypes get expressed are everything from and they've done studies of, you know, I mean,

1111
01:54:33,970 --> 01:54:38,320
just in my own town there was developing they're trying to and they did build a sober living

1112
01:54:39,040 --> 01:54:44,199
housing in my in Dexter where I live and there's just huge obviously you're going to have people

1113
01:54:44,200 --> 01:54:47,919
who use drugs near our children to do that and like the only people I know who aren't using drugs

1114
01:54:47,920 --> 01:54:50,860
and Dexter are the people living in sober living because they have to get tested every week.

1115
01:54:51,220 --> 01:54:56,940
So I actually I don't know how, but, you know, the point is, is like there's, you know, massive discrimination.

1116
01:54:56,960 --> 01:55:01,270
There's there's television programs that portray people with mental illness as being inadequate, unlikable.

1117
01:55:01,300 --> 01:55:12,010
Dangerous is what's also important and kind of is that family members also struggle from stigma, particularly in terms of having some family.

1118
01:55:12,020 --> 01:55:17,080
I mean, you can find stakeholders will talk about how if they're know.

1119
01:55:17,340 --> 01:55:21,270
Anytime. Something like schizophrenia, for example, is diagnosed and people are 14, 15, 16 years old.

1120
01:55:21,270 --> 01:55:26,680
It can be it could be that early. So the family members are like, what did you do and what did you do to your kid?

1121
01:55:26,710 --> 01:55:29,310
What people will do is like I've talked to family members who are like that.

1122
01:55:29,310 --> 01:55:34,260
People say that to them, you know, as though somehow they had something they caused it to happen.

1123
01:55:34,260 --> 01:55:40,140
And when we talk about autism and like why the diagnosis of autism has become much more prevalent than what it was.

1124
01:55:40,470 --> 01:55:45,120
Part of that is because for a long time, the belief was that mothers cause their kids to have autism.

1125
01:55:46,080 --> 01:55:50,760
So this was not something that people were not diagnosed as people weren't willing to go get.

1126
01:55:52,350 --> 01:55:58,470
So as a way to kind of just illustrate that, I think this poem is is a really helpful and I'll I'll read it out to you.

1127
01:55:58,920 --> 01:56:03,660
It's called a volunteer. So my father has had electricity shut through him and nobody must know.

1128
01:56:03,990 --> 01:56:07,080
Will he be blackened like lightning? Trees lying sideways in the wetlands.

1129
01:56:07,080 --> 01:56:11,010
My huge horse, chestnut father, who had made a special saddle on his bike when I was little.

1130
01:56:12,060 --> 01:56:15,719
It was voluntary, my mother whispered of summers, mumbled all night, and never had it up.

1131
01:56:15,720 --> 01:56:21,240
Up days, hunched over the table, his hands ringed in two black tunnels for his eyes to look through and not see.

1132
01:56:21,690 --> 01:56:31,500
I was at my wit's end, so this patient voluntary man, crept home with two rough circles at his temples where they jumpstarted him its shingles.

1133
01:56:31,530 --> 01:56:37,349
My mother explained that she hurried past the neighbors. My job was to take him by the hand and unobtrusively to lead him around town,

1134
01:56:37,350 --> 01:56:40,200
reteach him all the names of all the streets he'd always known and how to use his

1135
01:56:40,200 --> 01:56:44,550
telephone so his secretary wouldn't guess he was not allowed out by himself.

1136
01:56:45,510 --> 01:56:48,510
My father's had electricity shot through him and nobody must know.

1137
01:56:50,340 --> 01:56:57,340
So what has happened in this moment? And how is stigma sort of represented that?

1138
01:57:03,740 --> 01:57:08,880
Whenever you have a mental disorder or some kind of an electro electroconvulsive therapy.

1139
01:57:08,910 --> 01:57:13,129
Yeah. And then they don't want anyone to know, but they have like a spouse and everything.

1140
01:57:13,130 --> 01:57:18,730
So they call the shingles and ruin everything because it affects memory.

1141
01:57:18,740 --> 01:57:25,040
Yes. Yes. So he is so he's he's so he's had a specific treatment.

1142
01:57:25,190 --> 01:57:32,450
Right. So he said electroconvulsive therapy, which is still used to this day at the Pine Crest Psychiatric Care over in Grand Rapids,

1143
01:57:32,450 --> 01:57:38,659
which is now partnered with MSU, is one of the largest clinics that provides electroconvulsive therapy.

1144
01:57:38,660 --> 01:57:41,479
I've actually been in the space where they do it. It's really incredible actually,

1145
01:57:41,480 --> 01:57:51,380
and it's very for people who have not been responding or not have not responded to first line treatment for depression, it can be lifesaving.

1146
01:57:52,970 --> 01:57:59,180
So they but this is now this is not acceptable to explain either that this person is.

1147
01:57:59,300 --> 01:58:04,520
So is it is it a condition that's being stigmatized or the treatment in this country?

1148
01:58:06,320 --> 01:58:12,970
It seems like I mean, it's probably both. But she she talks about the she talks a little bit about the blossoms.

1149
01:58:12,980 --> 01:58:14,719
Right. Not so. He's not kind of making sense.

1150
01:58:14,720 --> 01:58:20,840
He's having this that's the cognitive symptoms of a severe depression, but it's the signs of the treatment that can't be known.

1151
01:58:20,930 --> 01:58:22,940
Right. Them, the memory loss that can't be known.

1152
01:58:23,780 --> 01:58:29,780
And then the explanation, the alternative explanation that he's got some other condition and why is shingles more acceptable?

1153
01:58:32,970 --> 01:58:36,000
It's not it's not a moral failing and a crappy cycle.

1154
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:39,480
So either people see it as something that you brought on. Yeah.

1155
01:58:39,660 --> 01:58:43,710
More often than not, if it's a physical illness, something that you just had the misfortune of doing.

1156
01:58:43,890 --> 01:58:47,219
And what's interesting about the shingles analogy is and this is actually an infectious disease.

1157
01:58:47,220 --> 01:58:49,290
This is like chickenpox when it comes back. Right.

1158
01:58:49,290 --> 01:58:53,639
So you part of what stigma does is like the idea that you're going to make me sick, right, if I'm near you.

1159
01:58:53,640 --> 01:58:58,950
And so here is the explanation. Not that you can get. I don't think I don't think you can get shingles from somebody else who has it.

1160
01:58:58,950 --> 01:59:01,230
But this is literally an infectious disease.

1161
01:59:02,160 --> 01:59:10,080
And so that the argument that of using some other anything else you know that would certainly be better than having been having schizophrenia.

1162
01:59:11,610 --> 01:59:11,849
You know,

1163
01:59:11,850 --> 01:59:16,950
they've done studies of sort of asking people what condition would they least like to have and people would rather have cancer than schizophrenia.

1164
01:59:17,130 --> 01:59:21,959
You know, it's kind of amazing to think about something anyway.

1165
01:59:21,960 --> 01:59:27,240
So and that this is this is in a poem from the nineties, but stigma is alive and well.

1166
01:59:27,840 --> 01:59:31,889
This is from a few years ago. I'm not going to play the poem or the play the video for you.

1167
01:59:31,890 --> 01:59:34,410
It's very difficult to watch, but it is hyperlinked in the slides.

1168
01:59:34,770 --> 01:59:39,030
This is a woman who was released on the street in Baltimore who was clearly in a psychotic episode.

1169
01:59:39,030 --> 01:59:43,290
She did not know where she was. It was cold at night. She's clearly in a hospital gown.

1170
01:59:43,710 --> 01:59:49,410
And, you know, the idea that she was just a discharge because they didn't have any place for her.

1171
01:59:49,410 --> 01:59:55,110
Right. And like, I can't I can't imagine a hospital discharging somebody who had out of control diabetes or out of control,

1172
01:59:55,110 --> 01:59:58,590
you know, had cancer or something like that on to the street in that state. That state.

1173
01:59:59,580 --> 02:00:05,819
So what makes mental disorders a target of stigma? Well, part of it is because of the ideas that we have about them.

1174
02:00:05,820 --> 02:00:10,049
Everybody in this room, myself included, has ideas about stigma, so has ideas about mental disorders.

1175
02:00:10,050 --> 02:00:17,700
Some of those are not you know, you may not be proud of those feelings executive but I think what I say is like it's important for

1176
02:00:17,700 --> 02:00:22,140
us to name them and just kind of talk about them because that's the only way we're going to fix it.

1177
02:00:22,440 --> 02:00:25,440
So this is your workload. That you made.

1178
02:00:26,440 --> 02:00:31,900
So I'll just sort of leave you here for a second to reflect on it.

1179
02:00:36,500 --> 02:00:43,550
Where do you see stigma? I actually see the word stigma, but you see other elements that we've kind of talked a little bit about.

1180
02:00:47,650 --> 02:00:51,280
What word stand out to you? I was.

1181
02:01:04,280 --> 02:01:08,480
We like discomfort relating to fear.

1182
02:01:08,930 --> 02:01:16,140
Mm hmm. Plus what stands out to.

1183
02:01:20,280 --> 02:01:24,290
Yeah, maybe like awareness and awareness and tackles stigma.

1184
02:01:26,290 --> 02:01:29,870
So, I mean, it doesn't, it doesn't it's interesting.

1185
02:01:31,430 --> 02:01:35,660
It's for its purpose. I guess we all know for sure.

1186
02:01:35,690 --> 02:01:36,910
Yeah, I would agree with that completely.

1187
02:01:36,920 --> 02:01:43,159
And the purpose is let's talk about it for the we'll talk a little bit about in in a minute what actually seems to address stigma,

1188
02:01:43,160 --> 02:01:46,250
but it's it is addressable, I guess you could say that.

1189
02:01:46,250 --> 02:01:50,809
But, you know, people have I used to work with the Depression Center here.

1190
02:01:50,810 --> 02:01:55,340
And if you talk to people about the Depression scenarios where we're going to we're going to call it the Depression Center,

1191
02:01:55,340 --> 02:01:58,610
it's going to destigmatize. And it's like there's there's no evidence that works.

1192
02:01:59,180 --> 02:02:01,159
Like it makes people aware of it, but like,

1193
02:02:01,160 --> 02:02:06,680
it doesn't make you want to be more friends with somebody who has depression or feel more empathetic to somebody who has depression just because,

1194
02:02:06,680 --> 02:02:12,980
you know, they have depression. What else stands out to you or are you surprised to see what it is you expect to see?

1195
02:02:19,430 --> 02:02:24,200
Yeah. Interesting that a lot of us highlighted the medication.

1196
02:02:24,400 --> 02:02:26,750
Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm.

1197
02:02:27,050 --> 02:02:37,170
Especially given that idea that the that our our Western media, like, we have to use some sort of chemical thing to make whatever is distressing you.

1198
02:02:37,280 --> 02:02:44,530
Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Yeah. There was just a paper that came out recently that was like the, you know,

1199
02:02:44,750 --> 02:02:50,410
the kind of chemical imbalance theory of depression not being not being fully.

1200
02:02:51,160 --> 02:02:58,809
Well, of course, like that's the problem is like. Then again, there's, there's like the current, the crib sheet version of all of these things,

1201
02:02:58,810 --> 02:03:06,250
which is like depression is a chemical imbalance in the brain. There's actually talk to somebody who doesn't work for like an artist, you know.

1202
02:03:06,250 --> 02:03:10,510
So like there's that is we don't fully understand. We don't know how our medications work.

1203
02:03:10,510 --> 02:03:15,280
In fact, all of you, if you've ever taken a nice depressant turn into anxiety drugs, it'll say right on the box, like, we don't know how it works.

1204
02:03:15,490 --> 02:03:18,729
So, yeah, so they're not, they're not hiding it, but.

1205
02:03:18,730 --> 02:03:25,850
Yeah. The things that stand out.

1206
02:03:26,990 --> 02:03:30,620
I think the. Sorry. I think the fact that common is hidden.

1207
02:03:31,190 --> 02:03:34,550
Mhm. Mhm. Mhm. Mhm. Yeah. Because they're kind of.

1208
02:03:35,600 --> 02:03:40,560
Yeah. Yeah. Very related to that one.

1209
02:03:41,090 --> 02:03:45,530
You're, you know you don't like sweetie. I don't know anything. Go ahead Rachel.

1210
02:03:45,890 --> 02:03:53,750
Okay. I think it's interesting. Like which, like mental disorders we picked out, depression is really common as well as anxiety,

1211
02:03:53,930 --> 02:04:01,430
but then like and those are more like socially acceptable and that's like bipolar being pretty interesting.

1212
02:04:01,430 --> 02:04:09,100
Mhm. Yeah. They definitely have a good nomenclature for the kind of conditions that we're going to talk about.

1213
02:04:09,450 --> 02:04:15,969
You know, I think if you ask if I gave this, I've done this, I do this work because it exercises a lot of different types of audiences.

1214
02:04:15,970 --> 02:04:20,170
And when I give it to high schoolers, I go to a very different notch, very different.

1215
02:04:20,350 --> 02:04:25,239
Some things are different, but they don't have nearly the vocabulary that you all already have.

1216
02:04:25,240 --> 02:04:30,300
Which is which is good. All right.

1217
02:04:30,350 --> 02:04:38,190
So but the point is, is that I think that we can probably agree that there are more negative words on this word cloud than positive words.

1218
02:04:38,210 --> 02:04:51,500
In fact, I'm struggling to find one that I think is sort of fully positive that you see one that they would consider unambiguously positive.

1219
02:04:52,770 --> 02:04:58,450
Really? Starbucks every single day.

1220
02:04:58,730 --> 02:05:02,750
Is this coming on like a self-help book? Because there is no mental health system.

1221
02:05:02,750 --> 02:05:07,579
So your treatment is that library. But that's okay, right?

1222
02:05:07,580 --> 02:05:10,700
Because the point is, I just want us to get it out in the open and we're going to like everybody.

1223
02:05:10,700 --> 02:05:14,090
I knew this work was going to look something like this before you generated it.

1224
02:05:14,540 --> 02:05:23,030
And it's I just want us to sort of just, again, name it out in the open, but sort of it's important to to just have that here.

1225
02:05:23,810 --> 02:05:28,940
Okay. So I'm going to skip the next couple of slides because you are going to listen to First Links Lecture

1226
02:05:28,940 --> 02:05:33,950
and he's going to tell you about all of these functions of stigma and what relates to stigma.

1227
02:05:35,210 --> 02:05:44,270
I will sort of give you the ten second version, two minute version of why again.

1228
02:05:44,780 --> 02:05:47,830
Again, we don't need to convince you that this matters, but it does really matter.

1229
02:05:47,840 --> 02:05:51,700
So there's a famous Supreme Court case. This is by Kobe Bell.

1230
02:05:51,710 --> 02:05:58,220
How many of you are familiar with this case? So it's a it's this is a case of a forced sterilization of a woman.

1231
02:05:58,640 --> 02:06:04,790
Carrie Buck, who was at the Virginia colony, is called at the time Virginia Colony for Evil, eviction, feeble minded.

1232
02:06:05,510 --> 02:06:10,790
She appealed this forced sterilization of the 14th Amendment, which is the equal protection clause.

1233
02:06:11,510 --> 02:06:13,670
This is language literally from the decision.

1234
02:06:14,600 --> 02:06:23,810
So the argument is the act of Virginia cited the health of the patient and the welfare of society may be promoted in certain cases by sterilization.

1235
02:06:25,160 --> 02:06:29,600
It is in the best interest of patients and our society that it may, under his care should be essentially so.

1236
02:06:29,660 --> 02:06:34,610
Sterilization is the operation performed on any patient with hereditary forms of insanity?

1237
02:06:35,750 --> 02:06:40,010
So what I want to call out to you is that there's, first of all,

1238
02:06:40,040 --> 02:06:46,939
the argument that genes as a cause is sort of justification for why this should be happening.

1239
02:06:46,940 --> 02:06:53,080
And the second is that the who is going to benefit from this happening outside of the public self.

1240
02:06:53,370 --> 02:06:55,870
Right. This is a this was seen as a win for public health.

1241
02:06:59,220 --> 02:07:04,640
They go on to say, like we've seen more than once that public welfare may call upon the best citizens for their lives.

1242
02:07:04,640 --> 02:07:07,760
So this is coming off the heels of World War One. Okay.

1243
02:07:07,760 --> 02:07:11,809
So I can send people to war. And so if it would be strange,

1244
02:07:11,810 --> 02:07:17,690
if I could not call upon we could not call upon those who already support the strength of the state for these lesser sacrifices.

1245
02:07:18,350 --> 02:07:22,110
And they end with this very famous quote of three generations of imbeciles are enough.

1246
02:07:22,130 --> 02:07:30,050
So, you know, the the argument here that this woman should be denied the ability to define her own fertility is,

1247
02:07:30,450 --> 02:07:37,909
you know, by virtue of her having this, again, being committed at this colony.

1248
02:07:37,910 --> 02:07:46,340
And then again, the language that they use is, is, as you can see, it just highly stigmatizing and reflects these stigma attitudes.

1249
02:07:46,370 --> 02:07:50,870
Again, just to kind of close out how that this is from unequal treatment, the institute,

1250
02:07:51,040 --> 02:07:58,000
a very important Institute of Medicine report, came out in 2012 to this emphasis on interpretation.

1251
02:07:58,070 --> 02:08:03,530
There's an example of what we mean by that. So this is both pictures taken after Hurricane Katrina.

1252
02:08:03,920 --> 02:08:07,890
This is a woman who appears to be African-American looting a grocery store.

1253
02:08:07,910 --> 02:08:12,690
These are two people who appear to be white, finding bread, apparently not in a grocery store,

1254
02:08:12,720 --> 02:08:17,450
just somehow freely available with a sign that said, please take if you're hungry.

1255
02:08:18,230 --> 02:08:24,139
Right. So this is obviously like the people engage in the exact same behavior, but it's being interpreted completely differently.

1256
02:08:24,140 --> 02:08:29,330
And so this is, again, this idea that I can see someone engaging in the exact same behavior.

1257
02:08:29,330 --> 02:08:34,540
And if I understand that to be a function of a mental disorder or in this case a function of race,

1258
02:08:34,550 --> 02:08:41,210
as I'm going to interpret that differently, I'm going to skip how we measure social stigma.

1259
02:08:42,350 --> 02:08:48,890
I'm sorry, I can't skip it other than say what I will tell you is that you all learn the word social distance in 2020.

1260
02:08:49,250 --> 02:08:53,270
I've known the world social distance for a long time. Why? Because it's how we measure stigma.

1261
02:08:53,810 --> 02:08:58,790
So social distance refers to like how much distance you literally want from somebody else, right?

1262
02:08:58,790 --> 02:09:05,269
And so we measure it by asking people not like, Hey, how much do you dislike people who have depression or dislike people have schizophrenia?

1263
02:09:05,270 --> 02:09:08,540
We don't say that. And so we say, well, how willing would you be to have a person?

1264
02:09:08,780 --> 02:09:14,479
And we we show a vignette and we read this vignette to the person, say, like, this is what this person is going through.

1265
02:09:14,480 --> 02:09:15,620
This is what symptoms they have.

1266
02:09:15,620 --> 02:09:21,740
How willing would you be to have that person be your neighbor, spend some time with, work closely with or marry into your family?

1267
02:09:22,010 --> 02:09:27,320
This is an example of the type of things that we use. So this is this is 27 year old man Jim Johnson.

1268
02:09:27,680 --> 02:09:31,590
He. Hospitalized for work after being diagnosed with schizophrenia.

1269
02:09:31,890 --> 02:09:34,980
He received treatment. He now appears to have recovered. He's doing fairly well.

1270
02:09:34,980 --> 02:09:39,780
He's clean and well groomed. He has a part time janitorial job. He gets along well with his coworkers.

1271
02:09:40,590 --> 02:09:46,230
He checks his work carefully, which this might slow him down a little bit, but he's never criticized for the quality of his work.

1272
02:09:46,530 --> 02:09:50,469
He's interested in meeting women. He's considered joining a local church group.

1273
02:09:50,470 --> 02:09:53,130
He also has an ambition to get a more responsible, better paying job.

1274
02:09:53,430 --> 02:09:59,640
So how willing would you be to have Jim be your neighbor, have an evening with, work closely with Mary and your family?

1275
02:09:59,880 --> 02:10:05,210
All right. So this is the way. And then what we do is like we randomize different elements of this vignette.

1276
02:10:05,220 --> 02:10:11,430
So sometimes the word schizophrenia is taken out. And instead it says after having experiences of hallucinations and delusions.

1277
02:10:11,430 --> 02:10:16,350
Right? So now it's like, is it the word schizophrenia that you're responding to or is it the symptoms itself?

1278
02:10:16,500 --> 02:10:24,460
Sometimes his bail will vary. Whether his gender, though, vary his or vary their gender, they'll vary their age, etc.

1279
02:10:24,490 --> 02:10:28,150
Right, to kind of say when they do, they'll be such different experiments. Most of these are fields in that.

1280
02:10:28,200 --> 02:10:32,909
What's this? Another data you may be interested in called a general social survey.

1281
02:10:32,910 --> 02:10:36,900
So this survey's got a lot of social factors. Almost nothing to do with health, unfortunately, though.

1282
02:10:36,960 --> 02:10:41,720
So. Okay, the.

1283
02:10:44,520 --> 02:10:51,690
Right. Subscription. Okay. So social distance over time has really not changed.

1284
02:10:51,690 --> 02:10:55,950
So this is again that same social distance skill, higher values equal more social distance.

1285
02:10:56,460 --> 02:10:59,850
What's I love the scale. I love this graph because this is just minor problem.

1286
02:10:59,860 --> 02:11:02,549
So this is a vignette for the person does not have any sort of mental disorder.

1287
02:11:02,550 --> 02:11:06,180
And this is basically a measure of how much you don't like people in general.

1288
02:11:06,600 --> 02:11:15,240
So like if this sort of unit relative to the zero unit relative to this and what you can see is that schizophrenia and alcoholism,

1289
02:11:15,420 --> 02:11:18,270
people want more social distance than they do from depression.

1290
02:11:18,540 --> 02:11:26,970
But you can also see that from 1996 to 2006, there was almost no change in what how much distance people wanted from people who had those vignettes.

1291
02:11:28,860 --> 02:11:34,920
You can also see how stigma operates by when you ask people why they didn't get health care, why didn't they get care for that problem?

1292
02:11:35,430 --> 02:11:39,810
So this is asking you wanted care, but you didn't get it.

1293
02:11:40,140 --> 02:11:46,170
So the 22% of people say they were concerned about being committed or having state medicine.

1294
02:11:46,170 --> 02:11:50,860
So they're concerned about being controlled that it might have a negative effect on their job

1295
02:11:50,860 --> 02:11:54,360
that might cause their neighbors have a negative opinion concerned about confidentiality,

1296
02:11:54,360 --> 02:12:00,719
didn't want others to find out. So again, there's a direct implication for stigma because people tell us these are things again,

1297
02:12:00,720 --> 02:12:04,980
they don't say the word stigma, but these are these are these are consequences of stigma.

1298
02:12:07,240 --> 02:12:11,950
Here. Skip this one. I'll come back to that.

1299
02:12:11,980 --> 02:12:15,160
Okay. So coming to I'll come back to that later in the class. But.

1300
02:12:15,880 --> 02:12:18,980
So the last thing I want to end with is like, again, a sign of hope.

1301
02:12:19,010 --> 02:12:23,530
So what? What reduces feelings of racial discrimination?

1302
02:12:23,680 --> 02:12:27,360
And I got it. I got a surprise for you.

1303
02:12:27,370 --> 02:12:30,820
It's not the micro-aggression training that you might have gone through. What?

1304
02:12:30,850 --> 02:12:35,259
What? But we do actually know what reduces feelings of racial discrimination.

1305
02:12:35,260 --> 02:12:38,910
And the answer is directly working with people from different backgrounds.

1306
02:12:38,920 --> 02:12:44,829
Like that's what does it. In fact, some of the first studies on this, you may recognize this name, James Jackson,

1307
02:12:44,830 --> 02:12:51,040
who I already told you about because he ran the National Survey of American Life. You know, this guy is Robert Sellers.

1308
02:12:51,520 --> 02:12:54,610
He was our first director of the FBI here at the University of Michigan.

1309
02:12:54,610 --> 02:13:00,879
So he trained here with James Jackson. So they did this this study of teammates.

1310
02:13:00,880 --> 02:13:05,710
Right. So what are some of the two first things that were racially integrated were sports and the military.

1311
02:13:06,970 --> 02:13:14,310
And so these were the two places where you could actually look at what does it mean to have racial integration and how do people's attitudes change?

1312
02:13:14,320 --> 02:13:20,830
And both of the numerous, numerous studies have shown that actually just spending time with people who look different from you,

1313
02:13:20,830 --> 02:13:26,140
who have a different background, that is what builds empathy and trust and that's what reduces feelings of discrimination.

1314
02:13:27,790 --> 02:13:31,239
Well, what reduces stigma towards people with dealing with mental illness?

1315
02:13:31,240 --> 02:13:35,020
And the answer is directly learning from people who have feelings of mental illness.

1316
02:13:35,020 --> 02:13:40,719
So it's not awareness. It's not sort of learning about it, it's not knowledge, it's actually interacting with people.

1317
02:13:40,720 --> 02:13:45,970
So this is from a paper I wrote with Bruce Link that was on the development

1318
02:13:45,970 --> 02:13:50,470
of the undergraduate undergraduate class of this research at the university.

1319
02:13:50,860 --> 02:13:54,460
And in that class, we don't do it as much in this class. We're much more focused on kind of the data.

1320
02:13:54,820 --> 02:14:00,790
But we spend a lot of time bringing in people who either have lived experience with a mental disorder, that family members have a lived experience.

1321
02:14:00,790 --> 02:14:04,780
Like I said, we're going to go on the field trip ourselves that summer. And I started with the undergrads.

1322
02:14:05,290 --> 02:14:07,329
But the idea of like, let's actually just see what it's like.

1323
02:14:07,330 --> 02:14:10,600
Let's just go meet somebody you probably already know, somebody who has a mental disorder.

1324
02:14:10,600 --> 02:14:15,280
You may you meet your self, may have a mental disorder or be dealing with something or have in the past or you have a family member.

1325
02:14:15,730 --> 02:14:21,100
But the point is, is like that's what directly kind of talking about it and are not talking about

1326
02:14:21,130 --> 02:14:25,870
directly interacting with people saying oh you also like dislike you too,

1327
02:14:25,870 --> 02:14:27,820
that's great. We have something in common.

1328
02:14:28,030 --> 02:14:36,700
So, okay, so to close out here, stigma, particularly towards people with serious mental illness and substance use disorders, remains prevalent.

1329
02:14:37,600 --> 02:14:42,249
I didn't show you this, but clinicians, you might think like, oh, maybe psychiatrist have listening attitudes.

1330
02:14:42,250 --> 02:14:42,580
They don't.

1331
02:14:43,570 --> 02:14:50,950
That exposure to persons with psychiatric conditions is the only thing that we know that is effective at reducing social desire for social distance.

1332
02:14:51,850 --> 02:14:58,120
And if anything, the increasing knowledge and awareness really has mixed or little effect on stigma towards towards mental illness.

1333
02:14:59,440 --> 02:14:59,740
Okay.

1334
02:15:00,040 --> 02:15:07,030
So questions here before we do our last activity because I know you're so tired of it isn't warm room and you're just tired of questions about this.

1335
02:15:08,980 --> 02:15:15,310
Yes, go ahead. Is there a difference for like exposure to with people who have psychiatric conditions?

1336
02:15:15,610 --> 02:15:23,290
Does it change at all if you know that somebody has a condition before you hang out with them or like hang out with them?

1337
02:15:23,320 --> 02:15:27,530
That's a good question. Hmm.

1338
02:15:28,400 --> 02:15:36,229
I don't know if people have looked at that. There's there was a study that compared attitudes towards another condition that was

1339
02:15:36,230 --> 02:15:40,520
that was highly stigmatized and still is stigmatized in some populations is cancer.

1340
02:15:40,970 --> 02:15:47,629
And so there have been studies showing that if you are told that somebody you meet with somebody and they were told later that they had cancer,

1341
02:15:47,630 --> 02:15:53,070
you actually rate that interaction much more favorably if you like them more afterwards.

1342
02:15:53,090 --> 02:15:56,270
Right. And so I don't know if they've done something similar like that where they're sort of like

1343
02:15:56,690 --> 02:16:00,800
a staged interaction and then afterwards you're told something about the person you know.

1344
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:05,000
But it's also interesting because it shows that it's modifiable, right?

1345
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:08,230
So people there was a time when people would never say that somebody died of cancer, you know?

1346
02:16:08,270 --> 02:16:12,820
And nowadays that's that's simply not that's not the case. Or even had cancer dynamism.

1347
02:16:13,910 --> 02:16:14,510
Other questions.

1348
02:16:20,180 --> 02:16:32,260
Well, we are it is time for mental health charity, which I've been talking this whole time, and now it's time for you all to play along with me.

1349
02:16:32,270 --> 02:16:37,940
So presumably you have some idea of how this works. You must answer in the form of a question that's most important.

1350
02:16:38,540 --> 02:16:42,590
And your categories are. USA, USA, USA.

1351
02:16:42,680 --> 02:16:48,020
These are questions about the U.S. population, because we're going to show a lot of statistics about the U.S. population.

1352
02:16:48,020 --> 02:16:51,469
So you need to know when we're talking about diagnosis.

1353
02:16:51,470 --> 02:16:55,070
That was an important movie with Robert De Niro, I think. Trick or treat.

1354
02:16:55,070 --> 02:16:58,620
I can't remember what's in that shorthand. Hmm.

1355
02:16:58,850 --> 02:17:05,450
I don't remember that one either. And then jargon. So wait a minute.

1356
02:17:10,380 --> 02:17:20,610
Right over here. Don't tell me, Nick, I've chosen you to select our first time to trick or treat or 100.

1357
02:17:20,640 --> 02:17:26,730
Yes, you may. This rule states that it is unethical for a psychiatrist to speculate about the mental

1358
02:17:26,730 --> 02:17:30,930
health of public figures or diagnosing someone they have not personally evaluated.

1359
02:17:32,010 --> 02:17:36,370
So more relevant in the past. Any any answers here? Yeah.

1360
02:17:37,320 --> 02:17:40,900
What is this rule on? What is happening?

1361
02:17:41,290 --> 02:17:45,320
What is happening? No, but that's a great guess.

1362
02:17:45,340 --> 02:17:53,260
Other other suggestions as to what this rule is. This is the Goldwater rule.

1363
02:17:53,270 --> 02:17:58,129
So Barry Goldwater was running for president against Nixon,

1364
02:17:58,130 --> 02:18:03,410
but is probably Ronald Reagan and it was disclosed that he had been treated for

1365
02:18:03,410 --> 02:18:07,850
depression and here had been inpatient care and it destroyed his campaign.

1366
02:18:08,540 --> 02:18:11,660
So this is why we don't do this, why we don't do this.

1367
02:18:11,810 --> 02:18:16,200
So, all right. Next. All right.

1368
02:18:17,880 --> 02:18:22,410
One of you is named Jordan, but I don't know which one.

1369
02:18:22,950 --> 02:18:26,350
Wait, Cynthia Jordan. Okay. There we go. I'm trying to map out the class.

1370
02:18:26,370 --> 02:18:30,090
You can't change places. You need to sit here the whole time. Jordan, go ahead.

1371
02:18:30,450 --> 02:18:34,410
I'll do it. USA, USA, USA. It's not pronounced that way.

1372
02:18:34,710 --> 02:18:38,160
USA! USA! USA! The number of people in United States today.

1373
02:18:39,960 --> 02:18:44,580
Come on. Yes, Rachel. So I'll take 433 million.

1374
02:18:47,570 --> 02:18:51,830
What is. Thank you. What is three?

1375
02:18:52,190 --> 02:18:56,120
Yes. All right. Very good.

1376
02:18:56,120 --> 02:18:59,750
Very good. All right, Nick, you're on the board.

1377
02:19:00,860 --> 02:19:04,160
What are you doing? Oh, sorry. You're destroying everybody.

1378
02:19:04,190 --> 02:19:10,630
Come on, keep us. Other trick or treat.

1379
02:19:11,170 --> 02:19:17,620
All right. There we go. This is the percent of people with a major depression. They get treated for their condition each year in the United States.

1380
02:19:18,460 --> 02:19:22,450
What do we got? 20%. What is 20%?

1381
02:19:22,480 --> 02:19:26,290
Oh, 40%. Oh, come on. It's only.

1382
02:19:27,880 --> 02:19:31,220
All right, good. All right, I'll. I will. So you are.

1383
02:19:31,240 --> 02:19:35,350
Don't tell me. You don't. You don't. You couldn't think of a hot take.

1384
02:19:35,350 --> 02:19:43,460
So I remember what you came up with. JACKIE Okay, so bad I wrote bad.

1385
02:19:43,970 --> 02:19:50,570
Her Oh, bad puns. WALKER That's right. Okay. Jackie Bad pun you've got you can select the next category.

1386
02:19:50,600 --> 02:19:53,750
So let's do this for 100.

1387
02:19:53,780 --> 02:19:58,030
All right. You guys are scared of the high category. This is the most common mental disorder in the United States.

1388
02:19:58,040 --> 02:20:01,100
What are they? What do they want to know? What do with it? Yes, Quentin.

1389
02:20:01,610 --> 02:20:07,580
Yes, it is a general anxiety disorder. Know what is my depression, but good guess.

1390
02:20:08,420 --> 02:20:12,829
Well, you know, it's interesting you ask that because the anxiety disorder actually split up into a lot of different things.

1391
02:20:12,830 --> 02:20:16,970
Antabuse atom all up. It's up there, but individually they're all less than 10%.

1392
02:20:18,200 --> 02:20:21,409
Okay. All right. But when you say let's we will extend with you.

1393
02:20:21,410 --> 02:20:24,920
Go ahead of you. Trick or treat. All right.

1394
02:20:25,670 --> 02:20:29,690
It is the percent of people with a substance use disorder that receive treatment for their condition each year.

1395
02:20:32,390 --> 02:20:35,690
Substance use disorder. Drug rehab. Yes, Mary.

1396
02:20:36,170 --> 02:20:43,530
Yes. Okay. What is 8% more loved than less than 10%.

1397
02:20:43,550 --> 02:20:46,910
Very nice. Sad statistic, but.

1398
02:20:47,930 --> 02:20:51,710
All right. Where are you taking us next? I'll do.

1399
02:20:52,010 --> 02:20:55,339
Jargon for fourth grade. Oh, yes.

1400
02:20:55,340 --> 02:21:00,760
There we go. This is the part of the brain primarily responsible for executive functioning, planning, problem solving.

1401
02:21:01,580 --> 02:21:04,790
Oh, what is the following? Very nice.

1402
02:21:04,840 --> 02:21:08,030
Yes. All right. There's our Nick Cannon over here.

1403
02:21:08,030 --> 02:21:12,080
Nick, over here. Okay. Go ahead, Nick. Out to Target for three.

1404
02:21:12,510 --> 02:21:21,080
All right. This term describes the result of a hypothesis where the association is a P-value greater than .05.

1405
02:21:24,240 --> 02:21:32,230
Saying yes, but what is not significant?

1406
02:21:34,180 --> 02:21:40,000
Very good. All right. So I have to think about it. I think you are.

1407
02:21:40,120 --> 02:21:50,330
Maria, I don't like having to go ahead and tell us what's next. I, I knew that one was going to cut a little close to home.

1408
02:21:52,160 --> 02:21:55,730
Really? But have we ever talked about those before? Yes. All of last year.

1409
02:21:55,820 --> 02:21:59,510
So go ahead. Yes. All right. I will take.

1410
02:22:01,240 --> 02:22:07,390
Student shorthand for 200. Right? Yeah. It's the full name of the entire age.

1411
02:22:07,690 --> 02:22:12,129
Yes. What is the National Institute of Mental Health? Yes.

1412
02:22:12,130 --> 02:22:16,450
Very good. All right. You are. Jacqui doesn't like work puns.

1413
02:22:16,810 --> 02:22:20,080
Loves puns. Okay. Okay. What you do.

1414
02:22:20,200 --> 02:22:26,900
Okay. Go ahead. Next time. I'm sorry to diagnose this for 200.

1415
02:22:26,930 --> 02:22:32,750
Mm. It's symptoms include brief periods of intense fear accompanied by physiologic activation.

1416
02:22:33,020 --> 02:22:36,320
Yes, Rachel. Just this one man's panic attack.

1417
02:22:36,330 --> 02:22:40,300
I'll give it to you. Mm hmm. Go ahead. Where you going? Diagnosis for 300.

1418
02:22:40,370 --> 02:22:44,720
Mm. Half of all mental disorders begin before this age.

1419
02:22:44,990 --> 02:22:48,049
Yes. 15. Disclose this already.

1420
02:22:48,050 --> 02:22:53,210
Good. 14 years. All go ahead. Next, what is our diagnosis?

1421
02:22:53,610 --> 02:22:57,110
The symptoms of this disorder include oscillating between feelings of acceleration,

1422
02:22:57,120 --> 02:23:02,020
excess, excessive good mood and feeling worthless and prolongs that cycle and hopes.

1423
02:23:02,360 --> 02:23:06,500
That is true. Sorry, I hit the wrong button. Good. All right. Close it out.

1424
02:23:06,530 --> 02:23:12,349
What is the timeline? Oh, yes. Just like the show. This common phobia describes a fear of being in busy public places.

1425
02:23:12,350 --> 02:23:15,800
Like a stadium or concert hall. Yes. What is it?

1426
02:23:16,280 --> 02:23:19,870
Yes. Correct. What is agoraphobia? Very good. Like I feel singing.

1427
02:23:19,880 --> 02:23:25,490
I know. Okay. What else are you taking us to trick or treating for?

1428
02:23:25,670 --> 02:23:29,750
Mm. This is the health care setting where most treatment for mental disorders takes place.

1429
02:23:29,780 --> 02:23:33,200
Yes. What is the person's Luke dark?

1430
02:23:33,290 --> 02:23:44,670
No. Primary person. Yes or no?

1431
02:23:46,470 --> 02:23:49,650
Where are we going with this? All right.

1432
02:23:50,780 --> 02:23:55,550
It was the first FDA approved medication to treat opioid use disorder.

1433
02:24:03,410 --> 02:24:06,530
It's not the one you're thinking of. It's the other one. Raise your hand. What is it?

1434
02:24:07,070 --> 02:24:10,250
What is it? We're not doing very good.

1435
02:24:10,280 --> 02:24:14,530
1972. All right, Burnley.

1436
02:24:15,020 --> 02:24:18,260
Okay, go ahead. Let's do. USA, USA, USA.

1437
02:24:19,100 --> 02:24:25,340
I appreciate you pronouncing it correctly. The percent of U.S. adults that have a four year college degree or more.

1438
02:24:27,860 --> 02:24:32,909
You say what is 40%. Oh very well.

1439
02:24:32,910 --> 02:24:37,950
Yeah, I'll give it to you. Yes, 34. So. So do the math for me.

1440
02:24:37,950 --> 02:24:42,190
What percent don't. 65, 65%.

1441
02:24:42,220 --> 02:24:48,210
Okay, so that's not your peer group. I got a feeling. Right. But two thirds of Americans did not go do not finish college.

1442
02:24:48,650 --> 02:24:52,980
So it's important, kind of when we talk about the population, just kind of have that number in the back of your mind.

1443
02:24:53,040 --> 02:24:56,480
Okay. All right. Next on the Supreme.

1444
02:24:56,820 --> 02:25:03,620
Mm hmm. This is how long a person born in the USA Today can expect to live in man or woman or something.

1445
02:25:05,040 --> 02:25:10,720
Yes. 47. Yes. But.

1446
02:25:10,740 --> 02:25:14,040
Yes, but but also I would have. Rachel also is correct. Yes.

1447
02:25:14,670 --> 02:25:21,060
All right. Rachel chooses to give us the next one. Shorthand for three.

1448
02:25:21,400 --> 02:25:32,460
All right. It's a full name of SAMHSA. No money.

1449
02:25:32,880 --> 02:25:40,000
What you mean? Yes. Substance abuse, mental health services administration.

1450
02:25:40,010 --> 02:25:43,430
They basically do all of the treatments.

1451
02:25:43,760 --> 02:25:56,000
So important to know. All right. It's like we're all we 44% of the population identifies as white, either Hispanic and non-Hispanic.

1452
02:25:56,660 --> 02:26:00,200
So in total numbers.

1453
02:26:02,900 --> 02:26:06,770
Based on as much as 65%.

1454
02:26:07,580 --> 02:26:10,720
Very good. 97%. Yes.

1455
02:26:10,730 --> 02:26:15,170
So now the this is changing, obviously, are populations becoming more diverse.

1456
02:26:15,170 --> 02:26:20,840
But if you just went and did a sample today in the United States, about seven out of ten people would identify as white.

1457
02:26:21,440 --> 02:26:25,190
All right. Let's finish out U.S. median household income.

1458
02:26:27,150 --> 02:26:31,100
This is all 38,030.

1459
02:26:31,410 --> 02:26:35,040
What is 30,000? What is 60,000?

1460
02:26:35,040 --> 02:26:41,740
Household income? So. All right. So, yes, of course, $60,000 goes a long way depending on where you are.

1461
02:26:41,760 --> 02:26:46,440
Right. So it's it's important to recognize that it's a single.

1462
02:26:46,620 --> 02:26:49,860
Yes. You can live that in some places, you know, but.

1463
02:26:50,010 --> 02:26:53,460
All right. Okay. All right. Next question.

1464
02:26:55,020 --> 02:27:00,390
I'll do the short end. Mm hmm. It's the full name of a daily.

1465
02:27:01,110 --> 02:27:04,620
Yes. Or does it? Disability. Sorry. All right. Very good.

1466
02:27:04,630 --> 02:27:07,770
Correct? No. And I'm. You are? Don't tell me.

1467
02:27:10,880 --> 02:27:16,230
Caitlin. All right, Caitlin, you go next. What is your name?

1468
02:27:17,040 --> 02:27:20,850
Mm. The full name of the news.

1469
02:27:21,150 --> 02:27:27,479
Oh, yes, go ahead. I know what kind of this and how the national survey of Drug Use and health it's like and Heinz.

1470
02:27:27,480 --> 02:27:32,340
But for drugs it's like any names but cool. You know, so very sorry.

1471
02:27:33,240 --> 02:27:36,360
Yeah. Okay. All right. Rachel, where are you taking us? Short and grand.

1472
02:27:36,450 --> 02:27:40,220
All right. It's a full name of the DSM, but those are blood.

1473
02:27:40,230 --> 02:27:43,770
Come on. Diagnosis is a male mental disorder. It's very good.

1474
02:27:43,780 --> 02:27:47,130
Yes. All right, good. Okay, Jurgen, let's finish it up.

1475
02:27:48,790 --> 02:27:55,290
I'll just tell you what he's doing. Okay. This term describes the proportion of the population that has ever met diagnostic criteria for a condition.

1476
02:27:55,440 --> 02:28:00,110
Yes. Oh, this is the term.

1477
02:28:00,370 --> 02:28:06,770
Oh, this is that is true. But this is the term that describes that quantity.

1478
02:28:08,270 --> 02:28:12,200
This is your. Sorry. Oh, no.

1479
02:28:12,800 --> 02:28:24,050
This is the jargon. This is the epidemiology term that describes that one in two people have never or will ever meet criteria for a mental disorder.

1480
02:28:25,100 --> 02:28:29,420
What would you call that? Incidence and prevalence.

1481
02:28:29,480 --> 02:28:33,640
It's one of those years.

1482
02:28:34,340 --> 02:28:42,469
Oh, very good one. So lifetime is ever that's where that ever comes from, is a lifetime.

1483
02:28:42,470 --> 02:28:45,770
And prevalence is that it's not new. So incidence is a new case.

1484
02:28:45,800 --> 02:28:49,100
Okay. So good. All right. Jargon for two.

1485
02:28:49,130 --> 02:28:52,580
This term describes the co-occurrence of two or more mental stories. Yes, three times.

1486
02:28:53,040 --> 02:28:56,149
Yes, that's our term. We love it. It's gross. All right.

1487
02:28:56,150 --> 02:28:59,870
And last, what is the correct pronunciation of this term?

1488
02:29:00,970 --> 02:29:04,340
You know, I'm asking.

1489
02:29:04,370 --> 02:29:09,180
I don't know what you're going to do.

1490
02:29:09,540 --> 02:29:13,380
What is good? That's good to know. What is it?

1491
02:29:19,230 --> 02:29:27,390
But wait, there's more. Okay, so now we're into final jam.

1492
02:29:28,200 --> 02:29:31,770
Category is music. Well, here we are.

1493
02:29:32,430 --> 02:29:41,550
According to Billboard magazine, this portion of the most popular songs mention a substance of abuse, alcohol, drugs or tobacco.

1494
02:29:44,200 --> 02:29:47,220
Because of that. Yes.

1495
02:29:47,520 --> 02:29:51,560
Hip hop. Wait. Right. Oh, right.

1496
02:29:52,540 --> 02:29:58,320
Oh, yeah. I'm looking for another one between zero and one.

1497
02:30:00,960 --> 02:30:05,850
What is. What is 40%? Do I hear higher?

1498
02:30:06,180 --> 02:30:13,169
Yes. What is this? What is 60% right here? Higher than 60 or something like nine is it's not all of it.

1499
02:30:13,170 --> 02:30:18,480
It's just all about drugs. So this is one third, one third according to deliver.

1500
02:30:18,780 --> 02:30:25,440
Next, what is the most commonly referenced substance of cocaine?

1501
02:30:30,570 --> 02:30:34,770
Alcohol. We're we're listening to different music.

1502
02:30:36,390 --> 02:30:41,450
All right. So all right. So it is 5:00 and I'm tired.

1503
02:30:41,460 --> 02:30:45,360
You're probably tired, too, but thank you for playing Jeopardy! So again.

1504
02:30:45,360 --> 02:30:48,419
So fill out your survey for what's readings you want to do.

1505
02:30:48,420 --> 02:30:52,650
If you don't fill it out by tomorrow morning, I'm going to just assign to something and that's going to be what it is.

1506
02:30:52,920 --> 02:30:56,300
You will get an announcement for me that will tell you when you are presenting.

1507
02:30:56,310 --> 02:31:01,170
Pay attention to that because two of you are presenting on Monday or I have your discussion board.

1508
02:31:01,230 --> 02:31:04,920
I was due on Monday and then you're presenting on Wednesday,

1509
02:31:04,920 --> 02:31:10,499
but then bonus you get it done with out of the way and you can just watch everybody else sweat it out, right?

1510
02:31:10,500 --> 02:31:18,270
Because you're going to set such a great example. So I will hang out for a few minutes afterwards if you need me, but otherwise have a great evening.

1511
02:31:19,020 --> 02:31:25,830
My primary audio source is quiet or silent. Did it not record on my on site?

1512
02:31:26,580 --> 02:31:28,710
Oh my god. That was.
