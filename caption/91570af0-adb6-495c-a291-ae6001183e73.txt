1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:08,600
The culture within. So obviously, high school students coming.

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:16,500
Yeah. There was really scrutinizing like everybody's.

3
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:23,040
And I think it is because there's something that's going on nowadays, just.

4
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:28,940
I don't know that yet. One.

5
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:38,720
Wanted to stay still. Oh, how I know it was like that.

6
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:50,560
So I actually. Yeah.

7
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:56,380
Hey, everyone, good afternoon. I got some weird screen management stuff going on so far, so bear with me.

8
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:05,050
Hopefully it will work out okay. My grand plan to host class outside the weather is not cooperating yet.

9
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:09,700
We'll keep our fingers crossed that we might have an opportunity coming up.

10
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:16,570
I did want to start just by revisiting the core schedule with where we're at with the semester and what's coming up and so forth.

11
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:21,640
So today in a few minutes, we'll dig in to kind of compare and contrast, of course,

12
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:28,390
the Montreal and Kyoto Protocol, followed by our student led discussion.

13
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:33,790
Let me jump ahead and I'll come back one to three weeks from today.

14
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:44,170
We have the class term project papers are do as well as that's the day that we'll have our term project presentations.

15
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:52,900
So I wanted to pause since we're three weeks out and just prior to see if anyone had any questions about your paper about,

16
00:01:52,900 --> 00:02:01,470
I don't know the structure of it, aspects of it, the rubric for about presentations.

17
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:06,390
Yes. So how long should the presentation be if everybody's going in here?

18
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:14,880
So we're going to be like rapid firing through using my best math, which is not necessarily strong.

19
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:22,410
We're talking five minute presentation per person with like a minute of questions and we'll just go right through.

20
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:30,060
The challenge is going to be, you've done this huge amount of work over the course of this semester and distilling it down

21
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:39,840
right next to highlights like the main points that you want to get across as part of that work.

22
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,960
Yes. With that presentation, should we have slides or generally yes.

23
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:58,080
Yeah. Um, I would call it visual. I don't want to be too prescriptive, but yes.

24
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,970
Any other questions about either the paper or presentation?

25
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:09,240
And again, this isn't the last chance to ask questions you can reach out to me between now and next week if questions come out.

26
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:16,010
I will try to prompt folks, you know, with each class period going forward here as well.

27
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:22,700
OK, so coming back up today, next week, we actually have a little bit of a pause.

28
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:30,860
We won't have a student led discussion. We will have a guest speaker who will be joining us remotely.

29
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:41,720
And bear with me while I live with this stranger in drag this across.

30
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:49,580
I wanted to take a few minutes and introduce to our speaker is going to be because I won't go in great detail next week when I actually introduce him.

31
00:03:49,580 --> 00:04:00,440
He will be joining us remotely. Professor Peron is an adjunct faculty member in our department, but for a long time he has been.

32
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:08,480
He served as a director for a federal research institute in Italy, atmospheric pollution.

33
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:14,450
And uh, he has a wealth of knowledge and experience.

34
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:28,670
But specifically around mercury. And so in addition to being a decades long research director, so research on mercury issues and the environment,

35
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:33,710
collecting data and doing analyzes to inform the policy process.

36
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:46,190
Not only has he done that, he's also served as a delegate of Italy to the EU and also a delegate of the EU to international

37
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:52,910
bodies for the actual drafting and eventual agreement of the metamorphic convention.

38
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:58,610
So he's this super, super valuable wealth of knowledge on this topic,

39
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:06,050
and so I wanted to go get him a little bit of a heads up and share a little bit of detail about him.

40
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:15,200
You know, prior to actually engaging with him next week, he I had a meeting with him last Monday over Zoom.

41
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:21,260
And he's just I mean, like most people dying to travel again right under non pandemic conditions,

42
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:26,480
he would be here presenting in class and really enjoying the interaction with all of you.

43
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,820
So we'll we'll do that over Zoom.

44
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:35,900
[INAUDIBLE] just be up here talking away, and we'll make it as informal as we can for questions and discussion and so forth.

45
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,530
But basically, you know, Nikola will be kind of leading the discussion.

46
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:44,150
Perhaps I'll moderate a little bit, but I'll leave it mostly up to you guys.

47
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:54,920
So in that regard, having this fabulous speaker coming, do your homework, do the readings and come with some comments and questions.

48
00:05:54,920 --> 00:06:00,590
Um, any any questions about kind of like the format or the logistics for next week?

49
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:08,360
Yes, we on Zoom too or in here, we'll do we'll do exactly what we did will be in here.

50
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:14,990
We'll do what we did with the power plant presenters. Remember earlier in the semester where they were up,

51
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:20,300
and I will try to have it sorted out in advance so that this time the speaker can actually see us right.

52
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:29,090
Last time they could only hear us. But the camera thing and I think I know the solution to it, but I will work on that in advance.

53
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:33,800
But yeah, we'll all meet here in class and I'm I am.

54
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,760
I told Nikola, you know, the class period is an hour and 50 minutes,

55
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:46,370
but he's not responsible for filling an hour and 50 minutes that we have our own and then bolts business that we can also address within that.

56
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:58,060
So we will definitely have some exchange just as a class without Nikola or any other questions.

57
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:06,610
All right, so with that, I'm going to go ahead and jump that back to today's topic, which, as I alluded,

58
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:14,410
is is a kind of a comparison and a contrast between both the Montreal Protocol and Kyoto Protocol.

59
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:21,130
I'm sensitive not to step on the toes of our class discussion leaders like I usually am trying to do.

60
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:27,970
Instead, I'm going to focus a little bit on the science behind both of them just to make sure that we're all kind of on it,

61
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:34,480
even understanding at least at a foundational level of the science behind both of these issues.

62
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:45,100
I will leave with a little bit of basic history around the protocols themselves, but then we'll go ahead and go into our student led discussion.

63
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:55,780
All right. So starting with the Montreal Protocol. So as I'm sure you're aware this from the readings, this is the issue of stratospheric ozone.

64
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:59,850
Right? This is actually confusing right off the bat.

65
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:10,570
We as an environmental health issue because ozone is bad, it's not something we want in the lower layers of the atmosphere in the troposphere,

66
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:15,850
right where we will live and breathe and play and work and so forth.

67
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:24,070
It's a lung irritant. It's super bad in terms of inhalation and respiratory effects.

68
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:29,380
Very different story. Once we get to the upper levels of the atmosphere into the stratosphere,

69
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:42,850
that's where Ozone exists naturally and where it without perturbations is stable and it provides a big benefit to us at the surface of the Earth.

70
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:53,740
So this is looking at altitude and kilometers going up 20 40 60 kilometers and then across the bottom scale,

71
00:08:53,740 --> 00:09:02,890
we're looking at ozone concentration and the ozone is traced in this yellow line, the concentration.

72
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:07,420
So hopefully it's as low as possible down here near the surface.

73
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:11,680
As we go up in altitude, the ozone is increasing, increasing, increasing, increasing,

74
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:18,130
increasing and then it starts to decrease as it continues to go up further.

75
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:25,360
But it's really, you know, this peak layer where there's peak concentration of ozone in the stratosphere.

76
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:32,140
So the travel pause, the red line delineates what was the troposphere down below and above.

77
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:40,360
It starts the stratosphere, which goes all the way up to a little over 50 kilometers in altitude.

78
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:50,650
So we have this stable layer of ozone, and where it provides the benefit is that it filters out ultraviolet b wavelength of

79
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:57,980
light that are otherwise super harmful to us as humans in terms of sun exposure,

80
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:01,720
not just sunburns, but skin cancer, things like this.

81
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:10,420
And there's also a long list of of adverse effects on the environment, on vegetation, on materials and so forth.

82
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:18,460
So this is the benefit that we have from ozone in the stratosphere that is naturally existing.

83
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:33,010
So when we look at layer levels of ozone in the stratosphere over time, you know, going back to the 1930s to the 1960s, it's relatively stable.

84
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:38,830
Then what's happened is about that timeframe.

85
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:52,480
1960S into the 1970s, we had some incredible engineering going on where scientists engineers developed these compounds called

86
00:10:52,480 --> 00:11:04,000
chlorofluorocarbons or halogen heated organic molecules that were tested to a great degree in the laboratory.

87
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:13,930
They have applications for refrigerants, so refrigerators, air conditioning and automobiles and so forth propellants,

88
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:20,290
lots of uses and being concerned about, OK, what would happen to them?

89
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:24,430
Do they break down or do they turn into something that could be toxic, right?

90
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:36,090
There was a lot of study of them in the laboratory, and they were found to be incredibly stable, non-reactive and long lasting.

91
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:42,880
Right. So just perfect. OK, so now let's put them into a lot of use, a lot of application.

92
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:48,370
Well, it turned out that all of those evaluations were correct.

93
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:56,990
They're not harmful. They don't break down. They're not reactive, all at the surface of the Earth, but those evaluations.

94
00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:05,780
That took place. So what happened over time is that the appliances and the uses of the of these compounds, uh,

95
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:12,230
once they started to leak right out of refrigerant system and so forth and these compounds get out into the air, they're buoyant.

96
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:18,320
They're a gas. They make their way up into the atmosphere.

97
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:24,380
And once they get high enough up, they're now exposed to different wavelengths of light.

98
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:32,180
And they're sensitive to something called a photochemical reaction. So a wavelength of the light can trigger a reaction.

99
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:36,740
So that now they're no longer stable, they now become reactive.

100
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:45,380
And what happens without getting into crazy amounts of chemistry is that these chlorine atoms are cleaved off.

101
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:50,600
The holograms are cleaved off over the compound through these sort of chemical reactions,

102
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:58,220
and they basically participate in the reaction that converts ozone into oxygen.

103
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:02,270
Right. We're not exposed to the ozone. Remember, it's up here.

104
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:05,030
Oxygen otherwise isn't very harmful.

105
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:17,450
But what we then start to do is deplete this otherwise beneficial layer of protective ozone in the stratosphere through that reaction.

106
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:23,840
How do we know that we've had ozone depletion in the stratosphere?

107
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:31,550
There are mapping spectrometers that can look at what column ozone right through the atmosphere.

108
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:39,350
And you've heard about the ozone hole right with with the seasonal circulation and global circulation patterns,

109
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:46,010
they are the worst over the South Pole and the North Pole, and it's kind of denoted here, right?

110
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:56,030
These these low concentrations down in the kind of bluish purple color that are centered over the over the South Pole.

111
00:13:56,030 --> 00:14:00,260
And this particular image, but then with patterns over the rest of the year,

112
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:05,660
it doesn't stay secluded to the South Pole for the kind of debates across the whole globe so

113
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:13,660
that we have on average reduction of protective ozone layer in the stratosphere and over time,

114
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:25,430
going from the 1970s through, we did see this kind of steady decline in column stratospheric ozone through the atmosphere.

115
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:36,620
Just looking at, you know, the negative aspects of it is that as you have a reduction in ozone, we have, you know,

116
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:45,740
a relative percent increase in those harmful ultraviolet rays that are able to reach the Earth's surface.

117
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:57,160
All right. That's that's, uh, stratospheric ozone 101. Any any questions about any of that material that was presented.

118
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:04,690
OK. I mean, in a nutshell, the problem, even though it's a complicated issue,

119
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:11,080
it's simpler to understand the science behind it and kind of the ramifications or the adverse effects are much more

120
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:20,230
limited with regard to the Montreal Protocol as we then shift to the Kyoto Protocol and the issue of greenhouse gases,

121
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:28,810
right? So this is much more complex and the the effects the adverse effects are much more broad and dynamic.

122
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:33,140
All right. So we start with this by looking at the greenhouse effect.

123
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:36,610
So I'm almost positive everyone's heard of that term. Right?

124
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:42,190
The greenhouse effect, what actually is happening when we say the greenhouse effect?

125
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:54,010
OK, so it's also related to sunlight. So, you know, if you're the history of the Earth, we have incident solar radiation coming in.

126
00:15:54,010 --> 00:16:02,860
It passes through the atmosphere. Most of that radiation is absorbed by the Earth's surface and warms it.

127
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:09,670
I don't think I've described this previously, but this is this is a fun fact when we have a warm, sunny day, right?

128
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:13,150
And oh, here comes that sun. You can actually feel it on your skin. It warms you up.

129
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:21,070
You're like, Wow, the sun is so warm the sun. Those those rays of sunlight are not warming the air.

130
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:25,750
All of that sunlight is absorbed by the Earth's surface.

131
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:34,810
It's then converted into infrared radiation and given back off as heat, so the air actually warms from the ground up.

132
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:40,810
Is that infrared radiation that's rising from the surface the same way that it might rise from your skin,

133
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:46,030
right as you feel your skin warm into this absorbing that solar radiation?

134
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:57,220
So this is how the atmosphere warms. Some of that radiation escapes back out out of the Earth's atmosphere.

135
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:01,120
Some of it is maintained and it's a delicate balance.

136
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,120
But it basically is what allows life to exist, right?

137
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:14,620
It keeps at a moderate temperature for things to grow, for things to thrive, for us to exist without this type of greenhouse effect.

138
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:20,170
If the Earth would be way too cool for survival, we're too cold.

139
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:29,020
OK, so what's happened is that as we start emitting, so there's natural levels of greenhouse gases,

140
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:42,250
CO2 and others that exist in the Earth's atmosphere as we have started through human activities to emit much more of these gases that hold in warm.

141
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:47,140
It's resulted in increasing temperatures across the surface of the Earth.

142
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:55,690
Right. So the greenhouse effect its existence and it's our understanding of it is a necessity for human life.

143
00:17:55,690 --> 00:18:06,800
But it's been complicated and challenged because we're emitting more gases that contribute to this effect and this warming at the surface.

144
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:12,230
All right, so what about the warming a couple of plots here?

145
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:15,230
And again, apologies with whatever's going on with the stream business.

146
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:24,080
It's kind of like compressing and stretching, so it's not turning out visually is as helpful as I would hope,

147
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:30,140
but asked me any questions if something's not clear to what start over here with on the left.

148
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:34,320
This is looking at about the last one hundred and forty years.

149
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,390
We're looking at global mean surface temperature.

150
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:46,430
So that means if you could record at every place on the Earth, what's the temperature at the surface and then take an average?

151
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:52,310
That's what global mean. Surface temperature means going back one hundred and forty years ago,

152
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:58,250
we're down here over time, we're increasing or increasing or increasing or increasing.

153
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:04,670
Right. So it's kind of like a slope pretty steady over those last one hundred and forty years.

154
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:18,080
What's striking is if we look over here at the flat on the right side, which is going back 1000 years a long, long time ago.

155
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,940
Here's that same temperature trace global mean surface temperature so average temperature

156
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:27,440
across the entire Earth's surface that was in the year fourteen hundred years,

157
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:36,080
sixteen hundred year, eighteen hundred. And it's only in this last hundred and fifty years or so or we see this dramatic increase.

158
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:50,720
So it's the same data that's over here. But on the scale, and compared to a thousand years of extra data, you can see how remarkable the increase is.

159
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,700
Let's see what you probably can't read. At least on the screen is the red bar.

160
00:19:55,700 --> 00:20:01,130
On this plot is the direct temperature and blue bar is approx.

161
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:06,710
This proxy data. So for those last 150 years, we actually have some homeowners, right?

162
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:12,440
Go out, hold it up or maybe mount it and it's recording and you can measure what the temperature is.

163
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:25,730
We didn't have those a thousand years ago. How do we know that this was the global mean surface temperature going back a thousand years ago?

164
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:34,070
Yeah, of. Yeah, absolutely. So we can take we scientists can take cores of ice from the Earth,

165
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:46,490
deep those cores based on different elemental information and understand what the temperature was over the course of many years going back in time.

166
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:54,230
So this is how we use this is this is what the proxy data is derived from the ice core information and then we continue with it.

167
00:20:54,230 --> 00:21:02,990
So there's actually blue and red plotted here, and they overlay pretty nice stuff a little bit more, just kind of over time.

168
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:08,750
Here's that same kind of temperature change in the bacteria with is the red and only in recent

169
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:16,730
years we have a big increase if we look at actual CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere.

170
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:25,730
If a similar trace is relatively steady until recent times and then we see a steep increase, that's in parts per million.

171
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:30,770
And then if we look at carbon emissions specifically, like how much is being emitted,

172
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:37,730
the trees in the foreground is relatively low until we kind of hit like the industrial revolution.

173
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:42,110
And then, you know, massive amounts of emissions of carbon, which you can't see here.

174
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:48,860
The yellow is all carbon, the pinkish color is red.

175
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:51,380
Color is specific to fossil fuels, right?

176
00:21:51,380 --> 00:22:00,470
So this is when we really started to to mine a lot of coal, a lot of oil and burn it for energy, for transportation and so forth.

177
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:11,510
And, you know, massive increases right along that same timeframe. So incident carbon emissions associated with the incident,

178
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:22,100
CO2 concentration increases and also associated with the same increases in global mean surface temperature.

179
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:26,600
So when we talk about these greenhouse gases and these emissions, where are they coming from?

180
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,930
A couple of different answers from different perspectives.

181
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:39,110
So let's see over here on the left, you're looking at the types of greenhouse gases, uh, how much is emitted by gas.

182
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:45,540
And so, you know, CO2 from fossil fuel use is a little over half.

183
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:52,130
Uh, looking at, uh, deforestation, decay or biomass as another source of CO2.

184
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:59,180
So all total CO2 emissions about three quarters. Methane is a smaller but yet still important fraction.

185
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:04,910
Nitrous oxide also a contributor if you look over here on the right.

186
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:09,350
This is looking at greenhouse gas emissions by source.

187
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:16,340
Right. So kind of what types of sources are emitting these? A big part coming from energy supply.

188
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:25,730
We talked about transportation, residential and commercial buildings, industry, agriculture, forestry.

189
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:33,140
And then if you look, uh, where on the earth, uh, in this case, by country or by region?

190
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:37,760
Where are those? And this is specific. This part is specific to CO2.

191
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:43,880
Where is the emissions coming from? And this is a snapshot from 2008.

192
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:49,160
And in this case, we had China at about twenty three percent. The US said 18 percent.

193
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,290
The European Union at 13 percent.

194
00:23:52,290 --> 00:24:01,130
An important contribution from India, Russia, Japan, Canada and then another quarter or so from essentially the rest of the world.

195
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:08,660
And again, this was this is a snapshot, right? So we're concerned with CO2 emissions over a hundred and fifty years.

196
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:12,890
If we looked at 1968, this pie would look different.

197
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:22,600
And actually, if we plot 2022, this pie would be continuing to to evolve.

198
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:33,400
So there's a governance intergovernmental panel called the IPCC, or that the acronym for it, the Internet Governance Panel on Climate Change,

199
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:47,080
and it's composed of a couple of hundred of topical experts from literally around the world that their charge is purely scientific in nature.

200
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:52,930
And they have that the panel has its own policy that the only statements they're

201
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:59,410
willing to make are those that are reached by consensus of every panel member.

202
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:06,340
So the hundreds of people that serve that are topical experts on the science behind climate change

203
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:12,880
all agree on a consensus with the statements that are made and what the reports that are produced.

204
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,080
And so that's what I want you to take away with these a couple of bullet points.

205
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:27,460
Here are new and stronger evidence that most of the warming observed over the last one hundred and fifty years is attributable to human activities.

206
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:35,590
The warming in the last 1000 years is unusual and is unlikely to be entirely natural in origin.

207
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:41,950
Natural forcings alone do not explain the recent substantial warming since 1950.

208
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:55,540
And some conclusions that both temperature so global mean surface temperature and sea level will continue to rise under all scenarios.

209
00:25:55,540 --> 00:26:00,010
All right, so we'll get to what those scenarios are in a second.

210
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:10,750
But that's basically saying like if we shut off the faucet magically tomorrow and there are no more greenhouse gases being emitted,

211
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:18,910
but the temperature and sea level will continue to increase for a few more statements.

212
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:24,490
And this is going back a while ago now, CC in 2013.

213
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:25,360
At that point,

214
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:34,600
it was comprised of two hundred and fifty nine authors coming from thirty nine different countries stated that the time for doubt is passed, right?

215
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:39,190
There's. It was originally kind of termed global warming.

216
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:48,850
It was more accurately evolved to the term of climate change because regionally it actually changes some regions of the globe cool, while others warm.

217
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:53,470
But on average, it's all warming. And it was, you know, a debate.

218
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:58,570
Is climate change real, right? And so this was kind of putting that to rest.

219
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:07,950
The warming from our climate system has been unequivocally confirmed and linked directly to human activity.

220
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:11,340
All right, so back to those scenarios, so these are.

221
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:19,590
This is from the IPCC reports where they do this right, there's climate scientists, climate modelers that have,

222
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:26,730
you know, massive computer resources and can do different simulations under different scenarios, right?

223
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:33,150
Because that's you hear a lot about the policy and the Conference of Parties meetings

224
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:40,410
and debates around how much do we need to reduce rate in order to have X result?

225
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:45,990
So 10 percent reduction by this year, a 50 percent reduction by this year and so forth.

226
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:54,450
So that's what these different scenarios are. And I'm not going to try to focus on all of them, but I just want to look at.

227
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:59,130
Draw your eye to the top and draw your eye to the bottom.

228
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:10,710
So going back to that, if we had the most magical scenario where tomorrow we could shut off the faucet, no more greenhouse gases being emitted.

229
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:17,700
This is still our temperature is increasing. Global mean surface temperature is increasing, it's going to continue to increase.

230
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:26,550
And this is going after the year 2100. That's a result of all of the emissions that have already taken place.

231
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:36,000
The top then, is if we do nothing, if we don't change anything about greenhouse gas emissions and we're just going to continue on our current

232
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:45,510
trajectory that the amount of global mean surface temperature increase would get us to this point by the year 2100.

233
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:49,290
It's hard to see, but again, with apologies over here on the left,

234
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:59,250
these are departures and temperature and degrees Celsius, and it's all compared back to 1990 values.

235
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:07,680
So here's kind of the zero line. We're actually slightly under that right up until about 1850 or so.

236
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:13,440
We have the recent years increase where we're now on the plus side of zero.

237
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:25,380
And even if we magically turn off all of the emissions, we still get up to about 1.5 degrees Celsius increase in global mean surface temperature.

238
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:36,330
The Do Nothing option or is giving us up to about five and a half degrees Celsius above current for global mean surface temperature.

239
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:40,500
So that's the temperature piece talking a little bit about sea level.

240
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:54,240
So here are measurements and data similar timeframes going back to 18 e, so we have a tidal gauge data, Beuys, right?

241
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,920
Things like this that measure sea level.

242
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:03,420
And you know, we're at a zero point 1880.

243
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:07,800
It's steadily increasing, steadily increasing over time.

244
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:12,760
We have satellite data that came into play in the 1990s.

245
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:19,530
So that's the red line here at it, which overlays pretty nicely with the GIS data.

246
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:26,790
And, you know, just to kind of state the obvious this is from from glaciers melting and sea ice

247
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:37,420
melting and then raising sea level on average across the surface of the Earth.

248
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:43,870
What you know, starting to shift a little bit from what's happening to why would we be worried about it,

249
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:48,190
what are the potential impacts with regards to sea level?

250
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:50,380
You've got I should have looked at this before.

251
00:30:50,380 --> 00:31:01,810
It's something like half of the Earth's population lives within the statistic 10 miles or something of an ocean coast.

252
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:05,790
Don't quote me on it. But roughly speaking with that's accurate.

253
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:14,380
And you know, all the infrastructure that comes with where people live and where we have urban areas and communities and so forth.

254
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:21,670
So just really basic level concerns, right? Like inundation. So just, you know, water flooding.

255
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:27,710
This is you can it's hard to see in this map. The red means bad in the US here.

256
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:33,490
Much of the Atlantic coast, you know, South Florida salinization of coastal aquifers, right?

257
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:38,260
So freshwater basically being contaminated with saltwater.

258
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:51,250
So these are kind of base level concerns around sea level rise, uh, getting back to some so or more recent data specific to CO2 concentrations, right?

259
00:31:51,250 --> 00:32:01,810
So now looking at the temperature, not looking at emissions, but just what the actual CO2 concentration this is looking at.

260
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:12,730
Carbon dioxide over a more recent period in nineteen fifty five to a little bit, maybe 2006 2007.

261
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:22,840
This is recorded by NOAA National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Federal Government Agency that Mauna Loa,

262
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:32,470
which is a mountain on one of the Hawaiian Islands in the Pacific Ocean.

263
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:44,270
Why would why would we be interested in measuring CO2 on the top of not a low in the middle of the Pacific?

264
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:49,940
Why would I bother to make a plot to mount a lower CO2 data, I guess? I guess it's probably a good control point.

265
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:54,440
There's probably relatively like less factories in the area versus like put in.

266
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,460
Absolutely. Oh, absolutely.

267
00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:04,360
So if we measure CO2 in Ann Arbor, we say, Hey, it's class project, let's go to the diag and we're going to measure CO2, right?

268
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:07,700
There's there are all kinds of things that are impacting the CO2 concentration,

269
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:12,950
the cars and busses that are driving by, you know, on state streets, for example.

270
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:19,070
Yes. So the top of I think Mauna Loa is about 13000 feet.

271
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:21,530
It gets into the free troposphere.

272
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:34,430
And so it's free from kind of contamination, free from from local effects, and it's representative of kind of this oceanic Trans-Pacific air mass.

273
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:43,150
And so it's representative of a much more global indicating level of CO2.

274
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:49,810
This one is pretty cool, while the result isn't that cool, but the individual assistance is pretty cool,

275
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:58,210
so this is looking at the changes in temperatures across the surface of the Earth over time.

276
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:02,110
It's a loop. I'll play it a couple of times. I will explain what it is first.

277
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:08,140
So it starts at 1884 and it goes through about 2011 or so.

278
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:16,240
And I know you can't see the scale. I apologize. Blue means cooler, and the orange and red means warmer.

279
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:23,590
So that's kind of the basic thing to pay attention to. And it's and it's a little bit challenging for like the whole multitasking thing for someone

280
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:27,910
like myself because you have to pay attention to both the year and how the colors are changing.

281
00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:33,640
So for that reason, I play it, I'll play it twice and you have the slide deck as well as you want to mess with it some more.

282
00:34:33,640 --> 00:35:02,410
So let's go ahead and press go. Hopefully.

283
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:10,120
Wow, right, so those most recent couple of decades, you can see how dramatic the increase is.

284
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:14,860
So I'll play it again in a minute. So we're this type of data.

285
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:21,430
Plot and visualization is helpful as we're we're looking at those previous plots are looking at global mean.

286
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:28,270
Right. The average of temperature increase, um, maybe by year over time.

287
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:34,280
This is acknowledging that that increase isn't isn't the same across the globe, right?

288
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:39,370
There's regions of the globe that are increasing more than others.

289
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:48,850
Some, some basic stuff. You know, you generally see this. The northern hemisphere has warmer temperatures or a bigger increase in temperature.

290
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:54,590
You generally see that over continental regions versus over water.

291
00:35:54,590 --> 00:36:30,460
Right, the warming is occurring faster. Go ahead and play it.

292
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:34,870
And then I started to kind of talk about the terminology a minute ago, you know,

293
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:47,620
wrongly the term global warming was was attributed to this and it it really landed itself to some wrongly contentious views,

294
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:54,490
right, that you walk outside and this will almost certainly happen in Michigan.

295
00:36:54,490 --> 00:37:01,660
Like, walk outside, you know, late April. And oh my gosh, there's like a trace of snow on the ground, right?

296
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:09,830
And the response is, what are these people talking about global warming, right? It's like snow went on top of the, you know, flowers or whatever.

297
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:13,660
Um yeah, I. And you know, to some extent, that's true.

298
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:19,150
It's really not global warming, although on average, the globe is warming.

299
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:28,240
It's really changing climates. That's the more accurate kind of terminology to discuss this, and it's acknowledging that regional component.

300
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:37,900
There's a few more slides here that kind of look at regional differences or regional potential impacts from an overall warming planet.

301
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:45,940
Fairly quickly here. Water scarcity might end up being a defining issue.

302
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:55,840
You know, we talk about many regions of the world, the U.S. even, you know, we have measure how politically inclined you are.

303
00:37:55,840 --> 00:38:00,700
But you know, people who live in the southwest, US or the West, the US,

304
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:06,460
there's severe drought now and there's not a whole lot of fresh water to be had.

305
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:18,310
And you know, there are there are definitely political desires for, Hey, how can we tap into the Great Lakes, right?

306
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:27,430
Like the Earth's largest source of freshwater and distribute this more broadly to areas that need it?

307
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:34,750
These are these are real discussions that that take place a couple of things that are a little bit complicated about how the atmosphere works,

308
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:40,160
but just in a couple of them. So we have warming the air, right?

309
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:49,690
Warmer temperatures, warming air can actually hold more moisture, so water that evaporates from like ocean surfaces.

310
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:54,520
They can also result in more precipitation, right? So it is brought up into the air.

311
00:38:54,520 --> 00:39:01,150
The air can hold it and it can transport it over land and that result in higher amounts of rainfall.

312
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:07,930
So some regions can have higher amounts of precipitation as a result of overall global warming.

313
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:14,170
We have a lot more contrast between warm air and cold air.

314
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:22,480
That's also another fun fact about this planet is gradients between warm and cold or high pressure,

315
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:27,820
and low pressure is what allows wind to blow from one direction to the other.

316
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:30,970
So in many regions, we can have more wind.

317
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:40,030
We've also talked about the melting of sea ice, resulting in higher Senior-level, but can also have effect on ocean currents.

318
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:44,830
So we end up with the possibility for some regions being warmer.

319
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:56,000
While some could actually end up being cooler in some areas being wetter, with others actually being drier.

320
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,470
That time here.

321
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:10,240
This plot has got a ton in it, I won't try to pull it all apart, but just say a couple of take home message is so drought rate being an issue.

322
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:16,300
Melting of glaciers that serve as otherwise a source of water and then kind of back to the

323
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:25,740
point of water scarcity that that continue to become a bigger and bigger issue going forward.

324
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:29,970
How does this change, um, food sources?

325
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:36,930
So these are some projections this is going out to the two thousand eighties time

326
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:43,080
period looking at projected impact of climate change and agricultural yields.

327
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:52,140
Some regions are going to benefit, right? You have warmer temperature and earlier spring or later fall a longer growing season.

328
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:56,310
So and that's generally depicted color wise here.

329
00:40:56,310 --> 00:41:09,270
The Greens are a positive change in agricultural productivity and the kind of oranges and reds are a negative change in agricultural yield.

330
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:19,890
So you can see, you know, based on this, where some areas would have a longer agricultural season compared to others,

331
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:25,380
uh, this one is super, super filled with information.

332
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:31,230
They won't go through it all, but it's a really nice schematic that kind of highlights all of the different

333
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:36,900
aspects of climate change and how they can potentially impact human health.

334
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:44,340
So if you focus on just on air pollution and water quality impacts on increasing allergies,

335
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:54,810
this is the downside of the longer growing season in the higher agricultural yield is now you have more vegetation, more pollen and more allergens.

336
00:41:54,810 --> 00:42:02,700
You know these types of things that can cause respiratory issues that same region,

337
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:13,230
those green regions in this plot, the longer, warmer seasons, uh, allow changes in vector ecology.

338
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:23,970
Right. So certain species of mosquitoes that only lived and existed in more southern latitudes now are able to exist in, you know,

339
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:30,690
pushing further north into more northern latitudes and the impact on disease transmission,

340
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:38,940
uh, heat waves is is another big impact from a changing climate.

341
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:49,110
So I didn't highlighted it's on this slide. Again and again, it's really small to see.

342
00:42:49,110 --> 00:43:00,840
And so my apologies. But basically what it's illustrating is that we have a warming climate and the changes that result from it

343
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:11,970
are getting us away from things taking place in the average region and having more extremes on both sides.

344
00:43:11,970 --> 00:43:16,770
Right. So I don't know, maybe as a couple of years ago, you probably remember like the polar vortex.

345
00:43:16,770 --> 00:43:21,510
Right? That's an example of extreme cold, right,

346
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:29,760
that wasn't happening before without going into a long explanation in terms of the polar atmosphere or the atmosphere above the

347
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:41,820
poles with a stable global mean surface temperature that cold air remains trapped at the poles and it circulates over the poles.

348
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:53,730
It's what it's what keeps the glaciers frozen and the sea ice frozen, as that gets debated by like the changes that we see here, right?

349
00:43:53,730 --> 00:44:03,090
Spatially, that tight circle of air over the poles begins to have kinks and bends in it so

350
00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:08,670
that that cold air comes much to much lower latitudes than I otherwise would.

351
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:13,500
So when we have like the polar vortex in the northern part of the U.S. or whatever, that's what's happening.

352
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:17,100
We're having this massive poor air mass that's coming way further south than

353
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:22,920
it ever used to because that circulation over the pole has been perturbation.

354
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:31,470
On the other end of the spectrum, we also have an increased incidence of extreme heat heat waves that we didn't have before.

355
00:44:31,470 --> 00:44:41,640
This is looking at some data. One of the best documented and kind of historically going back to August of 2003, this massive heat wave in Europe.

356
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:48,540
And again, it's not that it was never hot in different regions of the Earth,

357
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:57,500
as it is now becoming hot for very extreme heat or very short time periods in regions where it never used to.

358
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:06,690
Rates already have high populations of people living in areas that don't have cooling capacity because then they don't need it.

359
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:13,620
It's never been part of the infrastructure need to have air conditioning right in residential homes and apartment buildings, whatever it is,

360
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:18,090
and then suddenly to have extreme heat events, the same type of vulnerable,

361
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:22,620
susceptible people to all the pollutants that we're always looking at in our environment.

362
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:29,490
Same types of conditions. Those are the same people that are more susceptible to extreme heat is looking at, you know,

363
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:38,610
potentially even deaths that took place across a number of different European countries over this one month period in 2003.

364
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:43,840
The increase in both the frequency and the severity of severe weather.

365
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:56,310
Right. So this one is looking at a hurricane specifically. These photos are from Superstorm Sandy, which is going back a while now, 2012.

366
00:45:56,310 --> 00:46:01,290
Uh, it happened very late in the hurricane season.

367
00:46:01,290 --> 00:46:06,180
This is October 30th of 2012, where these photos came from.

368
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:10,920
And just unfortunately, it's not just Superstorm Sandy that you've seen this.

369
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:13,170
You can get these types of photos from now.

370
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:22,950
There have been events that have taken place over the last decade in Europe and other locations where just massive amounts of flooding,

371
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:26,680
massive amounts of rainfall, tidal surge and so forth.

372
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:30,930
So this is it's kind of hard. These are supposed to be before and after pictures of it family.

373
00:46:30,930 --> 00:46:35,070
It's all going down a roadway, going down underneath and you know, it's now filled with water.

374
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:41,910
All these people are floating, basically, um, this is, you know,

375
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:52,290
a bridge that's basically been washed away due to flooding, highlighting some of the diseases.

376
00:46:52,290 --> 00:47:00,960
So we talked about mosquitoes and vector borne disease. Waterborne diseases can absolutely be affected by these.

377
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:10,230
What might appear to be subtle changes in the hydrology can have a very large impact on waterborne diseases.

378
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:16,980
Uh, yeah. So talking about the vector borne, right? Um, and these these are um,

379
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:25,470
they're growing and expanding geographically where we're concerned about vector borne diseases that we didn't used to be here in Michigan, right?

380
00:47:25,470 --> 00:47:37,050
West Nile virus is a big concern. Uh, and then mosquitoes, there's a ton of study around them there,

381
00:47:37,050 --> 00:47:44,940
the different species that carry these diseases and where they're kind of migrating and.

382
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:52,620
And residing compared to where they used to historically air pollution,

383
00:47:52,620 --> 00:48:02,310
so climate change results in more stagnation of air masses in some specific areas.

384
00:48:02,310 --> 00:48:07,260
So what that allows is pollution to not dilute,

385
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:15,900
to not be dissected horizontally away from an urban area or where people live and not to dilute vertically into the atmosphere.

386
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:23,200
So we have stagnant air, we have increases in whatever is being emitted in that local environment.

387
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:32,700
So we're concerned about particulate matter. We're concerned about ozone in the troposphere right here on the surface where we live, where we breathe.

388
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:36,630
Also, I mentioned this earlier rate with the warmer,

389
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:48,390
longer seasons and increased allergy margin production to people with allergies, triggers of asthma and so forth.

390
00:48:48,390 --> 00:48:50,730
And then I think I'm almost done.

391
00:48:50,730 --> 00:49:02,310
Yes, it's called slides left here, but moving into the policy piece of this and where will transition to our student led discussion?

392
00:49:02,310 --> 00:49:13,320
Going back to 1992 was the Rio Convention, which adopted a UN framework on climate change.

393
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:20,070
It became effective in 1994. There were hundred and ninety five signatory nations.

394
00:49:20,070 --> 00:49:27,070
This has what each year since roughly speaking, there's been an annual conference of parties.

395
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:37,320
And I think maybe the most famous one that you've maybe heard of or noteworthy was the one that took place in Paris in 2016,

396
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:46,650
where there was some significant progress made on UN agreements towards combating climate change.

397
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:53,130
And you know, it's the the annual conference of Parties, each meeting.

398
00:49:53,130 --> 00:50:03,330
The goal is to review the convention, but its implementation and its progress and address what hasn't been done or what needs to

399
00:50:03,330 --> 00:50:14,010
be done on a slightly different vector was specifically was the Kyoto Protocol in 1997,

400
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:24,240
and it's mostly comprised of developed countries, as well as emerging markets, reducing emissions of six different greenhouse gases.

401
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:35,850
Two. And this is kind of an interesting statistics the five percent below 1990 levels and achieving that sometime between 2008 and 2012.

402
00:50:35,850 --> 00:50:42,720
By 2007, it was ratified by all the parties except the US.

403
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:52,470
Canada withdrew in 2012. Russia, Japan and New Zealand basically weren't setting any new binding targets.

404
00:50:52,470 --> 00:51:08,370
And you know what was put forth in 1997 and ratified the reductions that were aimed at were largely not not met, not achieved.

405
00:51:08,370 --> 00:51:14,130
And then finishing up and some important definitions kind of as we get into the into the discussion,

406
00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:19,470
but these are some terms that you'll hear when we talk about climate change. That's a very common one.

407
00:51:19,470 --> 00:51:34,170
Mitigation is one. So mitigation means doing something to intervene to either reduce the sources of greenhouse gases, right?

408
00:51:34,170 --> 00:51:40,290
So stop emitting them or to enhance the sinks.

409
00:51:40,290 --> 00:51:44,850
So if there are ways to remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.

410
00:51:44,850 --> 00:51:52,410
So either of those would be considered mitigation strategies and then adaptation

411
00:51:52,410 --> 00:52:01,320
is not addressing how much is being emitted or how much is being reduced,

412
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:08,370
but is basically saying, OK, this is what's happening, how can we live with it?

413
00:52:08,370 --> 00:52:19,590
Basically, what are strategies we can do to adapt to it? So adjusting in either natural or human systems in response to actual or

414
00:52:19,590 --> 00:52:27,360
expected right climatic stimuli or other effects that moderate harm or exploit,

415
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:36,930
you know, beneficial opportunities, various types of adaptation can be distinguished, including anticipatory and reactive adaptation.

416
00:52:36,930 --> 00:52:46,080
It could be happening in a in a private forum or in a public annotation, as well as autonomous and planned adaptation.

417
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:58,140
And in the term resilience, you'll hear this a lot on climate resiliency, and it's basically an indicator of an ability or capacity to adapt.

418
00:52:58,140 --> 00:53:00,990
Right? And so as you can imagine, you know, some regions,

419
00:53:00,990 --> 00:53:11,610
some areas have a higher level of resiliency than others because of infrastructure and resources, et cetera.

420
00:53:11,610 --> 00:53:25,860
And then, you know, with those with those clearly delineated definitions or terms, of course, the reality is it's it's not an either or argument.

421
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:31,890
If you go back to those those emission scenarios and how much the temperature is going to increase,

422
00:53:31,890 --> 00:53:37,260
even if we have the magic valve to turn it all off tomorrow, the temperature is still going to continue to increase.

423
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:46,980
So nonetheless, we will have we will need adaptation strategies to respond to changes that are that are going to occur,

424
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:51,370
but that that doesn't mean that that's all we're focusing on, right?

425
00:53:51,370 --> 00:54:05,970
We do absolutely need to continue mightily with those mitigation strategies as well to be able to reduce the emissions and enhance the things.

426
00:54:05,970 --> 00:54:13,860
All right. So that was meant to be kind of the science background, the foundation as we lead into our discussion,

427
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:28,750
you know, focus more back on kind of policy aspects of this. Are there any questions about any of the material presented?

428
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:32,440
All right, fair enough. Let's go ahead and do our usual five minute break.

429
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:40,240
Take a breather and then I'll invite our discussants to come up and get themselves set up here at the front of the classroom.

430
00:54:40,240 --> 00:57:49,370
Let's reconvene at right at two o'clock. And that's really something that.

431
00:57:49,370 --> 00:59:12,830
Year. You know.

432
00:59:12,830 --> 00:59:39,790
I mean that. I'd like to.

433
00:59:39,790 --> 00:59:49,090
I have no idea that lesbians, so I'm going to to London.

434
00:59:49,090 --> 01:00:02,880
Sort of box, it's a little but.

435
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:08,910
Every care she throws her baby.

436
01:00:08,910 --> 01:00:15,780
Oh, yeah, she was like, Oh, I don't do it.

437
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:25,740
Oh yeah, because at the time, people to be after the previous labor, so that's why we live in the house.

438
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:29,850
Yeah. What are your thoughts? Oh, it was just like, I don't know.

439
01:00:29,850 --> 01:00:37,810
I just don't know how you can just log in them.

440
01:00:37,810 --> 01:00:45,980
Wherever you go, my dear KG shared it with me if it's a presentation and it was really easy on a good drive.

441
01:00:45,980 --> 01:00:55,270
Oh yeah, oh yeah, it's so great.

442
01:00:55,270 --> 01:01:06,370
Public health in its own right is crazy because of the professionalism as a defender, but we didn't.

443
01:01:06,370 --> 01:01:11,800
There it is. I do anything which is probably right. Yeah, that's there.

444
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:15,160
And then, yeah, I was just driving that across.

445
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:27,850
And of course, it's ugly, but it should work on the subject, which was so fun that I drove to Detroit from there.

446
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:33,760
Yeah, that was fun. I get like three do a presentation.

447
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:42,310
Yeah. Where is I know you're going to read? I like you guys for this, you know, like an auto, correct?

448
01:01:42,310 --> 01:01:49,540
Yeah. Yes, it is.

449
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:54,830
Yeah, I haven't seen it for the next one gallon for this one.

450
01:01:54,830 --> 01:02:13,300
Yeah, I think so. I hope so. Oh, and then you know, and I'm talking about.

451
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:21,310
I think it's a little bit different. It's not like you can.

452
01:02:21,310 --> 01:02:42,740
Typekit playing for before. Yeah, yeah.

453
01:02:42,740 --> 01:02:58,300
So. We do.

454
01:02:58,300 --> 01:03:03,240
Oh, thank you.

455
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:11,770
Yeah, I mean, it's all right, it's OK to do something.

456
01:03:11,770 --> 01:03:21,520
What do you mean? Like, you know, put the Japanese aside. Yeah, I'm getting bit a year in China.

457
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:27,430
OK, yeah. Probably concerned that younger people are going to play games.

458
01:03:27,430 --> 01:03:35,510
And they think they want to know what it is, but I've heard it before.

459
01:03:35,510 --> 01:03:46,460
I think it was the perfect situation because it was.

460
01:03:46,460 --> 01:03:52,970
What if I don't know? Yeah, I probably dropped out of the episode already,

461
01:03:52,970 --> 01:03:58,400
so we're going to get started then obviously we're going to be presenting on the Kyoto and Montreal Protocol,

462
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:03,530
kind of focusing more on the policy now that we have a bit of the more of the scientific background from earlier.

463
01:04:03,530 --> 01:04:06,710
Before we get started, though, I want to give a brief aside about language,

464
01:04:06,710 --> 01:04:11,870
considering that climate change policies and discussions started in the 1970s.

465
01:04:11,870 --> 01:04:16,190
There's been a lot of changes in the way that we use terminology, especially around countries.

466
01:04:16,190 --> 01:04:21,740
So I listen the ones that are kind of common here high-income country, liberal and calm,

467
01:04:21,740 --> 01:04:27,560
developed or developing want to recognize that these are different connotations and the way we use them throughout time has changed.

468
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:34,100
And so we should be critical of the way they're used, but we'll be using them somewhat interchangeably in this space.

469
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:42,440
But we wanted something that that just to give a quick background on the history behind both the

470
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:49,760
Kyoto and the Montreal Protocol is so in green that's kind of Kyoto Protocol related and in blue,

471
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:56,000
as the Montreal Protocol related. But a lot of this all started in the 70s and 80s,

472
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:03,020
and it was a bit of a more quicker quick turnaround for the Montreal Protocol with the discovery of the out of the hole in the ozone layer.

473
01:05:03,020 --> 01:05:12,890
In 1985, the Montreal Protocol being an issue or being in action by 1989 and then the Clean Air Act

474
01:05:12,890 --> 01:05:22,220
amendments for stratospheric ozone protection are also in effect by 1990 and in 1972,

475
01:05:22,220 --> 01:05:31,460
we have the first UN Environmental Conference Conference and then another important meeting the Earth Summit with the Climate Change Convention,

476
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:38,420
and by 1997, the Kyoto Protocol was signed.

477
01:05:38,420 --> 01:05:43,400
So now looking into the 2010s,

478
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:55,070
we have the first Kyoto cop commitment period with the mandatory reporting that was covered in the previous presentation that was in 2012,

479
01:05:55,070 --> 01:05:57,910
which was to actually put there on that front.

480
01:05:57,910 --> 01:06:10,340
Mandate might be on there for that, but by 2012 it was the end of the Kyoto Protocol and in 2015 we have the Paris Climate Treaty being signed.

481
01:06:10,340 --> 01:06:13,040
And in 2016, we'll talk about this new detail.

482
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:27,350
Later, there's the prickly amendment and further stepwise actions into the Montreal Protocol and COP26 in.

483
01:06:27,350 --> 01:06:36,800
So, yeah, we have a. Yeah. So we have a brief video, just a little bit more of like background on like who the IPCC?

484
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:42,100
That's enough CES is. And then, you know, just generally, oh, there's no sound product.

485
01:06:42,100 --> 01:06:48,380
Give me a second. That's none of it. No, I was worried about sound.

486
01:06:48,380 --> 01:07:06,830
Oh, I see it. That kind of stuff.

487
01:07:06,830 --> 01:09:01,640
Well. And appropriate.

488
01:09:01,640 --> 01:12:04,880
And. And.

489
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:10,550
OK, so that's kind of when they start to go off into the wrong thing, but covers a little bit of what we talked about earlier,

490
01:12:10,550 --> 01:12:18,230
as well as starts to introduce some of the things that have changed recently and the importance of international cooperation.

491
01:12:18,230 --> 01:12:24,920
So here's a little bit more background that was covered in the previous class, but just to solidify it.

492
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:32,450
So ozone depleting substances of interest are categorized into Class one or Class two for Class one.

493
01:12:32,450 --> 01:12:36,740
These have a depletion potential of point zero point two or Highers.

494
01:12:36,740 --> 01:12:42,830
They're more dangerous, and for a class two, it's less than 0.2.

495
01:12:42,830 --> 01:12:49,880
And later, we'll talk about the Kigali Amendment, which included HFCs, which they're non.

496
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:56,970
They don't deplete the ozone, but they do pose harm, and those are right now also being phased out.

497
01:12:56,970 --> 01:13:02,750
So there's also the ozone hole, which was discovered in 1980,

498
01:13:02,750 --> 01:13:12,680
and it's not as much a whole as it is a thinning layer and generally located over Antarctica between August and October.

499
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:21,410
And there's a lot of influence by temperature shifts in atmosphere, atmospheric dynamics, but it has the photos you see of it.

500
01:13:21,410 --> 01:13:26,270
There's a stark change that is anthropogenic.

501
01:13:26,270 --> 01:13:35,240
So but we do expect to make a full recovery in the coming decades due to efforts that are resulting from the Montreal Protocol,

502
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:44,240
which, as has been stated a couple of times now, is an international agreement to regulate ozone depleting substances or odors.

503
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:55,730
So there's a lot of strength to it, as you can see, but largely it has been successful at slowing and reversing the Odia Odiase in the atmosphere,

504
01:13:55,730 --> 01:14:02,480
and it's reduced a cumulative a CO2 equivalent emissions by one hundred and thirty five billion tons.

505
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:07,430
It is the only U.N. environmental agreement to be ratified by all U.N. members,

506
01:14:07,430 --> 01:14:15,350
and we expect to return to pre eighties by mid 21st century, and you just have to see what that looks like.

507
01:14:15,350 --> 01:14:20,540
This is in 1979. This is in 2008 with the ozone hole.

508
01:14:20,540 --> 01:14:24,500
So you're pretty great if we can get back to that.

509
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:31,070
So generally, the largest weakness I could find is there is difficulty in monitoring implementation.

510
01:14:31,070 --> 01:14:38,660
With that said, each country does have like reporting and monitoring,

511
01:14:38,660 --> 01:14:47,210
but they they have to report all the data they've collected, as well as show that they've been doing something.

512
01:14:47,210 --> 01:14:58,010
So generally, why the success? It does include a limited scope of companies or doesn't have requirements for a limit of the scope of companies,

513
01:14:58,010 --> 01:15:07,790
meaning it's generally did not have like a whole to require complete economic transformation for each respective country.

514
01:15:07,790 --> 01:15:16,490
And it is a limited number of chemicals, but we can learn from this maybe taking a sectoral approach to climate change.

515
01:15:16,490 --> 01:15:26,780
And they do have this multilateral fund, which is money from developed countries helping to fund developing countries like Turkey,

516
01:15:26,780 --> 01:15:39,410
like in implementing technology that will allow them to meet the goals in the Montreal Protocol, which has been largely successful as well.

517
01:15:39,410 --> 01:15:49,310
So this is the photo we've seen already. So the Kyoto Protocol is also something we've talked about a lot this class.

518
01:15:49,310 --> 01:15:53,360
And one of the key distinctions between the mantra on the Kyoto Protocol is that

519
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:56,900
if better protocols were focused on limiting the number of greenhouse gases,

520
01:15:56,900 --> 01:16:00,500
the amount of greenhouse gases total not specifically focused on one.

521
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:05,510
For example, carbon dioxide. And it was part of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.

522
01:16:05,510 --> 01:16:12,350
We've obviously talked about quite a bit in this class. And so some of the mainstream are that I can't speak.

523
01:16:12,350 --> 01:16:16,550
It holds the developed countries accountable because based on research,

524
01:16:16,550 --> 01:16:22,520
it is pretty clear that a lot of these developed countries are big contributors to their emissions of the atmosphere.

525
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:27,740
And a specific quote from this convention is differentiated responsibility,

526
01:16:27,740 --> 01:16:34,580
which is tailored to the respective capabilities of each country, which means that each country has its own abilities,

527
01:16:34,580 --> 01:16:38,390
and this program can be tailored to fit the needs and the policies and just the

528
01:16:38,390 --> 01:16:43,190
structure of each country so that they can all do what's best for them and other good.

529
01:16:43,190 --> 01:16:47,660
I can't speak. Another good one is that their focus on global greenhouse gases, like I said,

530
01:16:47,660 --> 01:16:53,600
there's obviously gases like methane, hydrofluorocarbons and oxide and so many more.

531
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:58,160
And so it's good because it's more all encompassing, but it has a quite a few weaknesses,

532
01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:03,020
and one is that only countries that join are obligated to meet those requirements and joining.

533
01:17:03,020 --> 01:17:09,950
It's voluntary, which means that country, for example, countries I don't think they can meet the requirements, just won't join in the first place.

534
01:17:09,950 --> 01:17:15,380
And so India and China are two examples. They're both developing countries and so they're not included because they're not developed.

535
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:19,520
But they also have some of the biggest emissions in the world, but they haven't joined.

536
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:23,120
And then it bundles everything into this one big framework to catch all.

537
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:31,790
But it would be much more effective if they broke it down into four different sectors and different countries and individual greenhouse gases.

538
01:17:31,790 --> 01:17:43,690
So creating strategies specifically reduce carbon dioxide or methane and so on.

539
01:17:43,690 --> 01:17:48,990
The name is when. This one.

540
01:17:48,990 --> 01:17:53,070
And so there are quite a few reasons that it didn't succeed, but one, as we've mentioned,

541
01:17:53,070 --> 01:18:00,510
is excluding developing countries because those have some of the biggest and fastest growing economies and as a result have a lot of emissions.

542
01:18:00,510 --> 01:18:05,190
And there's not necessarily enough strict guidelines because they wanted to make it flexible for everybody.

543
01:18:05,190 --> 01:18:09,720
But that makes it difficult because the countries themselves have to decide how to self-regulate.

544
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:13,590
But having stricter guidelines could help reduce the emissions much faster.

545
01:18:13,590 --> 01:18:20,250
And another quote from the convention was It doesn't matter where emissions are reduced, it just as long as they remove the atmosphere.

546
01:18:20,250 --> 01:18:24,000
So that doesn't necessarily put the burden on each country specifically.

547
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:28,230
And, you know, because the global atmosphere, no one person has a claim to that.

548
01:18:28,230 --> 01:18:36,000
So just kind of a little bit putting it on to other countries and not taking full accountability is also an issue with that strategy.

549
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:44,920
And so in total, the structure was inherently flawed, and at the time it was a very novel and very helpful resource,

550
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:48,990
some way to eliminate carbon for all greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

551
01:18:48,990 --> 01:18:53,760
But there are better things we can do in the future and a lot of things we can learn from it.

552
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:59,040
So one of the main things is that you need more clear goals and financial incentives

553
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:03,780
to ensure that these companies and our countries will actually reduce the emissions.

554
01:19:03,780 --> 01:19:09,990
They put the atmosphere and work to abate them and then using smaller, more specific goals will also help by saying,

555
01:19:09,990 --> 01:19:16,380
OK, like maybe have you lowered the PM by whatever amount as opposed to just saying just eliminate greenhouse gases?

556
01:19:16,380 --> 01:19:20,970
And so by measuring these smaller action items,

557
01:19:20,970 --> 01:19:26,880
it'll be a lot easier to see what's beneficial and what's not and then make changes as needed to better promote those.

558
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:36,450
But if you're just looking at the end goal of reduce greenhouse gases, it's a little hard to keep track of what's happening there.

559
01:19:36,450 --> 01:19:41,430
So the Paris Agreement is the most recent climate agreement internationally.

560
01:19:41,430 --> 01:19:47,850
The US joint under President Obama in 2016 and then soon after they left with the agreement,

561
01:19:47,850 --> 01:19:55,200
or President Trump announced that there is an agreement in 2017. But he actually couldn't leave until 2020 after the election.

562
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:59,400
So then the reluctant 2020 and then we were just back at it in January.

563
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:11,820
So, yeah, the goal of this agreement is to limit global warming by two degrees Celsius past the pre-industrial period,

564
01:20:11,820 --> 01:20:15,990
while also pursuing efforts to keep it below one and a half degrees Celsius.

565
01:20:15,990 --> 01:20:24,540
And it is good to know that we've already reached one point one to one point two degrees Celsius more.

566
01:20:24,540 --> 01:20:30,990
So in this agreement, countries can join the agreement. It's not a legally binding agreement like the Kyoto Protocol was.

567
01:20:30,990 --> 01:20:35,940
So in the Kyoto Protocol, you were given course that you had to reach as a country.

568
01:20:35,940 --> 01:20:41,640
And then if you didn't reach those goals by the time you have to report, then you were fined or face some other penalty.

569
01:20:41,640 --> 01:20:50,130
And the Paris Agreement doesn't have that. Countries can make their own plans to reduce emissions and hold themselves to that.

570
01:20:50,130 --> 01:20:57,150
There is still reporting requirements, but it's not legally binding so they can report what they have.

571
01:20:57,150 --> 01:21:03,660
It's kind of designed to have a kind of peer pressure, like all the countries have signed on to this.

572
01:21:03,660 --> 01:21:10,050
So you should meet your goals because we're all in this together is kind of the philosophy behind the Paris Agreement.

573
01:21:10,050 --> 01:21:21,000
It is different from the other ones. Um, so countries, can they make their own goals and then they update their goals every five years to be stronger.

574
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:25,140
So it's like set forth an initial set of goals and then five years later,

575
01:21:25,140 --> 01:21:37,570
they're going to revisit the goal and see how much of an effect they had and then make stronger goals to cut emissions further.

576
01:21:37,570 --> 01:21:46,540
So this also is similar to the Kyoto Protocol concluded funding for financial support to lower income countries,

577
01:21:46,540 --> 01:21:53,260
partially to help them reduce emissions themselves, but also to deal with some of the effects that they're already experiencing due to climate change.

578
01:21:53,260 --> 01:22:03,580
Since, as we kind of know, a lot of developing areas, poor areas experience a disproportionate effect on climate change.

579
01:22:03,580 --> 01:22:11,230
And then another big strength for this agreement was that almost every country in the world signed, so it was like one hundred ninety five countries,

580
01:22:11,230 --> 01:22:17,440
which I think depending on who you ask, there's like a hundred and ninety six countries, maybe a couple more.

581
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:26,290
But 195 countries joined the agreement, which is a huge strength because it only kind of works if everyone is on board.

582
01:22:26,290 --> 01:22:33,850
But a major weakness of this is that a lot of the parts of the Paris Agreement were not finalized after their first meeting.

583
01:22:33,850 --> 01:22:39,370
So there are a lot of loose ends that they had to tie up, and that was also made the proposal, especially in the US,

584
01:22:39,370 --> 01:22:46,570
when President Trump kind of left the agreement, didn't want to talk about it and rolled back a bunch of regulations, set it back a little bit.

585
01:22:46,570 --> 01:22:54,280
And also, as I mentioned, their initial commitments only restricted warming to about two point nine degrees Celsius,

586
01:22:54,280 --> 01:23:01,330
which is kind of catastrophic and definitely very far from where you want to be.

587
01:23:01,330 --> 01:23:06,790
So then COP26 is kind of the logical follow up to the Paris Agreement.

588
01:23:06,790 --> 01:23:11,770
It's the most recent council parties meeting that happened at the end of 2021.

589
01:23:11,770 --> 01:23:17,740
And the goal of this meeting was to keep 1.5 degree Celsius alive.

590
01:23:17,740 --> 01:23:21,670
So some strength of this meeting,

591
01:23:21,670 --> 01:23:25,900
where they finalized a lot of the outside item from the Paris Agreement and a lot

592
01:23:25,900 --> 01:23:31,210
of the commitments that the countries made and updated were a lot closer to 1.5°C.

593
01:23:31,210 --> 01:23:35,440
They were between like depending on the estimates of like point eight.

594
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:42,610
If everyone follows through to like two point three degrees Celsius, so close, they're really not there yet.

595
01:23:42,610 --> 01:23:47,170
One of the major weaknesses was there was a last minute failure to phase out coal,

596
01:23:47,170 --> 01:23:52,990
which was the major goal of this convention because coal is like the dirtiest fossil fuel.

597
01:23:52,990 --> 01:23:59,620
So phasing that out would have had a large impact. But last minute India,

598
01:23:59,620 --> 01:24:06,520
I think it was decided that they didn't want to agree to that in the way the agreement works is that

599
01:24:06,520 --> 01:24:12,550
everyone has to agree to something because everyone has to be in it or else it's not going to work.

600
01:24:12,550 --> 01:24:17,410
So that was a big failure of that conference.

601
01:24:17,410 --> 01:24:20,650
And then, as was mentioned from the Paris Agreement,

602
01:24:20,650 --> 01:24:29,260
wealthier countries were supposed to put forth like $100 billion to support low income countries in their projects,

603
01:24:29,260 --> 01:24:37,480
and they did not follow through on that after the Paris Agreement, and they still didn't make any moves to follow through on that during COP26.

604
01:24:37,480 --> 01:24:43,990
So that was another major failure. Awesome.

605
01:24:43,990 --> 01:24:47,020
So a little bit more about recent happenings and where are we now?

606
01:24:47,020 --> 01:24:54,280
We already talked a little bit about 2021, but just where Montreal Protocol and Kyoto Protocol are in recent years.

607
01:24:54,280 --> 01:24:58,630
So both have had amendments in recent years. We'll start with the Montreal Protocol.

608
01:24:58,630 --> 01:25:06,040
So I had the Kigali amendments that was from Rwanda, that was from 2019.

609
01:25:06,040 --> 01:25:11,170
And so I continue to limit HFCs, which were already cooling products, as we talked about earlier,

610
01:25:11,170 --> 01:25:17,440
like refrigerants as ACS, things like that pass by at least 80 percent.

611
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:23,800
And so that is one way that the amendments are continuing to be added to the Montreal Protocol for the Kyoto Protocol.

612
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:28,030
Even though we have talked about how it's less successful than the Montreal Protocol.

613
01:25:28,030 --> 01:25:32,140
It is still in existence. It hasn't entirely been retired yet.

614
01:25:32,140 --> 01:25:37,510
And so one way that it is still in existence is through the Doha amendments. So that's out of Doha, Qatar,

615
01:25:37,510 --> 01:25:47,530
and that was the periods are always kind of funky because there's they get seven years where they get to sign on as signatories onto this amendment.

616
01:25:47,530 --> 01:25:51,250
And so the last country to sign on was Nigeria.

617
01:25:51,250 --> 01:25:58,120
And then they got like 90 days to get this into occurrence. And so it started out in October 20, 2020.

618
01:25:58,120 --> 01:26:03,190
And so the goal for this was to reduce greenhouse gases, as we've spoken about before.

619
01:26:03,190 --> 01:26:05,200
They don't differentiate between greenhouse gases.

620
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:14,120
They just say it in total by at least 18 percent by at least 80 percent below 1990 levels from 2013 to 2020.

621
01:26:14,120 --> 01:26:19,270
So that's kind of the period in which they were able to sign on and figure out what their plan was going to be.

622
01:26:19,270 --> 01:26:27,910
The Doha amendment also included some other pieces, along with having this at least 18 percent reduction in greenhouse emissions.

623
01:26:27,910 --> 01:26:29,710
And so they have free market mechanisms.

624
01:26:29,710 --> 01:26:37,450
So a few different ways they could differentiate how they could reduce emissions, how countries could name how that was going to work for them.

625
01:26:37,450 --> 01:26:44,890
And then a lot of these amendments or a lot of these protocols and a lot of these agreements start to kind of mixing with each other.

626
01:26:44,890 --> 01:26:50,830
They're all in existence at the same time. So it's sometimes hard to differentiate how they're going to differ for each country.

627
01:26:50,830 --> 01:26:56,230
And so for the Kyoto Protocol, for the Doha amendment does not supersede the Paris Agreement.

628
01:26:56,230 --> 01:27:01,030
But as we were talking about earlier, it's specifically supposed to be geared towards industrialized nations.

629
01:27:01,030 --> 01:27:06,190
And so it just requires earlier emission reductions among developed developed countries.

630
01:27:06,190 --> 01:27:11,980
And then this map is kind of similar to the one that Professor Tim showed earlier,

631
01:27:11,980 --> 01:27:18,760
where it just shows Annex B. So those industrialized nations, which when signed on with binding parties, which ones didn't?

632
01:27:18,760 --> 01:27:23,680
So everyone in blue is kind of like, we're not industrialized nations. We didn't colonize anyone.

633
01:27:23,680 --> 01:27:34,510
It's not about us. The ones that are in purple are ones that we're finding in the first period, but not the second Canada stepped out early.

634
01:27:34,510 --> 01:27:38,530
We're kind of just like signatory is not doing anything.

635
01:27:38,530 --> 01:27:44,200
And then those in green are those who actually picked up binding targets on for the next year.

636
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:48,700
And then ones in red are just like people trying to get their act together or who are not relevant.

637
01:27:48,700 --> 01:27:55,090
So South Sudan, who've recently come out of the Civil War, the Vatican City, you know, Palestine,

638
01:27:55,090 --> 01:27:59,560
who they don't really have choices right now anyway in the U.N. and then in Andorra,

639
01:27:59,560 --> 01:28:05,260
which I don't know if any of us know that much about it or in the first place.

640
01:28:05,260 --> 01:28:10,780
Next going, and we wanted to talk a bit more specifically about the role of the United States in the Paris Agreement,

641
01:28:10,780 --> 01:28:15,040
since this is something that was pretty big here for a long time.

642
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:24,460
As we've spoken about earlier, we rejoin the Paris Agreement in 2020 and 2021 was what I saw you with Biden's first executive order.

643
01:28:24,460 --> 01:28:31,420
And that was kind of like a big deal for him was like, we really need to immediately rejoin the Paris Agreement after being pulled out by Trump.

644
01:28:31,420 --> 01:28:35,770
And part of the reason why it is so significant that the United States pulled out of the Paris Agreement

645
01:28:35,770 --> 01:28:42,470
and that we removed ourselves from climate change talks on a global scale is because we are in history,

646
01:28:42,470 --> 01:28:44,590
the the largest carbon polluter.

647
01:28:44,590 --> 01:28:55,390
So this graph shows the United States from 1850 to 2014 the amount of carbon that was being released, or it's specifically about CO2.

648
01:28:55,390 --> 01:29:00,100
And then on the same axes, you see it for the EU, as well as other countries.

649
01:29:00,100 --> 01:29:04,360
And you can compare how the United States we might be less than China now.

650
01:29:04,360 --> 01:29:11,180
But if you look at in the long run, we still have had some of the largest carbon pollution out of any country.

651
01:29:11,180 --> 01:29:17,410
So not only considering right now those snapshots that we were talking about earlier, but over time as well.

652
01:29:17,410 --> 01:29:23,290
So considering how much of a presence and how much of the carbon pollution is from the United States,

653
01:29:23,290 --> 01:29:31,030
the fact that we removed ourselves from these talks has significant policy implications for the United States and international spaces.

654
01:29:31,030 --> 01:29:34,990
And so this could have drastic consequences for U.S. perceptions abroad.

655
01:29:34,990 --> 01:29:42,700
And we can go in more discussion questions later about how the United States can continue to gain back legitimacy and climate change talks,

656
01:29:42,700 --> 01:29:48,160
how we're able to recover when it comes to making sure we stay caught up in the ways that we're holding ourselves

657
01:29:48,160 --> 01:29:58,640
responsible for climate change and then ways that we can also continue to be leaders in international talks.

658
01:29:58,640 --> 01:30:04,190
So summarizing some of the policy implications, this is almost directly word for word from one of the readings this week,

659
01:30:04,190 --> 01:30:07,700
but I think it is a good way to kind of sum up where we've been and the way

660
01:30:07,700 --> 01:30:12,230
that we can understand the importance of climate change international policy.

661
01:30:12,230 --> 01:30:16,280
So first off, we always have to recognize that things are a global problem.

662
01:30:16,280 --> 01:30:22,190
We recognize the ozone depletion was a global problem and that it needed an international response.

663
01:30:22,190 --> 01:30:26,720
Next, we believe in scientific understanding. We didn't question the science.

664
01:30:26,720 --> 01:30:33,440
We knew that if so many scientists were able to come together and were able to form a cohesive argument towards policymakers,

665
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:39,080
we need to believe them and do something about it. That's the importance of public concern and perception.

666
01:30:39,080 --> 01:30:43,250
We talked about this earlier about the role that the public has in making sure that

667
01:30:43,250 --> 01:30:47,960
policies are taken up into the public's concern about the hole in the ozone layer,

668
01:30:47,960 --> 01:30:54,590
as well as health effects, really got people moving and got an international sports response in the works.

669
01:30:54,590 --> 01:31:01,460
And then lastly, this availability of acceptable substitutes. So is there something that's still or are we not drastically hurting our economies?

670
01:31:01,460 --> 01:31:05,870
Is there something we can put in place instead? That is going to be a good substitute?

671
01:31:05,870 --> 01:31:11,630
And I think that we can use this same model in the same sort of understanding for a lot of different other

672
01:31:11,630 --> 01:31:17,810
ways that we go about climate change policy and the ways that we respond both internationally and nationally.

673
01:31:17,810 --> 01:31:24,270
So I was thinking about this and in regards to solar power, how would we use solar power as an example in the same sort of equation?

674
01:31:24,270 --> 01:31:29,060
That's just one possibility, but that's enough of that.

675
01:31:29,060 --> 01:31:34,970
We're going to move on to a coworker who's so seeing if everyone was awake while we were doing all of this.

676
01:31:34,970 --> 01:31:46,790
I know terrifying. Log in.

677
01:31:46,790 --> 01:31:55,240
Yeah, if you have a lot to do with it, it's it's one or the one.

678
01:31:55,240 --> 01:32:01,140
Yes, exactly. I guess I think it's important.

679
01:32:01,140 --> 01:32:09,530
Oh yes, or oh, sorry, I just immediately. No, don't work that.

680
01:32:09,530 --> 01:32:26,960
I was just not going to happen. Why are you doing this, you're going to do something about this?

681
01:32:26,960 --> 01:32:44,650
Oh yeah, we can do. Yeah, I think we can do about the same. Maybe not just given this.

682
01:32:44,650 --> 01:33:03,780
I mean, you could just open up the screen and.

683
01:33:03,780 --> 01:33:21,880
Way of. You know, I think this is.

684
01:33:21,880 --> 01:33:31,730
The music. And everyone hear the music very important.

685
01:33:31,730 --> 01:33:42,000
I know that's a. Relevant.

686
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:48,480
Yes, what do you like mother bestowed on me like sad baby seals or is the entirety of both?

687
01:33:48,480 --> 01:34:27,300
I think it's. OK, because everyone was.

688
01:34:27,300 --> 01:34:36,180
Oh, oh, oh oh. Did the Montreal or Kyoto Protocol come first?

689
01:34:36,180 --> 01:34:42,570
Good job, guys. The Montreal Protocol came first.

690
01:34:42,570 --> 01:35:03,270
All right, next question. With protocols focused on protecting the Ozone specifically.

691
01:35:03,270 --> 01:35:26,010
Good job of the Montreal Protocol. So where is the ozone hole located?

692
01:35:26,010 --> 01:35:36,090
People start to think about where Antarctica and where the Arctic. OK.

693
01:35:36,090 --> 01:35:40,090
Over Antarctica. Good job growth over the North Pole, isn't it? Yes.

694
01:35:40,090 --> 01:35:45,060
And the Arctic is in the north. Well, it like ships yearly, but it's predominantly over.

695
01:35:45,060 --> 01:36:00,710
Antarctica is a question. Which protocol focused on a wider scale greenhouse gas emissions?

696
01:36:00,710 --> 01:36:06,220
We talk about drugs. Oh, they're.

697
01:36:06,220 --> 01:36:22,370
Good job, guys. The Kyoto Protocol. Sad polar bear has the highest answer streak of for the jockstrap, sad polar bear.

698
01:36:22,370 --> 01:36:27,050
So do you think maybe shorten it, do you think the Paris group will be more successful in the Kyoto Protocol,

699
01:36:27,050 --> 01:36:31,160
limiting emissions and slowing climate change? This is more of a pull. Yeah.

700
01:36:31,160 --> 01:36:40,030
Talk about your answers, Dr. Sorry, I shouldn't forget it.

701
01:36:40,030 --> 01:36:48,950
I didn't think about the word. I don't know if I'm going to forget about it.

702
01:36:48,950 --> 01:36:55,130
So we're not super optimistic on the Paris agreement.

703
01:36:55,130 --> 01:37:00,460
Does anyone want to share like, do they have thoughts about it? Strong opinions go ahead.

704
01:37:00,460 --> 01:37:02,740
I'm just going. It's like a lot of it.

705
01:37:02,740 --> 01:37:08,960
It's just it's not like finding out like there's the it's just kind of like guidelines like it doesn't put me like,

706
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:14,610
you know, enforcement like restrictions, penalties on like any country.

707
01:37:14,610 --> 01:37:18,290
And so it's just like it's like countries and like, sign on to it.

708
01:37:18,290 --> 01:37:26,530
But then like, it has no weight and. It did not hold countries accountable for their emissions.

709
01:37:26,530 --> 01:37:32,870
For tax. Yeah, just kind of bear in the previous comment, like, I mean,

710
01:37:32,870 --> 01:37:39,830
what can be done of these kind of large forms is only like it is reflective of what's politically feasible of each individual countries.

711
01:37:39,830 --> 01:37:43,670
And like I think if developed countries shows the natural light skin in the game,

712
01:37:43,670 --> 01:37:48,110
like technology transfers or dropping specific patterns and stuff like that,

713
01:37:48,110 --> 01:37:54,470
then maybe that would signal to developing countries that they're actually more serious and then they have to kind of reinforce the pain.

714
01:37:54,470 --> 01:37:59,900
But I don't think it's politically feasible for individual countries to do that.

715
01:37:59,900 --> 01:38:06,900
So the wider any kind of large conference would be kind of hindered by that.

716
01:38:06,900 --> 01:38:12,740
But I also said no, but I think an interesting part about the Paris Agreement is how much it's been

717
01:38:12,740 --> 01:38:17,840
brought into the public consciousness and how like when the U.S. pulled out in 2017,

718
01:38:17,840 --> 01:38:24,200
how there was like a lot of like outrage about that, which I don't know if the same could be said for the Kyoto Protocol.

719
01:38:24,200 --> 01:38:29,180
But I do think that there's a lot of things that the Paris Agreement could improve on.

720
01:38:29,180 --> 01:38:37,040
But I think that it's real and like the public consciousness and like the awareness of it is

721
01:38:37,040 --> 01:38:42,140
definitely like a plus that hasn't really been seen in some other like international agreements,

722
01:38:42,140 --> 01:38:51,310
at least in like the late persons you. Yeah, so since I spent a lot of time reading about the Paris Agreement,

723
01:38:51,310 --> 01:38:56,380
I was like maybe a little more optimistic just because like we saw with the Kyoto Protocol,

724
01:38:56,380 --> 01:39:00,670
that making things legally binding doesn't always mean people are going to do it

725
01:39:00,670 --> 01:39:06,010
necessarily like if they joined it and they thought they would meet the requirements,

726
01:39:06,010 --> 01:39:09,920
they could just drop out. That's kind of how international law is anyway.

727
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:16,930
Like you kind of like countries can subscribe to the rules they want to and then ignore the rest because there's no enforce that.

728
01:39:16,930 --> 01:39:24,340
But I also think like kind of what we were saying, like the context is different with the Paris Agreement than it was with the Kyoto Protocol,

729
01:39:24,340 --> 01:39:31,520
because when the Kyoto Protocol was signed, like climate change was just like off in the distance, it was OK.

730
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:35,830
In the future. We were like, we have so much time to address that. So it's fine.

731
01:39:35,830 --> 01:39:41,230
But now we're like, OK, we could actually see like the severe weather events that are like crashing our cities

732
01:39:41,230 --> 01:39:45,550
and like the droughts and the famine that are all happening because of climate change.

733
01:39:45,550 --> 01:39:53,320
So I'm like, I guess that's mild, yes. But like, I think it has been more successful.

734
01:39:53,320 --> 01:39:57,040
So I'm also more optimistic because I like reading in depth about it.

735
01:39:57,040 --> 01:40:00,500
So we have one more question like this.

736
01:40:00,500 --> 01:40:09,840
Excuse me, what else comments? I'll move on.

737
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:36,990
Last question, yeah. Do you think personal changes in behavior or consumption are necessary part of combating climate change?

738
01:40:36,990 --> 01:40:47,910
OK. I would personally agree with that, but I don't know if anyone wants to comment on anything first about why they chose the answer they did.

739
01:40:47,910 --> 01:40:53,910
I feel personal behavior or consumption can influence a just general public perception,

740
01:40:53,910 --> 01:40:57,750
because if if there's a general public perception that this is an issue and people

741
01:40:57,750 --> 01:41:01,680
need to have a look at individual responsibility to make changes in their own life,

742
01:41:01,680 --> 01:41:08,490
like we've learned about it, we know just based on experience that public pressure can lead toward policy changes.

743
01:41:08,490 --> 01:41:12,240
And without that public pressure and public perception being in favor of it,

744
01:41:12,240 --> 01:41:19,170
it's a lot harder to get politicians and policies to prioritize this issue.

745
01:41:19,170 --> 01:41:29,700
Definitely. I also said yes just because like for similar reasons like I can kind of like influence trends towards

746
01:41:29,700 --> 01:41:37,530
cleaner energy where it might be more like our animals to be grass fed or organic in that sense.

747
01:41:37,530 --> 01:41:47,340
But like I, I have a hard time, yes or no, just because of like the necessary like, yeah, I think it's necessary.

748
01:41:47,340 --> 01:41:55,140
But like, do I think it makes that much of the difference compared to like large companies or like the entire country differences?

749
01:41:55,140 --> 01:42:00,830
No. Yeah, I suppose there's a third answer.

750
01:42:00,830 --> 01:42:05,870
Like all the above, but also maybe the sense of like I mean,

751
01:42:05,870 --> 01:42:10,730
so obviously like people want to change a personal like personal behavior and consumption,

752
01:42:10,730 --> 01:42:16,220
but also climate change will also change personal behavior and consumption as I like.

753
01:42:16,220 --> 01:42:20,570
Maybe coffee won't be. But then that we can buy anymore. It's all like stuff like that.

754
01:42:20,570 --> 01:42:27,320
Whereas climate change will also dictate what is changed and it becomes this weird pattern of people's behavior change.

755
01:42:27,320 --> 01:42:32,960
Those changes climate change, the climate changes in our behavior and like I'm very pessimistic of like the

756
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:36,800
extent the actual personal behaviors will do anything for climate change.

757
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:43,250
But. Say, I agree with what everyone is saying, where it's kind of like a yes,

758
01:42:43,250 --> 01:42:50,630
but I think that part of the issue and like focusing on like personal changes like

759
01:42:50,630 --> 01:42:56,060
behavior consumption is that especially in terms of like just food consumption,

760
01:42:56,060 --> 01:43:02,450
like it's very like I like the word or phrase for like class based and which like,

761
01:43:02,450 --> 01:43:11,390
yes, if we all thought organic and we'd all be grass fed beef and whatever, like, yes, that would like change the markets,

762
01:43:11,390 --> 01:43:17,710
but like how many people can afford to do that consistently, that it would create that sort of like system of change?

763
01:43:17,710 --> 01:43:20,120
And the answer is not a lot of people.

764
01:43:20,120 --> 01:43:31,450
So I mean, especially when it comes to food, I think that's like a very difficult answer to give like a definitive yes or no.

765
01:43:31,450 --> 01:43:36,760
I think that applies like a actress down to is like a developed country,

766
01:43:36,760 --> 01:43:42,650
we have the resources to make decisions that will overall decrease our carpet,

767
01:43:42,650 --> 01:43:50,530
but we have already seen recently management and that's not a luxury a lot of other countries have.

768
01:43:50,530 --> 01:43:57,310
So I suggest and no, because as individuals and as countries, we have decisions about, you know, what we purchase, what we demand,

769
01:43:57,310 --> 01:44:08,980
we want to be all right because if it goes or how the industries and the corporations that respond to our

770
01:44:08,980 --> 01:44:17,680
demands that they make make decisions that affect them in a way and also fulfill our need for reducing carbon.

771
01:44:17,680 --> 01:44:27,340
So obviously, the decision is one we all made individually, but it's not something that we can consciously choose.

772
01:44:27,340 --> 01:44:31,550
For a while, it was. Yeah.

773
01:44:31,550 --> 01:44:36,890
Me personally, something I face, I don't know how many of you guys are from like the Kerry Town area,

774
01:44:36,890 --> 01:44:43,960
but in Kerry John, which is the neighborhood of Ann Arbor, there's a grocery store right near my house called Sparrow Market, and it has all local,

775
01:44:43,960 --> 01:44:48,350
all sourced everything, you know, all the things you want in our shop.

776
01:44:48,350 --> 01:44:57,050
And that's a five minute walk from my house. But there's a Maya and I'd have way more options there and it's way cheaper, but I have to drive there.

777
01:44:57,050 --> 01:45:01,580
So it's kind of a tradeoff of what difference do I want to be making?

778
01:45:01,580 --> 01:45:07,610
And it's sometimes hard, you know, I can't necessarily afford to spend five dollars on a carton of eggs every time, you know.

779
01:45:07,610 --> 01:45:17,630
And so I think it's hard to because being environmentally responsible is difficult because it requires you to have a decent amount of money,

780
01:45:17,630 --> 01:45:23,390
like things like buying more energy efficient cars or cars that are battery powered,

781
01:45:23,390 --> 01:45:28,070
buying the nicer foods that are locally sourced and just living that kind of lifestyle

782
01:45:28,070 --> 01:45:32,990
is very difficult and more than you can actually expect people to be able to do.

783
01:45:32,990 --> 01:45:42,260
And yeah, maybe in the wide scale of things companies are of a giant Typekit responsible for all the emissions,

784
01:45:42,260 --> 01:45:45,830
but you also want to have you want to make the difference yourself to.

785
01:45:45,830 --> 01:45:50,420
I feel like you want to feel like you're doing your part to slow and stop climate change, but it's sometimes hard.

786
01:45:50,420 --> 01:45:54,610
So I feel like that's another aspect of that. Yeah, I agree.

787
01:45:54,610 --> 01:45:56,780
Like the yes and no thing I lean more towards.

788
01:45:56,780 --> 01:46:02,720
No, just because I'm like, I think a lot of it has to do with like fossil fuels and like where we're getting our energy from.

789
01:46:02,720 --> 01:46:11,210
Like, I can't change that. I need electricity to like function as a human in society, like I can't change how it produces energy.

790
01:46:11,210 --> 01:46:13,760
I just have to pay the energy bill every month.

791
01:46:13,760 --> 01:46:21,290
So it's like in that way, since we know that energy production is like the main cause of like emissions,

792
01:46:21,290 --> 01:46:28,790
you can't really make a personal choice to change that unless you're like super rich and you can just like live off in a forest somewhere and like,

793
01:46:28,790 --> 01:46:38,090
be self-sustaining. But like, that's not the reality for most people. You have like a few more discussion questions.

794
01:46:38,090 --> 01:46:44,460
Yeah, they're getting close to five minutes. Yeah, we have a few additional ones so we can see what folks want to talk about.

795
01:46:44,460 --> 01:46:49,820
And if they don't want to talk this, you know, we keep doing that right?

796
01:46:49,820 --> 01:46:58,100
Yeah, OK. Yeah. So we can talk about these until, I guess, for the next three minutes, which is fine.

797
01:46:58,100 --> 01:47:02,120
It's a bit more specific about what the United States and policy in regard to that.

798
01:47:02,120 --> 01:47:07,040
So starting off, the United States made a huge blunder when we left the Paris climate agreement.

799
01:47:07,040 --> 01:47:15,740
What is a credible return to climate change leadership look like?

800
01:47:15,740 --> 01:47:21,660
I think just about the only thing they're getting any kind of faith in the global stage would be to reduce our emissions and

801
01:47:21,660 --> 01:47:26,870
then be an example because we're anything short of that talk and they know that we can just change everything for years,

802
01:47:26,870 --> 01:47:36,040
give or take. So I think that's just doing things is the one I could possibly help.

803
01:47:36,040 --> 01:47:43,720
Yeah, I think that's a great point. It also ties into kind of like this last question of should the US like have

804
01:47:43,720 --> 01:47:48,340
like should U.S. policy be so much on the whims of individual presidencies?

805
01:47:48,340 --> 01:47:53,320
Should we have better insulated like emissions protocols or things like that that can't

806
01:47:53,320 --> 01:47:58,420
be changed based on us based off of the political leanings of our current leaders?

807
01:47:58,420 --> 01:48:05,110
So I kind of encourage folks think if we could change the way we consider climate change protocols,

808
01:48:05,110 --> 01:48:20,520
what would be the best way to make sure that it's not something that can be changed so easily?

809
01:48:20,520 --> 01:48:22,640
Great question.

810
01:48:22,640 --> 01:48:31,190
I could say, like I said, just like thinking about the mechanisms by which we make policy like instead of having it be an executive order,

811
01:48:31,190 --> 01:48:41,060
whim or something like that, but go through like the legislative process and get the support in the House and the Senate to make it an actual law.

812
01:48:41,060 --> 01:48:45,560
We're like, I don't know if you can do that through litigation or something.

813
01:48:45,560 --> 01:48:50,480
But there, like other parts other than executive orders.

814
01:48:50,480 --> 01:48:56,450
I think two of those are even though I was just thinking like an idea could be like maybe it's more of like a bureaucratic

815
01:48:56,450 --> 01:49:04,190
change and like giving federal agencies more teeth and like building drop the standards or keeping them around longer.

816
01:49:04,190 --> 01:49:07,190
Like, I know that that's also like a big issue.

817
01:49:07,190 --> 01:49:16,350
Maybe like litigation was like this seemed like a route that's like trying to in terms of like standing for long periods of time.

818
01:49:16,350 --> 01:49:25,410
Know, I know we have like, you know, that's. I think we only have one minute and I'm like, I know what, it's 250 I want to leave.

819
01:49:25,410 --> 01:49:29,210
So thank you all for your considerations.

820
01:49:29,210 --> 01:49:35,180
I think it's also important to consider like what levels on this on like the state level we can do because I mean,

821
01:49:35,180 --> 01:49:40,220
even the rules that we have around climate change here in Michigan differ from the ones in Massachusetts,

822
01:49:40,220 --> 01:49:44,210
which differ from the ones in Illinois and things like that. So considering, you know,

823
01:49:44,210 --> 01:49:53,720
like what comes on the docket and how you want to still be conscious in regards to climate change in policy on our own scales?

824
01:49:53,720 --> 01:50:10,060
Thank you very much. Thanks so much. As your around, you know, I know that I think you were meant to be sorry for this, for admits for the sign,

825
01:50:10,060 --> 01:50:19,070
the geopolitics that have exploded across the world and how that, you know, directly, did you know anything about it?

826
01:50:19,070 --> 01:50:23,820
The was illustrative of the American leader that I think might have been reserved

827
01:50:23,820 --> 01:50:28,270
for their president was because I think he might be the one who was there.

828
01:50:28,270 --> 01:50:32,890
Like, We have some real connection.

829
01:50:32,890 --> 01:50:38,610
I suppose to me, I feel like that's the opposite of what I wanted to do.

830
01:50:38,610 --> 01:50:42,602
I think it would be fair to say, you know, like a of.
