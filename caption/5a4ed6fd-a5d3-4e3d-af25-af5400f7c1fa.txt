1
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:07,500
That's my natural roots. Yeah, that's.

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:24,620
That's something that's going good for the first couple.

3
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:33,360
Okay. Welcome back, everybody. Any questions?

4
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:40,650
Issues with the exam or the paper record?

5
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,930
Um. See, we're kind of in the home stretch here. They really have like three or four.

6
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:50,370
This might be the fourth, and then we have three more lectures.

7
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:57,840
So things will be a little bit more on the applied side as opposed to the mechanistic toxicology side from here on out.

8
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:03,240
Pretty sure. So kind of how we take what we've learned so far and apply it to various scenarios.

9
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,720
So today we're going to talk about air pollution.

10
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:15,430
Does anybody in here have experience like modeling air pollution or doing any work like sort of related to air pollution?

11
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:21,629
Before I get started. Well, okay, I've got a little bit that's not my focus, but, um,

12
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:28,560
I've done a little bit maybe talk about it as we get into the lecture, but it's a really fascinating area of research.

13
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,530
Again, not my specialty, but there's a lot of really important stuff covered here.

14
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:39,809
So, yeah, so air pollution, toxicology just running into it.

15
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:46,860
So first off, this is probably not coming as too much of a surprise, but air pollution is a global problem.

16
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:51,180
You know, we have you know, you could probably name just about any country in the world.

17
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,660
There's probably some degree of like air pollution issues going on.

18
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:03,650
So just as an example, you know, kind have like from Delhi, India, this like air pollution headline air improves to very poor.

19
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:09,570
So that's an improvement to very poor air quality in Delhi lately.

20
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:15,780
And this is air quality index likely to drop further this week so you know, that's in India.

21
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:21,570
And then here of course in the United States, we've had our own issues with air quality over the years,

22
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,160
and we'll talk about that a little bit throughout this lecture.

23
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:34,560
And there is like sort of a dynamics here where you can see kind of maybe more so than compared to other types of pollution that we talk about,

24
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:42,689
where the levels of pollutants have like changed in response to legislation that's been passed.

25
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:48,509
Like you can kind of point to certain years where we, you know, after this legislation is passed,

26
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:53,190
we see this drop off in certain toxic pollutants, concentrations in the air.

27
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,700
And then you can see kind of unfortunately,

28
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:03,810
like recently there's like this bounce back so that U.S. air quality gets gotten worse after years of improvement and it's killing more people,

29
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:07,379
which so, you know, on one hand,

30
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:17,370
this like this ability to actually see certain responses like actual improvement in certain areas is really nice to be able to see it.

31
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:23,640
Not something we can always see with all types of pollutants that seem a lot more kind of intractable in some ways.

32
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:30,540
But we also, you know, this this headline sort of highlights it's this ongoing issue that we're like, you know,

33
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:35,940
as certain regulations might get rolled back, we might see some of this these air pollutants kind of pop back up again.

34
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:41,430
So it's a very active and dynamic field of study.

35
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:52,760
So. Yeah. And so this goes back to, you know, as you might imagine, this goes back to like industrialization.

36
00:03:52,840 --> 00:04:01,030
And really, England was kind of a hot spot for a lot of these issues early on in like the mid to late 1800s,

37
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:08,980
you could see a picture here of like, you know, all these factories spewing smoke into the environment in England, you know,

38
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:15,580
was like this smog killing, you know, hundreds of people in one week in 1873.

39
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,020
And so this was a real issue.

40
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:24,370
And with the advent of, like, industrialization, you're starting to see these air pollution issues becoming more and more of an issue.

41
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:34,680
And here's an excerpt. It is like a description of what it was like to live with the stuff around us, like London fog is brown,

42
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:45,209
reddish yellow, greenish darkens, white fog produces one thick and choking sensation instead of diminishing.

43
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:47,910
While the sun rises, it often increases intensity.

44
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:55,800
Sometimes the brown masses rise of interpose a thick curtain at a considerable elevation between earth and sky.

45
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:02,460
A white cloth spread out on the ground rapidly turns dirty, and particles attach themselves to every exposed object.

46
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:08,969
So you can just imagine it's a very like descriptive description of like living with this,

47
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:12,660
like really bad air pollution, which sounds very unpleasant.

48
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,909
And this like continued up through the like the fifties, right?

49
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:23,040
Or type of 1500s. Now we're up into the fifties or there's like this really bad great smog.

50
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:35,430
And as that occurred in 1952, we're over like now we're talking about thousands of people died in a few days between 12 five and 12 nine in 1952.

51
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:42,810
And this inspired the Clean Air Act of England's Clean Air Act that was passed in 1956.

52
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:49,740
So this is where we're starting to see people looking at the effects of this air pollution and responding to it with this,

53
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:55,160
like these different types of legislation. Any questions or thoughts so far?

54
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:05,500
Cool. And then, of course, in the U.S., we have a problem and did have a problem with air pollution up through and still continuing today.

55
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:12,140
But it was particularly bad in like the 1970s. Some pictures here like New York City with pretty bad air pollution, etc.

56
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:16,000
You can see this like haze across the skyline here.

57
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:22,370
And like, you know, this is in Cleveland, Ohio, like areas with a lot of like industrialization, a lot of, you know,

58
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:30,170
industrial capacity are producing a lot of air pollution, releasing various things from factories and plants into the air.

59
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:40,000
When we're talking about air pollution, we need to talk about probably the worst,

60
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:46,840
probably the worst industrial disaster in history, which is the Bhopal disaster.

61
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:59,080
Has anyone heard the Bhopal disaster? So this was a factory in India that was operated by a U.S. company called Union Carbide.

62
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:06,400
And this happened in 1984. And so there's this Union Carbide which sense has been acquired by Dow.

63
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:11,770
But this had this plant in Bhopal that was manufacturing pesticides.

64
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,280
But Bhopal, India, established in 1969, around 1979,

65
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:24,700
they began production and storage of a chemical called Methyl Assassinate or M.S., which is a very toxic chemical.

66
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:32,450
On December 2nd, 1984, somehow water was introduced into the MRE tanks,

67
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:40,750
which caused an explosion and a huge release of the muscle ice or cyanide into the surrounding area and into the city of Bhopal.

68
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:49,700
In India, like 40 tons of mice were released into the air, drifted it downwind into the city.

69
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:57,139
And so this is like this really horrific accident and is really kind of the quintessential it's got all

70
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:02,750
of the elements that we talk about in environmental health in terms of like there's occupational safety,

71
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:06,920
occupational justice issues. I don't think they ever really, as far as I know,

72
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:14,870
figured out exactly what happened to cause this explosion or how this water was introduced into the tanks.

73
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:21,019
But, you know, it's what is known is that there was a lot of safety issues with this plant.

74
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:24,169
A lot of the workers were talking about how they felt unsafe working at this

75
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:29,300
plant and that there was a lot of sort of this corporate negligence going on.

76
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:33,889
So one of these like themes that, you know, kind of this classic, classic theme, you know,

77
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:39,440
that you see in like Hollywood movies and things like that kind of is sort of exemplified in real life here.

78
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:42,470
And there is a lot of politics and money.

79
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:50,260
You know, you can imagine the types of politics involved with a private company that was based in the United States operating in India.

80
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:57,500
So you've got the United States and the Indian government both kind of negotiating and figuring out what to do to help the victims of this.

81
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:02,569
So just a lot of money, politics, corporate negligence involved.

82
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:10,940
You know, it just has all of these hallmarks that fire a lot of us to get into the field of like public health and environmental health of it.

83
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:17,960
Activists to this day are working on getting people compensated in some way for what happens with this disaster.

84
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:23,700
So again, just to give you a sense of how bad this was.

85
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:28,769
There are almost a million residents in Bhopal and we're talking about, you know,

86
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:34,170
most of them, like almost 600,000, were thought to be affected by this gas leak in some way.

87
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:37,950
And we're talking about at least like 5000 deaths.

88
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:45,480
Some estimates put that at much higher, like 15 to as much as 50,000 people deaths attributed to the release of this.

89
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:49,739
I see. And I see is colorless.

90
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:57,300
It's heavier than air. It has a lot of toxic effects that we can see here, like starting around 0.4 parts per million.

91
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,900
You know, things like coughing, chest pain, breathing, pain, asthma.

92
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,820
That's bad enough, right?

93
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:13,620
And then at higher, higher concentrations, really severe impacts on the lungs, emphysema, pneumonia and death, high rates of neonatal mortality.

94
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:21,780
And we've seen with survivors, they have these like lifelong respiratory ocular effects and even like psychological effects,

95
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:27,630
which I'm going to link to a podcast that talks about this disaster in the the page for this,

96
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:36,420
which talks about how one particular like activist who is facing like basically, you know, psychological issues because his whole family died.

97
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,920
He was like a boy, 13 years old, woke up and found his whole family dead.

98
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:45,210
So it's just this really horrific accident that really highlights a lot of the

99
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:49,950
issues that we're covering in this class in terms of like environmental health,

100
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:53,190
occupational justice, environmental justice, etc.

101
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:56,420
So. Any questions?

102
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:07,850
Okay. So that's kind of the, um, you know, a disaster, an acute like event that happened.

103
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:12,050
We, of course, are facing day to day, you know,

104
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:21,830
air pollution that just is around as part of the normal environment that we live in, in like an industrial industrialized society.

105
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:27,010
So, for example, like China's, there's a headline from China, you know,

106
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:37,160
where the China's former health minister is estimating 300000 to 500000 Chinese people dying prematurely because of the air pollution being so bad.

107
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:45,200
So that's just. Kind of just I mean, just an unthinkable number of premature deaths.

108
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:54,940
You know, and that's only in this one country, right? Coming back to the United States.

109
00:11:55,690 --> 00:12:00,970
The EPA has this set of criteria, air pollutants.

110
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:06,579
So the Clean Air Act, which we'll talk a little bit more about that in a couple of different slides coming up.

111
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:11,830
But the Clean Air Act requires EPA to set national ambient air quality standards

112
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:16,360
for and a cure for six common air pollutants that are called the criteria,

113
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:21,750
air pollutants that are found basically all over the U.S. and can harm your health.

114
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:30,160
So these are ozone particulate matter, carbon monoxide, blood, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide.

115
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:41,000
And you can see with. So now we'll talk a little bit about the legislation that the United States passed addressing these air quality issues.

116
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:47,160
So in 1965, we actually began regulating air pollution with from motor vehicles.

117
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:50,580
So it was like 1965 with the Motor Vehicle Control Act.

118
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,320
And then you follow that.

119
00:12:52,710 --> 00:13:00,290
The Clean Air Act sort of followed that up in 1970 and expanded this to, like industrial sources of air pollution, not just cars.

120
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:08,960
Right. In the nineties, there was a lot of ish, a lot of concern about acidified rain and ozone depletion.

121
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:13,580
And so there was an amendment that was passed to try to address that as well.

122
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,790
So you can see on this graph here, the since 1990,

123
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:26,840
since like those big pieces of legislation were passed, you could see this is basically the standard.

124
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:31,700
This line is basically showing like the national standard for these air pollutants.

125
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:36,980
And you can see that a lot of the chemicals were on average, like higher in the environment.

126
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:46,700
And then after you passed this legislation, you did see a pretty regular like steady drop off of these concentrations of these pollutants in the air.

127
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:54,379
And so, for example, like carbon monoxide went down by like 77% because it got led out of gasoline.

128
00:13:54,380 --> 00:14:00,650
Right. 99 dropped by like 99%, just like huge drop offs for some of these 54%.

129
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:06,559
Ozone down 22%. Particulate matter, 40 around 40%.

130
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:12,710
So like pretty big like significant reductions in the levels of these pollutants in the air.

131
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:16,730
What, though, passed after the passing of this legislation?

132
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:25,610
And you can kind of see this on some of these graphs we put together just visually.

133
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:29,740
So like the red, red is always meeting that on most of these graphs, right?

134
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:36,489
With this like high levels of sulfates like in the air. This is just focusing on kind of the eastern United States.

135
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:42,850
But you can see in 1989, like how high this was compared to 2004.

136
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:51,790
You know, relatively quite a bit lower. Right. And again, let's get another pollutant.

137
00:14:52,840 --> 00:15:00,970
And oh three, 1989, you see a lot less red, a lot less dark red after the passing of these acts.

138
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:05,090
But, you know,

139
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:16,110
we still have quite a bit of instances where areas of the country are have like higher levels than what the standard is for some of these criteria,

140
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:23,909
air pollutants. So you can see on this legend here, these are like counties that are called like not attainment,

141
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:27,780
meaning they have like higher concentrations of these pollutants in the air.

142
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:38,219
Um, in this case, like Greenwood Main there in non attainment for one of the criteria air pollutants with the orange being like five of the criteria.

143
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:44,879
Air pollutants are out of compliance basically. And so you could see like various parts of the country you're seeing like, you know,

144
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:51,540
one to 2 to 3 of these air pollutants are like spiking up past the set sort of standard.

145
00:15:52,710 --> 00:16:01,800
I believe this is the county continuing. A so this is like, you know, you have like all five, four, not all five, but five of the six are high.

146
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:08,610
So again, it's this ongoing struggle basically to keep the air clean, basically.

147
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:19,560
This is a nice figure that EPA likes to point to.

148
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:28,300
And what we're tracking here is changes in multiple things between 1990 and, you know, in this case, 2010.

149
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:39,230
And essentially what we're looking at here is the emissions of these like criteria pollutants over time going down over this time period.

150
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:43,040
But a lot of factors that we typically think of.

151
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:49,519
You know, the argument that some people make is that we need to release these pollutants into

152
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:54,229
the environment in order to have a healthy economy that you're going to have,

153
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:59,510
you know, people are going to lose jobs, is going to be basically a really bad negative impact on the economy.

154
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:06,890
But if you compare the levels of these pollutants to the gross domestic product, one measure of how well the economy is doing,

155
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:11,480
that's actually gone up in that time and it's actually basically like opposite direction.

156
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:19,670
So this is one way to make the argument back that EPA or others might say, you know, these are not intrinsically linked things.

157
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:26,180
The economy and the releasing of these pollutants are not things that have to track each other in the same direction.

158
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:32,870
But you have other things as well that we sometimes talk about like that we think are intrinsically linked to some of these pollutants,

159
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:38,840
like we might say, whole population. As we increase the population, we're just naturally going to get more pollution.

160
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:47,690
But that's, you know, based on this graph, not really the case where you see pollution or sorry population going up with pollution going down.

161
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:52,310
And even something like energy consumption, as you know, mapped,

162
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:59,690
plotted on here is basically having an upward trend as these pollutants are going down in the environment.

163
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,580
So this is one way that that, you know,

164
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:09,129
one argument back to the idea that we have to release these pollutants in order to have a healthy economy or have a healthy populace,

165
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:14,510
steady growing population, etc. So any questions so far?

166
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:18,510
Comments. Thoughts? Like in so far.

167
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:22,019
Yeah. I'm curious. Do you like him too?

168
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:25,380
And PM10. Cover other pollutants. Like what?

169
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:31,620
Like if there's a plume not listed, would they be in a particle form that that would catch?

170
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:37,880
Yeah, we'll talk about that. Yeah. PM 2.5. The pigeons are like they're kind of like mixtures, right?

171
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:41,700
They're like complicated sets of different types of particles.

172
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:48,120
So yeah, you're, you're probably catching a lot of different stuff and PM 2.5 for what area of the

173
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,660
country might not be the same set of chemicals that you're getting in another area.

174
00:18:52,080 --> 00:19:00,950
So. Which makes things interesting but very challenging in terms of trying to understand health effects.

175
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:05,420
Right. Okay.

176
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:14,739
Any other thoughts or questions? Comments? Yeah. I think this might get to your next figure, but I'm curious, like GDP has grown a lot in this time,

177
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:18,880
but we've also probably started doing less manufacturing here.

178
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:21,310
So to what extent are we just exporting the problem?

179
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:30,030
That isn't really in case anyone didn't hear you saying this kind of this time frame that we're talking about where GDP has been growing,

180
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:33,250
we've also been like offshoring, a lot of manufacturing.

181
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:36,880
Are we moving the problem to another country?

182
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,410
That's a really, really good point. And I've seen arguments on both sides of that.

183
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:52,000
The consensus that, again, not really my field of expertise per se, but the it seems like even accounting for that,

184
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:59,770
some of the ways of cleaning up and doing things in a cleaner way are, you know, even accounting for the offshoring that we've done.

185
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:04,030
Air quality has improved, but I think that's a really good point.

186
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:09,520
And some people do research into this of like moving pollution into other countries.

187
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:13,240
What are we you know, are we just kind of pushing the problem off to someone else?

188
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:16,960
That's a really good point. And thank you for raising that.

189
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:22,190
Yeah. Any thoughts from that? Have you read any any studies about that?

190
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:25,690
Like, I've seen a few, but I haven't really dug into the literature too much.

191
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:29,809
Not a ton, especially not in public health,

192
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:40,730
but taking a political ecology class that talks a lot about this kind of general like exporting environmental harms to other countries.

193
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:46,550
See, I don't know a lot about it, but I think it is. That's a problem.

194
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:53,959
Yeah, it's a it's a really, really good point. And yeah, like I said, I've kind of seen like both arguments, you know, that again,

195
00:20:53,960 --> 00:21:01,820
that we've introduced certain methods of like cleaning process or filtering emissions and things like that, scrubbers and things like that.

196
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:06,649
But then I've also seen people, I've seen presentation or seen, I should say,

197
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:10,880
like advertisements for presentations of researchers talking about this as an issue of,

198
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:15,240
you know, are we just, again, like offshoring the problem to somewhat someone else?

199
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:19,750
Yeah. And well, you can see here.

200
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:27,860
You know, we talked about in the one health. The one health course of the eco tax lecture.

201
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:33,140
Um, or maybe somewhere else. Anyway, let's talk about how, you know, for some of these types of research,

202
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:39,590
we like that we are able to take a global perspective as opposed to some other types.

203
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,270
So with air pollution, you know,

204
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:49,190
we can like look at like satellite derived PRM data and you could see these like hotspots globally for high levels of PM 2.5.

205
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:54,370
Um, yeah. So, you know, you can just see like that there are certain areas, you know,

206
00:21:54,390 --> 00:22:00,680
China being a big one off like a lot of PM 2.5, you know, and we talked about their air pollution issues over there.

207
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:09,930
Another thing that we can talk about is indoor air pollution.

208
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:19,560
So indoor air pollution is actually a really big killer in a lot of the developed what we call the developing world.

209
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:26,040
So this is pollution that that arises from heating and cooking within a home.

210
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:31,709
Right. So like burning certain types of fuels and things in the home that an individual's living

211
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:37,650
in the home or breathing in this like burning material and leading to bad health outcomes.

212
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:45,270
And so you could see how the estimated amount of deaths, you know, in certain areas of the globe are like really high.

213
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:52,470
And so there's a lot of researchers doing work in terms of like how do we provide interventions to bring this number down?

214
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:56,280
Different cooking practices or different sort of cooking instruments?

215
00:22:56,910 --> 00:23:04,049
Different ways. And I've seen a number of different presentations on, you know, different studies introducing again,

216
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:10,470
like different cooking devices, for example, or different sources of fuel that could help to address this issue.

217
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:15,809
So it's also an issue locally as well.

218
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:20,790
So we have indoor air pollution in like a typical home you might see in the United States.

219
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:26,070
And there's a lot of sources of potential air pollution that could end up in the home.

220
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:33,990
And looking at a slide like this always makes me like think about what I'm doing in my house that I could like bringing some of these things down.

221
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:39,180
But we could walk through some of these, like chemicals released for like building materials.

222
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:47,840
There's a lot of building materials that like off gas, certain chemicals like volatile organic compounds that are not that are, you know, toxicants.

223
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:55,770
Anytime that is new, I've been in this field long enough that I've been in two different departments of public health.

224
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:56,790
They got new carpeting.

225
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:03,180
And we always like whenever that happens, we go around making jokes about all the chemicals that are probably off gassing from the new carpeting.

226
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:09,989
So like building materials. One thing is allergens that we don't talk about a ton in this class,

227
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:17,700
but like animals can release dander, things that can exacerbate of allergies and asthma and things.

228
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:25,050
Cleaning products can be toxic, can release like toxic fumes, particulate matter again from cooking.

229
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:28,380
So it's important to have, like, good ventilation by where you're cooking.

230
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:32,170
Um. Let's see.

231
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:38,320
Paint solvents, outdoor air pollutions can make their way into the home mold and bacteria in the air.

232
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:43,080
So, like, really wet environments, like the bathroom, you know?

233
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:50,500
You know, like, there's not good ventilation and there's a lot of moisture in the air. Cigaret smoke, of course, and fumes from the garage.

234
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:58,180
So these are all things that could lead to, uh, you know, contribute to air pollutants in the home as opposed to just outside.

235
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:08,020
Uh, I actually took, this is, I don't know if this is just a funny story or this is instruction, instruction instructional in any way.

236
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:14,499
But the American Lung Association does these trainings that they offer for free,

237
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:21,580
where you can learn how to basically run down a checklist and go through sources of potential air pollution inside someone's home.

238
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:29,040
And they do these like free like screenings that people can set up if they're concerned about air pollution within the home.

239
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:36,010
I took a class to learn how to do this, which was really instructive and really helpful, but the first.

240
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:39,339
And so then they started like giving me assignments to go out and do this like

241
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:43,629
checklist and like coordinate with people that like help improve their air quality.

242
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:45,220
So the first one I went to, though,

243
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:54,610
I show up to this guy's apartment and there was some kind of miscommunication where I thought I was just going to go through my whole checklist.

244
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:59,640
My, I knew all this new stuff with like to look for like, is there, you know,

245
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:04,629
are your cleaning products stored in the proper place or not or all sorts of things?

246
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:11,020
And I got there and it turned out all he wanted was someone to get his landlord to fix the flood damage in

247
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:17,310
his bathroom because he was just like this apartment across from me flooded at some point and I know it.

248
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:24,520
I can see this is all like going to be mold soon. It's probably releasing mold, but right now I just need someone to help me with this.

249
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:28,389
It's basically like, I don't care about your checklist. Like, I know this is bad.

250
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:33,010
So it was kind of this, like, humbling experience of like, okay, some of these problems have to be, like,

251
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:37,299
thought about like maybe with a bigger scope or like a different lens,

252
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:41,680
rather than me just walking in with my list of things to go through his house with them.

253
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:50,110
So that was instructive and interesting that these problems can have like multiple types of causes in some cases, right?

254
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:58,240
And how like socioeconomic class legal factors can sort of intertwine with things like air quality in the home.

255
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,320
So I don't know either a funny story or informative.

256
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,729
I'll let you guys decide. Okay.

257
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:11,080
So these are the criteria, air pollutants from the EPA just listed out here.

258
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:24,520
And yeah, the other thing with air pollution, you know, we haven't maybe talked a ton about the this mixtures issue in this class so far, but yeah.

259
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:27,050
Air pollution, you know, there's multiple things in the air.

260
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:35,170
So we're dealing with a complex mixture, a complex a complex exposure that, you know, all of us in this room are exposed to.

261
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:42,070
It's not just one chemical, of course. And so this makes doing like toxicology studies in the traditional way that we like to do them.

262
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,800
Pretty challenging, right?

263
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:52,960
I like to have one chemical that I take into my lab and treat my cells or my tissues with and measure some kind of response.

264
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:59,980
But which which of these even just taking these six is the one that's causing some kind of health effect that I'm interested in?

265
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:06,519
I don't necessarily know. Right. And then we have other stuff, too, beyond just the criteria, air pollutants.

266
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:11,319
We have also organic compounds, products of incomplete combustion, and then again,

267
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:18,400
allergens, mold or cockroach antigen, things that can also trigger bad health effects.

268
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:29,980
This is showing particulate matter and just giving you a sense of the size scale that we're working with here.

269
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:39,280
So PM10 is is any particle of ten micrometers in diameter or lower?

270
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:45,010
And so you could see some comparative like sizes of different structures and things like molecules.

271
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:56,110
Viruses would be here about 0.1 micrometer bacteria, ten fold bigger red blood cells, and then like a typical cell in the body up to about that size.

272
00:28:56,590 --> 00:29:03,790
The PM 2.5 is around here at lower. Um, so yeah, so we can talk about things like different things.

273
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:08,500
This could all end up as particles of these sizes could all end up in there.

274
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:13,870
So like you have your coarse fraction, which is like this, uh, between ten and 2.5,

275
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:21,160
this might be things like dust or, um, endotoxin, pollen, uh, fungi, debris or fungi.

276
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:24,400
Certain metals can end up in particles of this size.

277
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:28,479
And you see an example of the variety of sources that could contribute to this.

278
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:36,129
So agriculture, road dust. Seaspray That's something that I typically think about as a source of PM, but things can come out of the,

279
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:45,850
you know, the sea suspension, air like grinding erosion and then let's see where we go next like PM 2.5.

280
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:56,320
Again, these can be things like organic or elemental carbon, um, hydrocarbons against the biological materials of sulfates and nitrates, the metals.

281
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:03,790
As well. And these can come from light combustion sources coal, oil, gas, wood,

282
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:09,640
and then your ultrafine particles, you know, again, like metals keep showing up.

283
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:17,050
This could be like from gases and we'll see like off gassing and automobile combustion emissions.

284
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:17,410
Right.

285
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:27,180
So different types, different sources, different behaviors of these chemicals, different like chemical constituents that make up these fractions.

286
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:35,290
Oh, yeah. And then just to show like this would be in terms of size, comparison of the pan and the width of a human hair.

287
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:39,630
So. Uh, anything else there?

288
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:45,460
Any questions or thoughts? Yeah.

289
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:50,570
And that's what I want to say here. Characterizing the constituents of particulate matter is challenging.

290
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:58,069
Okay. So. In terms of total personal exposure.

291
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:04,360
This is kind of just going outside that house, the cartoon that I show, the house where we could just, you know,

292
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:11,929
think about where sources of pollution might be and how they might end up interacting with us in our day to day lives.

293
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:19,070
So, like, you could have combustion out like, say, factories or plants and then combustion of like vehicles that may like coming from the plants.

294
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:25,250
All of that can be transported in the air through wind and then out walking in the park or something.

295
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:32,870
We're inhaling the products of that. We can also have like dumpsites or release a volatile ization from, you know,

296
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:36,620
areas where chemicals may have been stored or improperly stored, for example,

297
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:46,909
releasing of chemicals that can also reach into the groundwater, in some cases ending up in the water table and then come into our homes in that way.

298
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:53,540
And we do see I don't know if you've ever seen like a map of different contaminants in like drinking water throughout the United States.

299
00:31:53,570 --> 00:32:01,460
There's a lot of stuff, actually, that kind of ends up in our drinking water. Um, you know, mostly at pretty low levels, but more than we'd like.

300
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:10,530
Right? And so. Once a chemical is in the in the.

301
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:13,040
The water coming into the hole.

302
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:19,490
When someone's taking a shower, for example, you're getting things that can off gas from the water evaporate into the water you're heating.

303
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:24,230
Typically, people are taking showers at higher temperatures. There might be some steam going on.

304
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:28,520
So you have inhalation exposure that could come that way.

305
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:33,860
Um, so yeah, all kind of makes pretty intuitive sense, right?

306
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:44,780
So multiple factors can influence like our susceptibility to air pollution.

307
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:54,620
So this could be like preexisting cardiopulmonary disease. And we'll talk about how air pollution can impact cardiopulmonary health, genetic factors.

308
00:32:54,860 --> 00:33:00,349
There may be, you know, again, like genetic polymorphisms that leave people more susceptible age.

309
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:06,290
We also see people as they increase age, are becoming more likely to be impacted by high levels of air pollution.

310
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:10,250
There's some like gender differences we've seen are sexual differences.

311
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:22,309
We've seen obesity, uh, pregnancy in utero exposures and again, other health effects of health factors like diabetes.

312
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:27,800
Right. Which. And then.

313
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:34,580
Yeah. So then we also have we have susceptibility sort of, you know, once we're exposed to air pollution,

314
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:42,410
then we also have other things that might make us more vulnerable in terms of exposure, the initial exposure to air pollution.

315
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:50,120
So we can have, you know, individuals might be living closer to the source of the pollution and facing higher levels,

316
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,710
you know, because they live closer to the source.

317
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:58,820
This is where we get into a lot of the environmental justice issues where certain demographics and people,

318
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:02,930
you know, members of the population are facing like environmental racism,

319
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:15,200
where African-American individuals are more likely to be living closer to sources of air pollution, proximity to high volume, know traffic.

320
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:22,820
So, you know, pollution coming from cars. Occupational exposures, activity level can change.

321
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:31,220
We'll also we'll kind of talk about that. But, you know, as you're exercising, you might be taking in more basically air.

322
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:39,950
And also, there's differences in how certain types of chemicals will deposit within the airway based on the level of activity or exercise.

323
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:46,940
How well ventilated or not your building is. Geographic location.

324
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:54,410
Yeah. And like, again, like lower socioeconomic status can contribute to this, you know,

325
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:58,670
can make people more likely to be living in areas that have high air pollution.

326
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:10,700
So. So we're going to talk in maybe the next lecture, I believe, about risk assessment in a more detailed way.

327
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:19,520
But there is a framework that we think about when we're trying to understand the risk posed by air pollution.

328
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:25,410
And in kind of like general terms, we want to think about exposure.

329
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:32,750
So how is the chemical getting to from the source to the receptor being the person's exposed to the chemical?

330
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:39,979
And then once we know that exposure is occurring, we want to know how the receptor or the person is responding to the air pollution.

331
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:43,730
And this is like the risk assessment portion specifically.

332
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:52,759
And then once we know that there's some kind of risk, like, say, risk for cardiopulmonary impacts, that's when we get into the risk management stage.

333
00:35:52,760 --> 00:36:04,220
Right. And so just walking through this, again, we have we have exposure and we kind of talked about how we know exposure occurs in various contexts.

334
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:08,940
And then, you know, we want to run our basic dose response relationship.

335
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:11,849
So ideally, let's just say like ozone, for example,

336
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:16,919
we know people are exposed to a certain level of ozone and that we can conduct certain toxicology studies either with

337
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:26,940
cells or animals and see what the dose response relationship is between ozone exposure and and like lung effect,

338
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:34,290
lung impacts and lung injury. So we'll be and then we can ideally be able to compare the levels of ozone exposure that

339
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:40,440
individuals are facing to the dose that's causing some kind of toxic response in our models.

340
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:46,470
Right. And based on that, we can kind of characterize the risk posed by exposure to that ozone.

341
00:36:47,030 --> 00:37:00,930
I can say there's a one in 50,000 chance of developing, you know, lung cancer under this particular exposure scenario.

342
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:08,489
So once we know that that's already entering into the risk management phase, where a lot of different factors come into play.

343
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:17,940
So this is what we're talking about, like legal considerations, like is ozone within the EPA is like standard in terms of air quality.

344
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:23,910
Socio social, economic and political factors are always going to play a role.

345
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:32,790
Right. Um, you know, is the source of exposure coming from a particular plant operated by a company.

346
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:39,180
They're going to have a certain like stake in this whole process of what a level of release of this chemical into the environment,

347
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:46,030
uh, is going to be considered like. Like reasonable, for example.

348
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,900
That sort of makes sense. Yeah.

349
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:56,219
We'll talk about this a little bit more like risk assessment overall in the next lecture to see some different sort of side tracks here.

350
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:59,910
But I think we talked through most of the main points there.

351
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:04,210
Which right, I guess sorry.

352
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:09,150
I should say at the end, the idea is that at the end of this process, you're coming to some kind of risk management decision.

353
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:14,640
So like what's going to happen, you know, in terms of mitigating the health effects of this exposure?

354
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:22,950
So moving on from risk assessments, we can think about risk communication.

355
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:36,300
So the idea here is EPA has put together this scoring system to let us know what the air quality in our region might look like and.

356
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:43,810
They've shot they. Yeah. And so this scoring system is called the Air Quality Index or AQI.

357
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:51,549
It's fairly intuitive here. Right. So like good air quality is like labeled in green, giving a low numerical value.

358
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:54,550
And this is considered like really satisfactory air quality.

359
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:58,450
And the air pollution is posing little or no risk.

360
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:02,559
And then you get like more severe levels as you go up.

361
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:11,950
It's like darker the sort of like levels go up in terms of the darker color all the way up to like things like red or unhealthy,

362
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:18,520
where we might see everyone begin to experience health effects and then particularly

363
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:22,390
like members of certain sensitive groups might experience like serious health effects.

364
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:30,219
Right. So typically when we're thinking about this, we're thinking about particularly susceptible or sensitive individuals are being impacted first.

365
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:37,780
And then if it gets severe enough, it's like everyone might be facing some kind of health effect if you get up to like, say, hazardous levels.

366
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:41,950
So this is we're going to see like a warning of like don't go outside today kind of thing.

367
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:50,080
But think about this in the context of say like a big like a forest fire is somewhere in your region, for example.

368
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:56,200
What do we think about this way of communicating risk?

369
00:39:56,590 --> 00:40:04,200
Do you all think this is an effective sort of risk communication device or is there anything important like kind of being left out?

370
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:12,000
That's an honest question. I don't really have a. No strong answer about that.

371
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:17,520
I think that it would be good if they included some guidance on what to do.

372
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:24,569
I just I lived in Sacramento for several years and a couple of months out of the year,

373
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:29,700
it would be there'd be so much pollution from the fires in the Tahoe region that like it'd

374
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:34,679
be raining ash and we would get these notifications that if it's hazardous but it's like,

375
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:42,440
what does that mean? You have to leave your house and it's still getting into your house like you could still smell it in your house.

376
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:46,110
So it's just kind of like unnecessary panic without.

377
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:50,750
You're acting you like, what do you do about it? How can you protect yourself then?

378
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:52,820
That's a really good point.

379
00:40:52,970 --> 00:41:01,220
I think giving people some kind of an action to take is probably some really good principle to put into place whenever possible.

380
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:10,250
People want to feel. I think in general, I'm opining here, but I think in general, people want to feel empowered to do something, however small.

381
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:15,380
You know, in some cases, I think we probably saw that with like the coping, you know, these are the things you can do.

382
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:22,190
Yeah. Like, did they say anything about, like, air quality index is, like, here.

383
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:25,910
Very unhealthy. Wear a mask if you go out today or anything of that nature.

384
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:29,480
Yeah, I just told you it was bad. The air was bad today.

385
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:32,630
Yeah. Yeah, I think that's. Yeah, that's a really good one.

386
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:39,800
I think that kind of overlaps with like the Prop 65 thing where you're seeing all this stuff is bad for you.

387
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:45,350
But there's I have to get my coffee today or, you know, I have to eat something.

388
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:50,340
And if this is labeled, if everything's labeled carcinogenic or what have you, what do I do?

389
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:54,950
You know, there's just, like this practicality aspect that becomes really tricky with risk communication,

390
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:58,790
I think, you know, it's not an easy you know, it's a whole field of study.

391
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:06,590
It's not an easy thing to like. What may seem really intuitive to one person is not necessarily intuitive to a lot of other people, you know?

392
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:14,820
Any other thoughts? But sort of first thought was like, oh, this is pretty good.

393
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:17,640
You know, it's got this, like, kind of graded thing, you know?

394
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:24,300
I don't really honestly, I don't really know the entire science that goes into how they score this.

395
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:28,950
You know, one thing I might be wondering is what all types of chemicals are included.

396
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:33,090
And I'm sure there's an answer for that in like setting the score.

397
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:38,069
So if there's something that's like outside of that, could you potentially have like a really good score?

398
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:42,330
But like there's a high level of something else that isn't included in what they're, how they're calculating that.

399
00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:52,590
But yeah, I don't know. It's okay to me. Okay.

400
00:42:52,590 --> 00:43:00,150
So when we talk about susceptibility, this might be a helpful sort of graph to think about, right?

401
00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:05,129
So what we have here are we can think of the levels of biomarker.

402
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:08,760
So when we say like biomarker, we might be thinking about in terms of air pollution,

403
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:13,950
maybe some type of pro-inflammatory cytokines that gets released into the blood.

404
00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:23,790
So some type of immune response molecule that goes up when there's an indication of some type of like impending health event,

405
00:43:23,790 --> 00:43:26,940
maybe like say pro-inflammatory cytokines goes up,

406
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:34,139
you know, really high in proximity to someone having like say a heart attack for example,

407
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:37,260
is kind of hypothetical, but this is the general idea, right?

408
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:45,780
And so this is just basically tracking like the effect of the air pollution and then this is the exposure or dose of the air pollutant.

409
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:50,250
And so for a healthy individual, we're going to have one region where, you know,

410
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:54,180
you're exposed to a pollutant and your biomarker levels like taking up.

411
00:43:54,180 --> 00:44:01,050
But it's, you know, you're still bodies, still overall considered like in homeostasis, like nothing really bad per se is happening.

412
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:07,230
And then at some level of this dose, you're going to enter into this region here where it might be,

413
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:12,329
it might be indicative of some kind of injury, but not too serious.

414
00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:20,430
You could probably recover from it. Like if you're able to move away from this air pollution for a certain period of time, you're going to recover.

415
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:30,540
But you'll see like this level of this biomarker going up. And then when you get into this next category, though, is where, you know, you're again,

416
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:36,660
you're getting higher levels of this dose of an airplane and moving into the next category where there's some type of like clinical problem,

417
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:48,420
you know, you having like say, an asthma attack or, you know, some type of measurable health effect that like a doctor would diagnose right now if we.

418
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,210
So that would be for a healthy individual.

419
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:58,500
If we kind of can think about someone who has some underlying condition and may be more susceptible to air pollution,

420
00:44:59,010 --> 00:45:02,459
they may start at an already elevated level of that particular biomarker.

421
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:08,880
They have some kind of already existing health problem or injury to a tissue that leaves them more susceptible.

422
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:16,559
And so basically the whole curved, it shifted over. We're at lower levels where many people might be at home homeostasis.

423
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:24,030
You might be starting to see injurious or clinical effects in the susceptible individuals.

424
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:28,300
Right. So that's the idea of like and then yeah,

425
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:33,320
and you can go up to this like last category of like severe effect where you might be getting consolidate or something.

426
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:49,750
So this graph shows how basically how exercise or activity can change the way things are deposited in the lungs.

427
00:45:50,470 --> 00:45:56,380
So this is looking at some kind of insoluble particle, like a small 0.6 micrometer particle.

428
00:45:57,310 --> 00:46:00,880
And they were measuring lung deposition.

429
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:06,210
So let's see. So if we go to, like, the sedentary curve here.

430
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:16,090
So this is like percent lung deposition and then areas in the airway that where the particle is depositing.

431
00:46:16,510 --> 00:46:24,340
And so you can see most of this stuff is deposited in kind of in this tracheal bronchial area and not as much as going deep.

432
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:29,740
There's still a portion that's like going deep enough into like the lung alveoli and what have you.

433
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:36,159
Now, as we increase the levels of activity from low light, heavy up to maximal,

434
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:40,930
you're seeing like basically this curve shifts to where more of this stuff is depositing.

435
00:46:41,350 --> 00:46:42,489
Like a greater percentage.

436
00:46:42,490 --> 00:46:51,520
Like the area that is considered in the pulmonary part, like deep in the lungs is making up a greater percentage of the particles deposition.

437
00:46:54,150 --> 00:47:00,690
So activity can really affect, you know, someone being sedentary versus someone exercising really heavily.

438
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:06,780
And air pollution is going to drive the way some of these chemicals behave or particles behave in the body.

439
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:14,760
This is just like a rat data where they try to basically do the same experiment by like adjusting the levels of CO2.

440
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:19,050
It's not quite as. Interesting. But anyway.

441
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:27,100
So. Okay. Any questions? Questions?

442
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:30,880
Thoughts. Comments. Okay. So how do we.

443
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:35,710
Do you know? I talked about how it's, like, hard to.

444
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,700
Compared to other types of toxicology or the types of exposures,

445
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:48,189
it's kind of hard to model air pollution or at least we we have to we can use kind of different methods that are kind of cool in some ways.

446
00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:57,010
Like, for example, we can actually like run clinical trials in like testing chambers for humans where for example,

447
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:02,620
one person could be exercising in the normal air that they're exposed to throughout the day.

448
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:10,690
And another person can be exercising in a like super filtered like ventilated room, like a HEPA filter, ventilated room.

449
00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:18,070
And then you could compare certain biomarkers in their blood and see how this pure,

450
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:25,390
pure air environment impacts or changes certain like physiological responses.

451
00:48:25,510 --> 00:48:29,829
Right? So we can't really do that in a lot of cases in like the toxicology world,

452
00:48:29,830 --> 00:48:40,059
like I can't set up a clinical trial and give one set of people endocrine disrupting families and one set not because that's not ethical.

453
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:42,880
Right? An IAB board is like not going to approve that.

454
00:48:43,570 --> 00:48:49,870
But in this case, the you know, we can have individuals that are exposed to the air pollution that we know is already in the environment.

455
00:48:49,870 --> 00:48:54,609
And you're not really changing their, you know, their exposure, really,

456
00:48:54,610 --> 00:48:59,440
other than just having them come in and like ride an exercise bike for a while, for example.

457
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:06,430
So this is one of the kind of neat things we can do in terms of understanding how air pollution might be affecting people's health.

458
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,069
And you have like kind of cool stuff where you have like these.

459
00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:16,030
Like I think unless you have like a mobile lab where they go like drive around different parts of the state and, you know,

460
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:20,950
run a similar type of experiment but like in different parts because we know that air pollution,

461
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:27,010
like I said, the constituents of like the particles maybe different in one part of the state versus another.

462
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:36,910
Um, so that's kind of cool. We could do these like field studies when I was back to University of Washington.

463
00:49:37,330 --> 00:49:43,149
This isn't really an exposure per se, but, um, I was helping out some other researchers,

464
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:46,160
like, just put up like little these, like little air monitors in different parts,

465
00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:54,340
in different areas of Seattle that just like passively, you know, we're updating the air, you know, um, that were measured later.

466
00:49:55,090 --> 00:49:56,020
So that was kind of fun.

467
00:49:57,540 --> 00:50:05,570
And then in vitro, the type of toxicology that I do, for the most part, there is these kind of interesting models that we use.

468
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:13,400
So if you're not familiar with how in vitro toxicology like biology studies work, you know,

469
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:18,630
you basically have like a plant or a dish and you have your cells attached to the bottom of the plate.

470
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:23,069
And you add on top of that like what's called cell culture media,

471
00:50:23,070 --> 00:50:28,080
which is this liquid that contains proteins and growth factors and things that help

472
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:33,540
the cells to survive in this environment and more closely replicate the environment,

473
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:42,050
the microenvironment they have in the body. Right. It's a little bit different with like what we want to understand how toxicants impact lung cells.

474
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:49,740
There's this kind of nifty device that is used in different areas where there's in addition to the overall like plate,

475
00:50:50,250 --> 00:51:00,719
you have this insert here and inserting another like insert into the the well so that you can see your cells all of this well here.

476
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:05,910
And so you'll have like liquid on this this side and this side instead of adding liquid on top,

477
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:10,440
you can add some kind of like test air, you know, like a.

478
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:15,110
Um. Yeah, so kind of a test component of air.

479
00:51:15,130 --> 00:51:20,690
I feel like, uh, they have some certain air toxic it that you're interested in studying.

480
00:51:20,690 --> 00:51:26,899
And if these are lung cells, they're actually like, okay, being in contact with just air on one side versus the other.

481
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:28,970
That's kind of how they exist in the body, right?

482
00:51:29,330 --> 00:51:36,140
So there's kind of these like nifty, like little tweaks you could do to normal types of, uh, standard toxicology studies.

483
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:40,999
Then you can, what you could do is that if you're adding, like, let's say, I don't know, again, ozone,

484
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:46,729
gas into this chamber, you can measure things that are released from the cells into the media,

485
00:51:46,730 --> 00:51:51,980
which is sort of representing, you know, how these cells might respond in terms of what they're going to release into the bloodstream,

486
00:51:52,730 --> 00:51:56,390
kind of a a model of that process in the lab.

487
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:03,650
Okay. You talk about health effects of air pollution.

488
00:52:07,330 --> 00:52:14,950
Yeah. So this is showing the kind of estimated mortality associated with different types of air pollution in hundreds of thousands.

489
00:52:14,950 --> 00:52:20,830
And the one thing that so they're looking at urban ambient air, urban indoor air and rural indoor air.

490
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:30,530
And again, the thing that's sort of striking is this rural indoor air issue is really kind of associated with an estimated like a hot,

491
00:52:30,610 --> 00:52:35,049
relatively high number, a high degree of mortality compared to the other types.

492
00:52:35,050 --> 00:52:42,580
So there's this indoor air pollution issue is really a really important global public health issue.

493
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:48,950
So you can see like compared to, you know, they all are bad and are all causing like a lot of mortality.

494
00:52:48,950 --> 00:52:56,810
But you can see in different areas of the world, this rural indoor, it's just really kind of far above the other types of air pollution.

495
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:05,540
One thing I mentioned that really is thought to contribute to a lot of lung

496
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:11,050
cancer are these things that are called products of incomplete combustion or PC.

497
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:14,780
So pieces are released from like solid fuel combustion.

498
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:21,740
There are like a complex mixture of different particulates and different types of gas species.

499
00:53:22,310 --> 00:53:25,639
So you have some examples here of like these different kind of nasty compounds.

500
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:29,300
Polychlorinated depends on dioxins.

501
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:35,450
Depends of your ends. Naphthalene is polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

502
00:53:35,450 --> 00:53:44,900
We've talked about a couple of those. It's like carcinogenic molecules that cause upregulation of certain metabolic enzymes and basically

503
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:52,590
cause oxidative stress and can contribute to cause DNA damage and can contribute to cancers.

504
00:53:54,230 --> 00:54:00,470
And so you can see here, this is the estimated contribution of different types of chemicals to lung cancer.

505
00:54:01,190 --> 00:54:07,400
We see a lot of like types of chemicals we've talked about at various times.

506
00:54:08,270 --> 00:54:14,719
Benzene, chloroform, asbestos, metals like arsenic, dioxin, etc.

507
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:21,620
But like far and away, again, these products of incomplete combustion are estimated to really be the big contributors to lung cancer.

508
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:27,530
Question Can you explain what you mean by incomplete combustion?

509
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:36,300
Yeah. So it's basically like. The material hasn't burned all the way.

510
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:40,070
There are certain things that haven't completely like oxidized, for example,

511
00:54:40,070 --> 00:54:45,220
is products that are getting kicked off that have not completely combusted.

512
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:50,059
Yeah, it's a little bit kind of sort of like the normal process,

513
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:59,480
like in an automobile burning gas or what what sorts of processes do you see that or anything where you're burning like some kind of fuel.

514
00:54:59,510 --> 00:55:02,360
I think you're going to get. Yeah, honestly. Yeah, that's a good point.

515
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:07,099
I don't know all the different processes, but like certainly like this indoor cooking can lead to that.

516
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:13,100
If you're not cooking things at a high enough temperature, there's going to be like these kind of things that are burning off and getting into the air

517
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:19,580
at one temperature that are not getting if you were to like able to cook it like whatever,

518
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:22,250
like 10,000 degrees or whatever, you wouldn't get those.

519
00:55:22,250 --> 00:55:28,670
But because you're burning it like this, like lower temperature, you're getting the formation of some of these chemical species that make sense.

520
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:36,530
Yeah, it's kind of interesting chemistry. I'm not, I'm not super, uh, well versed in, like, all the aspects of that chemistry.

521
00:55:36,530 --> 00:55:42,580
It's pretty interesting. Um. Okay.

522
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:48,690
Yeah. So. Ozone is a big ones like ozone gas.

523
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:54,460
That's one of the criteria, air pollutants. And this just gives you an example of how ozone can damage the lungs.

524
00:55:55,030 --> 00:56:01,540
There's a lot of complicated kind of well, not complicated, but a lot of like kind of chemical side chain reactions here.

525
00:56:01,990 --> 00:56:06,760
But the thing that's sort of what I want you to take away from this is that ozone can interact

526
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:12,730
with polyunsaturated fatty acids that are part of like the cell membranes in the lung.

527
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:21,060
Right. So ozone is extremely reactive and it basically ends up like just breaking down fatty acids in the cell membranes,

528
00:56:21,070 --> 00:56:27,380
just causing a lot of damage, a lot of reactions occurring. And you can see some of the sort of products of these reactions.

529
00:56:27,850 --> 00:56:32,319
But the idea is you're basically disrupting like the molecular structure of these

530
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:40,030
important fatty acid compounds that make up the cells in our bodies to the point that,

531
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:47,950
like you can even use ozone, gas. And during the COVID crisis in terms of sterilizing like massive things that people are having to reduce,

532
00:56:47,950 --> 00:56:53,709
there is some discussion of maybe using ozone gas to sterilize some of these materials.

533
00:56:53,710 --> 00:57:01,690
And you can use ozone to like stir up, sterilize medical equipment because it's so damaging to like living things, including like bacteria or viruses.

534
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:07,180
Right. So that gives you a sense of why ozone is considered a pretty bad toxicant, right.

535
00:57:08,770 --> 00:57:16,120
And the effects within the log are actually similar to another chemical that's like highly reactive that we talked about in the pesticide lecture,

536
00:57:16,450 --> 00:57:19,780
which is Paraquat and you can see here.

537
00:57:21,130 --> 00:57:27,910
So this is these are animals that are getting filtered air. So like normal air, then these animals were inhaling ozone.

538
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:36,400
And if you recall from the pesticide lecture like this, you could see this like these airways in the lungs are getting like overgrown with tissue.

539
00:57:36,430 --> 00:57:42,520
You're getting these like tissue growth and like fibrosis within the lungs,

540
00:57:42,730 --> 00:57:49,600
which is obviously really bad and going to impact breathing and potentially lead to lung cancer.

541
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:58,420
Just really bad damages in the lungs. Um, the, and so this looks really similar to what happens with Paraquat, actually,

542
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:06,400
that pesticide that was also really bad, uh, damaged the lungs really badly and so really similar effects there.

543
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:17,830
Okay. So we talked about cardiopulmonary effects of air pollution and we can kind of walk through this a little bit.

544
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:24,240
So. In this case, we're talking about particulate matter.

545
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:30,240
So we have particulate matter exposure. Particulate matter can be deposited into the lungs.

546
00:58:32,150 --> 00:58:38,170
And that's going to trigger, trigger some kind of response in the dialog cells, right?

547
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:42,260
So that's going to already start some kind of effects such as inflammation.

548
00:58:42,830 --> 00:58:48,890
The lung cells are going to be responding to this sort of essentially irritant that's impacting the lungs.

549
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:57,050
So you get an increase in things like IQOS annoyances, like molecules that are involved in inflammation, so cytokines or side growth factors.

550
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:06,950
In addition, if the PM is uptake in into like the lungs,

551
00:59:06,950 --> 00:59:14,510
they can it can they can dissolve into the blood and you can have your own set of biochemical reactions that are occurring now.

552
00:59:14,540 --> 00:59:22,879
But and I think we you probably probably recall from the probably one of the asthma lectures that once something enters into the blood,

553
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:28,460
it can cause all kinds of different and be taken to multiple places in the body.

554
00:59:28,970 --> 00:59:32,990
One of the most obviously relevant places that blood is going to go is the heart.

555
00:59:33,150 --> 00:59:38,360
Right. So you have this dissolved PM that can impact the heart in a number of ways,

556
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:43,970
such as, you know, causing systemic inflammation or systemic oxidative stress.

557
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:48,620
You can have clotting of blood or vascular injury, right?

558
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:58,370
So this. So this is how, you know, this is, again, this direct connection kind of with pulmonary function and heart function.

559
01:00:00,110 --> 01:00:03,099
Anything else here? Yeah.

560
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:08,860
And so like these there's like so you have like multiple mechanisms that might be going on in terms of adverse health impacts.

561
01:00:08,860 --> 01:00:19,780
And so if we're talking about like say chronic exposure to PE, you could get something like this, like lung remodeling similar to what we saw here.

562
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:24,130
You know, there's damage to the lungs most trying to repair itself.

563
01:00:24,190 --> 01:00:29,769
We talked about in one of the other lectures about how what tissue is like constantly trying to repair itself.

564
01:00:29,770 --> 01:00:40,419
A number of things can go wrong and you can end up DNA damage, what have you, fibrosis, overgrowth of tissues, multiple things can happen there.

565
01:00:40,420 --> 01:00:43,890
Right. And yeah,

566
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:49,510
you basically what you end up having is like the it's almost like the body trying to constantly repair itself and you eventually get

567
01:00:49,510 --> 01:00:56,650
this disorganized sort of repair process that ends up being detrimental to the health of the organism versus actually helping things.

568
01:00:58,330 --> 01:01:03,350
And so that's what you can get here. You know, if you get like, you know, a chronic exposure situation.

569
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:14,870
And then again, this can also contribute to like, you know, severe, like bad, like immune reactions to inflammation and what have you.

570
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:19,970
George. Right.

571
01:01:20,060 --> 01:01:25,060
Okay. So we kind of this is working through some of the same steps here.

572
01:01:25,810 --> 01:01:28,870
But again, you have him getting into the alveoli.

573
01:01:29,950 --> 01:01:35,770
Again, the soluble constituents can impact can get into the blood and reach systemic circulation.

574
01:01:36,310 --> 01:01:39,580
Um, what was the thing I wanted to point to here?

575
01:01:40,090 --> 01:01:44,200
You can also get impacts. You can also direct impacts on the nerves.

576
01:01:45,340 --> 01:01:51,459
Certain components of air pollution can directly go through basically travel through olfactory nerves and end up

577
01:01:51,460 --> 01:01:58,150
directly in the brain or cross the blood brain barrier in some cases and end up in the brain impacting brain function.

578
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:04,370
It's kind of a newer area of research, but we're finding that air pollution can affect the brain as well.

579
01:02:05,210 --> 01:02:14,060
So, again, you know, and so again, you're bringing both this inflammation issue like fibrosis, potentially lung cancer.

580
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:25,610
But, you know, you can also through impacting like like nerve reflex types of activity within the brain, autonomic nervous system processes.

581
01:02:25,610 --> 01:02:35,660
If you get things like heart arrhythmias, myocardial electrical impacts, just essentially disrupting the sort of autonomic nervous system,

582
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:41,840
which, again, not good for someone who may already have an underlying cardiopulmonary issue.

583
01:02:42,980 --> 01:02:50,240
So all of this kind of comes together for like a number of different potentially really severe effects,

584
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:56,840
like vasoconstriction, hypertension, cardiovascular, oxidative stress or inflammation coagulation.

585
01:02:57,930 --> 01:03:03,330
Plot formation, etc. So all of this very bad for this.

586
01:03:03,870 --> 01:03:12,650
That's like cardiopulmonary system, if you will. And again, as I mentioned, air pollution can affect the brain.

587
01:03:12,710 --> 01:03:15,920
We're learning more and more. So air pollutants, again,

588
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:21,649
they can travel along the nasal pathway through the olfactory bulb and basically

589
01:03:21,650 --> 01:03:25,490
bypass the blood brain barrier and end up directly impacting cells within the brain.

590
01:03:26,060 --> 01:03:35,810
And then you can also get air pollutants that through normal like respiratory respiratory intake and chemicals being in the systemic circulation.

591
01:03:36,950 --> 01:03:42,830
If they're small enough, they can get past the blood brain barrier, sort of like direct transport.

592
01:03:43,970 --> 01:03:48,350
You can also get like systemic inflammation where you're causing inflammation in the system.

593
01:03:48,350 --> 01:03:50,990
That's not the chemical may not itself being getting.

594
01:03:52,260 --> 01:03:59,550
Get into the has the blood brain barrier, but the systemic inflammation may be impacting cells in the brain,

595
01:04:01,010 --> 01:04:05,760
so circulating cytokines of things can end up crossing that barrier.

596
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:09,450
And inflammation itself can make the blood brain barrier more permeable.

597
01:04:10,290 --> 01:04:20,400
So you have a number of different sort of pathways for air chemicals, particularly have to impact brain function and cells within the brain.

598
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:25,530
So what does this mean when we kind of like put it all together that some of

599
01:04:25,530 --> 01:04:29,099
the types of cells that could be impacted would include like the microglia,

600
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:30,630
which are the brain immune cells.

601
01:04:31,140 --> 01:04:41,400
Those guys might start up regulating the expression of, again, pro-inflammatory cytokines, causing neuroinflammation, oxidative stress,

602
01:04:41,820 --> 01:04:46,020
protein aggregation, which is a feature of like for instance, Alzheimer's,

603
01:04:46,530 --> 01:04:51,420
really that impacts on brain function and potentially like neuronal cell death.

604
01:04:51,660 --> 01:04:57,040
So. Yeah, just very important.

605
01:04:57,060 --> 01:05:01,049
But compared to some of the other mechanisms of air pollution impacts,

606
01:05:01,050 --> 01:05:05,760
maybe a little bit not well studied and we're probably still finding out more every day.

607
01:05:08,030 --> 01:05:17,569
So. Just to kind of bring it up him in a little bit more to other parts of the body, you know, so air pollution affects to go beyond the lungs.

608
01:05:17,570 --> 01:05:22,690
So you have like respiratory impacts, but changes in blood pressure, endothelial function,

609
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:27,050
systemic inflammation, you can have impacts on like risk for stroke.

610
01:05:27,770 --> 01:05:32,930
Um, again, we talked about like central nervous system impacts again premature birth.

611
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:37,970
Something that I study is also we see lots of studies showing that higher levels of

612
01:05:37,970 --> 01:05:42,770
air pollution can lead to higher risk of preterm birth impacts of birth weight,

613
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:47,700
fetal growth in our urine growth restriction impacts on sperm quality.

614
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:52,150
So. I think that's it.

615
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:58,570
So a lot of systems can be affected beyond the lungs in terms of air pollution, toxicology.

616
01:05:58,750 --> 01:06:06,370
And again, we're still kind of characterizing what all this means in light of the added sort of complication of the fact that

617
01:06:06,370 --> 01:06:11,600
air pollution in one city might not look like air pollution in another city in terms of the relevant constituents.

618
01:06:11,610 --> 01:06:15,430
So really interesting but challenging area of research.

619
01:06:16,610 --> 01:06:19,640
That's all I have for today. So thanks, everyone.

620
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:24,210
Any questions? Thoughts. Comments.

621
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:36,670
Okay. If it has any questions of the stuff we got a few minutes before it during the.

622
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:38,910
Thanks again.
