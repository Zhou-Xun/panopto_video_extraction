00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:11,100
Hello. My name is Brian Amnesic and I am your instructor for epidemiology of psychiatric and substance use disorders.

2
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:15,749
The purpose of this brief video is to give you an overview of what we're going to be doing in course,

3
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:19,620
our big main activities and of course, expectations.

4
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:28,230
So the three goals for this course are first to address major conceptual and methodological considerations,

5
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:33,870
with an emphasis on issues related to classification and measurement that are relevant to public mental health.

6
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:40,710
The second is to become familiar with the descriptive and analytic epidemiology of common psychiatric and substance use disorders.

7
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:47,489
And the third is to discuss the roles of various stakeholders, whether that's people like myself, researchers,

8
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:56,490
but also health care providers, policymakers, advocates, government agencies, etc., who all have a role in addressing public mental health.

9
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:04,170
And on that note, one of the first things you're going to learn in this course is that public mental health is really a multisector,

10
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:09,150
interprofessional field. And so at the very beginning, I want to sort of dispel that.

11
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:15,360
Any idea that you might have that people like psychiatrist or psychologists, people who are mental health specialists,

12
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:20,390
are sort of the core of, you know, kind of foundation of public mental health.

13
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,750
That's really not the case.

14
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:33,420
Instead, what you're going to learn through this course is both because of the ways that access to care is shaped in our country and around the world,

15
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:42,000
the ways that social factors shape how people understand mental disorders and what types of intervention, if any, they want for their symptoms.

16
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:47,970
And also how social factors shape the the risk for mental disorders.

17
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:55,559
We're going to find that public mental health is, especially when it comes to prevention and intervention,

18
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:01,320
is really a field that intersects with a lot of different types of sectors,

19
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:07,650
including education, government, social services, health care, employment and unfortunately, the criminal justice system.

20
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:14,680
So the course in general is organized into roughly into three modules.

21
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:24,190
These modules sort of build on each other, but give us a way to work through what is really a very vast field.

22
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,469
So at the beginning, we'll talk about sort of big questions that we're not going to answer at the beginning of the class,

23
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:33,010
but rather are going to revisit throughout the course in different ways.

24
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:37,240
These questions include things like what are mental disorders and why is that such a difficult question to answer?

25
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,710
How do we measure population mental health? What is social stigma?

26
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,870
What does it have to do with public mental health?

27
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:51,159
And how do social factors more generally influence the ways that people access care for mental health in the second third of the course?

28
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:56,710
We'll work through some of these big ideas through specific case examples.

29
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:07,780
These are examples of conditions that are either very common, very costly, or both when it comes to public mental health.

30
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:15,130
And then finally, we'll close out the course by reviewing kind of mental health systems, broadly speaking,

31
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:22,060
including a field trip to observe the proceedings of the Washtenaw County Mental Health Court.

32
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:28,250
So our course will classmates. Once a week on Wednesdays,

33
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:36,559
class time will be spent doing student presentations of the weekly readings I tell start off every week will then have

34
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,960
lecture or occasional conversations with invited guests who also have time for small group discussions and activities.

35
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:49,280
These are not always graded, but just provide an opportunity for you to apply the kind of concepts that we've learned in class.

36
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:54,710
You'll also be working on a semester long writing project that has six checkpoints along the way.

37
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:57,950
I will always record lectures using Panopto,

38
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:02,960
so if you can't attend class or if you think you might be coming out with something, please don't come to class.

39
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:09,500
You won't miss lecture and attendance is expected, but it is not part of your grade for this course.

40
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:20,590
So one of the most important things that I'm I want you to do during this course is always to do the the weekly readings.

41
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:27,970
So each week you'll have probably, you know, 2 hours of total of readings to do for the week.

42
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:35,049
And I'm it's really important that you do those because I'm going to begin lecture each week with the

43
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:42,490
assumption that you have that understanding sort of at some level already when you come into lectures,

44
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:48,159
I'm not going to review the material that's in the readings to help ensure that sort

45
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,210
of you're able to do that and make it sort of get the most out of these readings.

46
00:04:52,870 --> 00:05:01,270
Each week we will begin class by having students present on the readings using this presentation guide.

47
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:04,209
If you are not presenting that week,

48
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:12,460
then you will respond to the the prompts and the quiz that the the students who are present in that week are going to make.

49
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:22,510
And you know, this way we'll have begin each class with a conversation about the materials and the readings and then lecture will build from there.

50
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:32,650
So every student in the class once during the semester will be responsible for presenting on the weekly readings.

51
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:38,410
And when it is your turn to present, you will have been assigned one of two roles my.

52
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:42,520
Student One or Student two If you're assigned the role of student one,

53
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:49,090
your job is to help the class sort of understand the implications of the readings for the real world.

54
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:57,610
And so you will both do an asynchronous, you'll do this asynchronously and synchronously so asynchronously that is outside of class time.

55
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:05,020
You will create a discussion board posts where you will summarize the weekly readings.

56
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:08,139
You will also find a nonacademic source that's relevant to the readings.

57
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,660
This might be a TED Talk, a memoir, a song,

58
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:20,140
etc. and something that and explain why this is relevant to the readings and then also post questions for the rest of the class to respond to.

59
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,709
If you're assigned the role of student to your job is to help us gain a deeper scientific understanding of the readings.

60
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:27,130
So again,

61
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:36,400
you will provide a summary of the weekly readings you will find in academic source or a scientific source and a sort of annotated bibliography,

62
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,810
or a summary of how that article extends, what was talked about in the readings.

63
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:46,810
And then you will also post questions for the rest of the class to respond to questions.

64
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:53,200
When you are not presenting, you are automatically assigned the role of the responder,

65
00:06:53,320 --> 00:07:00,220
and the responder needs to respond to at least one of the prompts from either student one or student two.

66
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:08,830
You will also complete a quiz that will be in which the quiz itself is not graded, but your completion of it is graded.

67
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:12,220
That is, you must participate in it even if you don't get all the questions right.

68
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:25,750
And that again, that's during class time and you can miss two of these responder sort of tasks that is two weeks without it affecting your grade.

69
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:33,430
So for the presenters in the class, the second part of the first part, which is the asynchronous discussion board posts,

70
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:39,190
and then the second part is your synchronous presentation of the readings.

71
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:41,350
So this is for both student one and student two.

72
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:47,620
Students will do this by creating a quiz using a Google form that will be given at the beginning of each class.

73
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,549
They will then review the answers using a Google slide deck,

74
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:58,210
explaining both what is the correct answer and why the other ones are incorrect, and how that and where they learned that information.

75
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:03,160
And they will also share a little bit more about their additional reading.

76
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:09,220
And they can also discuss the responses that the students, other students, had to their prompts.

77
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:17,260
And we will spend the first 15 to 20 minutes of class each week doing this synchronous engagement with the readings.

78
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:25,260
So what I in order to keep on top of all of this, I know that's a lot.

79
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:32,250
I encourage you to subscribe to the weekly presentations as well.

80
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:38,970
You know, when the presenters for the week have posted in year eight, you'll be able to respond to their posts.

81
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:47,670
It'll take us a couple of weeks before we get into the swing of things, but once we do it, will it will run like clockwork, clockwork, trust me.

82
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:59,940
So the other thing that we're going to be doing on over the course of the semester is you're going to be working on a semester long writing project.

83
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:03,720
This is the makes up the majority of your grade for this course.

84
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:12,630
And it is a writing project that redresses a misconception or a controversy that's relevant to public mental health on a topic of your choosing.

85
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:17,490
So these are just some examples of projects that students have done in the past.

86
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:22,590
Things like Is the legalization of recreational marijuana beneficial to public mental health?

87
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,640
Is firearm regulation an effective means of suicide prevention?

88
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:34,380
Are mental health courts ethical? And what is the value of direct to consumer advertising of psychotropic medications?

89
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:41,730
There's also misconceptions. There's many some examples are things like vaccinations and present prevalence of autism.

90
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:48,450
The relationships between pain, pain management, opiate use, misuse, perceptions of violence,

91
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:58,200
risk of violence of people with the mental disorder and pharmacologic or in sometimes also supplement to prevent dementia.

92
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:07,760
So again, the goal of this of this semester long writing project is for you to gain in-depth knowledge

93
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:13,040
of a specific topic of your choosing by addressing a misconception and or controversy.

94
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,860
Again, your paper should really discuss why this misconception exists.

95
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:23,390
Is this because conflicting findings from well-conducted studies, or is there just insufficient data?

96
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:27,379
Are there conflicting policy goals? So we have all the data, but we have different,

97
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:32,780
different things that we're trying to achieve or disagreements over the means to achieve a shared goal.

98
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:40,190
You know, it shouldn't just summarize everything. I'm not looking for like a Wikipedia entry here and but really just sort of really

99
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:45,740
describe why this controversy exists and all of the information you need to understand.

100
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:55,010
Your semester long writing project is posted already on campus under the You read me first assignment I strongly.

101
00:10:55,550 --> 00:11:01,790
Right now pauses video. Go download that packet and spend a little bit of time looking through it.

102
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:06,650
Because everything you're going to need to do for this project,

103
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:15,500
all of the sort of rationale for why I'm asking you to do what I'm asking you to do, etc. is explained in this packet.

104
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:26,959
The packet explains, and you will also sort of kind of D I guess compress or that's not the right word,

105
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:37,010
but you will deconstruct your project through these and then construct it on the back end through these six checkpoints,

106
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:41,760
which you will do throughout the term that help you stay on track with your project throughout the semester.

107
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:48,109
These are listed here and again you will get feedback on your check points from me and you will have

108
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:52,460
opportunities to share and discuss some of them with your classmates to help you refine your ideas.

109
00:11:53,420 --> 00:12:01,010
And so I think this is one of the big things that I the reason I do it this way is that I want you to have

110
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:10,340
some time to kind of reflect on your ideas without worrying about your expression of those ideas in writing.

111
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:16,160
Because to me like that, that your ideas are the most important thing that I want you to, to work through in the class.

112
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:26,010
Well, also do again during class. Time will have, you know, a portion of class that's spent working in small groups.

113
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:29,990
These will, again, be opportunities to apply some of the concepts that we've talked about in lecture.

114
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:37,010
You'll get a lot of experience working with data relevant to public mental health, including time to work on two or three homework assignments,

115
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:43,550
all of which require you to use publicly available public data that's relevant to public mental health.

116
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:48,200
And also time to just kind of check in with your on your project check point.

117
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:53,270
Your grade for this course is organized as followed college.

118
00:12:53,280 --> 00:13:00,360
30% of your course or your course grade or 10% for each homework assignment is comprised of these homeworks.

119
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:10,760
Each of these homeworks is a really is a a a reflection of the types of assignments that you're going to need to do for your checkpoint.

120
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:15,410
So you're going to have to work with data that, for example, is checkpoint number four.

121
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:22,340
You're going to have to annotate a citation that's the same as checkpoint number three.

122
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:31,850
So example, it's these are skills that I'm going to help you give you multiple times to work on developing over the course of the of the term.

123
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:38,840
So that's that's 30% of your grade are these three homework assignments we've also just as we

124
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:44,030
described you'll you'll present the readings one time during the semester that's 10% of your grade.

125
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:50,929
And then in total, over the course of the term, you will respond to the presentations or the readings.

126
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:54,799
Again, you can miss two of those responses without it affecting your grade,

127
00:13:54,800 --> 00:14:02,570
but in total that will be 5% of your grade, and the remainder of your grade is spent working on this final project.

128
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:09,590
Again, there are these six checkpoints that help you stay on top of your project that you will get feedback on throughout the course of the term,

129
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:16,309
so that when it comes time to write the final paper, you will really be in a strong position to do some really good work.

130
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:19,910
And I'm really excited to see the kind of ideas that you come up with.

131
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:26,870
The last few things I want to say is just to kind of recognize that I hope that

132
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:31,640
we can have a really open communication and a sense of community in class.

133
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:39,380
We really, really try to balance in time for in-class discussions and handle an application with more kind of lectures or didactic sessions.

134
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:46,130
I encourage you, if you share resources that you find, whether through presenting the the readings or through your class project,

135
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,459
you share these both with me, share them with your classmates.

136
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:56,360
I encourage you to do that. I every year I update the reading list with additional things that students have found,

137
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:06,290
which is always exciting to see and encourage us all to be patient and patient with each other and patients with me.

138
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:10,880
Communication can be challenging sometimes, especially online.

139
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:18,470
You know, we can often be missing goals or missed connections or have unintended gaps because things like tone and nonverbal cues are missing.

140
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:27,350
Please use the email function within canvas. It looks like a little inbox button on the left hand side panel for communicating with me.

141
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:31,610
When you send me a message through canvas, I get an email.

142
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:37,819
So you are you are accomplishing the same thing as to when you email me, but I also get a separate alert.

143
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:44,000
And so it helps me stay on top of emails for the class and make sure that I can respond to your emails in a timely manner.

144
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,150
If you do not email me through canvas,

145
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:53,930
I'm going to go through your emails in the same way that I go through all the other hundreds of emails I receive every day.

146
00:15:54,680 --> 00:16:00,710
And so you might not get it. You will definitely get a response from me a lot faster if you send me the message through canvas.

147
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:06,920
I also just want to acknowledge at the top that many of us have situations that require our attention at inopportune times.

148
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:12,440
Maybe you've been able to hear my dog barking multiple times throughout this recording.

149
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:18,050
I just, you know, I know that life happens and it's always happening.

150
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:24,259
So my request is just let me know about situations that might impact your ability to stay in class as soon as you know about them.

151
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:29,420
And so we can work together to to to make sure you can still be successful in this class.

152
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:33,830
And the last thing I want to say is that the most important thing to me is your learning.

153
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:41,150
I want you to leave this class with tools for how to think about public mental health, not what to think about public mental health.

154
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:49,819
And finally, this course. If you are a student at the School of Public Health,

155
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:57,710
this course is one of the courses that's a requirement for the graduate certificate in Social Epidemiology.

156
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:01,310
I am also the director of this certificate program currently.

157
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:05,149
And so if you are if this is something that you're interested in pursuing,

158
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:11,210
I guess I just want to let you know that just by completing this course, you will have started to meet the requirements for this certificate.

159
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:17,330
And if you have any questions about this certificate, please let me know and I'm happy to answer them.

160
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:26,659
So now that you've gotten oriented in class, I'll encourage you to complete your first assignments, quote unquote.

161
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:34,790
Of course. Neither of these are greeted. The first is there is a section on our canvas called Breathing Out, Settling In Before We Begin the semester,

162
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:39,079
which is just a sharing, just an example of three podcast episodes.

163
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:47,840
I'm a huge fan of podcasts, so some things that I think I've found very helpful over the last few years and helping to center myself in the work

164
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:54,950
that I'm doing and kind of understand how do we make sense of the world that sometimes doesn't make sense to us.

165
00:17:55,580 --> 00:18:00,620
So again, it just completely optional. But if you're interested, I recommend these podcast episodes.

166
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:07,010
And then finally I'd like everyone to just introduce themselves to the class using the discussion board here.

167
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:11,690
Just help me understand a little bit who's in the room and why you took this class and what you're hoping to get out of it.

168
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,060
Thanks so much. I'll see you in the classroom.
