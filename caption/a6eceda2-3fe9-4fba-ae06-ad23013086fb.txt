1
00:00:00,116 --> 00:00:05,936
Hi, my name is Leseliey Welch, and I'm your primary instructor for the FPHLP program,

2
00:00:05,936 --> 00:00:12,266
and I'm excited to talk with you today and provide an overview of public health.

3
00:00:12,266 --> 00:00:19,076
And my invitation to you during this time is to, you know,

4
00:00:19,076 --> 00:00:31,406
understand some basic definitions and history of public health, and to think critically about public health and what the field has to offer.

5
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:36,596
So this is an invitation to critical thought and inquiry.

6
00:00:36,596 --> 00:00:42,206
We will divide this public health overview into three sections.

7
00:00:42,206 --> 00:00:47,216
So we'll go over some definitions, disciplines, functions and services.

8
00:00:47,216 --> 00:00:58,016
We'll do an activity around historical achievements and social change and then finish up with a discussion of population  health,

9
00:00:58,016 --> 00:01:04,136
why it's controversial and then an invitation for you to consider,

10
00:01:04,136 --> 00:01:09,296
what is your personal inquiry as you think about public health

11
00:01:09,296 --> 00:01:16,936
as a field? The American Association of Public Health,

12
00:01:16,936 --> 00:01:24,406
or American Public Health Association defines the public health as, or says, public

13
00:01:24,406 --> 00:01:29,776
health promotes and protects the health of people and the communities where they live,

14
00:01:29,776 --> 00:01:35,176
learn, work and play.

15
00:01:35,176 --> 00:01:44,656
The Centers for Disease Control defines, "Public health as the science of protecting and improving the health of people in their communities.

16
00:01:44,656 --> 00:01:48,406
This work is achieved by promoting healthy lifestyles,

17
00:01:48,406 --> 00:01:57,346
researching disease and injury prevention and detecting, preventing and responding to infectious disease."

18
00:01:57,346 --> 00:01:59,146
And then finally,

19
00:01:59,146 --> 00:02:11,236
the Institute of Medicine defines, "Public health as what we, as a society, do collectively to assure the conditions for people to be healthy."

20
00:02:11,236 --> 00:02:21,306
This is a definition we're going to center, breakdown, and focus on.

21
00:02:21,306 --> 00:02:27,276
So from this Institute of Medicine definition, I would have you noticed a couple of things,

22
00:02:27,276 --> 00:02:32,406
and one of them is that public health is about context.

23
00:02:32,406 --> 00:02:36,576
It's about the conditions for people to be healthy.

24
00:02:36,576 --> 00:02:43,386
We'll be exploring determinants of health and more about what this means.

25
00:02:43,386 --> 00:02:49,416
I would also like for you to notice that public health is about populations.

26
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:57,006
It is about the health of our whole population or about communities,

27
00:02:57,006 --> 00:03:11,076
and not focused on the individual. And finally, public health is about health promotion, not the curing, necessarily, of disease.

28
00:03:11,076 --> 00:03:19,416
Right, not disease focused, but health focused. How do we promote health?

29
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:24,486
As an illustration, let's consider this.

30
00:03:24,486 --> 00:03:31,956
If this is our population, right, and we're considering a health condition.

31
00:03:31,956 --> 00:03:39,306
We'll have some people in our population that might have a high risk for the condition,

32
00:03:39,306 --> 00:03:45,756
and then we'll have some people in our population that have a low risk for the condition.

33
00:03:45,756 --> 00:03:52,336
And then the question is, you know, who gets sick?

34
00:03:52,336 --> 00:03:59,446
Do only the high risk people get sick? And the answer to that is no.

35
00:03:59,446 --> 00:04:04,516
Right? That when we consider disease and we consider risk levels,

36
00:04:04,516 --> 00:04:12,466
that there are people who are more likely, right, to get sick or get a certain disease and people who are less likely,

37
00:04:12,466 --> 00:04:22,066
but potentially both groups of people can have or experience that illness or disease.

38
00:04:22,066 --> 00:04:30,006
The example I like to use for this, is a dear friend of mine had to have a liver transplant,

39
00:04:30,006 --> 00:04:42,006
and we were all astounded, because she had none of the risk factors indicated for an individual who would need a liver transplant.

40
00:04:42,006 --> 00:04:54,786
Right? She was one of the blue people here, low risk and not on the risk radar for this condition that she experienced that led to a liver transplant,

41
00:04:54,786 --> 00:05:01,016
which she has named her liver after Laila

42
00:05:01,016 --> 00:05:10,206
Ali, the female boxer, because of her strength and resilience in that process.

43
00:05:10,206 --> 00:05:15,236
And so what I want to distinguish here for you then, using our

44
00:05:15,236 --> 00:05:24,506
blue and green people, our high and low risk people, is the medical approach from the public health approach.

45
00:05:24,506 --> 00:05:32,026
And so a public health approach looks at the risk factor,

46
00:05:32,026 --> 00:05:37,596
and it looks to identify those who are at risk,

47
00:05:37,596 --> 00:05:45,516
and then work to decrease the risk of those who are high risk.

48
00:05:45,516 --> 00:05:58,326
Right? And so if we're thinking about heart disease, for example, there will be work around diet, exercise, lifestyle, medication

49
00:05:58,326 --> 00:06:05,916
to work to decrease the risk. But then, there's something that we miss.

50
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:14,796
There's something that we miss. We miss folks who are less at risk.

51
00:06:14,796 --> 00:06:22,366
There is a unaddressed, underlying risk. And so the medical strategy sees this.

52
00:06:22,366 --> 00:06:28,236
The high risk approach, identify those who are at high risk and reduce their risk.

53
00:06:28,236 --> 00:06:35,456
So it sees all of the green people. But it misses this,

54
00:06:35,456 --> 00:06:45,666
the low risk people. In contrast, our public health approach

55
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:58,416
looks at this curve, this risk curve, and instead of slicing part of it off, we work to shift the entire distribution, right?

56
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:07,306
We work to shift the entire distribution, reducing the risk for the entire population.

57
00:07:07,306 --> 00:07:13,116
And so the public health strategy sees all of the people.

58
00:07:13,116 --> 00:07:20,646
Right? We see all of the people, the blue and the green people, the high and the low risk, and

59
00:07:20,646 --> 00:07:34,666
we worked in this case, right, to reduce the number of folks who are high risk, and then ultimately, to improve the averages for

60
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:38,326
both groups of people over time. Right?

61
00:07:38,326 --> 00:07:51,016
To improve the averages for both groups of people over time by adjusting, and improving, and assuring those conditions for people to be healthy.

62
00:07:51,016 --> 00:08:00,336
Right? Which is one of the reasons why I love this definition, the Institute of Medicine's definition.

63
00:08:00,336 --> 00:08:10,116
When we take a look at the history of public health, it helps to understand the history of public health in eras.

64
00:08:10,116 --> 00:08:17,066
There's actually, the history is framed as eras, it's framed as points, it's framed as waves.

65
00:08:17,066 --> 00:08:21,806
I'll show you all three of those things, starting with eras.

66
00:08:21,806 --> 00:08:30,906
And we think about when we think about eras in public health, the health protection era would be the first from antiquity up into the

67
00:08:30,906 --> 00:08:37,226
1830s, and during this era, it was about authority based behavior control,

68
00:08:37,226 --> 00:08:45,926
religious and cultural prohibition. Right? What you should and should not do based on your morals, values and beliefs.

69
00:08:45,926 --> 00:08:52,366
And then we move into the hygene era.

70
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:57,946
And during this time, the 1840s to about the 1870s, in this era,

71
00:08:57,946 --> 00:09:09,766
we see a focus on sanitation and we see a lot of environmental action. When folks talk about the social justice origins of public health,

72
00:09:09,766 --> 00:09:14,326
they're referring primarily, I would say,

73
00:09:14,326 --> 00:09:25,026
to the roots of the hygiene era, and the impetus to look at environmental health and take environmental action.

74
00:09:25,026 --> 00:09:27,916
The third, would be contagion control.

75
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:36,826
This is when we begin to understand the connection between germs, and illness, and sickness and work on communicable disease control.

76
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:44,146
This is our 1880s up into the 1930s. Number four, would be filling gaps in medical care.

77
00:09:44,146 --> 00:09:50,776
This is when we see a public health system emerge distinct from our health system.

78
00:09:50,776 --> 00:10:00,726
Right? And during this time, the focus was on taking care of vulnerable populations and modifying risk factors, right?

79
00:10:00,726 --> 00:10:08,316
So those without potentially access to health care or safety net services,

80
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:17,026
we see those emerge here. This would be, I think, our 1940s on up into the 80s.

81
00:10:17,026 --> 00:10:21,836
Then we come to health promotion and disease prevention.

82
00:10:21,836 --> 00:10:32,086
And here in this time, 1990s through the 2000s, we see this focus on individual health behavior.

83
00:10:32,086 --> 00:10:37,366
This is actually the time in which I got my public health degree.

84
00:10:37,366 --> 00:10:41,926
Right?  So it says something about my age and dating me.

85
00:10:41,926 --> 00:10:54,856
But I can remember the level of frustration I felt in public health school at that time when the focus was all about lifestyle choices,

86
00:10:54,856 --> 00:11:02,476
healthy eating, exercise, nutrition. Also, tobacco control was huge, a huge focus at that time.

87
00:11:02,476 --> 00:11:11,596
But I can remember being distinctly aware, right, of how the choices we make are constrained by the choices we have.

88
00:11:11,596 --> 00:11:18,106
And not everybody has the same choices to make around health behavior.

89
00:11:18,106 --> 00:11:23,596
And so we see a move and a shift,

90
00:11:23,596 --> 00:11:32,896
probably about two 2010ish and forward to thinking more broadly about social

91
00:11:32,896 --> 00:11:40,506
determinants of health and then moving into this idea of population health,

92
00:11:40,506 --> 00:11:46,126
of thinking about systems, thinking about collective impact.

93
00:11:46,126 --> 00:11:52,396
And we'll talk about these things. But first,

94
00:11:52,396 --> 00:11:58,396
quick trivia, would be this photo here.

95
00:11:58,396 --> 00:12:06,076
I give you the opportunity to observe this photo and then ask you to guess

96
00:12:06,076 --> 00:12:16,066
what era this photo is from and what it has to do with present day vaccines.

97
00:12:16,066 --> 00:12:23,496
So take a moment to take a look. Maybe jot down a thought or two.

98
00:12:23,496 --> 00:12:34,716
And let's go to our answer. So this photo is from our health protection area, right?

99
00:12:34,716 --> 00:12:43,746
And it is from the 1700s and the association with the cowpox vaccine.

100
00:12:43,746 --> 00:12:50,876
So Edward Jenner discovered at that time that there was this common ailment that

101
00:12:50,876 --> 00:12:59,046
those who milk cows, didn't seem to get it in a life threatening way.

102
00:12:59,046 --> 00:13:08,686
Right? And so here, is the origins of our thinking about vaccines,

103
00:13:08,686 --> 00:13:20,686
because he discovered that cowpox protected those who developed it against the life threatening illness, smallpox.

104
00:13:20,686 --> 00:13:32,596
Right? So those who were getting cowpox were more protected against a life threatening illness, smallpox.

105
00:13:32,596 --> 00:13:39,166
Next up, when we take a look at public health, we can think about the points and waves I referred to.

106
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:46,636
And so here too, you see down below, a timeline, the 1830s to the 2000s.

107
00:13:46,636 --> 00:13:56,116
If we want to think about public health in waves, we can think about the first wave being sanitary reform, great public health works,

108
00:13:56,116 --> 00:14:06,226
growth of municipal power, a concern for civil order, and social reformers as key players in public health.

109
00:14:06,226 --> 00:14:18,826
And then we move into the 1900s, seeing that correspond with contagion control, the rise of scientific medicine,

110
00:14:18,826 --> 00:14:25,666
hospitals, health services, rationalists, and reductionist approach dominates,

111
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:37,546
we'll talk about that. Right? This idea that one thing causes another, one to one vs. the contribution of many factors to a thing.

112
00:14:37,546 --> 00:14:43,066
Third wave, up top, is where we see the welfare state.

113
00:14:43,066 --> 00:14:47,446
This would be filling gaps in medical care. Right?

114
00:14:47,446 --> 00:14:54,796
Institutional reform, national health services, established social housing, focus on living conditions,

115
00:14:54,796 --> 00:15:03,766
and here politicians becoming key players in public health, which is very important today as well.

116
00:15:03,766 --> 00:15:11,656
We'll have some conversations about that. And they are finally moving into the fourth wave, which here

117
00:15:11,656 --> 00:15:14,616
1990s, 2000s,

118
00:15:14,616 --> 00:15:22,756
a focus on those risk factors, a connection to health promotion, disease prevention, lifestyles and behaviors, emerging concerns,

119
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:27,436
right, here is where the emerging concerns about inequalities come into play.

120
00:15:27,436 --> 00:15:27,706
Right?

121
00:15:27,706 --> 00:15:41,626
This idea that the choices we make, are constrained by the choices we have and how do our politics, and policies, and environments shape our health?

122
00:15:41,626 --> 00:15:53,146
And so those are our waves. And to our right, here, we also see another way that the history of public health is divided,

123
00:15:53,146 --> 00:15:58,126
which would be in points. And so our first two points would be 1.0,

124
00:15:58,126 --> 00:16:03,826
and this is after the Industrial Revolution, the late 19th century,

125
00:16:03,826 --> 00:16:09,886
expanded capacity of epidemiology and laboratory science, vaccines and antibiotics,

126
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:21,376
and then moving to Public Health 2.0, which is after the Institute of Medicine report, assuring the conditions in which people can be healthy.

127
00:16:21,376 --> 00:16:26,816
And we see our core functions and essential services emerge.

128
00:16:26,816 --> 00:16:41,096
And so let's talk about those, are disciplines, our functions, and our services, starting with our disciplines.

129
00:16:41,096 --> 00:16:54,026
Here are our six public health disciplines. The first being epidemiology, as the core science of public health. And then biostatistics,

130
00:16:54,026 --> 00:16:58,526
our focus on data and diagnostic tools in public health.

131
00:16:58,526 --> 00:17:08,296
Environmental health, how we consider, look at, assess, evaluate, environmental exposures. Health management and policy,

132
00:17:08,296 --> 00:17:19,006
here, looking at the role of health care and the role of policy. Biomedical sciences, infectious, chronic and genetic disease.

133
00:17:19,006 --> 00:17:25,966
And social and behavioral sciences, which would be the intersection of individual and social environment.

134
00:17:25,966 --> 00:17:33,916
Right? Intersection of individual and social environments. The photo you see here,

135
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:40,486
another piece of public health trivia, would be to ask you to guess who this

136
00:17:40,486 --> 00:17:47,816
individual might be and why he's significant to the history of public health?

137
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:55,036
So I ask you maybe to pause for a moment to consider it, or I'll pause.

138
00:17:55,036 --> 00:18:02,146
And let's talk about who this is and why he's significant.

139
00:18:02,146 --> 00:18:14,476
This is John Snow, and he is often referred to as the Father of Modern Epidemiology, because of his work around cholera.

140
00:18:14,476 --> 00:18:36,316
And what we saw from John Snow and his work around cholera, is that he noticed a pattern in illness, at the time, related to where people were living,

141
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:52,786
and while others were considering and thinking about cholera and like air, and things like that, he went to do a study.

142
00:18:52,786 --> 00:18:58,156
Right? Our first, sort of studies around

143
00:18:58,156 --> 00:19:00,106
who was getting sick?

144
00:19:00,106 --> 00:19:07,606
So going from door to door in this one area of town to see who was getting sick with cholera and what they had in common.

145
00:19:07,606 --> 00:19:13,186
Right? And what he learned is that they had a water source in common.

146
00:19:13,186 --> 00:19:20,926
Right? They were all the folks who were getting sick. Most of the folks who were getting sick were getting their water from a certain well.

147
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:31,606
And that is how the association or determination or connection between contaminated water source and cholera came to be.

148
00:19:31,606 --> 00:19:36,616
And also the origins of modern epidemiologic study.

149
00:19:36,616 --> 00:19:45,906
Right? Looking at populations and groups and contributing factors in common when we think about disease.

150
00:19:45,906 --> 00:19:57,486
The other thing I will point out about John Snow as significant, is that while now we herald him as the father of modern epidemiology, during his time,

151
00:19:57,486 --> 00:20:01,026
he was not heralded as such.

152
00:20:01,026 --> 00:20:10,106
In fact, his colleagues thought he was crazy, that he was going off on a tangent, that he didn't know what he was talking about.

153
00:20:10,106 --> 00:20:15,876
Right? And it turns out he absolutely knew what he was talking about,

154
00:20:15,876 --> 00:20:22,476
and he's contributed to how we understand epidemiology today.

155
00:20:22,476 --> 00:20:34,596
And we'll come back to this, this idea of courage, and this idea of standing in what you know and believe to be true, even in the face of opposition,

156
00:20:34,596 --> 00:20:44,396
which if you want to lead in public health, or any industry for that matter, some semblance of courage, I would say is required.

157
00:20:44,396 --> 00:20:54,686
Right? And you won't always be celebrated in your time if you choose to be a leader and an innovator.

158
00:20:54,686 --> 00:21:06,196
Next up, would be our core functions and essential services. So our core functions of public health are assessment,

159
00:21:06,196 --> 00:21:10,816
assurance, and policy development. Right?

160
00:21:10,816 --> 00:21:26,076
Assessment is how we understand and monitor population health. It's how we investigate, diagnose, and address public health hazards and root causes

161
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:39,546
to essential services within assessment. And then assurance, is how we build and maintain a strong organizational infrastructure for public health,

162
00:21:39,546 --> 00:21:47,676
what we do to improve and innovate through evaluation, research, and quality improvement. It is assuring a

163
00:21:47,676 --> 00:21:57,646
skilled and diverse workforce to support the conditions in which people have the opportunity to be healthy.

164
00:21:57,646 --> 00:22:09,316
And it is enabling equitable access to those conditions that assure all people have the opportunity to be healthy.

165
00:22:09,316 --> 00:22:21,646
And I would point out here, that our essential services were updated very recently in the last year to center equity.

166
00:22:21,646 --> 00:22:31,786
So equity was not always centered and enabling and assuring equitable access was not necessarily always a priority,

167
00:22:31,786 --> 00:22:40,166
and we'll talk more about that. And third core function, would be policy development.

168
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:48,326
And here, we have utilizing legal and regulatory action, creating, championing and implementing policies,

169
00:22:48,326 --> 00:22:54,656
plans, and laws that connect, again, to the conditions that enable us to be healthy.

170
00:22:54,656 --> 00:22:59,516
Strengthening, supporting and mobilizing communities and partnerships.

171
00:22:59,516 --> 00:23:07,406
We link all of this back to the IOM definition. And here again, the idea that public health is about partnerships,

172
00:23:07,406 --> 00:23:11,036
public health is about what we collaboratively do, right,

173
00:23:11,036 --> 00:23:16,486
to assure those conditions. And then finally here, communicate.

174
00:23:16,486 --> 00:23:23,806
Communicating effectively to inform and to educate. Communicating effectively

175
00:23:23,806 --> 00:23:34,336
to inform and to educate. And so those are our core functions and our essential services.

176
00:23:34,336 --> 00:23:42,596
And we will pause here before moving on to our next segment.
