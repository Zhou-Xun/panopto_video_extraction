1
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:14,480
In the choice between education and training is usually about mentoring and high.

2
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:25,780
All right. Welcome, everyone, to epidemiology six seven for you, Mikulski.

3
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:31,229
Here's our plan for the day. We're recording. So welcome, everybody.

4
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,490
Who's going to watch this video later on? We'll go over canvases, all of us.

5
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,069
We'll do introductions and then we'll jump into it.

6
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:44,670
We'll do this like periodic switching between slides and then Kodak once and then Kodak throughout throughout the class.

7
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:53,600
All right. Check out the canvass site. Some of you may be familiar with this.

8
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:59,360
If you haven't noticed yet. There's an activity before the first class.

9
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,550
If you haven't done it yet, please don't panic. You can do this right now.

10
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:06,530
I'm talking. There's two steps.

11
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:14,690
One is to create a log in with positive cloud. This is the interface we're going to use for sharing files and for coding together in class.

12
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:21,380
And then the second one is to join our specific class because that cloud workspace to actually,

13
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:28,610
if you would like to in the future code on your personal computer instead of these will be operating through the web browser.

14
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:35,990
I have some optional steps for you here. So first install are on your computer.

15
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:39,500
Second, install our studio through closet.

16
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:49,070
Third, create a local folder and if you have a mac, there's a couple additional steps that we need for some developer.

17
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:59,090
Welcome. Hello. Applications to be able to compile all the packages we're going to do here something that I have found after taking this.

18
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:06,830
There's a few times that the Project Cloud works really well for getting us in a uniform environment so that we are coding more quickly.

19
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:14,810
There can be a lot of hiccups along the way because everyone has a slightly different operating system, slightly different version of our.

20
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:20,600
So I'm happy to work with you individually. They'll work on this potentially during our Drop-In hours, which are every Friday.

21
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:29,210
So let me know if you need your help here. I've just found if we can try to set this up in class together, this could take the entire time.

22
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:35,480
So that's why I'm using the web browser version. But I'm happy to help you all out with the personal computer version.

23
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:44,540
So it's optional. You, if you like some more information on our class.

24
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,700
Oh, let me just pause. Does anybody. Is anybody here up the waitlist who does not have access to campus right now?

25
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:55,980
And can I have it right now? What we're talking. So you'll need to, like, follow some of the hyperlinks that are in here.

26
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:01,230
Okay. The syllabus.

27
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:09,540
Pull that up and word. There's three identical sections for this class.

28
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,760
One of the ones they want is that capacity.

29
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:18,270
But if for any reason you have a conflict on some Tuesday and you want to show up on Thursday, they're they're interchangeable to me.

30
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:24,330
But please don't attend Wednesday. That one is already completely full.

31
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:31,020
You're welcome to call me Kelly. Dr. Mikulski pronounced like a buckle and a ski.

32
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:35,640
Dr. B Professor Kelly And a number of options here.

33
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:43,380
A student drop in hours are Fridays. Let's do we have the prerequisites?

34
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:50,430
I think the thing that people are tend to be most curious about are the class structure.

35
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:56,430
So we'll have weekly lectures interspersed with coding.

36
00:03:56,490 --> 00:04:06,780
We'll go back and forth. There will be weekly homework assignments, only six of them total drop below this one and only three online discussion posts.

37
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:11,340
So one of the biggest things with are that it takes people a while to get used to is.

38
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,960
Unlike other coding languages that might be more hierarchical.

39
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:21,650
So if you have a question, you go ask the SAS website for help.

40
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:26,419
There's not a similar framework with R, there's a much more flat hierarchy.

41
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:30,620
So we have to get used to relying on our fellow community of our users for help.

42
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:35,030
So we're going to practice this in the discussion board with your fellow classmates.

43
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:43,959
So we're going to practice this activity of. Asking questions that are able to prompt useful answers and then also providing support for each other

44
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:51,220
because this is going to mimic the art community on the wider Internet once those classes are completed.

45
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:55,570
This there's a skill like any other to practice giving up residency back.

46
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:04,989
Here's the grading scheme for this class is a pass fail class and based on university standards and set a 70% threshold.

47
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:08,559
I haven't lost anybody yet and this will not be the time.

48
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:15,400
We will all be highly successful here. So what I find with that grading format is you can mostly focus on the experience of

49
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:20,470
coding and not really be worrying too much about individual points kind of along the way.

50
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:26,050
So here's how we'll break down those points. Drop in hours on Fridays.

51
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:31,920
So we have four interns on a late word policy.

52
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:35,309
I think that's a good one to make sure we mention there's no penalty for late work,

53
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:40,350
but I have due dates for everything on campus to help keep you on pace for the class.

54
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:51,899
There's a number of resources here I invite you to see, and then here's our session topics.

55
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:56,100
So today we'll do getting started with AH. You can see a number of learning objectives along the way.

56
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,640
Our second and third classes will both be about data management.

57
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,690
You may find this in your research to. Data.

58
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:09,180
The actual analytics is very quick and data management takes up the bulk of the time.

59
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:14,910
So this is reflective of what epidemiologic analysis often looked like for myself.

60
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:18,690
And so we'll spend a little extra time in this area reflecting that need.

61
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:31,610
Yeah. I also have a self guided module because I found maybe this whole idea once people get going with us,

62
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:37,450
they get excited about it and they want to continue learning. So I created an additional module for the class and then we also.

63
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:45,730
A link with a number of other continued learning resources that your colleagues have provided,

64
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:51,190
and we can keep adding more resources there for folks who want to keep going.

65
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:56,590
Hopefully this is just the first step. So let me pass in terms of expectations.

66
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:04,239
Any questions, anything we should clarify about what is needed to be successful,

67
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:10,750
and especially if we have to maybe schedule an opportunity to meet with you outside of that writer's room.

68
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:14,049
We just know you. We have class. Yeah. Yeah.

69
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:17,860
That might be a complex time for folks. Yeah, I have.

70
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:19,980
I was just double checking about this here.

71
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:26,139
I have a link to, like, my personal appointment calendar, which can be another opportunity, or feel free to connect with me over email.

72
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:31,120
We can schedule an alternate timeline to use an email.

73
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,460
Should be on the syllabus.

74
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:40,510
It's just my last name I use. Yeah.

75
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:47,350
Because people. Yeah.

76
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:54,330
Yeah. I'm sorry to wait until to much recorded.

77
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:58,770
Yes. They'll be posted with Panopto to the website.

78
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:02,700
You can already see Thursday's class.

79
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:10,110
So each class on the homepage we're doing getting started with right here, they're going to follow the similar format.

80
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:13,710
So we have our learning objectives that were on the syllabus as well.

81
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,590
We've got our class notes, the PowerPoint slides.

82
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:22,590
I'm doing this positive workspace, and then here's the recording instructions about how to access the recording.

83
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:30,890
Or else. Okay.

84
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:34,820
Yeah. So here's how each class session will have this type of format.

85
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:40,040
The slides, the puzzle club workspace. This is where we'll share code and whatnot.

86
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:45,720
Yeah. Generally by the Tuesday section, I have ironed out some logistical issues.

87
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:50,940
You can see on Wednesday we had a little bit of a cloud and challenge that has hopefully been resolved by now.

88
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:56,850
And then we have the recording available each week. There'll be a homework assignment you can access here.

89
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:05,280
So if your, for example, is our first homework assignment, I'll ask for your code and your answers and a number of problems.

90
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:10,800
And then. There is a discussion thread.

91
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:15,850
So here I ask that you do three of these in all three of these a semester.

92
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:21,010
There is like a link to tell us how to provide.

93
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:30,220
Useful information when you're asking a question. Basically, the idea is to give as much detail as you can.

94
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,590
If your question is.

95
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:41,240
It doesn't work or nothing's working, that even if somebody is coming to you and like trying to help, there's nothing to grab on to.

96
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:45,530
So the more specificity you can provide, like, here's the code I tried.

97
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:47,750
Here's the error message I got.

98
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:55,430
Then we can practice going through the error message together to try to find how are we going to resolve this together?

99
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:59,830
My goal in coding is never to. Have the absence of errors.

100
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:05,380
I just want to be able to more efficiently work my way through those error messages so we can practice that together.

101
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:12,620
There's a number of discussion posts some of your colleagues have already been asking about sort.

102
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:17,490
So feel free to check that. See if your question already matches mean.

103
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:23,620
Maybe there's already an answer already posted by one of your colleagues in a discussion post like per her section.

104
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:26,770
Or is it a catch all across all the sections?

105
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:32,919
Oh, that's a great point. I've got it right now open for everybody because I was seeing I was thinking

106
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:36,160
that there would be some overlap in terms of things people are curious about.

107
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:43,270
Yeah, that's a great point, though. Yeah. So you'll be able to see things like the ones that people might have asked about something.

108
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:50,390
Her comments about expectations set to do.

109
00:10:54,610 --> 00:11:01,569
I think that goes over. And the only last thing I want to mention on each class page,

110
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:07,680
we have at the bottom a number of optional readings of resources which might be useful for you.

111
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:14,020
Some people learn well through a textbook. A nice thing about our is almost all of our textbooks are open access.

112
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:18,250
So these are all free chapters that you can click on and read through.

113
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:23,290
They have examples often in them, and then I'm pulling up some of these cheat sheets.

114
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:30,939
So our is big on making these things. And when I got started, I printed all these out and had them tacked up around my cubicle.

115
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:36,190
So they're designed to be for each specific topic.

116
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:39,069
So give you some helpful functions around it.

117
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:44,500
So you might want to, when you're getting started, have something sheets used to help you out so you can find there's like.

118
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:51,989
The the language of our has so many functions in it, like the vocabulary so wide.

119
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:55,500
And this can be a way of trying to narrow things down a little bit for you.

120
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:06,740
Here's links to those external resources for continuing on the class and the self-paced model.

121
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:21,240
Was curious about here. And the next thing on our agenda, we're going to do some introductions.

122
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:27,940
And my rationale for this is because our is such a community based thing.

123
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:33,490
I want us to get to know each other a little bit more. And I don't want us to feel a little bit more comfortable.

124
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:36,930
It's a vulnerable thing to ask questions and admit you're having trouble with something.

125
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:44,420
So I want to get a little bit more insight into each other, what programs we're coming from and whatnot.

126
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:49,709
So and I can go first. I will go over a name, if you like.

127
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:52,880
You can share some pronouns. Little pressure there. What program?

128
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:57,840
Your end. And I'd also like to know why you are taking this classes as an elective.

129
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:05,409
You don't have to be here. In this way, I can try to tailor what we go over to help it match your needs and expectations.

130
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,180
So everybody's different.

131
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:12,900
And I think you'll see, at least consistent with some of the other sections, we have people who have never opened the software before.

132
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:16,330
I mean, people who've been coding with it for maybe over a year or so.

133
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:20,540
So all in between, we have a lot of expertise and a lot of writing in there.

134
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:25,230
So we've got we've got room for everybody in this class.

135
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:28,640
So my name is Kelly Mikulski. I you see her pronouns.

136
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:36,510
I'm an assistant professor in the epidemiology department, and I'll just give you a background of what got me excited about her.

137
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:43,980
I was a doctoral student in this was around the year 2009.

138
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:47,280
I was very into wet lab.

139
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:59,049
I was a typesetter and I generated some weird DNA methylation data that had the file extension of got i d a t I called these high def files.

140
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:05,070
They're essentially image files and I tried to load it into sass and I said, No, thank you, please.

141
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:09,480
I tried to load it into SPF Celsius and now I try to load it into Excel as a no.

142
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:16,230
And I found some thread on the internet talking about R and somebody had some sample code for how I could load this.

143
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:21,200
And ah, so that was my first self-guided journey out of desperation.

144
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:29,220
And I came to R because it was a software that accommodated new and emerging scientific technologies.

145
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:36,570
And in the beginning, with my ah journey, I would do my data management and SAS and I would come to our for analysis.

146
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:42,090
And then over a period of a couple of years, I became really just an R programmer.

147
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:45,570
I think our also started to improve some of its data management offerings.

148
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:52,890
But, um, that's what got me into R was out of sheer desperation and wanting to graduate.

149
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,300
But I think it's paid off in the long term.

150
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,580
I think it's been completely worth it.

151
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:08,370
And hopefully this will give you some kind of introduction to our so little maybe a little more structured introduction to it than my friends going,

152
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:12,749
although that likely tends to come up over time. So if you'd like, let's start in the back burner.

153
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:16,660
I used to sit in the back of classes, so I have a particular time.

154
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:24,800
I mean, please write in probably to see her or hear you do that.

155
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:30,410
And then I think I use ah, before in undergrad I didn't get it.

156
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:33,720
So I just went, oh great, perfect one time.

157
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,380
It's great to have people from non epidemiology departments.

158
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:44,760
My classmates over here think, you know what I am Rob I am in my final semester of a movement science master's program.

159
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:49,860
There we go. Is also my second semester. I'm doing a science master's program, so it's only one year program.

160
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:56,640
That's a quick one. Yeah. To concentrate on. Yeah. You know, the ending not see him.

161
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:05,939
I was introduced to our last semester with bio stats and it was actually sort of frustrating because I feel

162
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:10,490
like the professors sort of just assumed that you knew what you were doing and I didn't and I don't know.

163
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:21,990
Okay, so I'm very into it's been a very useful tool in bio stats and as well as the research that I'm doing or trying to do.

164
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:28,910
And so I wanted to learn more about it. Just interactive elective and just kind of hoping to learn as much as I can about.

165
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:32,579
About the world. Oh, wonderful. Thank you. Welcome. Hopefully, yeah.

166
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:35,790
We'll be able to take you beyond that introduction. Yeah.

167
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:41,940
Well, my name is Marnie pronounced or she her. I am also a master's student in the movement science program.

168
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:49,409
I also do science apps and we started to use ah there specifically there's some biomechanical research,

169
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:53,550
ah seems to be one of the languages that are kind of transferable to know how nice.

170
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:57,570
So we're going to give you skills that you can put to use. Right? Right. Ready for your research?

171
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,860
Yeah. Hi, everyone. My name is. Yeah.

172
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:09,480
And the mouse. She. Her. Um, actually, I'm a new staff member in Carly's lab.

173
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:15,930
Yeah. And the reason I'm here, just because I learned Oracle by myself.

174
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:20,430
And finish my homework during my master's program.

175
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,450
So everything all by myself.

176
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:31,000
So I think this course will be a good opportunity for me to systematically learn all code and troubleshooting the animals.

177
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:37,590
Great attitude. Thank you. And I am Stephanie and my friends are sheepherders.

178
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:45,200
And the first year in general, they sent last semester to the class and to Capital City Crane,

179
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:49,590
which was an interactive mathematical pottery class, focusing on using mathematical modeling.

180
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:53,940
Wonderful. But it was like my interior art and it's hard to do that.

181
00:17:54,210 --> 00:18:02,350
Also, trend modeling. I do not want to, but I really want to get better at on sides of this thing.

182
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:12,020
Hi everyone. I'm Marcus. I use pronouns. I am first year global health and student and I'm interested in taking this class because I still can't.

183
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:16,530
Ah, before my undergrad went to expats and I also myself one semester.

184
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:20,009
So I just want to get a little bit different like I used to back on the game.

185
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:25,440
So, oh nice. I'm really interested in excited that a lot of undergraduate programs are working and are now great.

186
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:34,430
Thank you. Hi everyone. My name is with regard to my pronouns that she her and I'm a first year Ph.D. student at School of Dentistry.

187
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:39,720
Oh, great. My back stories is kind of like you. So I'm very much into wet lab and reporting and everything.

188
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:46,650
And I have all these tumors and all these slides where I'm trying to analyze the the nucleus and the morphology of the and have known.

189
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:54,180
And I've used all sorts of programs for it, like I used Halo A and then a lot of other trends.

190
00:18:54,180 --> 00:19:02,760
But I've been seeing a lot of literature that the needs to I'm using are and assessing the more common signature.

191
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,380
So that's why I'm taking this got so perfect hopes that I get to, you know, system slides.

192
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:11,549
Excellent. Welcome. I'm so interested. I'm curious how people from all these different schools.

193
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:15,180
I even heard of our little class ruling. Hi, everyone.

194
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:23,610
I'm Jeremy. Pronouns. Are he? No. I am a second year Ph.D. student in the School of Business in consumer psychology.

195
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:31,170
They want you to know, ah, however, they're not willing to teach you.

196
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:42,219
It's like a mismatch, right? So I work a lot in SPSS and when I even see that name, they just cringe.

197
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:47,280
And so I'm really working my behind off on trying to have something structured

198
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:52,140
because so teaching just hasn't really worked completely the best for me.

199
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:57,490
And so it would be great for someone to just say like, here's how to do this step by step.

200
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:03,899
Oh me. I hopefully also like I try not to be disparaging to other programing languages because,

201
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:07,979
you know, the more languages we learn, the, you know, the more it's useful to be multilingual.

202
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:11,450
And I started with a skill sets, so it's a great place to be. Yeah, yeah.

203
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:22,980
See, on the right hand are you she her pronouns and are in the first year in the hospital molecular Abby the person taking those tasks because we

204
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:33,120
learned this last semester and I know a lot of other research particularly in academia uses hard so common introduction to other persons.

205
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:40,110
Okay. Um, hi. My name is Jessica. I usually go by Jess and my friends are she her.

206
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:48,420
I'm a first year in the family program as well and I'm interested in taking this class because I use ah an undergrad for my research position,

207
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:53,010
but I kind of have a self teach myself everything. So I wanted a more formal education.

208
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:59,309
Have those. Thank you. Yeah. So it seems like people have like the talent in practice with this a little bit.

209
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:03,060
Yeah. Hi, I'm Fatima. My friends are she her?

210
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:13,770
I'm in the undergrad program. I'm a senior and I took stats intro to stats class my freshman year and we used are there.

211
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:19,500
But I'm kind of more interested in learning about it and like an MP person in an EPI context.

212
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:25,170
Yeah, I did. I also used SPSS in my research, but I think I they also prefer part.

213
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:28,440
So just trying to get more familiar with that again. Oh perfect.

214
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:37,140
Thank you. My name's was on my phone or even I'm also in the undergraduate program and I'm also a senior.

215
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,370
So this class was recommended by my, my own counselor.

216
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:49,140
So if you want a class in class one take home or something, there was a little bit of our sister brother is is a coordinator.

217
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:57,450
So I run into with that he uses like a bunch of other stuff, but that's basically like and then also I did a little bit of ah in my stem, so.

218
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:01,290
Oh wonderful. We'll get you guys some more skills. Ready just in time for graduation.

219
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:06,570
I am. I use your pronouns.

220
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:08,790
I'm in the health management policy program. Okay.

221
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:16,190
So I'm interested in because one of my classmate in HP program right now that we took class together last month.

222
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:27,010
And for one of our programs to do like on a research paper and she use ah to analyze the data and I thought that was really cool.

223
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:32,800
So you're gonna take this class and like, just to understand what our is.

224
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:37,599
Oh, fantastic. This is amazing. So we have people from all over the School of Public Health, all over the campus.

225
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:43,570
Really. And I'm excited to get to know you all more. And I hope you're similarly curious about each other as well.

226
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:53,920
So next what we'll do is slide through our we'll talk conceptually about what these programs are.

227
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:58,480
So we're going to try to understand what is our why why I would encourage you to want to use it.

228
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,040
And we're going to become a little bit familiar with the positive cloud interface that we'll use for class,

229
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:08,920
and then we'll do some basic ah as a calculator, then we'll do coding where we'll implement these activities.

230
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:18,760
So what is are as many of you are familiar with, it's a comprehensive statistical and graphical programing,

231
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:26,260
language and environment, and it's available through the Comprehensive Archive Network, this cram website.

232
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:34,249
This is kind of the. Infrastructure.

233
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:35,540
This is the key software.

234
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:41,780
And then there's this nice wrapper that goes around it that makes it more user friendly to all of us who are using it every day.

235
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,749
Up until November 20, 22, it's called Our Studio Now.

236
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:52,670
It's called Present. So I apologize. This is a recent change and my language might be imperfect here.

237
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:58,190
There's also a couple like little coding things, very few that change between the two.

238
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:05,149
They'll crop up over time. So we're in the process of transitioning this, but it's not the opposite.

239
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:14,710
And the idea behind this is to. It reflects the company's idea that you can code in more than just the language of art.

240
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,800
You can use the same software to code and sequel Python.

241
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:21,370
A number of other languages. So they found calling our studio.

242
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:28,270
People were thinking in their mind very narrowly, and now they're hoping with a more general theme that you might approach it more widely.

243
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:33,730
But of course, we will be using this code in art for the purposes of this class.

244
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:41,590
Then there's a version of POSIT called Posit Cloud, which is the web based version that we'll use for a shared environment in our classes.

245
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:46,120
This is because everybody's personal computer might be running a different version

246
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:50,900
of art and a different version of Closet and just making everything run smoothly.

247
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:57,580
I found it goes a lot more efficiently with closet. Those are how these things are related to each other.

248
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:02,950
Why are we talked about? A few of the reasons that all of you are excited here.

249
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:13,500
Some reasons that got me excited about it. I love that our is free some of you that code in SAS that has an annual subscription that's

250
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:20,580
about $100 and that can be limiting if you're in a working in a low resource community.

251
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:24,150
So our history, which I think is a real advantage.

252
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:30,240
It's also computationally fast, which I like. I do genomics data, as I mentioned.

253
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:36,960
Sometimes those datasets have 25 million rows and our doesn't even point out that has no problem.

254
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:44,069
I also like about it that it runs on many platforms, some software you can only do on Windows or something,

255
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:48,030
but here we can run all kinds of different computing systems.

256
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:59,190
Another reason I really like is that, um, I think was a little too right there at the end is that it has incredible graphics capabilities.

257
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:06,599
I'm pretty sure I got my postdoctoral fellowship because when I gave a presentation that faculty member was like, Who?

258
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:15,600
I want that plot in my lab, because plots can be such an effective way to communicate our findings, to share our public health work or whatever.

259
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:21,540
Just one you're working in and we'll see that are is infinitely customizable here in terms of graphics.

260
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:28,950
Another thing that's nice about art is that it can be it's updated every single day.

261
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,570
So there are advanced statistical methods that are not yet available in other programs.

262
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:39,670
Oftentimes, you'll see if somebody publishes a peer reviewed article, it'll come with an accompanying package.

263
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,780
So you can run those analysis right away in our.

264
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:49,850
Just like other languages, the research is reproducible. We have code we can share with each other.

265
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:58,400
So this is not unique to our but I think it is a useful feature and I also like that it's open access and open source.

266
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:04,310
So I want to see does anybody know what either of those things mean? Does anyone know what open access or open source means?

267
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:12,990
Any guesses like anyone is able and freely to contribute to the clean or to the conception of something that's new?

268
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:17,520
That is extremely well said. This is the definition of open source.

269
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:26,240
So the source code underlying that software is freely available to anyone to study it, to change it, to update it, to distribute for any purposes.

270
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:33,990
So it's kind of of openness and an open access is this idea that it's free, there's no restriction on who can use it, right?

271
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:41,720
So I think this is very powerful in terms of transparency, in terms of openness,

272
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:47,059
really, that keyword is anybody anybody think about any issues that might come up.

273
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:53,600
Is this like pinging anyone's kind of spidey senses that could be any potential problems?

274
00:27:53,870 --> 00:28:03,170
Maybe if you work for the government, they might want to make statements in private and interfere with using an open source.

275
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:07,350
Oh, yeah. You might want some of your, uh.

276
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,240
What? We can always keep our personal code private. We don't.

277
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:15,319
We're not required to share it with other people, and that's an important aspect to make.

278
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,200
Yeah. So this is the underlying code for the software.

279
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:23,779
But we can make our code, we can make decisions about how and when we're ready to share with you.

280
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:29,600
Let's agree. I appreciate it. Please. Thank you very much.

281
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:34,130
And what about the errors on the way? Right. Because there's nobody looking over this.

282
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:40,220
You're mentioning in the government there might be issues in particular where they they need an extra level of rigor.

283
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,680
They need an extra level of certification that these things are right.

284
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:49,909
So some places like I've heard in the FDA, the Drug Administration for drugs to be able to kind of market those analysis need to be done.

285
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:53,630
And that's because that company is certifying that that code is doing what it's saying.

286
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:55,070
So here we don't quite have that.

287
00:28:55,370 --> 00:29:04,630
So to that point, yeah, especially since I'm not familiar with it is there's no criteria or conditions for once you release something,

288
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:10,670
you know, one just kind of goes back to just see, is this a gene, is it not?

289
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:16,100
It's always at the users expense of using the new package or whatever.

290
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:25,520
Yeah, there's some like basic standards in terms of, um, to get your, if you want your package hosted on their AH website,

291
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:33,080
it has to adhere to certain formatting standards, but nobody accuses to make sure it does what it says.

292
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:37,520
So this is a challenge and we'll talk about ways around this.

293
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:46,580
And so really how this has been handled largely is because the user base is so large and so strong, we'll learn how to evaluate.

294
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:54,380
It's almost like a Yelp review. So for packages, have a rating at the top and you can see this is in the top 99th percentile rating.

295
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:58,760
There's also this source code is available.

296
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:05,000
You can see if people have you can submit requests for people to make if they catch an error,

297
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:08,480
you can put like a ticket in there to say, hey, there's a bug here.

298
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:16,940
And if you see a package where there's like a bunch of bugs from two years ago and they never updated it, those people are moved on to another job.

299
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:23,870
They're not they're not having that. But so there'll be certain things that we can check to make sure he's this package well-maintained.

300
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:29,510
Are there any errors that any users have? Not until other users recommend this package, these kinds of things.

301
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:33,710
By and large, the packages that we'll use in this class I have already vetted,

302
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:40,910
but we can practice vetting packages as well because I hope that you'll continue and use other packages going forward.

303
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:46,370
So many packages. What do we make. Do we use different packages for different function?

304
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:49,160
Yeah, well, I'll have like a lecture on this.

305
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:58,610
Likely not till next class, but the language of our is essentially written by users and each user organizes the,

306
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,799
the, the code they want to write in under package a set of libraries.

307
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:08,180
Those are synonyms here. So they're, those are like the units that we share code with each other.

308
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:18,340
Yeah. Nice. All right. So this is, like, really nice in some ways, but we should be aware that there's potential drawbacks.

309
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:27,200
Yeah. So just to confirm some of the things folks are talking about graduating, talking about job postings.

310
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:35,990
Here's some information from Indeed.com, which is a job posting website you can see in blue here and are postings asking for are going up over time.

311
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:42,740
There's a plot out in traffic by industry to ah. This is in 2016 versus 2017.

312
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:50,300
I can find updated information about some of the higher user groups include academia, health care and government consulting.

313
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,290
And the ones above this line mean that there's more traffic going there than the prior year.

314
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:58,849
And then this, I think, is probably the most informative one that affirms.

315
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:02,090
My choice to learn are that there's a Web site called StackOverflow,

316
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:10,070
which is one of these online user coder websites where people can share Q&A when they have issues.

317
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:15,530
And they asked how disliked is each programing language?

318
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:20,180
So up at the top, Perl is the most disliked coming in.

319
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:28,100
Like 25% of users dislike it. The one always at the bottom is R, so there's the least number of people coding an hour to dislike it.

320
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:39,680
So hopefully once you get into that, hopefully once we get going you will not dislike this process is what I think you are is constantly evolving,

321
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:44,570
however, so people make new art packages literally every day.

322
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:50,680
So our goal here in this class is not to learn everything there is to know or R,

323
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:56,600
but to focus on the process in terms of like how do we think about this?

324
00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:01,190
And this is going to be something that I hope gets stuck in your head and that

325
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:06,470
you'll hear my voice maybe like it going beyond the scope of this class.

326
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:13,490
But I hope that you, as you're doing your research, that you ask before you even run the code, what do you expect?

327
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:16,100
Then you run the code and see what you get,

328
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:21,830
and then you check to see if those two things match because R is not always going to tell you when there's a problem.

329
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:28,400
So you have to get in the habit of doing this logic check to see Does this match my expectations?

330
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:31,960
Is there something funny going on here? How are we doing?

331
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:44,390
I want to be honest that there is kind of a steep learning curve. This is because there are a lot the language of our has a lot of vocabulary in it.

332
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:51,740
Anybody who did the epidemiology curriculum and took the our introduction to sex class.

333
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:57,320
Can anybody tell me like what order of magnitude number of practice did you learn in SAS?

334
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:06,480
Maybe she sent out ten. Yeah.

335
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:12,230
So maybe somewhere around ten. So in SAS, the company makes the products.

336
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:15,850
Maybe in a semester there are around ten that you use.

337
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:20,960
What's the problem? It's. It's our action words in the so like our functions are.

338
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:29,480
Yeah. The analogous one in R would be the functions. So this is you would have like prop three to calculate frequency is or something like that.

339
00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:36,020
That was always my favorite one in R, it's a little bit different authorship.

340
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,940
So the user is making the package,

341
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:45,379
it's not the company and packages are also called libraries and then each of those contain functions and then you as the user

342
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:52,010
use them so that there's a lot of heterogeneity in terms of who wrote your package that you're using at any given time.

343
00:34:52,010 --> 00:35:00,700
So just like anything different, people are going to have different preferences, different default settings, different, yeah, all on the way.

344
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:02,750
So there's a little bit more upfront here.

345
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:09,560
What this also means is that there's a lot of ways and combinations to achieve your goals in our and that's a beautiful thing.

346
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:16,190
So if you're calling next to you, if you both have completely different approaches on any problem, no problem, that's great.

347
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:25,820
I learn new ways of coding stuff every year from this class. The other thing is it can really vary in terms of package authors.

348
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:28,730
How much time they want to put into providing you with error messages.

349
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:34,580
SAS is generally pretty excellent at giving you informative error messages and ah, we don't always get them.

350
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:41,059
So we're in a practice that logic checking. So we're going to focus on fundamentals of these building blocks.

351
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:47,520
I'm going to focus on how to learn new skills in our hopefully. All right, let's transition to the class.

352
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:52,660
So this is how we're going to interact with posit cloud in this class.

353
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:59,260
You can see on this this home page. So if you follow that link to join our class workspace here,

354
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:07,129
here is that overall class workspace Nick Jackson's ah it he had the school public health so this is like

355
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:14,660
under his tent under content there's going to be a new project or project that I'm to share with you.

356
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:17,330
For each class section, there's another tab for members.

357
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:22,219
If you want to see your colleagues and I'm here, they'll be your personal account profile while you're there.

358
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:28,160
I have a test account so that hopefully my view looks like yours, not my administrator view.

359
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:39,140
And then that was just the top row. So now we're looking at the content, some of the information here.

360
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:46,940
So there should be one with my instructor account, the introduction class.

361
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:50,990
So each class session will have a project that's shared by the instructor account.

362
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:57,500
Only one person can be in that project at a time, so we could end up ping pong.

363
00:36:57,950 --> 00:37:01,340
So I could go in there and then Yan wants to click another. She's going to kick me out.

364
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:06,230
And you at all? We're all just ping pong and nobody gets to stay. So instead what we'll do.

365
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:13,200
Click the copy button. The plus. And then you get to have your own copy of it.

366
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:19,890
So that's what made my test do that. And this is my private one that just went under your name.

367
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:24,209
Now you can edit it and see it as much as you want. So put copy.

368
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:28,710
Make your own version. Then we get inside of it.

369
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:32,590
So this is what our view and puzzle is going to look like.

370
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,040
It would look the same if you were working on your personal computer as well.

371
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:44,080
It's going to have these four panels. So the first panel in the lower left, this is our our our console.

372
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:52,200
In the upper left. This is our code editor and the upper right is our environment.

373
00:37:53,610 --> 00:38:00,510
And our lower right is kind of a catch all. It's got a bunch of tabs for files that help view our plots and whatnot.

374
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:05,910
So these are we'll talk about each of these four sections in sequence.

375
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:15,150
In general, the basic principles of coding. There's like a couple of steps in that we'll talk about who does which.

376
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:20,290
So first step, you use a programmer. You're not going to draft her.

377
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:25,330
Other people might call this input. Some people might call it commands.

378
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:30,180
This is General. You're writing texts in the language. So this would be an upper left hand corner.

379
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:37,690
You're writing some code there. Then you have to take a step to run that code, to submit that code.

380
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:41,740
So just because you write the code doesn't mean R is going to do anything with it.

381
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:43,300
You have to click to submit it.

382
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:53,530
So then that makes the R software kick in once you submit it, and it'll give you some kind of output, some results, some text in the language.

383
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:57,940
Then lastly, you have to interpret that. You have to bring some kind of meaning to it.

384
00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:01,740
So we'll practice each of these steps throughout the lesson.

385
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:08,100
If we look at the our console, this is the lower left hand corner.

386
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:12,600
This is temporary. This is where you're actually interacting with our software.

387
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:20,860
If you submit any code, it'll show up down here and R is going to use color to denote information to us.

388
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:27,880
So any output that R's providing is going to be black font and any code that we submit is going to be blue fun.

389
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:34,610
So input is blue. Output is black. And then this little symbol here.

390
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:45,210
This. I'm not like here at facing to the right that's got a command prompt that's ours way of telling you it's ready for you to submit code.

391
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:51,420
So it's telling us we finished our last job and we're ready for you code to be available.

392
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:56,130
If at any time you're missing this command prompt, are still thinking about the last thing you get.

393
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:01,049
So you wait a second. You might need to restart the program if it's been stuck for a while.

394
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:04,710
Something like that I didn't understand is my whole first day with.

395
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:08,610
I kept typing this. I thought I had to provide this, but this is just there for you.

396
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:17,110
It's an indicator that's ready. So then in the upper left hand corner, this is our code at our.

397
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:21,040
So this is how we're going to tell our to do actions.

398
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:27,519
And this is saved. It can be run later. So do you want to be typing your code up here as opposed to in the console?

399
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:31,720
Because this is more of a stable thing that we can share with people.

400
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:40,330
I want to pause for a second and see if you can notice any patterns, even if you've never coded an R and have no idea what those patterns mean.

401
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:45,700
But I want us to get in the habit of using our senses to notice patterns.

402
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:49,930
Because sometimes if we in the future identify disruptions in those patterns,

403
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:54,130
that can mean that there's an error in the code that can help us find out where to fix that error.

404
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:59,770
So does anybody notice this is just a screenshot of the code we're going to work on in the next section of the class?

405
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:03,850
Is anybody notice any patterns or any repeating symbols?

406
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:10,030
I want to talk about what those might mean. Whose? Yeah, I think the number and who.

407
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:13,910
Yeah, you see this here. So all of our numbers are showing up in blue.

408
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:19,420
So it's a good pattern. If we ever notice our numbers are not in blue, then we want to double check what's going on.

409
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:26,290
That's a great one. Notice that we're using the sounds and to create notes for yourself.

410
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:32,980
And that's when you're going, Oh, man. Yep, yep. So anything that's following the hash tag, these are notes in our.

411
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:37,240
And you notice anything after the hash tag turns green. And we can do that on a new line.

412
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:43,330
Or we could do it halfway through the line. So anything after the hash tag, these are notes and I'm going to ignore it.

413
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:50,230
Personally, I like to play as many notes as humanly possible in that code because you try to revisit it a month.

414
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:55,340
For now, I'm not going to know what's going on and try to encourage you to take a lot of notes.

415
00:41:55,950 --> 00:42:00,200
So anybody notice any other patterns? Is there achievement so far?

416
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:09,760
It puts them right by the background color change.

417
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:14,380
Oh, yeah, that's a good one. I don't like my green light.

418
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:20,510
Yeah, exactly. So. And I'm impressed that this projector is vivid enough to have that show up.

419
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:25,390
But there's portions where the background is white and portions where the background is gray.

420
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:35,140
This is a style of coding called markdown coding, where, uh, the only time we're actually talking to our software is when the background is gray.

421
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:40,570
So these gray chunks start with three back sticks.

422
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:46,570
This is not an apostrophe. That's another thing. A camera. It's like found on a keyboard in the upper left hand corner.

423
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:51,490
Call it back tech. That's all. Three back text, curly brackets, lowercase r.

424
00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:54,580
This is where we're telling it. We're coding an R. You could tell it.

425
00:42:54,580 --> 00:43:00,040
You're calling in another language like Python or something, and then it closes it out with these back checks.

426
00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:05,680
So this is anything in between here? We're actually talking our. In between for the backgrounds.

427
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:11,050
WHITE These are just notes to yourself. This is free text. You can. You can provide any kind of information there.

428
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:15,370
So the only part that's actually, ah, has this great background.

429
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:25,990
So you can make note what's the difference between the blue notes and the green notes are needed are going to ignore both of us.

430
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,879
Gotcha. Yep. This one here out in the white background.

431
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,660
There's some you can get fancy with your formatting.

432
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:40,810
So based on the number of hash tags you put will correspond to the size of the font in the ultimate document.

433
00:43:41,170 --> 00:43:47,950
So like, uh, I think it's like the fewer hash tags, the bigger the font.

434
00:43:47,950 --> 00:43:54,760
So this one's going to turn out like pretty big. You know how like in Microsoft Word, there's like a styles dropdown.

435
00:43:54,850 --> 00:43:58,360
This is essentially modifying the style of the output font in here.

436
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:01,630
You can't mess with the style with them.

437
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:05,910
This is just gonna be our default text.

438
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:10,870
Look, appearance. Yeah. Group comments. Anybody else have any other patterns they notice?

439
00:44:10,870 --> 00:44:23,640
Any any symbols? That's more than once you're using quotation marks so name things yeah appear and and they're always paired and when

440
00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:30,220
we're using quotations in the stuff in between turns green so this is one of those patterns if you ever notice that.

441
00:44:31,850 --> 00:44:35,840
Everything turns green. That means we forgot to close out that second.

442
00:44:35,930 --> 00:44:39,790
Well, so it's still going with that. So this is a good example of life.

443
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:44,660
We get to know the patterns and if you see a change in the pattern, that can help pinpoint where your errors.

444
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:52,630
So all these codes are going to always be paired and therefore providing character information, the r word star.

445
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:57,800
And we separate them by commas. This is great.

446
00:44:57,810 --> 00:45:01,490
You're picking up on all kinds of stuff. Luxury fashion.

447
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:05,870
But you don't do the back to your car. Will assume that you're speaking an order.

448
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:11,010
If we within these program, let's leave it empty.

449
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:18,180
Or if we just didn't have the at if we don't have the back text at all, it will think it's all free text.

450
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:22,860
And so it will not talk to our. So the only way to make a talk to ask to have this here.

451
00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:30,370
Yeah. I'm sure more will come up over time.

452
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:35,950
So in China are going to use different colors to denote information.

453
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:41,410
One thing, just like the quotes have to be paired, the parentheses have to be paired,

454
00:45:41,410 --> 00:45:45,580
whether they're rounded or square brackets, and learn about what's the difference between us.

455
00:45:46,270 --> 00:45:53,290
So things are going to come in tooth. We're going to use in this class a style of coding called markdown.

456
00:45:53,950 --> 00:46:01,770
That's going to include both code and output. So there's another style of coding that I think is what is taught in the biostatistics statistics class.

457
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:08,140
That is just the script does not have output.

458
00:46:08,410 --> 00:46:14,500
And the rationale why I elected to use markdown coding in this class and in my entire research group

459
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:22,780
writ large is because of the extreme frustration that can cause when somebody presents output.

460
00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:28,089
And then they give me the code from like six versions ago so they don't go

461
00:46:28,090 --> 00:46:31,600
together the style of markdown to make sure that if we're looking at output,

462
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:36,040
we always know what code produces that. So there's no you can't mix that up.

463
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:41,050
They're always come together. And here's what that looks like, a little bit anatomy of a markdown file.

464
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:44,500
So all these markdown files are going to start with a header.

465
00:46:45,650 --> 00:46:52,190
There's only one of those. So at the top of the file it starts and ends with these three dashes is where you give information like the title,

466
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:56,450
who's the author, what's the date, what are you doing and what type of report do you want?

467
00:46:56,600 --> 00:47:03,710
So here I'm saying I want my report to be a website, but you can make your report a PDF, a word document, whatever.

468
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:09,940
The next. Sorry, this is not free text. This is what you're asking about. What's that?

469
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:18,400
Blue font. So here we'll have, like, be like bold of a header, and he would just be regular text and you can put anything you want in there.

470
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:24,590
This is not talking to Aria. Here's the part where it is actually talking to her.

471
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:30,240
So these are called code chunks. And this is anything within their subnet arm.

472
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:35,250
And then below that is our output. So you can see here's our code one plus one.

473
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:39,480
The output is two. So they're stitched next to each other.

474
00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:43,320
So any time we're looking at output, we have the code that produced it.

475
00:47:43,950 --> 00:47:47,970
And so they're not disconnected. We know where everything came from.

476
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:55,020
And this makes them really nice output. Well, I think I'll maybe that'll come up in a minute.

477
00:47:55,500 --> 00:48:00,750
So there are mathematical symbols we can use that provide some meaning.

478
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:05,220
So some of these here addition subtraction, this is all within those are code chunks.

479
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:12,210
So there will be additional logical ones for like greater than or equal to these types of things.

480
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:21,000
We will work with these in the future, in the class. But when you're done, we we can when you're done, like drafting code.

481
00:48:22,310 --> 00:48:27,980
We can submit it. So we transfer that code from our code file to the council.

482
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:33,320
We have a couple options for doing this. So this is like once we've written it and now we actually want to run it.

483
00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:43,470
The Key Stroke command center. If you have a mac, if you're on a PC or two control, enter.

484
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:49,890
Or you can click, right? There's like a little run button and say, Run whatever line you're selected.

485
00:48:50,950 --> 00:48:54,010
Or you can copy and paste the code from the console into the here.

486
00:48:55,480 --> 00:49:07,750
Copy. Paste the code from the code editor into the console. Does it matter where where the cursor is like when you decide to submit the code?

487
00:49:08,110 --> 00:49:13,330
Mm hmm. Wherever your cursor is, it'll run whatever line the cursor is on.

488
00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:16,840
Or if this has, like, multiple lines for the same line of code.

489
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:22,510
As long as I put it anywhere within here, it'll run this entire. It knows that this all goes to itself.

490
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:29,420
So you don't have to like highlight the whole thing if you don't want to put your cursor anywhere in that line.

491
00:49:33,850 --> 00:49:42,400
But it wouldn't do it. Like, let's say, for instance, everything blue and above was code that could be submitted.

492
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:50,590
If I put the cursor. Like with this question mark, is it would you do deadline or deadline?

493
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:59,290
Everything before it just like the on or if because this is it or if this is like incomplete alone,

494
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:04,390
it would do like the this is like a a it would complete the function.

495
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:08,070
Yeah. Especially and we'll trial and error this. We'll see what happens.

496
00:50:08,290 --> 00:50:11,830
Yeah, I remember. I like to take my word for it. Well, we'll see what happens.

497
00:50:11,870 --> 00:50:14,949
We put our cursor in different places, but it won't let it go.

498
00:50:14,950 --> 00:50:22,429
Run everything about it. When you're totally done with your card, when you're ready, you're like, okay, I've done it.

499
00:50:22,430 --> 00:50:23,569
I've checked my output,

500
00:50:23,570 --> 00:50:31,250
and now I want to produce a report to give my homework to Kelly or to share with my colleagues that I've got this nice analysis.

501
00:50:32,210 --> 00:50:39,500
We're going to click this render button at the top. And this is going to build us this beautiful report.

502
00:50:39,590 --> 00:50:43,639
So this is how we're going to go from something that looks maybe less approachable.

503
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:47,270
This is code to an output document.

504
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:55,280
So by clicking around Earth, this is going to produce this code. So you can see here this like white background stuff ends up looking pretty nice.

505
00:50:55,310 --> 00:50:58,490
So the, the stuff with the two hash tags is like this bolded one.

506
00:50:58,730 --> 00:51:04,520
This part without any hash tags is like standard text and there's different symbols.

507
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:09,829
Like you can use asterisk to make a word bolded and there's different like text formatting things.

508
00:51:09,830 --> 00:51:10,310
You can do that.

509
00:51:10,490 --> 00:51:19,340
But the key part for us is this code chop now shows up as code and the output shows up as output and they're right next to each other.

510
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:27,750
So every time you want to show results to your colleagues, you've got those results and you've got the code that is used to generate it.

511
00:51:27,770 --> 00:51:33,409
So it makes for a lot less errors, makes for stronger communication of your work to your colleagues.

512
00:51:33,410 --> 00:51:39,680
And I think this just looks quite professional. So people are impressed you're able to produce one of these professional documents.

513
00:51:40,070 --> 00:51:45,920
So here I did it with a HTML format, but if you want to make even put Doc X, you could put PDF,

514
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:51,200
you can make different formats because for a second, how are you doing with these reports?

515
00:51:52,130 --> 00:51:56,030
So this could be how you could make your homework for me. That 100 code in your output.

516
00:51:57,820 --> 00:52:01,710
They are put as a bracket and a one is. What does that mean?

517
00:52:02,730 --> 00:52:07,530
Well, yeah, that's a good point. So, um, our is going to use these square brackets.

518
00:52:08,830 --> 00:52:17,860
To index or look at positions. So this output is actually saying one plus one is equal to the value of two in position one.

519
00:52:19,110 --> 00:52:24,150
So this only has one position right now, but we will in the future be working with large data sets.

520
00:52:24,450 --> 00:52:29,850
So we might have 100 participants, so we might have a value in position 79.

521
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:37,080
So information and our is not just the value, it also matters where in that object it is.

522
00:52:37,710 --> 00:52:42,630
We will see how to use these square brackets to show position value.

523
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:57,579
So a great question. Right in the upper right corner or that we're still on our tour of our posit is the environment.

524
00:52:57,580 --> 00:53:00,940
These are going to be all of these objects and we'll talk about objects in more detail.

525
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:07,030
This is also called our workspace. We're going to double click on them at any time if we want to look at them.

526
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:11,530
And then the lower right hand corner, the sort of our catch all area.

527
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:15,640
So the files, this is going to be the files that I'm sharing with you through the class.

528
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:21,340
But you can make your own files. You can double click on them to open them in a new window.

529
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:24,970
And if you want to take them out of the cloud and use them on your personal computer,

530
00:53:25,690 --> 00:53:30,010
you can check the box next to them and then click this more button.

531
00:53:31,770 --> 00:53:39,810
And then there'll be an export dropdown menu. So you can take things off of our cloud browser and put them on your personal computer.

532
00:53:43,550 --> 00:53:48,320
Another tab in the lower right next to files is this one we're going to use constantly as a help viewer.

533
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:57,560
This is one nice thing about art. Even though different people right up have a uniform format for our health files across every package.

534
00:53:57,560 --> 00:54:03,230
So all practice looking at new functions in help, you are pulling meaningful information out of those.

535
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:12,010
So by way of recap, the process of coding is you draft code, you decide you want to submit it and then we'll give you the output.

536
00:54:13,310 --> 00:54:23,300
In our posit viewer, we have panels in the lower left for a console, in the upper left for the code out of the upper right for the environment.

537
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:28,130
And then in the lower right we have files and help each class.

538
00:54:28,130 --> 00:54:33,080
I'll give you in our project, our projects are going to have code output data, all kinds of stuff.

539
00:54:34,190 --> 00:54:39,170
And then we saw that these operator symbols, these calculator symbols, they have special meaning in art.

540
00:54:39,650 --> 00:54:47,180
So the big one, this is probably going to be the biggest section of slides we do all semester, but I really want it to get us ready to start coding.

541
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:50,750
So let's pause for a second what kind of questions you folks have.

542
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:03,900
But we're going to take a break. Let me check the clusters. If you're sitting on my phone now, how about, well, restart.

543
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:08,490
So this will be 3 p.m. because this is a different start time.

544
00:55:10,170 --> 00:55:13,220
And we will. When we come back, we'll start cold and pausing.

545
00:55:13,770 --> 00:55:17,220
Take a couple minutes break, stretch it out and we'll be back now.

546
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:26,610
So when you walk like I just think it's really easy to work.

547
00:55:27,210 --> 00:55:31,070
It will automatically be with me at my birthday.

548
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:36,160
Well, within the 30 years I do it over. Once you install it earlier.

549
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:43,440
Yeah. So it won't be there right away. It's more like this extra step is pulling the package from the 900 meters.

550
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:50,110
And once you do that and you'll have to go with all of that,

551
00:55:50,190 --> 00:55:59,950
you have to go to the I you got to put that into the work because you want to be packages that come inside certain.

552
00:55:59,970 --> 00:56:07,570
So they give you someone like you and so you want to be able to get some momentum around anyway.

553
00:56:07,650 --> 00:56:12,850
You want to add it to that to get over to the lab.

554
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:16,900
Does it work without done?

555
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:24,560
I always say you're going to become a bystander. I went out in those days based on packages.

556
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:28,410
You can do a ton of stuff. Yeah. So you can get going out of there.

557
00:56:29,610 --> 00:56:35,939
I think there were 725 right at Walmart and they're good ones.

558
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:44,500
It's like I mean some they're like these are like useful things that you can review here.

559
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:52,590
And also, you know, yeah, these are things that are fun and stuff.

560
00:56:52,640 --> 00:57:03,950
And inevitably the questions and if you hold on right, yeah, that's going to India is actually going to be able to do in Google search, right.

561
00:57:04,530 --> 00:57:14,430
And then there's like people here are just my paperwork like, you know, but yeah, but there are supply side applicable.

562
00:57:14,550 --> 00:57:27,570
So I'm starting tomorrow night when you take over 220 over a month nightmare.

563
00:57:27,690 --> 00:57:38,160
I mean I don't know if you couldn't read that much, but yeah, Academy is really good for all.

564
00:57:39,550 --> 00:57:48,120
I mean, I haven't mentioned the name of it show on August six.

565
00:57:49,470 --> 00:58:05,520
Well, I got to get this night going to just really have to go home.

566
00:58:07,830 --> 00:58:10,200
Yeah, I'm not doing. I mean, I don't know. I'm doing it. Yeah.

567
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:22,030
Or somebody doing the lecture last year and they just released in less than 3 hours, you know.

568
00:58:22,050 --> 00:58:29,790
What do you mean? When I was teaching a master's degree, the option or learning curve now for $3.

569
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:35,340
Yeah, I can. I could do X amount of classes I didn't do.

570
00:58:35,340 --> 00:58:42,860
Right. Yeah, you're absolutely right.

571
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:50,130
Now there's a lot going on behind that. So I would say, like, I really like, but I didn't want that.

572
00:58:50,150 --> 00:58:54,389
I couldn't control them like that. I'm just a minority myself, I think.

573
00:58:54,390 --> 00:58:57,480
Like, I really like.

574
00:58:59,390 --> 00:59:02,430
I was involved in that, too, all day. Every other day.

575
00:59:02,430 --> 00:59:23,759
And it's all. And then they had to put them out in the music and it was like your family started to have you like, what?

576
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:28,740
We are really good at. How are you going to do it? Yes, that's how I've been lucky did most of the content.

577
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:37,080
And then I realized that I know them. Like there's no way of saying, how did you get away with it?

578
00:59:37,650 --> 00:59:42,660
Is that kind of like a bad thing that they're here?

579
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:46,110
When I first met you was I don't know.

580
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:55,340
It also looks like these are like towards the end, this messed up of this all created test.

581
00:59:55,390 --> 00:59:58,620
You don't use those things like you are. You are. You are. Exactly.

582
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:03,060
Yeah. So that allows, you know, you can have time for while.

583
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:09,410
So what? I didn't know what I mean.

584
01:00:09,660 --> 01:00:13,420
You know, I think it's harder, if you will, in person.

585
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:23,220
I am, I guess. And like they get more general feeling, it's like saying right now.

586
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:30,830
But that's not really true that I think everyone, I mean, should feel like I.

587
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:35,730
I don't know what you're saying. I'm the biggest one there.

588
01:00:35,730 --> 01:00:41,250
And it just was the first opportunity that I am ultimately.

589
01:00:42,230 --> 01:00:52,950
I glad to do this, you know, because I listen, there is a great number in cause the 40 minutes,

590
01:00:53,550 --> 01:01:01,620
but they're like, you know what, I think you I'm struggling to right here.

591
01:01:01,970 --> 01:01:10,020
And like you said, it's up to you, but only the same level, whether it's like doing great.

592
01:01:10,530 --> 01:01:30,360
I mean, all you had to go on point is, you know, so I don't I did my well but I did my take on doing all this stuff got sick research,

593
01:01:30,870 --> 01:01:39,570
no independence them actually sort of like we sort of like all these reason you're going to do you have to

594
01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:48,330
like I need you to read neutral you just like you can imagine any kinds of circumstances are completely free.

595
01:01:48,540 --> 01:01:59,690
Right? I'm trying to do 3 hours a day initiative, which is northeast.

596
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:07,410
Right. Welcome back, everybody. Let's go ahead and follow these links to get to our class closet cloud.

597
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:14,550
So here's the general link. But to join the first time, here's the thing. Now I have another I said three things actually that.

598
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:20,909
Oh yeah. I mean a first. Yeah, there'll be a Panopto available for checking this.

599
01:02:20,910 --> 01:02:28,260
Right. All right. So if anybody's having any challenges joining the workspace, we have sort of listserv,

600
01:02:28,270 --> 01:02:35,760
but so those are the same links that are provided on the activities before first class as well.

601
01:02:38,250 --> 01:02:41,680
So we are, you went through that and we can just log into closet. Mm.

602
01:02:43,230 --> 01:02:49,920
Yeah. And if you just log in generically it might look like it might have on the left hand side of

603
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:54,600
your personal workspace which might be empty if you're new to this and then this one for class.

604
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:59,970
So you can click into the class workspace. Once you do that, one time, it'll show up here.

605
01:03:02,350 --> 01:03:08,180
So what we're gonna do right now is look at the one for introduction and click the copy.

606
01:03:10,140 --> 01:03:14,750
So I'm gather our my student council should look just like yours, and you can click the copy to get a new.

607
01:03:14,790 --> 01:03:32,760
And I'll ask you, are you sure you want to make copy or say yes? But.

608
01:03:38,420 --> 01:03:43,060
You ever want to get back to that view? You can click the class name up here.

609
01:03:43,940 --> 01:03:50,260
I'll send you back to there. But now I've got one. You'll have one under under your name so you can click to reenter.

610
01:03:50,620 --> 01:03:54,170
So this is your version? I'm not going to go in there.

611
01:03:54,190 --> 01:04:02,650
This is just for you to go in and out, save whatever you want. So I click the name of the class workspace, so leave it, and then I can go back in.

612
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:12,160
So what do we see? We've got three.

613
01:04:13,770 --> 01:04:18,810
Boxes. I thought I spent all this time telling you that we're expecting for what is missing.

614
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:23,610
What do you notice? What's your what's your what pattern are you noticing?

615
01:04:23,650 --> 01:04:30,200
Who's got less sections do we have on what's missing in the code after losing the code editor.

616
01:04:30,210 --> 01:04:36,150
So let's open a code. So we've got the our console, we've got the environment.

617
01:04:36,150 --> 01:04:39,270
Once you click over to it, we've got the files.

618
01:04:39,270 --> 01:04:42,600
And where we're going to get the code file is in our files here.

619
01:04:42,690 --> 01:04:46,790
So these are the files I'm sharing with you. Presumed dead right now.

620
01:04:48,290 --> 01:04:56,050
The one that we're going to use is the markdown file. So it ends with the file extension of that queue and the class introduction after.

621
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:03,090
I sort of a click to open class on introduction that queue empty.

622
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:10,930
And once I click on that should pop up in the upper left hand corner here right now have four panels.

623
01:05:12,820 --> 01:05:16,210
So we see up here we've got this header, the start of the markup.

624
01:05:16,540 --> 01:05:18,339
Go ahead and add your name to the author left.

625
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:26,260
So if we share if you share this with other people, take some ownership over it so people know who's been editing this code,

626
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:30,250
who's who's bad, have their hands on it and this type of work.

627
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:35,320
So this is telling us we've got our title, we've got our author, our date and our format.

628
01:05:35,330 --> 01:05:40,780
This is a format when we click render, when we're done with it, it's going to make it each HTML if you want.

629
01:05:40,780 --> 01:05:49,050
You could switch that out and put. Or if you want, you could say Doc X.

630
01:05:50,430 --> 01:05:54,870
So here's where you say in that output report what format you want that to be.

631
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:07,909
Scroll is down a little more, then we end the header with the three hashes and now this is just free text.

632
01:06:07,910 --> 01:06:11,750
So this is some information. This is consistent with what was on our slides.

633
01:06:11,750 --> 01:06:16,070
So some background. Reminding us to click that render.

634
01:06:16,250 --> 01:06:21,170
And I want to. So here is our first actual code you can tell our.

635
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:26,970
Probably to her boss the way that all the way until like 926 to actually get into our code.

636
01:06:28,190 --> 01:06:33,410
So let's practice trying to run it. Can anybody remind me what is one of the ways?

637
01:06:33,590 --> 01:06:37,280
So we've got code in here in this, our code chunk.

638
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:41,960
But how do we actually run it right now? It hasn't been running. What's what's one option or run code?

639
01:06:42,050 --> 01:06:47,390
And you're only think of one. You can click on it in the neighborhood.

640
01:06:47,810 --> 01:06:53,300
Yeah. We can put our cursor at the end of the line or anywhere in the line and then there's a button up top doesn't run.

641
01:06:55,040 --> 01:07:00,709
And I say, run those lines. And we notice now output shows up right below it.

642
01:07:00,710 --> 01:07:04,070
So it wasn't there before. We've got the output right below the code.

643
01:07:04,070 --> 01:07:07,610
Those are like there and there's no like lines for that because it's not coded.

644
01:07:07,610 --> 01:07:14,090
Marcus Is that correct? Okay. I think it's a different way to run code and that is command center.

645
01:07:14,210 --> 01:07:19,760
Yeah, we could put our cursor on the line. And if you're on a mac, it's command center.

646
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:24,650
If you're on a PC, it's control center. So we'll do the exact same thing.

647
01:07:28,090 --> 01:07:32,860
When you hit it, when you go hit and run, which one do you like when it drops down?

648
01:07:33,130 --> 01:07:39,130
Yeah, let's try different stuff. So we could you see there's a dropdown menu, there's a lot of options.

649
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:46,540
The one that I clicked first was this run selected line for those control center, and that's going to run whatever lines or cursors next to you.

650
01:07:46,930 --> 01:07:54,250
But if you want, we could run the entire chunk. Right now this is the entire chunk, but we could run like run the current chunk.

651
01:07:54,850 --> 01:07:59,650
And that will run not just the line we're on right now, but that will run anything in that block.

652
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:04,930
Other options in there. What are some of the other options?

653
01:08:05,770 --> 01:08:10,639
Some of the other ones are like run all of the chunks above it or run all the chunks below it so

654
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:16,590
we can try on air and play with some of these different options that might be applicable here.

655
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:19,809
Like if things get really awry, you might want to restart our.

656
01:08:19,810 --> 01:08:23,560
But probably right now I think things are going pretty smoothly. I don't want this type of situation.

657
01:08:24,550 --> 01:08:27,820
But so there are some some options in here that you could play with.

658
01:08:30,630 --> 01:08:37,770
In general and Lakota here. I'll probably just run one line at a time so that we can see right away what the output is.

659
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:42,600
So I'll probably mostly use control enforcement and try to run my line at time.

660
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:53,450
What if we want to make a new coach? And where do these things come from? So can anybody help me here?

661
01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:59,160
I've made a blanco chunk here. So anybody have a guess where?

662
01:08:59,330 --> 01:09:08,920
Well, what would be your first thing you would do if you wanted to make a new coach on somewhere to start working on?

663
01:09:09,650 --> 01:09:12,680
I'm deliberately asking you some things that we haven't talked yet,

664
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:17,690
because a lot of stuff with art is kind of like, okay, let's see if we can figure this out together.

665
01:09:18,380 --> 01:09:22,940
So we can press we can press that. Let's see the the green button.

666
01:09:23,060 --> 01:09:27,650
Oh, nice. Remind us that here first I'm going to hit enter a couple times just to get myself some space.

667
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:32,930
But then you mention that there's this green C plus button here. Let's try that, see what happens.

668
01:09:34,220 --> 01:09:39,080
But then we get a new coach on. And if you ever forget what it is, if you hover over it, I'll tell you what it does.

669
01:09:39,350 --> 01:09:42,920
So insert new coaching. It also tells you, Oh, here's a keystroke command.

670
01:09:43,870 --> 01:09:48,340
So if we if you don't like pointing and clicking, we can click control.

671
01:09:48,750 --> 01:09:52,570
All I can do on our command, I if you're on a map.

672
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:57,220
So we can do that with keystroke control.

673
01:09:57,250 --> 01:10:00,880
All right. We got a new one. Yeah, I have a question.

674
01:10:00,890 --> 01:10:09,940
So if the cursor is inside, that could jump, and then we proceed, and then it sees jump three jump forward, which is what I did.

675
01:10:10,180 --> 01:10:13,210
Oh. So how do. How do I know? Because.

676
01:10:13,570 --> 01:10:18,700
Oh, does that come out? I've never tried that before. What happened? So if we're trying to make a chunk with a chunk, probably we don't want that.

677
01:10:18,940 --> 01:10:23,500
But if we do that by accident, what happens? Oh, it just, like, splits them.

678
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:29,710
Oh, yeah. That's what you see on the menu is command and whatever.

679
01:10:30,310 --> 01:10:35,950
All right, so command, ma'am.

680
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:48,729
Well, and then I think it will replace that for control, which then if you ever forget what it is,

681
01:10:48,730 --> 01:10:54,230
you can just, like, hover over the button, and it should show you and I.

682
01:10:54,380 --> 01:10:58,570
You could do it sometimes. You could just copy it. So I can right click it.

683
01:10:59,970 --> 01:11:09,130
Copy. And so no one. That's right.

684
01:11:09,550 --> 01:11:14,440
Another way we could do it. We could type it. So remember, what do I call these little symbols?

685
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:19,780
And that apostrophe is one of those things that back text so we can find those on our keyboard.

686
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:28,710
One, two, three. Make a curly bracket. Are. And then at the end we can make one, two or three to close it out.

687
01:11:30,090 --> 01:11:34,660
So you can type it. You can copy paste that. You can use a C++ riser.

688
01:11:34,890 --> 01:11:38,310
So if you need a space to code an R, we can create and move the way.

689
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:42,800
Yes. I like a but I do what you do.

690
01:11:43,030 --> 01:11:50,040
Yeah. You can do control Z or Command Z, and that'll undo your last action.

691
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:57,380
You can also get that up here under edit. There's a undo a redo.

692
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:01,390
So if you ever a control. Yeah. Control Z.

693
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:07,090
Is that what I said? Okay. So I'm willing to give you two.

694
01:12:08,450 --> 01:12:15,930
Yeah. When I was using our last semester, generally improperly, I imagine we never use the tactics in,

695
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:20,780
in the art that is, that is that a function of this type of coding that we're doing.

696
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:27,439
Yeah. And that is a completely valid way to code also. So how do we get that version of ah, that might look more familiar.

697
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:31,160
We can go to file new file and now we've got an option.

698
01:12:31,220 --> 01:12:34,400
So look at all these different file types we can use in this software.

699
01:12:34,790 --> 01:12:38,920
The one that I think you were using in biostatistics classes, it was one at the top called Our Script.

700
01:12:38,930 --> 01:12:42,790
So let's do one of those. File, new file.

701
01:12:42,820 --> 01:12:49,360
Our script. This whole thing is in our script. So if we like print.

702
01:12:50,210 --> 01:12:55,140
Hello. We never need to tell it.

703
01:12:56,240 --> 01:12:59,330
It's all because the whole thing is are by default. But you not.

704
01:12:59,330 --> 01:13:03,860
That's when I run it. The output shows up down here in the console. The output doesn't stick to the code.

705
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:09,460
So we have to track those two things separately. And I notice it's the least amount of work.

706
01:13:09,470 --> 01:13:13,130
So it's very hard to keep track of everything.

707
01:13:13,430 --> 01:13:19,820
If you are holding these two things in different places, you might those might be on code version five and this might be an output version.

708
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:21,410
Something like this.

709
01:13:21,770 --> 01:13:28,280
So this is a completely fine way of coding it, if you want to think of it this way in my class and just like copy and paste the output together.

710
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:32,800
No problem. It's like that way is working for you. Keep doing it.

711
01:13:32,850 --> 01:13:36,650
Do what you like. Everybody codes a little differently. This way of coding.

712
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:43,220
If we want to make a new one, we would go file a new file. File a new file.

713
01:13:44,330 --> 01:13:51,460
This is called a quarto document. You can't say we want a new one.

714
01:13:51,490 --> 01:13:54,590
I'm just saying if I create it and it gives us.

715
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:59,200
So if we click over to the source viewer, this is what we've got going on right here.

716
01:14:00,580 --> 01:14:05,080
So that other way of connecting with file, new file, our script, and that is completely fine.

717
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:07,810
You just have to copy and paste your code and your output together.

718
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:14,650
If you would like to make the computer copy, paste them together for you, you think go file and file and code with your.

719
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:20,030
Virtual document. See what preferences you develop over time.

720
01:14:20,030 --> 01:14:26,220
See what you like. See what's easier for you to maintain forever is going to have the least amount of resistance, you know?

721
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:34,820
So you're saying that the import of that the the quarto way tracks the code that we enter in the output.

722
01:14:34,830 --> 01:14:36,739
It is tracking it line by line.

723
01:14:36,740 --> 01:14:47,450
So that's easier to keep up with what we were doing versus is just easier to track step line by line versus the other way, does it the other way?

724
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:51,770
Everything everything's going to say impact your outputs, not even getting saved.

725
01:14:51,770 --> 01:14:55,310
You're only saving the code and that's on you to like.

726
01:14:55,850 --> 01:15:08,140
I'd have to go over here and like. Grab the output from the console and paste it here with a hash tag in front of it.

727
01:15:09,190 --> 01:15:17,980
If I run like it's a lot of manual labor too, and I might forget to copy and paste it on time.

728
01:15:20,340 --> 01:15:23,340
Everything is just separate and it's for me, this is more manual.

729
01:15:24,610 --> 01:15:28,510
This way. It's as soon as you run it. The output is right there.

730
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:38,280
You got two options. Let's scroll down a little bit.

731
01:15:38,290 --> 01:15:44,290
It might be a different line number for you because I've been making code chunks left and right, but there should be one all about calculator demo.

732
01:15:44,890 --> 01:15:48,610
So we're going to work with some keystrokes calculator t shirts and see what happens.

733
01:15:48,970 --> 01:15:58,570
So the nice thing is some of the symbols have special meaning in our that hopefully some of these symbols are intuitive and you don't need to carry

734
01:15:58,570 --> 01:16:06,880
around like a to 83 calculator like I used to have to bring to class because all of that functionality is here in our on your computer at any time.

735
01:16:07,450 --> 01:16:12,909
So that plus minus is used for addition. Before I do it, I always have a logic check and double checks.

736
01:16:12,910 --> 01:16:19,600
Okay. What do I expect? Do expect this type of value for if I want to run just one line of code, I do control enter.

737
01:16:20,380 --> 01:16:24,310
I see that that comes with the output value a for anybody.

738
01:16:24,310 --> 01:16:28,180
Have a guess. What do you think this asterisk is going to be a multiplier?

739
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:31,880
Yeah. So I expect this one to give us a value of eight now.

740
01:16:32,820 --> 01:16:38,049
So yeah. What about this, like uppercase or upward facing here?

741
01:16:38,050 --> 01:16:48,250
What do you think? Now let's go to exponential. So I expect this to to the third power outside the value of eight and ah follow orders of operations.

742
01:16:48,250 --> 01:16:54,900
If you give it parentheses it will do whatever inside the parentheses first so you can get it,

743
01:16:54,910 --> 01:17:00,430
continue to give it more complex jobs to do than you want to do.

744
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:05,420
They may have a guess what that backslash will be all about, but yeah, that's a division.

745
01:17:07,420 --> 01:17:09,910
Okay. So so far I've been running code line by line.

746
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:16,930
There's this nice play button here in the screenplay, but if I want to run the whole code chunk together.

747
01:17:18,940 --> 01:17:24,630
I can click that green play button and that'll run everything and all the output will show up and order.

748
01:17:25,660 --> 01:17:33,680
Same order that it is up here. When you double.

749
01:17:33,770 --> 01:17:41,240
So each group, each line of code is like space.

750
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:47,989
Mm hmm. Do we always do that, or. That's just for, like, personal preference and visual.

751
01:17:47,990 --> 01:17:50,069
Same. Oh, yeah. Let's see what happens.

752
01:17:50,070 --> 01:17:57,080
So if I get rid of some of this, like, free space in between here, and if I take away some of this, like, spacing in between here.

753
01:17:59,980 --> 01:18:05,020
We've got value of two in there. Let's see, does it do we truly do we get the same value?

754
01:18:05,020 --> 01:18:10,210
So I'm expecting these last two values to be 38 and 47. Do they come at the same?

755
01:18:11,770 --> 01:18:15,310
Oh yeah. They still come out the same. So R is going to ignore spaces.

756
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:18,430
So this is going to have implications in the future.

757
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:24,400
But so any spaces you want to put within a line and these spaces between lines are going to ignore that.

758
01:18:24,940 --> 01:18:32,350
So that's purely my esthetic preference. I find it easier to see things we're learning spread out, but you don't have to go that way.

759
01:18:35,140 --> 01:18:42,280
Yeah. When we read a single line of code and then ran another single line to replace the previous.

760
01:18:42,310 --> 01:18:49,080
Mm hmm. With the new answer? Yep. Uh, I think there's a question in there.

761
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:52,870
I'm not exactly suggesting that is true. That exactly happened.

762
01:18:53,610 --> 01:18:56,850
If we want to run multiple stuff at once, we got to highlight them all.

763
01:18:57,980 --> 01:19:05,370
And Click Run. Selected lines. Then we get all of the output, or if we had the play button, it'll run all of it.

764
01:19:05,700 --> 01:19:10,290
But if we submit only one line of code, it's going to give us just one line of output.

765
01:19:12,910 --> 01:19:16,210
And then if we want. So if we wanted that directly underneath it. Yeah.

766
01:19:16,690 --> 01:19:21,620
We would have to close the ah. And open anyone. Ooh. But one more like really ready to make our report.

767
01:19:21,640 --> 01:19:28,120
Let's try it right now. Let me hit the render button. And see what it's going to cause.

768
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:32,890
It's going to look a little bit different in the final report than it looks right here in this interactive viewer.

769
01:19:34,090 --> 01:19:37,990
All right. We attempted to make an external browser.

770
01:19:39,250 --> 01:19:42,970
I have pop up blocker, but we can't get it from here. So which which one did I make?

771
01:19:43,300 --> 01:19:48,610
I think I did a dark x file this time so I can click to download.

772
01:19:48,610 --> 01:19:56,589
This is go to the select model what we do for Mark. So I just rendered I made a dark x you can see it's I rendered it, it came out.

773
01:19:56,590 --> 01:19:59,350
It's brand new for January 10th. We just ran that.

774
01:19:59,350 --> 01:20:08,320
So I'm going to put check the box next to it and then click this gear to export it and look at it, see what the output looks like.

775
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:19,480
So you see, like traditionally I'm on at 121 line of code, it shows up like right beneath it.

776
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:24,100
And when you have like a code chunk, it also shows up.

777
01:20:24,100 --> 01:20:26,340
It needs that. So now it's split it up for us.

778
01:20:26,370 --> 01:20:32,679
It's not just putting all the output on the code and then all the output we see the output like actually printing right.

779
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:36,940
Max the one that it corresponded to. So when you when you click the render button,

780
01:20:37,180 --> 01:20:42,850
they are actually next to each other in a way that it's not quite in them when you're in the interactive type of code.

781
01:20:43,150 --> 01:20:48,100
So when you render, it's going to automatically run it for you don't have to preview.

782
01:20:48,100 --> 01:20:51,700
It is just boom. Yeah. Okay. It's like lovely.

783
01:20:51,700 --> 01:20:56,140
It acts like a completely separate planet and it runs everything top to bottom.

784
01:20:56,530 --> 01:21:01,580
Make sure everything works. Um, it ignores everything else that you have going on.

785
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:06,490
Any other projects you're working on, it will just do what you have on, like, code.

786
01:21:07,420 --> 01:21:15,440
Makes like, a nice report for you. These are these are I appreciate I'm really burning through.

787
01:21:15,620 --> 01:21:19,670
Like what happens when we do this and that? Like, spirit of experimentation is is great.

788
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:25,420
And I hope it continues throughout this whole process because a lot of this is like, well, what happens when we do this?

789
01:21:25,430 --> 01:21:29,510
What have we learned of this? Let's do a check, Your Honor, saying how Ciara is doing.

790
01:21:29,810 --> 01:21:35,930
So I want you to make a coach up and try to evaluate some of these calculator

791
01:21:35,930 --> 01:21:41,810
operations to see if you can appoint yourself with some of those capabilities.

792
01:21:44,900 --> 01:22:22,820
Feel free to talk to your neighbors or as a community spark. It's.

793
01:22:42,870 --> 01:23:39,290
We're. Can I shot?

794
01:23:39,320 --> 01:23:42,650
Who can help me out? How are we going to start making an art coaching?

795
01:23:45,220 --> 01:23:48,480
Yes, it's tough to say exactly.

796
01:23:48,490 --> 01:23:53,950
So I might click enter a couple of times, give myself some space to work with and then to make a two hour coaching.

797
01:23:53,960 --> 01:24:01,090
One option would be to hit this the Green C plus. Or you can do one of those keystroke commands that we wrote over there.

798
01:24:02,110 --> 01:24:05,320
So now we're right in here. We've got some space to work.

799
01:24:06,010 --> 01:24:09,130
What did anybody do to evaluate that first line?

800
01:24:16,090 --> 01:24:23,350
Talk me through what I should type. Yeah. Mechanically, that two plus two and then a star.

801
01:24:23,380 --> 01:24:28,180
Oh yeah. The asterisk. Yes. Then three, then divided by the backslash.

802
01:24:28,180 --> 01:24:34,899
Yeah. For minus three. Yeah. So just practicing what are these different locations on the keyboard.

803
01:24:34,900 --> 01:24:38,090
What do they do and what not. What?

804
01:24:38,170 --> 01:24:44,170
Not a backslash where it flashes to the right. Right.

805
01:24:46,390 --> 01:24:51,610
The other one. And you notice that our runs each if you click enter each line of code is separate.

806
01:24:51,650 --> 01:24:58,780
Those of you that may have coded in SAS before each line has to end with a semicolon, but that's not really here.

807
01:24:58,780 --> 01:25:05,110
So it's just like as soon as you click enter, it thinks it's a new it's a new thing you're coding.

808
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:18,820
So it might do two times three divided by four, you know, like just practice, practice with the different operators.

809
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:23,710
How do I do this other than this to the fourth power was the symbol for that kind of.

810
01:25:24,060 --> 01:25:29,530
Yeah. Oh yeah. Like upward facing carrot and then minus one.

811
01:25:31,080 --> 01:25:36,730
Okay, now we're going to run them all together. So you're trying to do on a separate line.

812
01:25:36,940 --> 01:25:39,910
And if you wanted to control the order of these operations, we're going in,

813
01:25:40,150 --> 01:25:45,639
you can put parentheses around certain aspects to have them run first by hypothetical.

814
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:51,910
So let's just say, for instance, like one for one problem, line 90.

815
01:25:52,330 --> 01:25:58,540
Let's just say, for instance, you are continuing to type this long equation.

816
01:25:59,170 --> 01:26:05,200
Will it continue to stay on that line or will they give that like will they go down to a new line?

817
01:26:05,330 --> 01:26:10,659
Well, let's test it out. And I might just do this with like R because this one I was like, will it just push the,

818
01:26:10,660 --> 01:26:16,010
you know, will it just keep pushing it towards the end or will it eventually go to another line?

819
01:26:16,010 --> 01:26:19,990
I just. Yeah. What's going to happen? How is it going to do it? I am.

820
01:26:20,390 --> 01:26:31,150
I'm just trying to type random. I keep doing that word selection backslash goes around and I'm only asking because I know like an Excel.

821
01:26:31,150 --> 01:26:37,830
Excel will be like, what are you doing? So it's kind of crazy when you produce or Oh,

822
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:44,470
do you notice what just happened that it dropped itself to the next line and it didn't give me a new number.

823
01:26:44,770 --> 01:26:50,889
So that's how we know it's a continuation. So it's going to automatically text wrap before you went in.

824
01:26:50,890 --> 01:26:55,660
This comes up all the time. Our equations are going to be very long. Our functions might get long.

825
01:26:55,840 --> 01:27:02,590
And what it will do is a little rapid along. So what we run or if we put the cursor anywhere in here, it's going to run all of this together.

826
01:27:02,590 --> 01:27:06,020
And our knows that this all goes together. Exactly.

827
01:27:08,730 --> 01:27:14,400
And the location of that text wrapping might be different if we are like zoomed in.

828
01:27:14,610 --> 01:27:20,040
So if I zoom back out now, it's all back on one line.

829
01:27:20,130 --> 01:27:23,250
But if I zoom in, then that goes to a new line.

830
01:27:24,300 --> 01:27:28,680
So, so it might be a function of your like view whether that wrapping is taking place as well.

831
01:27:29,940 --> 01:27:33,750
So that makes sense. Yeah. So just keep typing and are will.

832
01:27:34,730 --> 01:27:40,340
Go on to a new line for you. Nobody had any challenges with that.

833
01:27:40,360 --> 01:27:51,270
Anything we should check in about? And then to run it, we use that control center or the run button to actually take the code and make our calculated.

834
01:27:55,100 --> 01:27:58,190
Let's transition back to slides and talk about objects.

835
01:27:58,640 --> 01:28:05,270
So let's do our next section. So the goal of this section,

836
01:28:05,270 --> 01:28:14,720
I want to be able to classify different object types in our line one objectives and then we'll come back to our practice coding of objects.

837
01:28:16,220 --> 01:28:21,560
So objects are literally anything you give a name to in R.

838
01:28:22,130 --> 01:28:25,490
These could be variables is going to be datasets.

839
01:28:25,730 --> 01:28:28,460
You can even create graphical objects.

840
01:28:29,420 --> 01:28:36,200
You can have regression model results of objects and anything as long as you give it a name in R, it's an object.

841
01:28:36,740 --> 01:28:44,059
And these are inherently temporary. They're not like hard snap to your to your computer.

842
01:28:44,060 --> 01:28:56,540
And we can we'll talk about how to say about objects in the future. How do you assign something a name you use this to keystroke command operator.

843
01:28:57,230 --> 01:29:07,160
I think about it like a left facing arrow because R is going to read our code from right to left, and that arrow helps me remember that.

844
01:29:08,770 --> 01:29:13,180
So essentially the code is read from right to left across that assignment operator.

845
01:29:13,870 --> 01:29:19,569
So here I'm saying take the value of five an assignment as an object.

846
01:29:19,570 --> 01:29:23,980
I'm calling pajamas. This is one of the names of my caps and I use that as an example you can make.

847
01:29:24,310 --> 01:29:31,600
You can name these objects literally anything you want. So it's saying, take this value and assign it as a new object.

848
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:36,790
I'm calling pajamas this thing. Do we type this thing? No, no, that's just our command prompt.

849
01:29:36,910 --> 01:29:43,900
Are telling us it's ready to accept new code. Okay, so the name, whatever name we want to give the objects can be on the left hand side.

850
01:29:44,170 --> 01:29:47,650
And then whatever value you want the object to have a similar right hand side.

851
01:29:49,960 --> 01:29:53,890
So our us. Let's take the value of an assignment of an object called pajamas.

852
01:29:55,860 --> 01:30:03,940
So if we want to ask our what is pajamas? But yeah, we can just submit the light of pajamas and like essentially asking our question.

853
01:30:04,570 --> 01:30:08,200
Now we get this output that we've been seeing all along. So it's bananas.

854
01:30:08,200 --> 01:30:20,290
Has the value of five in position one. So anytime time you see this assignment.

855
01:30:20,290 --> 01:30:29,120
Operator, we're trying to create a new object. Yeah, that was an equal assignment set that you can't insert if you prefer.

856
01:30:29,140 --> 01:30:33,730
Instead of using this two keystroke menu, if you use a single equal sign.

857
01:30:34,630 --> 01:30:38,320
I personally, I do this because it reminds me to read the code, right?

858
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:40,840
To laugh. That took me a second for that to become more intuitive.

859
01:30:41,080 --> 01:30:47,710
So if you prefer, you could substitute here a single equal sign and said those would be equivalent styles of coding.

860
01:30:54,650 --> 01:31:00,530
These square brackets. They're going to show our positions and we'll talk about positions and our objects.

861
01:31:02,120 --> 01:31:06,770
So there's a couple rules on naming objects, and you'll forget these and you'll try and figure it out along the way.

862
01:31:07,010 --> 01:31:11,239
But those operator symbols that we've been talking about that already have a given meaning.

863
01:31:11,240 --> 01:31:17,719
We can't put those in the object names. Those are already taken. You can't put space is an object name.

864
01:31:17,720 --> 01:31:23,210
So you guys have already seen our is going to ignore spaces. So don't put them in your object name.

865
01:31:23,750 --> 01:31:27,460
It's just going down. You can put dots and underscore.

866
01:31:27,680 --> 01:31:31,069
You start some some people if they want to remember.

867
01:31:31,070 --> 01:31:39,580
This is a temporary object. We'll start out with a dot. Object names can have numbers in them, but they can't start with the number.

868
01:31:41,650 --> 01:31:47,320
And this one, for those of you who may have started coding in SAS is going to take a while to get used to are as case sensitive.

869
01:31:47,770 --> 01:31:52,210
So capital x and lowercase x are completely different objects.

870
01:31:52,510 --> 01:31:59,290
This is a frequent flier for types of typos that my trip you up along the way and then another thing

871
01:31:59,290 --> 01:32:04,839
that I also trip myself up over don't name an object the same thing as a function you're trying to use.

872
01:32:04,840 --> 01:32:09,159
You'll overwrite it and are always assumes you know what you're doing and won't give you an error message.

873
01:32:09,160 --> 01:32:13,000
It'll just keep going. You'll forget this stuff or time.

874
01:32:13,540 --> 01:32:22,240
Just work your way through it. So these data object types we're going to classify are based on their shape.

875
01:32:22,510 --> 01:32:29,230
So we saw that objects or anything we give a name to and we're going to put them in different categories based on their shape.

876
01:32:30,130 --> 01:32:35,140
So vectors are objects that only have information in one dimension.

877
01:32:35,710 --> 01:32:38,950
You can think about this as like a single variable in your dataset.

878
01:32:39,340 --> 01:32:45,850
And so we only have information in one dimension if we have information in two dimensions

879
01:32:45,850 --> 01:32:51,220
like an Excel spreadsheet and are going to call these a matrix or a data frame,

880
01:32:51,280 --> 01:32:57,370
and we can get into the difference between that's true. It's very subtle, but here you can see we've got two dimensions of information.

881
01:32:57,370 --> 01:33:01,810
Now we have rows and columns versus here in a vector. V only had information in one dimension.

882
01:33:04,170 --> 01:33:11,010
There's another type of object that is beyond the scope of the class, but it will probably come up when you're on the Internet searching for answers.

883
01:33:11,820 --> 01:33:18,330
These are called lists or S4 objects. I think of these like umbrella objects because they contain other objects.

884
01:33:18,990 --> 01:33:25,770
So a list could have a whole bunch of actors in it, or a list could have a whole bunch of data frames in it or a vector in a data frame.

885
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:31,590
So this is like if you want to carry around a whole bucket of objects together, that would be in the list.

886
01:33:33,260 --> 01:33:42,910
Primarily in the past where doctors and different. So those back to our objects, those one dimensional objects.

887
01:33:45,630 --> 01:33:51,960
They are just a random collection of values. They have to come in a specific order.

888
01:33:53,250 --> 01:34:03,780
So in this example, the value of 6.2 and position one, the value of 9.3 and position to, let's say these are, I don't know, length of something.

889
01:34:05,910 --> 01:34:16,230
So each of these values has a position, has like a slot that it goes, that this is meta information, this is like data on top of the data.

890
01:34:16,650 --> 01:34:21,240
This doesn't count as a dimension. This is like describing the coordinates most.

891
01:34:21,240 --> 01:34:26,370
Like if anybody grew up playing like battleship or game, this is like your position on the board.

892
01:34:30,050 --> 01:34:40,050
We might call it an element if we're talking not just one position and one value and a vector can have as many elements as you want,

893
01:34:40,050 --> 01:34:41,210
it can be as long as you want.

894
01:34:41,240 --> 01:34:50,420
I have some that are 25 million elements long, but what is really key here across the type of information, the type of values all be the same.

895
01:34:51,080 --> 01:34:57,170
So if they're all numbers, it wants it to be all numbers. If it's all character information, I wants it to be all character information.

896
01:34:57,480 --> 01:35:02,060
Once every value in this vector to be the same type of information.

897
01:35:03,970 --> 01:35:07,720
What are some of those types of information? Could be numbers.

898
01:35:07,720 --> 01:35:11,620
So numeric vectors. There's a couple like some flavors.

899
01:35:11,620 --> 01:35:16,360
So an integer is a subtype of numeric but doesn't allow decimal places.

900
01:35:18,550 --> 01:35:23,680
A double. I don't know why it's called a double, but that is a some type of numeric that does a lot of decimal places.

901
01:35:25,300 --> 01:35:32,230
Character vectors are ones that contain like letter information, character information.

902
01:35:32,500 --> 01:35:41,380
These can be literally anything. This is one of the things we spend a lot of time cleaning in our data sets if it comes in as character information.

903
01:35:41,680 --> 01:35:48,100
Because you can imagine people could write if you want to refer to University of Michigan, people might write Michigan U of m u mesh.

904
01:35:48,130 --> 01:35:53,560
There could be a lot of data claiming to try to make character information common.

905
01:35:53,830 --> 01:35:58,570
This is like the most heterogeneous thing, uh, type of vector.

906
01:36:00,290 --> 01:36:04,070
That's a little bit more restrictive type of adapter is called a factor.

907
01:36:04,610 --> 01:36:08,060
This has restrictive levels. So this is kind of similar to character.

908
01:36:08,330 --> 01:36:13,760
But it says the only levels you're allowed to play would be high, low and medium or the only value.

909
01:36:13,820 --> 01:36:18,620
These are the only values you're allowed to put. So it's putting some boundaries around that character expression.

910
01:36:21,680 --> 01:36:23,450
There's another type of vector called logical.

911
01:36:23,490 --> 01:36:30,350
This is a series of trues and pulses, and you can denote those with either the full word or just the capital letters.

912
01:36:30,890 --> 01:36:34,950
This is the way that we're going to ask our questions. So we like, is this true?

913
01:36:34,970 --> 01:36:41,330
And I'll say yes to this. And then lastly, this is what I'm at a pot for a couple of weeks because.

914
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:48,530
It's kind of a pain. It doesn't come off right away from me, but it does in a lot of people's datasets, like if you're doing surveillance,

915
01:36:48,530 --> 01:36:54,140
flu data or something, but there's a special type of vectors that corresponds to date and time information.

916
01:36:54,830 --> 01:36:59,330
And so you can see that within each one of these, that's the same type of information together.

917
01:37:01,560 --> 01:37:08,060
It won't do alphanumeric. Those will be coded as character.

918
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:22,690
Got you. So even just just you in one, it'll still receive this and might if you have a vector that has 100 values that are all numbers,

919
01:37:23,380 --> 01:37:29,530
but you have one of these, like somebody typed out the word one, then everything gets coerced to a character.

920
01:37:30,130 --> 01:37:36,670
So it kind of like goes downhill to the lowest vector type, which is like usually a character one.

921
01:37:38,170 --> 01:37:43,000
So yeah, I spent a lot of time cleaning this kind of stuff up when you work with a new dataset.

922
01:37:46,850 --> 01:37:51,380
And you all noticed in the beginning that the numbers turn blue.

923
01:37:51,470 --> 01:37:55,670
So there's like some of these pattern. Thanks. Help you notice a bit of any deviation in there.

924
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:05,300
When we want to look at those positions, when you use those square brackets to find out what positions that mean, values are at.

925
01:38:05,990 --> 01:38:14,960
So, for example, if we have an object that I'm naming cats and we want to see, we can ask a question like, what is the value of cats in position four?

926
01:38:15,350 --> 01:38:19,490
And so those square brackets are helping us to know what position in the object we're talking about.

927
01:38:21,260 --> 01:38:22,750
We can also select on the value.

928
01:38:22,760 --> 01:38:29,240
So here we're selecting a positions here in our selection values, saying, here, show me the positions where the values of cats are less than five.

929
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:34,940
And if you got parentheses or square brackets are not always read out from inside out.

930
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:44,180
So those are vectors. That's one information and then one dimension. Data frames are we have information in two dimensions.

931
01:38:44,180 --> 01:38:53,510
So we've got rows and we've got columns and our once that information with essentially columns of vectors.

932
01:38:53,960 --> 01:38:57,440
So within each column at once, all the information of the same type.

933
01:38:57,560 --> 01:39:03,500
So this would be a numeric column, a factor column, a character column, illogical column.

934
01:39:03,560 --> 01:39:09,470
So within each column it once it treat it like a vector, if you get the data and it's like the opposite,

935
01:39:09,710 --> 01:39:16,550
then we're going to we're on usually here like your participants are heroes in your variables on their problems.

936
01:39:16,820 --> 01:39:23,240
We're going to spend some time to transpose it or pivot the table so that your it's

937
01:39:23,240 --> 01:39:26,960
formatted this way as opposed to it doesn't want your participants in the columns.

938
01:39:30,700 --> 01:39:33,720
So it's just like before each value has a position.

939
01:39:33,730 --> 01:39:39,100
So like this value of 6.2 has an ROE one, column one.

940
01:39:39,100 --> 01:39:44,059
So each of these has a coordinate. We need both the matches.

941
01:39:44,060 --> 01:39:47,300
We need the rose and we need the column. So we've got the rose positions.

942
01:39:48,620 --> 01:39:58,590
And we've got those kind of long positions. So we can look around and be like, okay, this is in row four, column four.

943
01:39:58,680 --> 01:40:08,819
To be able to find every battleship essentially in our in our data frame now and that's in there will want to use those square brackets.

944
01:40:08,820 --> 01:40:14,100
We have to be in both dimensions. We have to have the rows in the columns. And this is just a subtle thing to memorize.

945
01:40:14,460 --> 01:40:18,750
Our is always going to want the rows first and the columns second.

946
01:40:19,290 --> 01:40:29,960
So here's the row, comma, the corner. So for example here is saying show me what value is in row to column three in the practice this.

947
01:40:32,750 --> 01:40:39,680
It's hard for me to remember what's in each row column, whatnot, so it allows us to give names to the columns.

948
01:40:39,680 --> 01:40:45,350
We can also give names to the rows. So up here I can give names to these columns.

949
01:40:45,350 --> 01:40:49,970
This is the size column, the light column, whatever, and different than Excel.

950
01:40:49,980 --> 01:40:51,890
This doesn't count as our first row.

951
01:40:51,920 --> 01:41:03,030
This is like information on top of the dataframe and we have a special operator to refer to it so we can use the dollar sign to go on here.

952
01:41:03,050 --> 01:41:08,360
So here I make a go of the name of the dataset dollar sign, the variable name.

953
01:41:09,200 --> 01:41:13,550
So the name of the dataset, the dollar sign level to refer to this column.

954
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:25,690
So the dollar signs are going to help us look within a different sort of recap or to make us I'm just does anything more sign a name too.

955
01:41:26,250 --> 01:41:31,250
We can assign objects with this less era or with an individual equal sign.

956
01:41:32,380 --> 01:41:37,690
If those objects are one dimensional, we call it my vector. If there are two dimensional, we call them a data frame.

957
01:41:38,500 --> 01:41:42,250
And those objects all have values when positional information in it.

958
01:41:42,250 --> 01:41:48,670
And to find those positions, we're going to use these square brackets and that to give a column name or use those dollar signs.

959
01:41:50,700 --> 01:41:53,780
So let's pause here. How are we doing about objects? Yeah.

960
01:41:54,200 --> 01:42:02,750
Do you name vectors or is it just the name of the vector you're going to name vectors or any data frames are to name every every object needs a name.

961
01:42:03,260 --> 01:42:09,350
So if I give a vector, say the vector was a list of lengths, could you name it length?

962
01:42:09,710 --> 01:42:13,600
Like would that be metadata on top of the vector domain, metadata on top of the vector?

963
01:42:13,610 --> 01:42:16,549
And I would recommend not calling it length because length is a function.

964
01:42:16,550 --> 01:42:26,930
We'll use a next time to talk about function, but maybe you want to call it like I don't know what length, whatever it is.

965
01:42:26,930 --> 01:42:34,340
So like, oh, oh I don't like the length of Tree of life of a foot.

966
01:42:34,400 --> 01:42:41,660
Yeah, length of the foot. And then we're going to assign this here and then we can say, okay,

967
01:42:41,660 --> 01:42:47,000
these are going to be we're not gonna do this next week, but we'll use a C function and then provide all those values.

968
01:42:47,270 --> 01:42:58,490
So our first participant is 37 centimeters or second participant's 41 centimeter, and we can provide as many as we want separated by column commas.

969
01:42:59,630 --> 01:43:05,510
So this might be 32 and then when you're done, you close it out so that that's the name of the vector, right?

970
01:43:05,510 --> 01:43:12,710
Yeah. So now we have a vector called length foot and it has these three values in the first three positions.

971
01:43:13,280 --> 01:43:17,170
My question is, would you ever use the dollar sign with vectors?

972
01:43:17,180 --> 01:43:22,940
Oh, that doesn't apply. Yeah. Okay, so we'll get an arrow. So it's not suitable for an atomic vector.

973
01:43:22,940 --> 01:43:28,190
And I don't know what that's like. The worst phrase I should just say, like, doesn't apply to a vector.

974
01:43:28,190 --> 01:43:36,440
Yeah. So you would just you would just name the vector because you don't need to add like a metadata on top of that because it's only one.

975
01:43:36,710 --> 01:43:39,980
Yeah. It's already there already. You got it. Okay. Right.

976
01:43:42,470 --> 01:43:47,900
Yeah. That in the last couple of minutes of class let's jump back into the code and try

977
01:43:47,900 --> 01:43:53,360
a couple of things and then well we'll finish with coding aspects on next class.

978
01:43:54,770 --> 01:43:59,150
So what we'll do is continue coding on the introduction line.

979
01:44:00,620 --> 01:44:07,519
This is going to be around who knows what line number one, but one thing that might be useful for you to navigate.

980
01:44:07,520 --> 01:44:13,250
There's a button for outline so we can follow along.

981
01:44:13,400 --> 01:44:18,469
These are these patterns are made when I did these like double hashtags, right?

982
01:44:18,470 --> 01:44:22,250
This blue font. So right now I'm on make your first object.

983
01:44:22,250 --> 01:44:28,820
So if you want to navigate down to that one, it does that. It will outline these for you automatically when you double call.

984
01:44:29,210 --> 01:44:41,450
Oh, yes. Let's see if we can test it out like double hash exec new spot automatically shows up on our outline.

985
01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:48,740
Yeah. So and if you want to get rid of that line because there's too much debris in the sky to.

986
01:44:50,380 --> 01:44:53,440
So let's make an object. So right now, we have no objects.

987
01:44:53,440 --> 01:45:00,070
Our environment is empty. There's nothing in our environment. So what I think we're going to do is make a new object.

988
01:45:00,520 --> 01:45:04,060
And this first object I want to make is called number of apples.

989
01:45:04,450 --> 01:45:09,999
So I'm expecting here to say I take a value of five and assign that as a new object.

990
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:16,990
I'm calling number of apples. So I'm expecting once we run this code, I'm expecting a new object called number of apples to pop up in our environment.

991
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:23,290
Put my code somewhere around here, hit control, enter. And what do we see?

992
01:45:23,290 --> 01:45:27,130
We've got a new object called number of apples with the value of five.

993
01:45:28,540 --> 01:45:32,180
Our first. So it's not super mysterious.

994
01:45:32,450 --> 01:45:38,090
We just any time we use this time to operate let's see if we put an equal sign in there doesn't store.

995
01:45:40,250 --> 01:45:45,440
So a single equals two saying we still got that. So either way, nice.

996
01:45:45,440 --> 01:45:50,269
And if we want to ask our question, what is the number of Apple's object,

997
01:45:50,270 --> 01:45:57,260
we can just provide the name of the object and then the output will show us the number of Apple's object has the value five in position one.

998
01:45:59,270 --> 01:46:04,250
Let's make a new object. So what do you think is going to happen with this line of code right here about the cost of the apples?

999
01:46:10,810 --> 01:46:14,020
Anybody talk me through this line of code? What you think I was going to do here?

1000
01:46:15,460 --> 01:46:17,270
Expectation. You know,

1001
01:46:17,290 --> 01:46:34,419
put it on the saying that they would just and then after five will take it make it will drop down on the in the environment in the environment

1002
01:46:34,420 --> 01:46:43,450
using the environment it will give you a new column that is cost Apple and put the 25 five is going to give us a whole new object.

1003
01:46:44,110 --> 01:46:51,370
So let's give us it's going to give us an object since they take the value of $0.55 an assignment as an object in contrast to the apple.

1004
01:46:54,160 --> 01:46:58,540
So we see now. Yeah, just like you said. Now we've got another object in the environment.

1005
01:46:58,870 --> 01:47:03,730
I'm going to do one for the sales tax in the state of Michigan, 7%.

1006
01:47:04,900 --> 01:47:10,780
So now you have objects that you can start doing calculator operations with like we were doing with numbers before.

1007
01:47:11,080 --> 01:47:13,750
So I would say let's multiply the number of apples,

1008
01:47:13,750 --> 01:47:19,060
times the cost of the apple and if you want we could just look at the output or we could assign that as a new object.

1009
01:47:19,330 --> 01:47:26,320
You can once you start me objects, you can start making more and more objects. So here I'm saying assign that as a new object and cost no tax.

1010
01:47:26,920 --> 01:47:32,350
And if I want to see what that is got that does not your total cost of taxes.

1011
01:47:32,560 --> 01:47:37,660
This is very similar to the hammer question that's going to ask you to go back and forth between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

1012
01:47:38,470 --> 01:47:48,220
And so so I did the number of apples and I wanted to run it and then all the whole chunk came up on the global environment.

1013
01:47:48,220 --> 01:47:50,560
How did you do the single line? Oh yeah.

1014
01:47:50,560 --> 01:47:56,860
So if we run around the whole chunk at once, we can hit this play button and I'll run the whole chunk together.

1015
01:47:57,130 --> 01:48:02,380
If we want to run a single line at a time, we can put our cursor on that line and either hit control,

1016
01:48:02,380 --> 01:48:08,170
enter or command enter, or we can put our cursor on that line and click run just the selected line.

1017
01:48:09,160 --> 01:48:19,790
Now I'll just run one line of time on. We're going to ask our questions.

1018
01:48:19,790 --> 01:48:25,279
So all next class, we'll talk more about functions. But this is a function called length where we can ask our questions.

1019
01:48:25,280 --> 01:48:28,710
How long is that number of Apple's object?

1020
01:48:29,120 --> 01:48:32,720
And they'll tell us. All right. Now, starting here is has a length of one.

1021
01:48:33,110 --> 01:48:39,890
So there's only one value, only one position. If we're not, we can make it longer.

1022
01:48:40,250 --> 01:48:47,270
So this is going to be weird. So this is going to take the values of one through four and assign as an object called number of Apple.

1023
01:48:47,450 --> 01:48:53,160
Do we already have an object on number of Apple? Do you think it's going to error out me like this already?

1024
01:48:53,210 --> 01:48:56,930
This? No, I was going to assume we know what we're doing.

1025
01:48:57,530 --> 01:49:02,080
So watch this number of Apple objects. It currently has a value of five.

1026
01:49:02,090 --> 01:49:07,140
Let's see what happens now here on this line of code we say, well,

1027
01:49:07,610 --> 01:49:14,330
and now it just transfers to a new has new values and there's no error saying that you just over your dataset.

1028
01:49:15,320 --> 01:49:20,870
So just be careful. Ah, we'll never even give you a warning if you like, overwrite your dataset.

1029
01:49:22,040 --> 01:49:27,559
So now the number of objects is an integer object with the values of one, two, three, four and positions.

1030
01:49:27,560 --> 01:49:31,490
One, three, four. Answer this.

1031
01:49:31,730 --> 01:49:35,720
Our alpha does it. Does it?

1032
01:49:35,930 --> 01:49:39,080
Everything. Alphabetical order. Well, that's a good question.

1033
01:49:39,110 --> 01:49:45,480
It looks like it is. Yeah. Looks like it doesn't and certainly doesn't appear to be in the order of creation.

1034
01:49:46,640 --> 01:49:52,730
Now here, I'm going to create that same object with a function called.

1035
01:49:52,730 --> 01:49:58,730
See? This is what I was using over here. This is the nice functions. Combine is here stitching together multiple things.

1036
01:49:59,150 --> 01:50:03,590
So I'm saying combine the numbers one, two, three and four into one object.

1037
01:50:04,610 --> 01:50:12,439
So that gives us the exact same thing. We're starting to see that there's multiple ways to produce the same products and are something

1038
01:50:12,440 --> 01:50:16,160
that this function gives us a little more flexibility as we can put stuff in a different order.

1039
01:50:16,730 --> 01:50:21,110
So when we run this, we'll see it's going to overwrite this, it's going to put the values in a different order.

1040
01:50:22,430 --> 01:50:27,600
So the order matters. The order central the positioning is central to the how our interprets us.

1041
01:50:27,620 --> 01:50:31,790
Yeah, actually on the here control enter instead of command enter.

1042
01:50:31,790 --> 01:50:36,140
It did the same thing. Is there any difference between those two shortcuts?

1043
01:50:36,320 --> 01:50:40,160
Oh, no. Sweet. I'm glad that works. I was there. Yeah, I do the same.

1044
01:50:40,550 --> 01:50:43,940
Sounds like it. Are you in a mac or PC Mac? Oh, yeah.

1045
01:50:43,940 --> 01:50:47,500
Sweet. So Control Center also works with there for not.

1046
01:50:48,980 --> 01:50:54,799
Adding more options all the time. Here is also a common complementary way to create it.

1047
01:50:54,800 --> 01:51:02,660
So here I'm using a sequencing function that will practice next possible thing count in in order from 1 to 4 and count by one.

1048
01:51:03,620 --> 01:51:06,650
So multiple ways of creating that same information.

1049
01:51:06,860 --> 01:51:13,760
Now, when we ask how long is that number of apples object, we see that it has four elements in line, right?

1050
01:51:13,790 --> 01:51:18,109
So that when we started this coaching, that object was only one element in length.

1051
01:51:18,110 --> 01:51:23,720
And when we ended, now it's in four. So we're doing some some updates along the way.

1052
01:51:25,190 --> 01:51:29,480
I'm noticing that we're at the end of time, but I just want to remind you, when you're coding for your homework,

1053
01:51:29,810 --> 01:51:35,780
when you're ready to produce the report, click that red button and that will give you everything all stitched together.

1054
01:51:36,080 --> 01:51:41,780
If you like, I have a homework template here that you can work from or you can make your own.

1055
01:51:42,800 --> 01:51:46,270
But the actual wording of the hallmarks are all on canvas.

1056
01:51:46,280 --> 01:51:54,470
Thursday for each class there's the homework assignments are here, but if it's helpful,

1057
01:51:55,010 --> 01:51:57,770
I'm pleased that I have like a template with all the code chunks there,

1058
01:51:57,770 --> 01:52:02,330
so you can just plug your code to whatever level you're ready to interact with.

1059
01:52:03,140 --> 01:52:09,080
So thank you, everyone, for all of your attention. This is a delightful group to spend time with and I'll see you all next week.

1060
01:52:09,650 --> 01:52:16,459
If not soon, drop in hours and print that question.

1061
01:52:16,460 --> 01:52:19,790
Yeah. Then what we just need is a break to write.

1062
01:52:20,270 --> 01:52:24,049
Yeah, okay. Because I guess these are all vectors.

1063
01:52:24,050 --> 01:52:33,590
Excellent. Gotcha. It is because the environment is kind of like another read.

1064
01:52:33,950 --> 01:52:37,370
That's misleading, right? That's I think this was what was thrown me.

1065
01:52:37,790 --> 01:52:42,260
So these are all separate objects. Each one is a separate object.

1066
01:52:42,380 --> 01:52:47,690
You got to get together. And I think and we can throw down eventually in a future one,

1067
01:52:47,690 --> 01:52:55,490
we will make a data frame where we will like stitch them all together and you'll be able to see it comes up in like a separate area.

1068
01:52:56,240 --> 01:52:59,720
The data frames will be like separate from those.

1069
01:53:00,200 --> 01:53:03,650
Yeah. Okay. These aren't.
