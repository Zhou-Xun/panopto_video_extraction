1
00:00:05,168 --> 00:00:09,310
This is the first of a series of
lectures covering food security.

2
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:12,240
In this lecture, we'll review
definitions of food security and

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,330
research around food insecurity and
nutrition related outcomes.

4
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:19,530
There are several related
concepts of food insecurity.

5
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:22,864
This figure demonstrates how these
various terms relate to each other.

6
00:00:22,864 --> 00:00:27,268
The definition of food security,
from the 1996 World Food Summit.

7
00:00:27,268 --> 00:00:32,175
Is that food security at the individual
household, national, regional, and

8
00:00:32,175 --> 00:00:36,497
global level is achieved when all
people at all times have physical and

9
00:00:36,497 --> 00:00:41,038
economic access to sufficient, safe,
and nutritious food to meet their

10
00:00:41,038 --> 00:00:45,970
dietary needs and food preferences for
an active and healthy life.

11
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:48,501
It is implied that food
insecurity is when one or

12
00:00:48,501 --> 00:00:51,920
more of these components is missing.

13
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,830
Food insecurity is different from hunger.

14
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:58,020
Hunger is an individual
level physical sensation or

15
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,690
pain of not having enough food and
can result from food insecurity.

16
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:05,550
But food insecurity refers
to the broader social and

17
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:09,519
economic condition of not having
enough food to meet individual needs.

18
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:13,002
Nutrition insecurity is similar
to food insecurity, but

19
00:01:13,002 --> 00:01:16,414
a broader concept that also includes care,
health, and

20
00:01:16,414 --> 00:01:20,053
hygiene practices with
the provision of a nutritious diet.

21
00:01:20,053 --> 00:01:24,932
And finally, undernourishment has been
examined in relation to food insecurity,

22
00:01:24,932 --> 00:01:28,310
and is sometimes considered
an extreme food insecurity.

23
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:32,681
The FAO defines undernutrition as
resulting from undernourishment,

24
00:01:32,681 --> 00:01:37,980
poor absorption, and/or the poor
biological use of nutrients consumed.

25
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,860
Food security can be measured
using different tools that assess

26
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:45,150
food availability, food access,
food utilization, or

27
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:48,160
health indicators related
to food security.

28
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,930
Data for these measures can
come from national sources,

29
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:54,860
surveys of households, and
individual assessments.

30
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:57,920
Here are some common examples
of food security measures.

31
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,270
The prevalence of undernourishment.

32
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:05,340
Anthropometry, including height, length,
weight, and skin fold thickness.

33
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,419
Dietary Diversity, which assess
the consumption of different food groups.

34
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:12,080
The Household Food Security Survey.

35
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,233
Household Consumption and Expenditures,

36
00:02:14,233 --> 00:02:17,206
which collects data on all foods
acquired by the household.

37
00:02:17,206 --> 00:02:21,153
The Global Hunger Index, which is
a ranking of countries that includes

38
00:02:21,153 --> 00:02:24,787
undernourishment, child underweight,
and child mortality.

39
00:02:24,787 --> 00:02:27,188
And the Global Food Security Index,

40
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:32,147
which is an index of 30 indicators
across three domains of food security,

41
00:02:32,147 --> 00:02:36,733
including affordability,
availability, and quality and safety.

42
00:02:36,733 --> 00:02:40,722
This is a world map showing country
level differences in the global food

43
00:02:40,722 --> 00:02:41,726
security index.

44
00:02:41,726 --> 00:02:46,084
From this map we can see a correlation
between the income level of the country

45
00:02:46,084 --> 00:02:48,071
and their level of food security.

46
00:02:48,071 --> 00:02:51,053
There's also a correlation
between coastal countries and

47
00:02:51,053 --> 00:02:53,550
those with high food security.

48
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:56,550
Landlocked countries are at risk for
food insecurity because they have

49
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:59,990
lower availability of
irrigated agricultural land.

50
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:03,380
Making them more susceptible to
the effects of climate change, and

51
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:06,178
because the additional costs with trade.

52
00:03:06,178 --> 00:03:09,590
Countries experiencing government
instability, civil unrest, and

53
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:13,730
armed conflict, are also at risk for
food insecurity.

54
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:18,860
In the US, here is a map showing rates of
food insecurity by county across states.

55
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:23,030
Although, on the global scale, the US
has very high rates of food security,

56
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:26,420
the food insecurity still
exists at the national level.

57
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:31,820
According to recent estimates, 12% of
all US households were food insecure.

58
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:35,870
This map shows that food insecurity
affects in nearly every county in the US.

59
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,590
Even urban areas and

60
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:41,480
counties traditionally thought of as
having higher socioeconomic status.

61
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:45,710
The US definition of food insecurity
comes from the Department of Agriculture.

62
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:47,743
It defines food insecurity as a limited or

63
00:03:47,743 --> 00:03:51,620
uncertain availability of
nutritionally adequate and safe foods.

64
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:52,525
Or the limited or

65
00:03:52,525 --> 00:03:56,805
uncertain ability to acquire acceptable
foods in socially acceptable ways.

66
00:03:56,805 --> 00:04:01,132
If we unpack this definition further,
we can see that food insecurity includes

67
00:04:01,132 --> 00:04:05,925
components of food access, that foods need
to be nutritious and free of contaminants.

68
00:04:05,925 --> 00:04:09,380
And that food should be acquired
through socially acceptable means.

69
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,890
Meaning that we should not
expect others to beg, steal, or

70
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:15,068
dumpster dive for
food in order to meet their basic needs.

71
00:04:15,068 --> 00:04:20,540
In the US, we measure food
insecurity using an 18 item scale.

72
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:25,070
This scale assess psychological aspects
of food insecurity, behaviors related

73
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:29,770
to not having enough food and
physical consequences of food insecurity.

74
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,340
This scale can be used to
classify individuals and

75
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:36,400
households into four categories,
full food secure,

76
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,880
marginally food secure, low food secure,
or very low food secure.

77
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:47,830
Combined, low and very low food secure
are often termed food insecure.

78
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:51,300
Food insecurity exists on a continuum
from full food securities

79
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,660
to severe food insecurity.

80
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:57,510
The indicators used to assess food
insecurity range from worrying about

81
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:01,310
food running out before one got money
to buy more, to skipping meals or

82
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,740
eating less at meals, to not eating for

83
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:07,050
a whole day because there
wasn't enough money for food.

84
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:10,760
When adults reduce the quality or
quantity of foods consumed, or

85
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,480
more severe situations where
children reduce the quality or

86
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:18,320
quantity of foods consumed,
that is indicative of food insecurity.

87
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,450
Previous studies of the US population have
examined food insecurity in relation to

88
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:23,900
obesity.

89
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:27,010
This relationship has been
described as paradoxical

90
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:31,030
because food insecurity symbolizes
food scarcity and hunger, but

91
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:34,480
obesity is often thought of as
a condition of food excess.

92
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,800
This study by Dinour and

93
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,980
colleagues is one of the earliest reviews
of food insecurity and obesity, and

94
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:44,780
discusses many contributing factors to the
food insecurity and obesity relationship.

95
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:49,090
These include a lack of availability of
nutritious foods in that neighborhood,

96
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:52,420
the price differential between healthy and
unhealthy foods.

97
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,610
A stressful neighborhood or

98
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:58,325
household environment, lack of nutrition
knowledge or adequate cooking facilities.

99
00:05:58,325 --> 00:06:01,620
And physical adaptation to
cyclical eating patterns

100
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:04,690
that makes one more prone
to weight gain over time.

101
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:07,650
Here's another figure that further
explains how food insecurity

102
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:11,950
interacts with other insecurities
that affect diet and poor health.

103
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:15,250
Food and other insecurities,
like job insecurity and

104
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,770
housing insecurity, are driven by poverty.

105
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:23,330
These have direct effects on biobehavioral
mechanisms like stress, sleep, and

106
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:25,340
cognitive capacity.

107
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:29,840
Together this contributes to a mentality
of scarcity, which is defined as,

108
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,180
reduced cognitive capacity
to manage challenges.

109
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,280
Combined with a decreased
purchasing power for

110
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:40,890
healthy food, this leads to poor diet
quality and subsequent health outcomes.

111
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:44,240
With these models in mind, it can be
better understood how food insecurity

112
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,970
increases the risk of chronic
disease in vulnerable populations.

113
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:51,070
This figure is from
the California Women's Health Study, and

114
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:55,410
shows prevalences of diabetes,
heart disease, high blood pressure, and

115
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:58,610
high cholesterol by food security status.

116
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:01,037
As you can see, for every disease outcome,

117
00:07:01,037 --> 00:07:04,589
the prevalence increases by
higher levels of food insecurity.

118
00:07:04,589 --> 00:07:07,479
4.6% of food secure women had diabetes,

119
00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:10,985
compared to almost 8% of
very low food secure women.

120
00:07:10,985 --> 00:07:14,225
16% of food secure women
had high blood pressure,

121
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:17,681
compared to almost 22% of
very low food secure women.

122
00:07:17,681 --> 00:07:20,649
17% of food secure women
had high cholesterol,

123
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:24,560
compared to 24% of very
low food secure women.

124
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,540
All of these differences were significant,
even after adjusting for

125
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:32,050
age, income, education,
and race ethnicity.

126
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:34,830
This figure shows even further
how food insecurity and

127
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:37,860
chronic disease could
have a cyclical pattern.

128
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:41,540
Here, food insecurity leads to
constrained dietary options.

129
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:44,270
Which could include excessive
calories from unhealthy fats and

130
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:47,060
refined carbohydrates,
lower intakes of fruits and

131
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:51,135
vegetables, higher salt and
sugar intake from highly processed foods.

132
00:07:51,135 --> 00:07:55,940
Food insecurity is often paired with
cycles of overconsumption when food is

133
00:07:55,940 --> 00:08:00,530
available, and skipping meals and eating
less when food supplies are reduced.

134
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:04,900
This combined with the stress of food
insecurity increased the risk of obesity,

135
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,910
hypertension, and diabetes.

136
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:10,340
Chronic disease needs
to be properly managed.

137
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:14,070
But food insecure individuals may have
trouble adhering to medication regimens or

138
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:16,990
accessing health care for
financial reasons.

139
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:19,220
This leads to poor control
of risk factors and

140
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:22,370
weight gain, which can further
exacerbate disease states and

141
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:26,940
increase health care expenditures,
which further worsens food insecurity.

142
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:31,877
Thus, efforts to improve food security
should also focus on the simultaneous need

143
00:08:31,877 --> 00:08:34,345
to improve diet, alleviate stress, and

144
00:08:34,345 --> 00:08:38,153
reduce the risk of chronic disease
in order to break the cycle and

145
00:08:38,153 --> 00:08:42,547
address the multifaceted factors and
consequences of food insecurity.

146
00:08:42,547 --> 00:08:45,639
Now that we have a better understanding
of what food insecurity is,

147
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:49,547
including how it's defined and measured,
and how it's associated with obesity and

148
00:08:49,547 --> 00:08:51,320
chronic disease outcomes.

149
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,370
The next lectures will focus on nutrition
programs and policies that aim to both

150
00:08:55,370 --> 00:09:00,940
reduce food insecurity and improve dietary
intakes in vulnerable populations.
