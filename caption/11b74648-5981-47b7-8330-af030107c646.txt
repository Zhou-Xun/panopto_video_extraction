1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:05,430
I just wanted to hear from my company. Wonderful.

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:09,240
All right, let's get started. Are there any questions?

3
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:15,329
Okay, so your first Iraq is due on the sixth.

4
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:22,380
That's a canvas quiz. And then the rest of your homeworks will be that grade scope submission.

5
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:30,780
And many of you have signed up for a project topic that's also not due till the 13th, I think.

6
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,670
But many of you have not yet signed up, so please also check those out.

7
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,170
Okay. No questions.

8
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:50,880
Today we are going to talk about participation of everyone, anyone, but particularly focus on underrepresented groups in clinical trials.

9
00:00:51,840 --> 00:01:01,710
It's again a non mathematical statistical talk but yet very, very important thinking about generalizability and representation in general.

10
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:12,299
As a guest note before we begin, I am still learning what the correct terms for everything is.

11
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:15,600
So if I mess up, I apologize. Please correct me.

12
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:24,059
I am hoping that much of this is in the right language person forward language, but a lot of it probably is not.

13
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:30,600
And so I'll just apologize ahead of time. You're welcome to correct me either in class or after class.

14
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:34,650
This isn't meant to be a a.

15
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:42,980
Controversial lecture, but it's meant to be informative and thoughtful.

16
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:48,050
And so I hope that we can participate in some discussion as we go along.

17
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:55,860
Okay. So we're going to discuss the landscape of clinical trials around the world, but really focus on the US.

18
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:03,030
We're going to talk about what the landscape looks like in terms of gender and then also racial and ethnic group representation.

19
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:07,469
We're going to introduce various barriers to participation in clinical trials and

20
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:14,250
talk about potential ideas that could help recruitment for all for more diversity.

21
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:19,020
So I asked you this before, but we're going to try out actually using Paul everywhere.

22
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:26,770
It should work now. So if you use your phone, you can text to 37607 if you are using your computer.

23
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:33,830
You can log into four dot com slash Kelly Kidwell but one L to 50 and Kelly has that extra E

24
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,480
in it if you're using it and you should see this question come up if you're on a computer.

25
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,090
So have you ever I guess I ask the question, would you ever, which I think is next.

26
00:02:45,150 --> 00:03:00,250
But have you ever participated in a clinical trial? Try to get at least 20 people to answer before I show you the results.

27
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:05,140
And remember that this is not. I'm not using this in any way to grade you.

28
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:09,249
It doesn't matter what you say if you get this. There's no right answer, obviously, here.

29
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:12,250
But for other questions, where there are right answers, it doesn't matter if you get it right or wrong.

30
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:23,800
Anybody having trouble accessing it. See they come in.

31
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,900
So a few people have, but most people have not been in a clinical trial.

32
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:38,040
So then the next question is, would you participate in a clinical trial?

33
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:53,340
So many, many people saying yes. Some people saying no.

34
00:03:53,340 --> 00:04:07,380
Probably a lot of it depends. So does anyone want to share why they wouldn't participate or why they wouldn't participate in a trial?

35
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:13,770
There's no right answer. I'm not. No one's judging you or no one should be judging you on your answer here.

36
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:24,770
So anyone want to? Yeah. I think for me, it's like if I'm really sick and there is no really effective drug here, how is it?

37
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:29,410
But it's not that, say. And they're like a mark.

38
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:34,590
There is like, if I blocks here, I would not, like, participate.

39
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:42,749
Yeah. So I don't know if you all can hear that, but basically she said it depends if if I'm really sick and that's the only option, then yes.

40
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:48,000
And if it if I'm not that sick or there are lots of options and probably not anybody else.

41
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:54,670
Yeah, I think there's a lot of things with like clinical trials, particularly with like birth control and like reproductive.

42
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,760
Yeah. It's like there's a lot of research women. Yes.

43
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,840
Yeah. That we just don't know enough about but have been prescribing to people anyway, assuming it's safe.

44
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:12,030
And so I think for things that we take every day already, you may as well sign up and see what happens just because that's the standard of care.

45
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:17,230
I thought you were going to go the other way. So, like, I'm definitely not. Okay.

46
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:24,329
I like that view. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I think it depends on the risk level, too, because we've been talking about drugs,

47
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:27,750
but also like we talked about yesterday and it could be physical therapy.

48
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:32,640
So sometimes the physical therapy, it's like it could help or it could just you could be the same.

49
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,160
So there's not really like a big risk level there.

50
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:41,100
Yeah, well, in all trials, right, we're supposed to minimize the risks and maximize the benefits, but yeah,

51
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:46,590
there are definitely different levels of that and what you perceive of that given the different types of interventions.

52
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:55,260
Yeah, I think would be probably the biggest consideration would be in fact on making an impact on your daily life.

53
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:59,210
I think there's a book about a woman who was in a cancer trial.

54
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:03,479
The drugs they were using wasn't allowed to be administered by her local hospitals,

55
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:08,800
and she had to drive 3 hours to it and it wasn't covered by her insurance.

56
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:16,790
So the study is making your payments from being very supportive to advertisements for so late that she paid by thousands of dollars first.

57
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:23,120
Yeah, that's a big. So the impact to your daily life so generally in clinical trials are not supposed to cost you,

58
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,050
but it could be in the fact that you're getting reimbursed and perhaps those are coming in late.

59
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:31,640
And if you have to go to a special place that's far away, right, that can be a huge impact.

60
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:36,590
And so maybe you would be willing to do that if that's your only option.

61
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:44,180
But if that's not, you probably won't for the sake of science, want to go out of your way every day and have issues?

62
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,500
Yeah. Any other thoughts?

63
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:55,900
Yeah, I would say, like, I probably won't check if the, you know, the trial was conducted by a credible institution or, you know.

64
00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:05,450
But what how do you define credible? Like, let's say, like for CBC, if a clinical trial conducted by CBC or by state level.

65
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:10,100
Okay. It's more like transport. Well, so that's an interesting question, right?

66
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:13,280
Like how do you trust the people putting on the clinical trial?

67
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:18,160
So maybe people would be more willing to come to the University of Michigan because it's a big research institution.

68
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:22,850
However, we also have a bunch of our trials that like community places, right?

69
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:28,640
And those community places could even be better than University of Michigan in terms of the care that they would provide.

70
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:38,840
So that is interesting to think about and probably need to potentially ask more right about it and learn more and maybe

71
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:45,800
not have as many stereotypes going into it about what could or couldn't be credible because it could it could differ.

72
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:50,780
Yeah, I think one thing that's cool about clinical trials, kind of like you were saying is it's not all drug dependent,

73
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:54,530
like there are behavioral and physical therapy interventions, things like that.

74
00:07:54,530 --> 00:08:00,110
So I do think that, you know, risk can obviously very and so I think to some extent there is a clinical trial that

75
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:04,400
you could find that people would be more willing to participate in so long as they're,

76
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:09,409
you know, given that swath. So I think most people would given a non drug.

77
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:14,510
I think it's more a non trial, I suppose maybe more people.

78
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:17,899
But yeah, so I thought that's absurd. Yeah.

79
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:23,780
I just wanted to kind of add in on the accessibility, you know, like I've always been really interested in participating in trials.

80
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:28,610
It seems like it's like a great way to just like help out and contribute to science.

81
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:31,459
Um, but especially like as a young,

82
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:37,430
healthy individual like you often there's not like a ton of opportunities or I guess I've never found it super easy.

83
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:40,759
Like now that I'm at a university, there's fliers everywhere.

84
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:45,049
But if you're not in a university, you're not in a setting where they're like trials being conducted.

85
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:49,070
It's a little bit harder to get involved and figure out, how do I become part of this?

86
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:52,730
So that's like another accessibility issue. I feel like they're not always that well advertised.

87
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:59,450
Yeah, that's a good point. So and we'll talk about like who are healthy individuals in trials or are sick individuals in trials?

88
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:05,120
We're probably mostly thinking that it's like six sick individuals, but actually most phase one trials,

89
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,629
which we'll talk about in a few lectures, are dose finding trials.

90
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:11,510
And those are done except for in cancer, in healthy individuals.

91
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:16,220
So there are actually a lot of opportunities for healthy individuals or vaccine trials.

92
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:21,020
But yeah, thing finding out how do you find out about them, right?

93
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:27,589
You're on University of Michigan campus. You might see fliers or get emails, but trying to figure out how to get them out to people.

94
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:36,950
So I'm on several data safety monitoring board committees, do surveys for other trials, and this is often a question there's issues with accrual,

95
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:41,360
meaning we're not getting enough people, the trials aren't getting enough people recruited.

96
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:47,750
And so they're often saying there's a whole discussion almost every December meeting on how do we get this out, how do we get this out?

97
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:52,010
So I was on a DSB meeting yesterday, the day before, and they were saying,

98
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:57,580
let's try radio ads, maybe the radio, maybe people listening to the radio are going to live.

99
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:04,220
I guess this is like old people they're trying to target like they're on Spotify or I don't know what you guys do, but that's what I do.

100
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:10,580
Oh, I'm already old person, so I don't know. But right, like, you know, get on the radio or they're like, try social media.

101
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:13,819
And so, yeah, how do we get that?

102
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:20,780
There are websites that you can join, but you have to know about those in order to join them or you have to go to your principal or your

103
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:25,340
primary care provider for them to tell you there are these opportunities and not everyone does that.

104
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:29,809
So that's a really good. Good point. Anything else?

105
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:38,870
Yeah, for me, I think the key factor is whether it's a personal interaction and we are happy the staff really like making

106
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:47,240
you feel comfortable in terms of being across the aisle because if I just like randomly see some poster.

107
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:52,370
As I probably. Don't have that trust yet.

108
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:57,020
So I just think that personal connection is the key.

109
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:02,580
Yeah, that's a really great point. So personal connection is the key. How trustworthy do you feel like this stuff is?

110
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:09,590
And we're going to see that again as we go through this lecture. You know, my so I told you, I've been in a clinical trial.

111
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:16,790
I've been in two. Maybe the one was I thought I was a grad student and I found out about it from a flier or something.

112
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:20,090
And I thought it would be fun because it was a drinking clinical trial.

113
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:27,360
So they like say you had you got rid of mice, either get drinks and get drunk or you got randomized to placebo.

114
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,759
And I was like, This is great. I've got somebody to pick you up.

115
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,790
And I was like, Somebody is going to pay me to have some drinks. Awesome.

116
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:38,929
So I signed up for it and I go and then they told me it wasn't blinded.

117
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:47,690
So then they were like, You're a placebo man. That was like, I had my friend on call to pick me up.

118
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:56,419
I was like, Never mind, I can help you get ahold of myself. So that was my that was my one experience with a clinical trial.

119
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:02,360
It's kind of funny. Oh, so. Right. That's one that maybe more people would be willing to participate in.

120
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:07,070
Whereas if it's like get this serious drug or vaccine that we don't know about, maybe what it.

121
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:15,679
All right. So. Randomized controlled clinical trials are considered.

122
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,760
What is the gold standard of providing evidence for treatment?

123
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:25,610
We think that while we can get this observational data, case control studies, cohort studies,

124
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:30,920
retrospective studies, there's all this issues with confounding, possible confounding.

125
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:40,700
So we want this prospective assignment randomization, which we'll talk more about to give us really great quality evidence.

126
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:44,800
And so we would hope, I think, right.

127
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:52,940
That we want to have that evidence be generalizable to whatever population is then going to take the drug or the treatment, the intervention.

128
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:59,960
So we would like most likely all genders, all racial and ethnic groups to be represented.

129
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:07,669
So we're hoping that if we have diversity in clinical trials, right,

130
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:13,250
that we can then know more about the general population that would receive that intervention.

131
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:21,770
If we have if we get people in trials, right. Possibly we're we're giving we're giving something that's going to have benefit.

132
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:23,540
So maybe there's lower mortality.

133
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:30,350
Maybe there are new discoveries in different populations because we have this diversity and we could see specific biomarkers.

134
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:34,420
Does everybody know what the biomarkers? Yeah.

135
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:39,100
So biomarkers, right. Are some some any measurement something that we can measure.

136
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:51,399
It could be from blood. It could be something else from individual that's related to either a treatment success or your maybe not with treatment,

137
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,860
but just your natural progression of disease.

138
00:13:54,730 --> 00:14:01,000
And so if we have diversity and you have enough of those people in the trial, we could actually look at that and get get some idea from the data.

139
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,750
We can also potentially look at what's called pharmacogenomics.

140
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:13,959
So looking at is the drug metabolized differently by different genetic makeup, which is unlikely probably to be associated with race and ethnicity.

141
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,390
And we'll talk about why in a second, but potentially could be.

142
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:26,920
So just a reminder of a lot of those ethical issues that we talked about Tuesday that really focus.

143
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:31,570
There are all issues with with either clinical trials or human subjects, research.

144
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:35,200
And a lot of it was very racist based.

145
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:42,310
So there is the Tuskegee study that was a horrific study that really targeted black men.

146
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:46,110
There were the Nazi experiments which were targeting Jewish individuals.

147
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:50,110
There's the neuron. So that created the Nuremberg code.

148
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:56,620
But then there was even after that, that there might a tragedy, which was unfortunate for most women.

149
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,810
This was a lot of white women in the UK.

150
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:05,050
Then there's also something called The Trail of Tears, which we didn't talk about the read more about, if you like.

151
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:11,050
And this was very unfortunate in the 1970s of sterilization of Native American individuals.

152
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:19,360
And so then in the late 1970s, the Belmont Report tried to take some ideas from the Nuremberg Code and say,

153
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:29,560
here are here are some three main principles that we should really be upholding in clinical trials and human subjects research that beneficence,

154
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:37,720
respect and justice. So we want the fair distribution of benefits and burdens of medical research across all groups,

155
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:43,300
and we should pay particular attention to what we're going to call or what they called vulnerable groups,

156
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:50,619
which were our historically marginalized individuals from our race and ethnicity perspective, and also women also,

157
00:15:50,620 --> 00:16:00,699
as we move on through this, another note, a lot of these slides consider gender as binary, and we know that that's not a binary concept.

158
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:06,130
However, you're going to see that it's mainly going to focus on comparison of men versus women.

159
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:11,620
But yet another issue with thinking about gender as binary.

160
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:20,200
So in 1993 and I said, okay, we have the Belmont Report, we have these code for ethics,

161
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:27,280
but there are still issues with a lack of diversity or underrepresented groups in clinical trials.

162
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:34,629
So maybe we can help this because the national the NIH, National Institutes of Health are often funding clinical trials.

163
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:38,200
So they said, what can we do to try to help encourage diversity?

164
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:47,230
So they had this Revitalization Act, which mandated appropriate inclusion of underrepresented groups in their funded research.

165
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:52,809
So they were specifically calling out representation of women, older adults.

166
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:57,970
So older older adults are generally also not very represented in clinical trials.

167
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:01,960
And then racial and ethnic, historically marginalized communities.

168
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:05,530
And they would be evaluated in the NIH review process.

169
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:08,619
So I don't know how much of you know about NIH grants,

170
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:18,009
but what happens is that investigators write a proposal for a trial or for a study, and then they would have to have this part on it.

171
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:22,240
That said, who are we including? And then it goes to a study section.

172
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:31,000
And that's a group of of experts in the area who read it and evaluate it and say, okay, this is worthwhile or this is not worthwhile.

173
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:38,500
And then after that, it goes to NIH, people who decide this is something we want to fund, and so we will fund it.

174
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:45,880
So this is something that the study section and the NIH was supposed to look at and consider in their criteria for funding.

175
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:51,700
And so they said specifically that women and historically marginalized communities

176
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:57,489
must be included in research unless it is otherwise justified for scientific reasons.

177
00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:01,450
Like you're studying prostate cancer, obviously you're not going to include women in that.

178
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:07,120
Right, or to think about many other good examples.

179
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,900
Right. But something like that where it would be useful.

180
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:13,930
So this is the catch 22.

181
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:20,200
If we don't know which drugs are safest and most effective for pregnant women and children, why don't they just let us into clinical trials?

182
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,259
Well, we're trying to protect you from them, but then we don't know what to treat you with.

183
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:27,969
Right? So we have to be really careful about who is in our trials, and we want to be careful for them.

184
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:34,120
But yet, if we want to treat these individuals with this treatment, then we should let them be in the trials.

185
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:42,970
So within this revitalization act and I age to find people into five groups based on their race or ethnicity.

186
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:48,010
So you are either American Indian or Alaskan Native Asian or Pacific Islander Black.

187
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:53,050
Not of Hispanic origin. Hispanic or white, not of Hispanic origin.

188
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:57,360
As you can see, there's a lot of things missing. Right.

189
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:08,399
They decided that these were five buckets and people would have to fit in these five buckets and it made it cause some problems.

190
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,250
Right. Recruiters are now saying, well, what about individuals who are mixed race?

191
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:15,770
What about people who are considered other race or consider something else?

192
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:24,750
Right. What do we do about that? So this became, while perhaps well-intentioned, not quite done well in practice.

193
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:34,440
So this is actually the inclusion enrollment report that NIH provides that all investigators looking for funding must fill out.

194
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:39,120
And so you can see here that it had those five categories and then they decided, oh, yeah, you're right.

195
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,810
Okay. There are people who could be more than one. Let's just add more than one. Now we've covered everyone.

196
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:51,449
So you have to fill this out. If you want a clinical trial or a study and you have to estimate the number of individuals you anticipate to

197
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:59,550
recruit and enroll in your trial in each of these groups and show that you are filling all of these boxes.

198
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:06,360
And then I looks at this and says, Is that representative or is that good enough?

199
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:16,970
So like I said, maybe this was well intentioned to increase diversity and in trials.

200
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,950
However, it's quite controversial.

201
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:29,330
So the guidelines can ultimately be interpreted as implying that we must focus on these different races because different races are different.

202
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:34,790
And so things are going to be different for the different races because of these biological differences.

203
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:37,850
And that's why we have to have people in these different groups.

204
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:42,319
However, hopefully most of you, all of you know.

205
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:47,390
Right, that all people are in the DNA of all people is 99.9% the same.

206
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:55,760
And so we kind of sometimes some people think this essentialist concept of race like, oh, we're super different, right?

207
00:20:56,030 --> 00:21:02,790
That of people of African descent and orange people of European descent and green and people of Asian descent and purple like that.

208
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:07,610
We're so different biologically, right? We look different. We must be very, very different genetically.

209
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:15,190
Maybe there is some overlap. There is the population concept of race like, okay, we're not that different, but we're still really different.

210
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,160
But people do mix. So, you know, there's some more overlap of these.

211
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:26,690
However, the actual right pattern of sort of genetic diversity is that there is not much genetic diversity and there's

212
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:32,930
much more genetic diversity of people who come from African descent than from those of Asian and European.

213
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:43,400
And you can see that the Asian and European are almost right, are like completely within the African descent in terms of genetic diversity.

214
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:51,170
And there's just very little non-overlapping pieces between the individuals from Asian and European descent.

215
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:57,850
So there's really genetically biologically race is not a concept, right?

216
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:06,740
Race is really a structural social concept. That is, we should not be thinking, oh, we have to separate these because biologically we're so different.

217
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:10,370
It's that things can be socially or structurally different.

218
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:17,030
But that wasn't really the message being put out by the NIH or by others in this Revitalization Act.

219
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:26,880
There's another problem. So NIH is trying. Right. Which, you know, we give credit for people who are trying.

220
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:31,320
However, unfortunately, NIH, their fund,

221
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:38,160
the amount of trials that they were funding in terms of the total number of trials has just been going down considerably over time.

222
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:42,270
So there's less money allotted to the National Institutes of Health from the government.

223
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:46,120
And National Institutes of Health have many things that they want to fund.

224
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:56,010
So it's not just clinical trials. So as you can see here, right, that these are all all NIH funded trials that from 2005 to 2015 are going down.

225
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:03,150
And you can see these other lines or just like what phase trials are they in?

226
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:11,489
But ultimately, NIH is funding all the trials. A lot of pharmaceutical companies or nonprofit organizations are funding trials.

227
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:17,250
And if they don't have to abide by NIH rules, then there's no incentive for diversity.

228
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:26,590
So the FDA steps in and they actually only created this office in 2010.

229
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:31,930
It's the Office of Minority Health and Health Equity. And they said, okay, you're right.

230
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:35,010
There is this issue in clinical trials in terms of representation,

231
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:39,520
we'll create this office such that it's a drug at least that's going to be a new drug.

232
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:45,070
And given maybe we can try to promote and protect the health of diverse populations

233
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:50,410
with for those clinical trials that are going to have to go through the FDA.

234
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:54,729
So they have tailored communication and research. They have several goals listed on their website.

235
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:57,280
I just took these straight from their website.

236
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:03,490
They're trying to increase transparency, increasing the amount and quality of clinical trial data on underrepresented groups.

237
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:11,230
They want to think about trials specifically for individuals who are underrepresented in terms of what are the health concerns there,

238
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:18,340
and then promote health and safety communication. So they came out with this enhancing the diversity of clinical trial population.

239
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,730
But as you can read here, right, this is all just sort of like a mission.

240
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:25,810
Nothing is mandated or necessary or required.

241
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:31,239
So this is, again, something that's probably very well intentioned but not necessarily going to

242
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:36,639
make a difference because it's just something that is going to maybe help.

243
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,760
But but not it's not a mandate.

244
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:49,790
So there's a fair amount. There was a fair amount of controversy still to this day, a discussion about, you know, what do we do?

245
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:57,799
And so there is a lot of of discussion about, okay, this is helpful, but this is not a mandate.

246
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:04,160
And so maybe the FDA should actually be mandating clinical trials to have some level of diversity in them,

247
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:08,630
especially in areas where we know that there are big health disparities.

248
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,090
Right. So there's a lot of research going on, especially now about health disparities.

249
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:20,300
And so if we know that health disparities exist, then we should really be targeting specific populations in our trials.

250
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:29,600
The National Black Church Initiative pushed the FDA to mandate diversity in 2017 and said that if you leave it up to the pharmaceutical company,

251
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,280
there's no incentive. They're not going to do it.

252
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:36,469
They're just going to try to get whatever patients they can as fast as they can so that they're not spending more money.

253
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:39,950
On keeping the trials open or on recruitment. Right.

254
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:46,580
And so there has been a push for financial incentives for diversity.

255
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:49,850
But still, in 2022, none of these things exist.

256
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:55,030
So there's there are ideas and they're offices to try to promote this.

257
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:58,550
However, there are no mandates in terms of diversity in clinical trials.

258
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:05,580
So why don't we actually get a look of is this a problem?

259
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:11,040
Right. So I'm saying it's a I guess I've been saying it's a problem, but how much of a problem is it?

260
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:16,739
Let's look at the data. So this comes from actually I updated this yesterday.

261
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:24,190
It's not 2015 to 2016 is 2019. This was the latest clinical trials landscape that exists from the FDA.

262
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:37,200
And so this is just a set of a simple histogram, right, of the countries that had greater than 1% of all clinical trials.

263
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:43,470
And how many what percentage of that? The clinical trials that they had there were all conducted in 2019.

264
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:50,910
So these countries listed here account for 96% of all trial participants.

265
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:55,980
The remaining 4% of participants were distributed across 59 countries.

266
00:26:56,220 --> 00:27:01,040
And so you can see that much of the clinical trial research that is ongoing,

267
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:06,870
most of the most of the or not most, but like a large portion of individuals are coming from the US.

268
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:16,860
So 35% of all clinical trial participants were from the U.S., whereas 1 to 4% were from or less than 1% were from many other countries.

269
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:28,650
So what does it look like globally in terms of the sex, race, age and ethnicity distributions?

270
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:37,110
So globally, it's almost 5050 in terms of men and women participation in clinical trials, at least in 2019,

271
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:49,920
76% of individuals in trials were white, 11% Asian, 7% black or African-American, 5% other races, and 1% American-Indian or Alaskan native.

272
00:27:52,020 --> 00:28:01,290
Majority of individuals, almost 70% were younger, less than 65 and 31% were older, older than 65.

273
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:05,940
And then you can see the breakdown of the ethnicity distribution,

274
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:14,100
where 67% were not Hispanic or Latino, 20%, we don't know, and 13% were Hispanic or Latino.

275
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:20,490
So we can see, obviously, right. That if we look at this year, you know,

276
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:28,890
it looks good in terms of the sex distribution as a majority of white individuals in trials who are younger than 65 and not Hispanic or Latino.

277
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:34,080
So if we break it down a little bit more and look at global versus the U.S.,

278
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:39,360
actually, the U.S. is heavily, much more heavily women in clinical trials.

279
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:44,000
Not much more, but 56%. Right. As opposed to the 51%.

280
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:47,850
And that's most likely driven by women's specific clinical trials.

281
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:55,470
So breast cancer trials, gynecologic trials, those are more likely being done in the U.S. than in other places.

282
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:07,110
If we look at the race distribution, the globally, what we saw before the 76, 11, 75 and one.

283
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:17,270
If we look at the US, it's 78% white individuals, 2% of Asian individuals, 16% black,

284
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:23,400
black or African American, 1% American, Indian or Alaskan native and 3% other.

285
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:35,880
And so we could compare that to the U.S. population. So the U.S. population is roughly 76% white, almost 14% black, 6% Asian and 1.3% American Indian.

286
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:44,700
So if you think that we should have representation that is generalizable to the greater U.S. population,

287
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:54,480
then perhaps we're doing relatively well in terms of whites and black individuals and American Indians,

288
00:29:54,480 --> 00:30:00,120
maybe, but we clearly have many less Asian individuals in our U.S. trials.

289
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,620
However, we must also note that this is an aggregate, right?

290
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:11,870
We're not looking at specific clinical trials or specific areas of clinical trials.

291
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:18,290
Summarizing over and taking a mean which is not always the best summary statistic.

292
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:23,060
Right. You all know that from six one or some of our previous classes.

293
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,970
So if we look down across therapeutic areas.

294
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:32,580
Right, it can really differ in terms of the race and ethnicity breakdown in these various therapeutic areas.

295
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:37,489
So you can see, right, many of the participants were coming from cardiovascular diseases.

296
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:46,100
So there really big cardiovascular studies in 2019 with the majority of participants where it seems like there's relatively good representation,

297
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:50,359
maybe of these are not in percentages. So it's a little bit hard to see.

298
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:56,360
But the bars, right, are the size of Asian-Americans or Asian individuals and white individuals,

299
00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:00,320
but not so great in terms of black or African-American or others.

300
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:07,010
And you can see that maybe an infectious diseases there is better representation of those who are black or African-American.

301
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:12,350
And so you can just see that there is a huge variety in the types of diseases,

302
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:17,510
in clinical trials, in terms of the populations that they're actually recruiting from.

303
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:22,190
And so you could imagine that that will affect crude,

304
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:29,570
that drugs are really appropriate for how much information we have about all of these different groups and how.

305
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:33,900
It could be beneficial for for everyone or not everyone.

306
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:50,899
So if we take a specific snapshot in time of the 2019 Food and Drug Administration Center for Drug Evaluation and Research approved drug trials.

307
00:31:50,900 --> 00:32:00,700
So the Cedar is the group and the FDA who approve all of the drug, all the drugs for that will go out into the world.

308
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:13,060
Right. So in 2019, there are 48 approved new drugs and 46 a little over 46,000 individuals participated in the trials related to those 48 new drugs.

309
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:21,180
And so if you see this, there are actually in all of those drugs, 72% of all those participants of the 46,000 were women.

310
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:25,509
And that's because five trials were only in women.

311
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:29,440
So they are either breast cancer or some gynecologic treatment.

312
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:39,820
72% were or white. 9% of individuals identified as black or African-American, 9% Asian, 18% Hispanic,

313
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:46,030
36% were age 65 and older, and 40% of the individuals were from the U.S.

314
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:56,410
So if we take that and compare it to at least the U.S. population right now, we're doing better in terms of the individuals of it who are Asian,

315
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:03,219
but we're doing much worse in terms of individuals who are black or African-American, although these are global trials.

316
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:12,310
Right. So only 40% of these were from the U.S. So after looking at that right, what do you think?

317
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,930
Is there a problem?

318
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:22,300
Maybe we can differentiate historically, although we did look a lot of historical data, but like thinking historically versus currently.

319
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:26,710
Do you have any thoughts? Do you think that there's issues with representation?

320
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:33,940
Whether or not. Anyone.

321
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:43,290
Yeah. I was just going to say, like kind of just looking at the first chart about participants by country.

322
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:47,819
Yeah, it seems like like most of the trials are done here in the US.

323
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:53,490
So that to me seems like there's a little bit of bias going on there just because like

324
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:57,780
environmental conditions and social conditions in other countries would definitely affect them.

325
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:02,010
And then also people in these other countries aren't getting necessarily access

326
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:07,379
to me in these trials and have like first access to these emerging drugs.

327
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:11,100
So that kind of seems like a small problem.

328
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:18,240
Yeah. Yeah, right. If we all can just think about I don't know how much you followed the COVID vaccine trials, but.

329
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:26,320
Right. It's really interesting to see that the US was doing very different trials than, say, Russia, say China, India.

330
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:30,330
Right. There are all sorts of vaccines that differ by the geographic region.

331
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:36,210
So not everyone has access to the same medications, right? The rest of the world doesn't have to deal with the FDA.

332
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:38,490
They might have their own regulation.

333
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:45,750
So there are very different potentially very different trials, very different treatments going on around around the world.

334
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:52,660
Any other thoughts about diversity in trials?

335
00:34:55,120 --> 00:35:03,130
In aggregate, maybe it doesn't look that bad, but once you start diving deep down into like certain areas, it starts looking worse and worse.

336
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:13,660
That's kind of the message. So you don't see a lot. I didn't get into too much of the details here, but it's not great for a lot of different areas.

337
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:22,130
And. It's although it's not a trivial question to say what should the makeup of each trial be?

338
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:26,420
So we'll we'll think a little bit more or maybe have some discussion about that.

339
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:33,290
You know, and it's important to think about, you know, maybe we look one way right now in the U.S.,

340
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:38,629
but we're certainly moving toward another in another direction where right there is

341
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:43,400
no longer what we used to call minority groups are going to be majority groups.

342
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:51,649
And so thinking about, you know, what we should think about what representation do we want or need in trials,

343
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:56,450
given that individuals in the U.S. taking the drugs are going to be a changing landscape?

344
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:04,200
So what do you think? What does an ideal trial participant makeup look like?

345
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:08,580
Like, should it be generalizable to the U.S. population?

346
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:10,950
Should it be generalizable to the.

347
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:25,190
Population in which has that disease or disorder, should it be oversampled for individuals who are most likely to get have that disease right.

348
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:33,190
Like what? What do you think? That the ideal representation would be in trials.

349
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:40,389
Does anybody have. There's no right answer. So, yeah, one thing that comes to my mind is that these underrepresented groups in trials,

350
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:47,920
even though they are perhaps a smaller population size in the U.S. or other countries, there's not a lot of data points.

351
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:54,730
So. That's the thing that would make me a little nervous about making something generalizable to a certain group.

352
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:59,750
If you only have, you know, a third of the amount of data compared to something else or even less than that.

353
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:06,319
Yeah, that's a really good point. So a lot of times of trials, you up, you write your main analysis, going be on everybody, right?

354
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,799
You're going to have some final saying about like across all these people, right?

355
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:13,010
For public health. This is the this is the conclusion.

356
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:19,969
But often we do what's called subgroup analyzes, which maybe we could think about in terms of lots of different things,

357
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:26,629
not just race and ethnicity or or sex or gender, but other severity or co-morbidities or whatever.

358
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:32,630
Right. And that there are very few people in that group. How are you actually saying that they are representative of a much larger group?

359
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:38,570
So that's a really good point. Yeah, I know there are some like cancer trials.

360
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:47,390
Like were there only like include people that have some biomarkers like now like PD one positive of the now.

361
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:54,140
Yes. I think that's a very good train that the also include the people that really have biomarkers.

362
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:57,379
So I think that's a good idea for. Yeah.

363
00:37:57,380 --> 00:38:06,440
So they're right there are specific and targeted treatments that are made to treat people with specific biomarkers.

364
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:12,530
And so some trials now are saying, okay, if you have a specific biomarker that you can be in and if you don't, you can't be in it.

365
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:17,209
Although I will say that there are some issues with that because then we don't know about the people without the biomarker.

366
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:21,980
Like how specific is that drug? Is it really only effective for the biomarker positive people?

367
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:28,609
And unless you have a really good data that it is, you could be missing giving it to more people that could also benefit.

368
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:35,360
So that actually happened in a big breast cancer trial for HER2 positive women.

369
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:40,190
They gave a specific they said, okay, if you're HER2 positive, you can be in this trial, will give us treatment.

370
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:44,270
The way that they measured it was actually quite faulty.

371
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:49,010
And so they had some women who are not HER2 positive in the trial and who went back and analyze the data.

372
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:55,249
They realized, Oh, they did well with this treatment too. And so they wouldn't have known that had they not had those women in it.

373
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:58,729
And automatically, you know, only focus on that group.

374
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:03,740
So it can be really it can be really good, but it can also be an issue of you don't have enough science.

375
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:14,190
Any other thoughts? Sarah So in terms of like, should we recruit more populations that are at higher risk?

376
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:18,479
Do you think of like an extreme example with tropical diseases,

377
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:27,800
which I think might be driving the large black and African-American population for the infectious disease section on Slide 22?

378
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:37,830
But like the black individuals are at a much higher risk for something like malaria geographically and genetically.

379
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:42,570
So I think it would make sense to recruit more of that population.

380
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:51,090
But then like if you think of things on a scale of like it would depend, like how much higher risk are they?

381
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:55,230
What is the global public health burden?

382
00:39:55,320 --> 00:40:04,350
Those types of things. Yeah, right. So we know that thing that diseases and disorders differ geographically and people differ geographically.

383
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:09,210
So thinking about who is actually going to require this treatment.

384
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:13,150
Right. Is going to differ from trial to trial.

385
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:19,379
And so your definition of the ideal population is going to differ from trial to trial based on geography,

386
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:23,400
on treatment involved on the individuals with the disease disorder.

387
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:30,550
Okay. So just so put it together, right?

388
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:33,910
Like what? One word or phrase.

389
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:37,599
I think, actually, there's a trick to if you have a phrase, to keep it together.

390
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:41,510
I don't remember. I do it to put dashes in it or something. I don't know.

391
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:44,980
Think of like a word or a small number of words. It's going to be a word cloud.

392
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:48,760
Cloud of what the ideal trial spin make up looks like.

393
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:13,150
Oh yeah. Write it all together. Representative of at risk populations.

394
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:16,840
Okay. You can think of things like should it be diverse? Should it be specific?

395
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:20,430
Should it be? General.

396
00:41:22,370 --> 00:41:33,410
Representative. Yeah. A super tiny.

397
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:40,690
Equally representative, each group were at risk tailored to the study.

398
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:46,829
Inequality, although hard to define. Right? Yeah. What does equality mean?

399
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:50,550
Does that mean equal numbers of individuals or.

400
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:57,600
Oversample minority populations.

401
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:08,160
Yeah. So this is definitely a big question in clinical trials research and it it likely varies from

402
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:12,959
study to study and it's something that really needs to be thought about in every trial.

403
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:23,790
There is a lot of time focused on the inclusion and exclusion criteria for that trial that not just things about race and ethnicity and gender or sex,

404
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:34,680
but also is thinking a lot about other histories of individuals or other characteristics of individuals or it's fully randomized.

405
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:39,330
There's a little bit of a different question, but yeah, we'll get to the randomization part eventually.

406
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:43,440
So let's focus in in one area.

407
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:51,780
So it's actually been quite clear in cancer research that the representation of black Americans is really quite poor.

408
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:56,010
So this is from 2015, 2016, but I don't think it's different.

409
00:42:56,340 --> 00:43:08,790
It's that different in 2022 that there are only 2.74% of all individuals in cancer clinical trials identify as black or African-American.

410
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:15,150
I don't know why FDA is called oncology, right? No.

411
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:18,660
Any proof? Read that. That picture.

412
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:26,309
Okay. So, right. The Vitalization acceptance happened when you all grew, like not quite born or something, right?

413
00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:36,810
And then in 2014, 20 years after the Revitalization Act was put into place, the group wrote an article saying, okay, so what does it look like now?

414
00:43:36,810 --> 00:43:43,560
20 years after we've had this revitalization act, we've tried to promote diversity in trials.

415
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:51,600
What does it look like specifically in cancer? So this looked at 10,000 National Cancer Institute.

416
00:43:51,600 --> 00:44:01,290
So that's one of the institutes within the NIH that funds cancer trials, looked at 10,000 NCI funded trials up to 2 to 2 in 2013,

417
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:10,590
and they found that about 1% of cancer clinical trials focused primarily on racial or ethnic historically marginalized population.

418
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:22,259
And that's extremely, extremely low. So if we look here, we can see that the cancer of the middle is the cancer incidence of individuals per 100,000.

419
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:32,010
So you can see that, right? The individuals who identify as black or African-American have a cancer incidence of five 93.7 per 100,000.

420
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:39,780
That's actually higher than those who are white, 513 per 100,000, which is higher than those who are Hispanic or Latino,

421
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:45,120
which is higher than Asian or Pacific Islanders and higher than American Indians or Alaska Natives.

422
00:44:45,870 --> 00:44:55,260
This enrollment fraction over here is that 1.7% of all people with cancer enroll in clinical trials.

423
00:44:55,770 --> 00:45:04,919
And so if you think about the 1.3% of individuals who are black, who have cancer enroll in clinical trials, right?

424
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:12,180
So it's actually lower for individuals who are black or African-American, the percentage of individuals with cancer that enroll in trials.

425
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:17,370
So we can see that there is that issue, that underrepresentation, whereas there are more individuals,

426
00:45:17,490 --> 00:45:22,470
slightly more individuals who are white with cancer, that role, less who are Hispanic or Latino.

427
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:32,190
Right on the average for those who are Asian and surprisingly higher for American Indians or Alaska Natives who enroll in these clinical trials.

428
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:39,930
So there is a lot of literature like. So why why is there a lack of diversity?

429
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:47,250
Right. There could be a lot of reasons why. And so one question is, are underrepresented groups less willing?

430
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:51,930
Are they more likely to say, no, I am not going to be in a clinical trial.

431
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:57,360
And a lot of people thought that this might be the case, especially for black Americans, because of Tuskegee.

432
00:45:57,750 --> 00:46:06,450
So, right, we talk slightly about Tuskegee, but that very long for a study.

433
00:46:06,450 --> 00:46:11,729
It wasn't a clinical trial, but it was a study that was just really terrible for black men saying that we're going to

434
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:15,690
get your bad blood and then there's this treatment and we're withholding it from you.

435
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:22,049
So there was a belief that there was a Tuskegee effect such that black individuals would

436
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:26,370
be more reluctant to agree to participate in a research studies than white individuals.

437
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:31,080
However, there have been many, many studies that have shown that this is not the case.

438
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:36,840
So it is true that black individuals are more likely to know about the Tuskegee study than white individuals.

439
00:46:37,050 --> 00:46:44,730
However, they are have a comparable willing level of willingness to participate in trials than that of whites.

440
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:51,150
And so we can see this from some of this data here. So this is what's called a forest plot.

441
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:54,120
Have any of you seen the forest plot before? Yeah.

442
00:46:54,630 --> 00:47:01,620
So this is often used in what are called meta analyzes, which we'll talk about at the very end of this of this class.

443
00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:10,409
Not this class, but this semester. And so you can see here that it's broken out in between interview or non intervention studies.

444
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:13,770
So meaning like they're not giving a treatment, right? There's no intervention here.

445
00:47:14,730 --> 00:47:22,020
They're just collecting collecting data versus intervention studies like clinical trials or giving treatment or interventions.

446
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:31,290
And the more that the point estimate, which is right like this, the little diamonds in the middle, you can't even see that one was there.

447
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:39,540
Right. Their point estimates of the odds ratio of that individuals who are underrepresented, if it's on the right,

448
00:47:39,930 --> 00:47:49,260
that more individuals who are underrepresented would participate versus on the left less there's less participation from underrepresented individuals.

449
00:47:50,730 --> 00:47:59,520
And so you can see here that over 20 studies this over 70,000 individuals, that the odds ratio of one means that there's no difference.

450
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:02,670
Right. That there's similar participation between those who are underrepresented and not.

451
00:48:03,390 --> 00:48:06,719
And so that for the most part, right.

452
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:13,200
All of our men, many of our point estimates and our confidence intervals are all around the odds ratio of one.

453
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:19,710
So that in some studies there is actually more willingness from individuals who are underrepresented in some studies.

454
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:23,459
There's less willingness, but overall there's comparable willingness.

455
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:26,460
And this the large diamonds. Right.

456
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:33,360
The the totals here, show us the the average across all of the studies of that willingness.

457
00:48:33,570 --> 00:48:39,690
So it's not that African-American or black individuals are less willing to participate.

458
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:46,130
Similarly, they ask this question with those who are Hispanic or Latino versus those who are not.

459
00:48:46,550 --> 00:48:47,420
And similarly,

460
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:56,270
I actually found a positive odds ratio that those are Hispanic or Latino are more likely or more willing to participate than those who are white.

461
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:06,680
So then the next question is, okay, so if there's comparable willingness then ah, is there less awareness of these clinical trials?

462
00:49:08,090 --> 00:49:13,249
And so there are there has been there have been studies showing that there are substantial

463
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:18,890
differences in the number of historically marginalized participants invited to participate.

464
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:29,180
And so perhaps we should be focusing our attention on the access to participation as opposed to trying to change attitudes of people.

465
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:32,870
Right. Because attitudes actually are equally there's equal willingness.

466
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:36,620
So let's not change attitudes. Let's really focus on getting this out to more individuals.

467
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:44,209
There is unfortunately right either conscious or unconscious bias from providers who

468
00:49:44,210 --> 00:49:50,060
are just maybe not offering the trial to certain individuals for various reasons.

469
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:56,899
And sometimes there are issues in terms of like, well, I didn't want to offer,

470
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:59,780
I didn't want to present this trial to my patient because I felt like they weren't

471
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:03,740
going to understand it because of either cultural or language difficulties.

472
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:06,890
So therefore, I just didn't even ask them. Ask them.

473
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:15,260
There may be a belief that those with low access are not able to understand the trial and maybe would feel coerced.

474
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:18,530
So I'm not even going to ask individuals with low X.

475
00:50:20,090 --> 00:50:28,370
And it might also be the fact that like people in most places, running trials might be large research institutions like University of Michigan,

476
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:32,570
and that there's maybe not a lot of diversity in around that area.

477
00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:39,530
And so perhaps we need to be thinking about where these clinical trials are offered and the communities that they're offered for access to them.

478
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:46,930
So there is this study that looked at 7000 adults.

479
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:52,370
Again, this is in cancer, specifically in the Health Information National Trends Survey.

480
00:50:52,610 --> 00:50:58,040
And you can see that the majority of respondents were white. But there there is relatively.

481
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:06,770
Okay. Participation or individuals who are black and somewhat of Asian.

482
00:51:06,770 --> 00:51:10,250
Right. If we think about the percentages that we have in the U.S. population, this is closer.

483
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:21,650
It's not exact, but it's closer. And what they found was that it was actually the white, non-Hispanic, higher income,

484
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:30,290
educated individuals who had family members affected by cancer that were more likely to know about clinical trials than other individuals.

485
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:33,470
So again, here, these are odds ratios listed in this column.

486
00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:39,529
And you can see that the odds ratio is less than one for those who are Asian-American or black or African-American,

487
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:45,590
meaning that they're less likely to be aware than white individuals of clinical trials occurring.

488
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:55,310
Similarly, you can see that for those who are Hispanic or Latino, and then you can see variation across income ranges,

489
00:51:55,910 --> 00:52:02,360
education and as education, as education, income get higher, there's more likely to know about clinical trials.

490
00:52:08,810 --> 00:52:17,870
So they they said, all right, 57% of the clinical trials funded by NCI actually reported sample sizes by the racial or ethnic groups,

491
00:52:17,870 --> 00:52:21,700
whereas 43% of them didn't show this information.

492
00:52:21,710 --> 00:52:29,150
So it was hard to see what the participation level was. And actually, 36% of them provided analysis by racial or ethnic groups.

493
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:32,890
Now, whether that's appropriate or not is of question.

494
00:52:32,910 --> 00:52:38,120
Right. So perhaps those 64% are not wrong.

495
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:42,740
Right. That might actually be the better percentage. But just interesting here.

496
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:49,130
And so then they went on to say, so what do we think the barriers are for underrepresented group participation?

497
00:52:49,370 --> 00:52:57,290
Likely there is mistrust. There is the what we talked about earlier, like how much does it affect your daily life in terms of cost transportation?

498
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:01,280
There can be differences in cultural or religious perspectives.

499
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:07,810
In terms of clinical trials. There's lack of awareness. There is physician neglect in inviting participants.

500
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:12,840
There could be linguistic barriers. And then there are issues with right.

501
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:16,850
We just have inclusion, exclusion criteria. We have to have those for every trial.

502
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:23,540
And unfortunately, some of those might be so specific that they are very much excluding specific groups of individuals.

503
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:30,620
And so those perhaps need to be relaxed, but but perhaps are useful for what they're studying.

504
00:53:32,450 --> 00:53:37,400
So they they list out these barriers and then they separate them by being structural.

505
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:43,250
The lack of outreach programs, for example, whether there are restrictive inclusion criteria,

506
00:53:44,090 --> 00:53:50,450
whether it's unconscious or maybe conscious bias by physicians or research assistants,

507
00:53:50,690 --> 00:53:57,679
the costs for a participating meeting, meaning that perhaps they have to trans individuals have to transport themselves right.

508
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:04,579
Or take off work or whatever. And that there are again,

509
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:09,470
the clinical trials often happen at these large research institutions where we just don't have

510
00:54:09,650 --> 00:54:15,470
large communities of often don't have large communities of underrepresented individuals.

511
00:54:17,570 --> 00:54:26,570
So they did a literature review. They also went in and had a small focus group, qualitative interviews with individuals,

512
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:35,809
both patients and clinicians, and found that these large areas were really what some of the barriers were.

513
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:45,890
So there was mistrust, like understanding the value fears, stigma of participating, not trusting the staff, as was said earlier.

514
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:54,440
Right. Like if you don't feel comfortable, why would you be a part of it? Lack of just overall, lack of comfort, lack of information.

515
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:57,800
So remember we talked about that informed consent process.

516
00:54:58,110 --> 00:55:04,249
Supposed to give time. You're supposed to explain it well and in eighth grade or below language for everyone.

517
00:55:04,250 --> 00:55:10,340
But that's not always the case. There are time resource constraints, so there's the financial burden,

518
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:17,390
the time commitment that perhaps is not going to have you engage in a clinical trial and then obviously the lack of awareness.

519
00:55:18,890 --> 00:55:23,209
So they had a lot of themes for solutions given these barriers.

520
00:55:23,210 --> 00:55:27,820
So they said, well, we should reinforce personal health, we should ensure safety, right?

521
00:55:27,830 --> 00:55:33,260
So people might think, oh, clinical trial, you're going to give me something that isn't safe.

522
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:38,240
I don't want to be in this. Right. We have to make sure that we know that individuals know that we're trying to minimize harms.

523
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:44,690
We should appreciate involvement of the patient for participating.

524
00:55:44,690 --> 00:55:52,159
So usually that does come in a monetary compensation, but also obviously we should acknowledge with words.

525
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:57,140
Thank you for being a part of the study and then usually giving a follow up of like, here's what we found.

526
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:04,160
That can also be very helpful, emphasizing available support, making sure that it's more patient centric,

527
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:09,440
providing transportation, flexible hours and compensation and.

528
00:56:10,490 --> 00:56:16,220
Creating potentially mobile apps or providing cell phones if that's going to be an important part of collecting the data.

529
00:56:16,850 --> 00:56:21,290
So I was just thinking about I get called occasionally.

530
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:29,140
So, right, I have two kids and they go to a primary care physician and that primary care physician is connected to the research networks.

531
00:56:29,150 --> 00:56:34,580
And so I occasionally get calls that are like, Hey, do you want to enroll your kid in a trial?

532
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:39,660
It meets 9 to 5 on Monday. And I'm like, No, I'm not.

533
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:44,149
I'm not taking my kid out of school and I'm not going to stop doing work to go to that.

534
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:53,479
So like clearly. Right. You can think about who they're excluding to be in this trial based on on who I mean, I'm not even sure who they're including.

535
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:55,490
Right. Like, who are they including in these trials,

536
00:56:55,490 --> 00:57:01,670
individuals who have a parent who can stay at home and the kid doesn't go to school or daycare to go to these trials.

537
00:57:01,670 --> 00:57:06,620
It's like a very specific group that obviously these I just wonder like,

538
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:11,419
what are you what results are you actually going to generalize about these children?

539
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:20,239
Because I don't I don't see it. So, again, this is very important to think about who is in the trial and how are you going to get them to the trial?

540
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:30,320
And you have to be flexible about that. So they then say, well, some cancer centers have really succeeded because they have a they have commitment,

541
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:36,650
leadership, they have a focus on diversity. They've also really thought about this in terms of the hiring,

542
00:57:36,650 --> 00:57:42,680
training and mentoring of the individuals who are going to be recruiting the patients or people on the trial.

543
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:44,930
There's community engagement practice.

544
00:57:44,930 --> 00:57:52,700
So this is a big, big area now, community engagement or community based participatory research where individuals are going into communities.

545
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:59,120
So not just like, all right, I'm going to go to the in Michigan medicine, right?

546
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:07,759
It's like I'm going to go into Dearborn and I'm going to talk to individuals at different places, at churches, at at schools.

547
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:08,870
Right. I'm going to go to Flint.

548
00:58:08,870 --> 00:58:15,169
So I have some clinical trials that were done in Flint and they went into Flint churches particularly to talk to individuals in Flint and to say,

549
00:58:15,170 --> 00:58:20,240
here's what we're doing, here's why we're doing it, here's why we'd love you to be involved, here's how you can be involved.

550
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:27,500
So thinking about those practices and then other types of patient engagement practices

551
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:31,879
and making sure that the materials can be culturally appropriate and also flexible.

552
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:37,520
So a lot of things, informed consent will not only be in English but also in Spanish or in other languages

553
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:42,230
to make sure that people can understand and get a wider variety of individuals.

554
00:58:44,060 --> 00:58:47,450
So the FDA had that Office of Minority Health.

555
00:58:47,660 --> 00:58:51,649
Right. And then they said, okay, well, we can create a guidance document.

556
00:58:51,650 --> 00:58:56,270
So in 2019, they came out with the guidance documents and they said that we really should

557
00:58:56,270 --> 00:59:00,290
be thinking about broadening our eligibility criteria for clinical trials,

558
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:03,880
and you could consider having an adaptive design.

559
00:59:03,890 --> 00:59:10,340
We'll talk about adaptive designs later in the semester that might allow altering the trial trial population if unsafe.

560
00:59:10,370 --> 00:59:15,979
So usually if you if you think about adaptive designs, the first thing you think about is like, oh,

561
00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:20,210
we changed the randomization probabilities so that more people get the better performing treatment.

562
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:26,810
But there's a lot of different kinds of adaptive designs where you could say, Let's invite everybody to be in our trial.

563
00:59:27,020 --> 00:59:34,459
And then we go through and we say, Oh, this subgroup, this group of individuals who are previously on this treatment, it's not going well for them.

564
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:40,010
So let's narrow the eligibility criteria and only recruit people who didn't have that.

565
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:44,900
So you could do something like that or you could go the opposite way to broaden your eligibility criteria.

566
00:59:46,670 --> 00:59:49,340
We want to try to make trial participation less burdensome.

567
00:59:49,340 --> 00:59:57,920
So the flexibility that increasing the hours, the giving transportation, not making them come all the time or driving forever to get there,

568
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:06,620
making sure that if they are doing that, that we're reimbursing them for what they're doing and then try to adopt practices to enhance inclusiveness.

569
01:00:06,650 --> 01:00:11,150
So working with communities, having public outreach and education.

570
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:21,430
One thing that's really been suggested by a lot of people and actually has has been taken up,

571
01:00:21,430 --> 01:00:24,670
especially during the pandemic, are what are called virtual trials.

572
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:31,000
So for most clinical trials, you would have these specific study assessment time points in which you require

573
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:36,159
individuals to come in to wherever it is to have those study assessments.

574
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:42,760
So like, you know, maybe they have to come in and get their blood pressure bred or they have to come in and get the treatment.

575
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:46,510
And then we take a lot of measurements on the individual.

576
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:51,160
Well, instead of requiring them to have that transportation and that time, we could think,

577
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:55,660
how can we be more creative in collecting that information such that it could be remote?

578
01:00:56,080 --> 01:01:06,040
Right. So virtual clinical trials would use apps on phones to collect either actively or not actively,

579
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:10,360
just getting passively getting the information from your phone.

580
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:14,680
So to get the information that we would need for the trials,

581
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:22,510
so it's not requiring that time and energy spent to get somewhere and hopefully it would be less burdensome.

582
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:29,260
So there's a fair amount of literature on virtual clinical trials.

583
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:35,259
There are specific virtual clinical trials that are testing apps, right, that are testing virtual interventions.

584
01:01:35,260 --> 01:01:42,340
But there are also virtual clinical trials that are giving other interventions, but collecting data virtually.

585
01:01:42,850 --> 01:01:48,560
But if you do this, you have to make sure that everybody has access to give that data virtually right.

586
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:55,240
So for these, you would need to give the phone to all participants or whatever.

587
01:01:55,900 --> 01:02:00,280
So some clinical trials might require like Fitbit type things.

588
01:02:00,310 --> 01:02:04,210
So you have to give those to everybody to make sure that they could give that data.

589
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:13,100
All right. So we're done with this one a little bit early, but we can have more discussion or questions or you could just leave.

590
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:21,889
But basically, there is a history of unethical research that we mostly talked about the last class, some of which includes clinical trials.

591
01:02:21,890 --> 01:02:29,000
And we talked a little bit more today about how there is underrepresentation in clinical trials when you maybe not in aggregate.

592
01:02:29,330 --> 01:02:31,520
You can dig down into specific areas.

593
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:41,780
There are many, many barriers to clinical trial participation that particularly affect underrepresented individuals.

594
01:02:41,780 --> 01:02:46,879
And so we really want to think about those in every trial in terms of the inclusion

595
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:50,630
and exclusion criteria and the population that we want to generalize to.

596
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:54,050
There are several ways to enhance diversity in the trials,

597
01:02:54,380 --> 01:03:00,220
and what we really should be thinking about right, is in those three main principles of the Belmont reports,

598
01:03:00,290 --> 01:03:07,909
it seems like we are focusing on justice and thinking about if there is not representation,

599
01:03:07,910 --> 01:03:14,760
if there's a lack of diversity, is that a violation of the Belmont principle of justice?

600
01:03:14,780 --> 01:03:18,709
Is that an injustice? And I would argue that, yes, it likely is.

601
01:03:18,710 --> 01:03:26,110
But that definition of the ideal population or the ideal participant is going to vary from trial to trial,

602
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:30,679
disease to disease, intervention to intervention. All right.

603
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:33,890
So that's all I got today. If you have any questions, I'll stick around.

604
01:03:34,430 --> 01:03:39,079
Otherwise, use this time to start looking into the projects or doing your homework.

605
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:40,520
One and I will see you next week.
