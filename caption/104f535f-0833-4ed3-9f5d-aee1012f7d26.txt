1
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Okay. Good morning, everyone. that's get started so today. we're gonna have a smaller classroom due to some students have a conflict schedule.

2
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:19,000
So before we start. so tomorrow morning if you could please come here on pie.

3
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Because that's the last very last lecture of the course and there will be a course. evaluation.

4
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I was told to give you guys about 15 min in cost tomorrow to go over the cost evaluation.

5
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
So if you could please come here tomorrow. and beyond time that will be very helpful.

6
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Thank you very much. Yesterday we talked about multiple in your regression, the lecture, and also we talk about in cost projects can be.

7
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,000
So today we're gonna finish 10 a and then we continue to the very last night travel just regression.

8
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So multiple in regression essentially, is a generalization of simple in your regression.

9
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Well by allowing one on one predictor variable basically acts in the model I'm, by allowing one that one acting the model.

10
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:14,000
There are a lot of complications with some of compounding interaction on your back modification models.

11
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,000
The election so many things right? So this course focus on the interpretation of the analysis.

12
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:32,000
So basically, I focus on you know, How do we interpret all the analysis resolves or the P value of the folks from the model as well as you know how to compare different models?

13
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Right so specifically how to compute the slope or the P value is not a major interest, because you know, the software will automatically give them to you.

14
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,000
So it's really more important to know one and to use which model?

15
00:09:47,000 --> 00:10:06,000
And why so? Any question regarding the multiple in your regression lecture before it move on to a project and a

16
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Okay, So as you'll see tennis is not required for submission.

17
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:24,000
So you could summarize and then after the day. Please tell me the post lecture quiz. you haven't done so, and those can be, and all sorts of quiz are deal tomorrow morning, and those are the final assignments

18
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:31,000
for this course lecture 11 we'll just regret it doesn't have any assignment, although we'll go over the access again.

19
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:43,000
So. if there's no more question that star was 10 then

20
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:51,000
So 10, as you see, is asking off to go over a data on how and development study.

21
00:10:51,000 --> 00:11:00,000
We're the data is on the website how the Baby's data set, and then from that data set.

22
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And then, we can answer questions from the textbook. but for those of you who don't have the tax but ahead I'm posting the Pdf.

23
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You know, basically the questions at the back of this exercise.

24
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
So it's all here, so you don't need to go to the textbook.

25
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:25,000
All the questions are here. So essentially you look at the data side, look at the questions and answer them.

26
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
There are a total of 5 questions because it's not a very long exercise.

27
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I would think maybe 20 min, and then work on them.

28
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I don't know let's do it again 25 min because in the morning people are not so long.

29
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Probably W Wikipedia, so let's do another 25 min we have fewer people so each room have fewer people. but nevertheless feel free to to switch rooms, and then i'll see you

30
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:14,000
in 25 min. Any questions before I send out to pretty hard rooms

31
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Okay, if there's no question i'll see you in 25 min, thank you.

32
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Hello, welcome back. Hope you had enough time to work through this and now let's go over to Piano.

33
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:49,000
So first let's look at less than 8.2 yeah so we have a data set on birthday the babies.

34
00:38:49,000 --> 00:39:05,000
And then there's another variable We call the parity which basically says whether the child is the first part or not, why is one means there has a civil angle 0 means is the first one, and then this is a simple linear regression

35
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,000
model. Is it from a birthway to the parity? I?

36
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Then we got all these numbers, and then number one is our rider equation that we regret online.

37
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:27,000
So anyone most will go ahead

38
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Yeah, I I can. thanks for that. for the birth rate, if we call equals to 102 many points.

39
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:45,000
My name is 1.93 which blind by the parity awesome.

40
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Thank you. got me off absolutely right. Let me write it here.

41
00:39:50,000 --> 00:40:01,000
So the the birthday equals 1 20 oh, 7 minus 1.9, 3 times parity.

42
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,000
If you write a birthday equals parity, you have to add a error right?

43
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:22,000
If you don't want an arrow this is basically the expected birthway, or you know, for short, you'd really need to participate right just by the E birthway, that's what I expected birthday

44
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Alright in terms of the slope in these contacts and top of the predictive birthday, the first board and others.

45
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:39,000
So anyone else had this alright Walk all you can. You can go ahead, and you know, if you want to do it here.

46
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Yeah, I can try this as they look it's negative.

47
00:40:45,000 --> 00:41:00,000
So I think it is predicted 1.9, 3 decrease, in needs increase in the childhood from the same mother, because I was not sure what what parity is.

48
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Maybe the people pediatric help me with that.

49
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:13,000
But I think it it like the number of children right yeah it's not for you.

50
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Thank you. It's actually written here so typically the the slope You're right.

51
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Means that per unit increase right, the expected value of Y with decrease.

52
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:29,000
But here the parity is actually binary. It basically is a binary variable saying whether it's the first board or not 0.

53
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,000
He says, the first 1 one is not so in this particular setting.

54
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:38,000
This already has a specific meeting is actually the predicted difference. Right?

55
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:46,000
You, you birth weight in the first 4 population of person, the not the first born population.

56
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:55,000
So let me find out here. Well, you signally a slow 0 point.

57
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:05,000
1.9, 3 Hi needs that.

58
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Let me see, is the

59
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Yeah. So yeah, this seems like a parody is is a binary, right?

60
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:32,000
So is that the first born how Yes, so he's negative means.

61
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:38,000
It's 0 is higher than one right is 1.9 3 I forgot was the unit.

62
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:55,000
It's probably out analysis have a year bye the average second or later or so.

63
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:05,000
That's a that's about it any questions so far Oh, the question is not finishing right?

64
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:13,000
You also ask how to calculate the birthday, first born and hundreds right?

65
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
So if you think about right. But for the birth first, or in the past it was 0.

66
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:23,000
The expected birthday will soon give you the intersect, for others will be either set past. the slope.

67
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Here is minus right. so it's packed birth wait no you can write it given first.

68
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:48,000
How will be 101 o 7 and if i'm using you know, don't know page I have a power on clause that's you know better with me for short the birthday you man second for later.

69
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:55,000
equals 100. Oh, 7 minus 1.9 3 I don't have a populator.

70
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Well, yeah, yeah. it's w 1 1 8.1, 4 at 4. Yeah.

71
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:08,000
All this sorry

72
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Oh, you should get his number. And the third question, hey? There are statistical, significant renewal between average birth rate and parity.

73
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Anyone

74
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,000
I can answer this. I said. no because if we look at the P.

75
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Value it's greater than point 0 5 awesome thank you and then we you don't have to.

76
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:50,000
We also thought that the T. value was between negative 2 and 2. also indicate that it was not significant.

77
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Thank you. Thank you both. Yeah, You both are very correct, so that the you know the the key here is to figure out which people look at.

78
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:06,000
So you should always look at a pivot or the piece that they mean up consistently for the for the flow right.

79
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,000
The slope equals 0 means they're not associated slope equals one.

80
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
You know, last 0 means they're associated so the pivot for the slope.

81
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:20,000
This is the one to look at. The P value for the intersection is not because you know whether the internal staff is 0 now is not of interest here.

82
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:27,000
So yeah, I mean, the rule of comedy is that if the P statistics are that, too, you know they came out of the last time. Point.

83
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Oh, 5. The more more I would say more rigorously.

84
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,000
We should look at a P value because the tool is the rule of thumb, right?

85
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:42,000
I mean actually, the color vary a little bit, I think, based on the sample size, you know, when the sample size, infinity is 1.9, 6, and the sun thread.

86
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,000
We do sometimes can be started over to 2 is just a little of time.

87
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
So the pivot will be more accurate.

88
00:45:48,000 --> 00:46:01,000
But but in general those 2 will be consistent. So the answer here is, Steve P.

89
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Equals 0 point 1 one by means the slow yes, not secondhand

90
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Significant different from 0. right? So which means no

91
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:50,000
So that this they call every time association between birth, weight.

92
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:58,000
And the parity. so that's the conclusion right so it doesn't mean there's no associate that's being, you know.

93
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:06,000
You sound likely? You know we just cannot move. There is association right? It could be.

94
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:11,000
There's a lot of times we don't have power to figure out.

95
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:20,000
So exactly, although we know this a difference between a group of children by first, more and later more.

96
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Well, the difference is not big enough for us to detect if you look at the sample size, right it's pretty big.

97
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:45,000
It's like in thousands. So we should have this empower here which such decent power we still couldn't find it. Its problem is, the fact is too small to the so give me after all, is 1.9 ounce

98
00:47:45,000 --> 00:48:01,000
i'll have it that's a very small amount right any questions so far 8.2

99
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Okay, Now, 8 number 2 is 8.3. So now we, you know, 8.2 is really we are reviewing single linear regression right?

100
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,000
8.3. Now we are looking at not going in your regression.

101
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:24,000
In this case we add more variable, for example, smoke to to the model.

102
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Right now we have small hand Parity? fault. No, we actually create a moral Darwin in the model.

103
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Including just hate the transportation which is a pregnancy. in days a mother's age in years mother's high in inches, and the mother's pregnancy weight in power right so these are the data Oh, we have

104
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:58,000
1,236 individual and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

105
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:06,000
We have 7 variable, but one of them is the birth rate of debate of the human is the one, and there are 6 ads. Right?

106
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,000
So this is a volatile regression model with 6 different hacks.

107
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:18,000
This is the model failing. I see you got interrupt and the 6 different slope there's a pretty standard output.

108
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,000
So usually, I mean yesterday they still didn't ask me during the office.

109
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,000
All right. How do I decide whether to include the interaction or not?

110
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,000
The truth is, you rarely include the interaction because they think about random model.

111
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:36,000
For example, here it's not a very big model you have 6 variable give you consider all the pairwise interaction.

112
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:43,000
There are 15 alright actually I didn't talk about they don't actually tertiary interaction.

113
00:49:43,000 --> 00:50:00,000
No, it's just the number. of interaction. is is too too many. right? so usually, to keep things simple, we do not including directing the model unless there is a strong reason. we believe there could be the impact on going down so usually we do

114
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:06,000
not include interaction unless there is a special reason. Alright,

115
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,000
So these are the estimates that Arab he statistic.

116
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Right. So again, right on the equation of the regression line that includes all the variables.

117
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:31,000
I know it's a very long equation. but it's gonna be. you know, the expected birthday is minus 80 point, 4, one plus 0 point 4 4 times just station minus you know 0 point 3 3 times parity and So on so

118
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:37,000
forth. You can have a very long equation. Let me just write it for sure.

119
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:45,000
In this case they expect it

120
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Because no, I'll, have it definitely intersect off 0 point 4 call arms just station minus 3.3 3 times parity plus all the way.

121
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Finally it's minus 8.4 on smoking smoking

122
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Okay, so that's the the question is for riley you have any questions?

123
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Please let me know it's a borrowing equation that i'll move on right in terms of the slope of the jestation and age in this compact let's come back to the equation Anyone wants to

124
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:37,000
in terms of you know. Let me write down the age because pages by the 0 point 0 one times 8

125
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:43,000
I've done pause honestly, Dr. Jen can I try it again.

126
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Yeah. So I got that for the station. the model predicts.

127
00:51:52,000 --> 00:52:01,000
And this will is positive at 0 point 4, 44 increase in birth rate for each.

128
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Just now this station, like part period, right as 0 point, 44 increase

129
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Are gestational distribution period. Yeah, we have to see how the station was measuring days.

130
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Right, they increase in for days. Yeah. in each day, right off alright.

131
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Thank you. Are you all done

132
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Sorry. Are you done with this? This you know. invitation of the gestation slope.

133
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Yeah, thank you. Thank you. You know the the the reason I I I I remind you, is because actually, you're missing one quite important.

134
00:52:53,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Sometimes. basically, you always have to say unfolding well, very both.

135
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Yes, yes. so this is the the difference between the interpretation of the sloping module in regression.

136
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:15,000
And you know But you mean if this controlling is, all of the samples are all.

137
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:19,000
The variables are is stable. not do not change right?

138
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Takes them off the variables, controlling or fixing.

139
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Or he teamed the problem, you know, no matter how you say it mean the same thing.

140
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,000
But essentially, yeah, we only look at while I remember about the time.

141
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:56,000
If they remain constant. constant. for H. Anyone wants to try

142
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Yeah, I would just go ahead do it right so 0 point 0 1.

143
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:09,000
It's almost al right decrease

144
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Birth wait. So ages measured by yeah right so her year the increase and mother's age.

145
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:35,000
And now you can say, assuming all other variables are the same.

146
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Oh, not the same, you know. Stay the same

147
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:46,000
So there are many way you can. You can say this thing right?

148
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Are you essentially that's the that's the way they interpret that any question

149
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Okay, you know it's also you can think about There there are 2 potentially different subjects, right?

150
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Different childbirth and their mother, or almost the same, exactly different by one variable.

151
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:17,000
And that would be the difference in the expected birthday, the same interpretation.

152
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:21,000
How many different, you know. way of saying it? Probably the same same idea.

153
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Alright number 3. the call refugee or parity is different than in the linear model.

154
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Well, let's see in the linear model remember the parallel has a minus 1.9 3.

155
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Now the parity has a minus 3.3 3 so it's different scanning smaller.

156
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:48,000
So why do we think there is a change

157
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Can I try it? Yeah. I think because there are some other variable is related to this one.

158
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:06,000
The parody one, so it might decrease. little Tao prediction.

159
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:20,000
So other variables right? How about you have to pack i'll go slow of parity, right?

160
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,000
So that that's definitely true, right because we include in other words right?

161
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:38,000
But but you know more specifically when we include other variables, and some of them, or maybe all of them, or one of them could be confounded right if they are compelled, or they might change the impact of this variable right because the definition

162
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:45,000
of the slope are different in the 2 models therefore there's no reason that they have to be the same right.

163
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,000
For example, if you think about the definition of the slope here.

164
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Yes, you know the changing parity. Oh, you don't care about all the variable he's.

165
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Actually the This is the slope here is that when you change the parity, other variable sort of like a randomly drawn, variable, randomly drawing subject right?

166
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Like you place, if you're you're thinking about so how do I put it? this slope essentially you're comparing the 2 group, right?

167
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Parity is 0 and parity one. But now each group have different value of different other variable.

168
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:28,000
You are, you essentially average, view them all right, but because parity could be correlated with other variables, which means in the parity equals 0 group.

169
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
The distribution of other variable may not be the same.

170
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Very likely not the same as the parity equals one rule so you're not really come.

171
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:41,000
You're not really comparing apple to apple due to this confounding and correlation.

172
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:50,000
But here the slope of herity, when you are really compared to subjects the only day for about Paradise, all all of them are with the same.

173
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,000
They have different interpretation. Therefore, of course, the value will be different.

174
00:57:53,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Right. Similarly, the the the intercept change hugely because you see here is 1 point is on the here's minus 80.

175
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Why does the intercept change usually because they're in the data different right here.

176
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:22,000
You're thinking exactly birth weight of someone being the first one. of course one party makes sense, right, but here you are saying the expected birth rate of someone has just take gestation of 0 parity of 0 age, of 0.

177
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Height of 0 weight of 0 smoke of 0 that mother doesn't exist.

178
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Therefore you got a negative value, which doesn't make any sense right so all these violet change because they are invitation change.

179
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Black would say, There are many reasons, Right? the interpretation of the flow.

180
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Well parody change from simply the right to modeling the regression.

181
00:58:53,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Right there my the i'm founding I'm fine.

182
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Father, you know variables in the model right so These are the reason that you know we're included you've arguing them all the previous. the slope of the previous vital.

183
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:21,000
My team, because the new variable will be parted with them where it'll take away some of their in class.

184
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Right. So things like those are you in this case it's actually not taking away exactly, making any 5 even stronger.

185
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:41,000
But any thing can happen. We include new variable in the model

186
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Okay, any other questions regarding this

187
00:59:51,000 --> 01:00:02,000
If we remove the age variable from the table, do you think we could increase our or adjusted squared?

188
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Are okay? Good question. So when now you add a variable in the model, you'll always increase the r square even just by a tiny bit, which means, whenever you remove a variable from the model, you'll always decrease our square even just

189
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:30,000
a by a tiny bit. So in this particular case, the age has a very little slope has a very high p value, which means he's not playing a big role here, so I would expect, if you remove page from the model the hardware

190
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:38,000
will just drop it highly there by still kind of drop a time in there

191
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Welcome, or if you remove some other variable, for example, with a large slope like smoking, with a very significant P. value, we remove this variable.

192
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:57,000
The ours part probably would drop a lot more. Well, you have to try to know no one every day how much?

193
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Okay, this this kind of key value and slope are very.

194
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:12,000
How are you? I will say, very, very odd heart will predict. Okay.

195
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:25,000
So we'll remove a variable in the model all the slope and all the pivot from other variable will change sometimes in a surprising way, because they're a complicated correlation between these variables Okay, let me show

196
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:31,000
you a for example, since we are here. let me show you an example.

197
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Right. let's just take the multiple regression exercise

198
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Hold on a second. i'll show you example before you take a break

199
01:01:55,000 --> 01:02:00,000
So these are the multiple in your regression model right yeah and the last.

200
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Let's Let's ignore all the interaction let's take them out doesn't matter let's just look at this right right now.

201
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:18,000
X. one is significant. x 2 is in significant bye so let's make x 2.

202
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Let's change x 2 let's make x 2 equals x one lost them random value.

203
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Very small random body. let's see if that works

204
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Okay, So this X 2 is basically a version as well as a very tiny, random variable.

205
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:56,000
So in this case you x 2 almost equals x one but it's not quite the same bye, because they thought run them out to it.

206
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:59,000
So it's like a copy of x one but not as a legal.

207
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:11,000
You would imagine X Y. X. 2 are highly. coral But when we include both X one actually in the model. You see that it none of them is significant.

208
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:22,000
And you have very why on the phone so what's going on here is because, remember, X, one was originally significant for one.

209
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Well, now, adding that to adding a near identical copy of X one into the model, actually both become usingly different.

210
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:34,000
The reason is because the interpretation of the P. value now is different.

211
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:43,000
So in the retain of this P. by means whether act 2 is useful, or for predicting why given X.

212
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:49,000
One. it's already in the model No see both I think x 2 can predict why.

213
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Very well, but give a one the otherwise is is useless, because that would provide duplicating information

214
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:15,000
So this is a very funny case, which means that if you add a variable in your model, which could make the previous significant variable no longer in the beginning, which one would also make the previous using the variable become significant, so all of these are

215
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:23,000
unpredictable we'll sometimes you have to dig but because this correlation is complicated, you cannot really fully predict the behavior. when you add a remove a variable from the model.

216
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:33,000
So that's why model selectory is really hard because there are, you know, comedy, Horio number of possible models, and they all give you different things.

217
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Probably really pick the one just looking at the key value is not sufficient right?

218
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:52,000
So that's why you know there are seemingly you know heuristic approach, trying to select model for example, they add a variable to the model one by one, or they remove them all the remove variable problem all the one by one but look

219
01:04:52,000 --> 01:05:06,000
at P. value those works, but they often give you different answers, because, you know, one of the variable is significant or not, Depend on what other variable also in the model at that time this is really complicated stuff.

220
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Okay, So It's unpredictable so what I'm saying is that if you remove age from the model, whether other slow put or Peabody will change, or not I don't know you only know where to try every

221
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:33,000
time is different. Okay? Any questions?

222
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Okay, Let's take a 10 min break and and then finish this exercise.

223
01:05:37,000 --> 01:06:07,000
I'm gonna move on in your lecture thank you

224
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:16,000
Okay, let's continue So during the break I just send out 2 calls announcement.

225
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:21,000
So you might chat, or you might got email so essentially I

226
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:35,000
I still don't ask also i'm mentioning past I'm sharing the answer. Keys to all the in cost projects. Of this course, as a zip package. so you can go back find out you know the answer case I

227
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:38,000
I used also the spreadsheet as the exercises.

228
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:44,000
For your own learning benefit. So want to mention that.

229
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
You know many of the questions we talk about in class, right?

230
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:51,000
They they don't really have a single answer I mean the answer could be subjected.

231
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:55,000
So that in mind so don't take I haven't mentioned many times in statistics.

232
01:16:55,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Right. don't take my end, answer is the only answer I think it's a reasoning or evidential argument make more since then the final conclusion, because people might have different opinion on different topics, and the other one I

233
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:17,000
shared is the sample exam problem you know the earlier introduction to pile statistic course on top in the school public house.

234
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:27,000
So it's That was a one semester force is 4 credit with one power of lab sections. It's like a 5 h a week.

235
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Course, with the loss of homework and 3 mid term examine.

236
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:35,000
You know a 2 meet term and find what one final? Exactly.

237
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:40,000
So that course has largely overlapping content with this one, like 80% overlapping.

238
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:49,000
But the focus was somewhat different there, because, you know, we have more time to dig into the mathematical details. In this course the focus was more on the interpretation.

239
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:53,000
I studies that. so the focus was somewhat different. So when you look at that exam, keep done in mind.

240
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:59,000
There may be some question I did the fully cover here. in that right so don't worry too much.

241
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:06,000
If you couldn't solve other questions also provide isp there for interest, so none of this is required at all.

242
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:11,000
It just puts. those of you who want to, you know, do some more review and learning beyond this course.

243
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:17,000
I hope those will help, and always give you a question after the course you know, always feel free to email me.

244
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:24,000
I'll try to advance to to provide you know information, you know, for you as much as I can.

245
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:30,000
If you want to ask about, you know, consolidate others to do questions about other parts, you might take also feel free to email me.

246
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:47,000
To be in contact with you. So any question regarding the fourth overview

247
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Okay. again. I talk about earlier today. Some of you are not here.

248
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:58,000
If you could. please come join the lecture tomorrow. and tomorrow I'm going through our

249
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:05,000
Of course you violation that was required by the program, and the more people answer the evaluation, the better.

250
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:11,000
So looking forward to see all of you tomorrow if possible and Now let's move on to Number 3.

251
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:20,000
Answer Question 8.13 from open introduction is the textbook right here.

252
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:29,000
So this is about diagnostics. So So these are the diagnostic pause of all the multiplying the pressure model with F, right?

253
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:36,000
So you have to look at. All this part are sort of a scalar part, but you need to look at X and y, and understand what they are right.

254
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:48,000
So essentially they are the the residual. Remember, the residual is the Observe the value of subtractability value by against some other thing.

255
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
For example, this is the residual against Why have we did?

256
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Why and remaining our residual against each of the acts.

257
01:19:54,000 --> 01:20:01,000
Remember what hardware cost right from this plus you can see whether the model of this file or not.

258
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:07,000
But the question is asking you So determine the model assumption or map using the possible law.

259
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:11,000
Remember the model assumption. There are 3 right

260
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:18,000
The normal the Hitler ground for the residual so It's a little hard to see that, but you can sum up guests right.

261
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:22,000
Think about what the normal should look like, and then call and variance.

262
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:25,000
And then the linear assumption, right, How do you want to?

263
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:55,000
Fine answering this one alright. What happened?

264
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:22,000
So let's ask this one Do You think the residual normally distributed at Center 0

265
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:34,000
So we're for absolutely from group 2 so we thought like like the gestation was pretty well normally distributed.

266
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:40,000
And then also the height of the mother. Okay. interesting.

267
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:51,000
So. So when when you want to see whether a variable is normal, if you do it or not, the best way to do is make a histogram of that variable right?

268
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:56,000
Well, unfortunately, here we are now making. histograms are not variable, so really hard to see.

269
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:07,000
From this plot. So really, what you can do is think about if you'll pile up all the data along one access versus the other. when you'll say the less of justation is normally distributed you're saying look at this the

270
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:16,000
variable of lance. justation. Is that right?

271
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:22,000
Okay, Yeah, I agree with you. If you look at the less of just patient they may be normal, distributed the center here with some. you know.

272
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:35,000
Things on the on the side. Well, I have a i'm I'm. hearing that in the sense that the the soundtrack for the being a regression model, they assume the residual are normally distributed with sentence

273
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:40,000
0. They actually never assume that acts. The variables are normal, distributed at all.

274
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:44,000
For example. Here the parody is actually definitely not normal it's binary.

275
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:49,000
It doesn't matter right so when they're normal it's fine, but they're when they're not normal.

276
01:22:49,000 --> 01:23:02,000
It's fine, too. We don't really care so that's how the question is asked about asking about the residual whether the residual is

277
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:12,000
What's your you know, really with helpful to look at is look at the Y access all the plots by the way. access you think about, you know.

278
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
Look at. Think about the y-axis all the point. Okay.

279
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:24,000
It would be much better if we have a peaceful graph for the reason we just do the have that here. but you'll see that the points sort of a concentrated wrong 0 value on the Y-axis I'm done

280
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:28,000
as they call away from the 0 value. There are a few of your points right?

281
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:40,000
You can imagine. If you make a instagram on a hit residue, It's probably normal distributed center or 0 is probably rather thanometric right, and there's no value.

282
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:46,000
There doesn't seem to be all the line right because the highest of all 40 40 something right, and that's it.

283
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:50,000
There's no doesn't seem to be all around the resume either.

284
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:54,000
So it's rather symmetric around 0 r or 0.

285
01:23:54,000 --> 01:24:02,000
No, you know, green autoider. so I will say they they are rather normal.

286
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Any question.

287
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:23,000
So? So the second assumption in memory is that common variance which means the residual have a call from various, regardless of the fitty value or any of the acts right?

288
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:31,000
Do you think that assumption is reasonable? Exactly. you can think about the cost of errors regarding the fitted value?

289
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:45,000
That's the figure you know of most interest right do you see a call to variance or not

290
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:54,000
So basically, do you think the the spread of the residual distribution vary depend on the feedback or not?

291
01:24:54,000 --> 01:25:01,000
I don't think it varies a lot yeah so I agree with you.

292
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:08,000
In the middle, maybe a little big variance, and the 2 sides, maybe a little smaller and skewed a little bit.

293
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:11,000
There. You know the points up here. The points are down here.

294
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:20,000
Oh, there are so few points right it's hard to see a trend so overall I see it's like roughly constant variance across the range of PHD. values.

295
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:24,000
So that's what I see here, so you you might think about this.

296
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:29,000
There are 2. if we remove 2 points here, 3 points here, and look better.

297
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:34,000
But remember there are 1,000 points in this block right having 5 doesn't follow the time perfectly.

298
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:56,000
It's not something I I really worry about any questions

299
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:59,000
Okay, the final assumption is the lead linearity assumption.

300
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:08,000
Basically why is linear in all the acts right Oh, yeah which basically shows that the residual shouldn't have any nonlinear pattern.

301
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:19,000
Yeah, i'm from his pop you know it's hard to see if from this binary variable, because you know, you just don't see any pattern where you have 2 stripes right, but you may still see if the

302
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:28,000
2 straps are hasty. metric or wrong I mean and now we don't see a huge ace as symmetry, so that's probably fine or other parts you'll see more and I don't really see a

303
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:41,000
strong nonlinear pattern. again, there seem to be a slide trend downwards, a negative trend in the residual path here and here right after you.

304
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:45,000
This a little bit that's again, because a few outliers are here.

305
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:50,000
I'm here you remove them I don't see any pattern at all.

306
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:55,000
I'm 2 or 3 outliers probably wouldn't make a big difference.

307
01:26:55,000 --> 01:27:00,000
When you have, like a a 1,000 meter phones.

308
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:05,000
So. So again, I think the the linear assumption is roughly fine again.

309
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:19,000
All this all this clause. Only tell you when something goes wrong right? It doesn't guarantee nothing over, so it could be something go wrong with the for the part of the show by the place, or something goes wrong for sure, something is going

310
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:28,000
on it's a one way for the chat I will tell you so it's a necessary but not sufficient condition to guarantee the model feelings.

311
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:33,000
Good.

312
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:37,000
So the answer, you know, to me is like roughly I don't see any problem.

313
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:43,000
I don't see a big problem any question regarding the pause here.

314
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:51,000
Yeah, real quick growth. So are are we comparing the plot for, say, the link of gestation versus the fitted plot?

315
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:56,000
These are just the you know basically we're fine we're trying to see.

316
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:01,000
We are using residual to to find problems right. A residual by itself is not very important.

317
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:10,000
You can see the piece of room now. we are planning residual against everything we could like y hat and every single ad, and trying to see if there's anything weird home.

318
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:17,000
Now that's all we can do because the impressive we should. We would like to part the residual against everything house jointly.

319
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:28,000
Unfortunately, we just cannot. Each time we can only pop 2 variable That's why we partly 0 gets everything else. But we're not really comparing paths across this off.

320
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:35,000
We're trying to identify if any of this look weird okay, and we don't think the height of the mother looks weird.

321
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:50,000
The high. the mother. Yeah, I I don't really think it looks weird by weird, I mean there there's a little you will say in the middle of the various a little high on the edge of various little low right but it's not

322
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:53,000
I would say it's not crazy you know it's this sort of a steel.

323
01:28:53,000 --> 01:29:00,000
Okay, bye, by really weird thing i'm saying those look like you know, things like drawing past yesterday.

324
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:04,000
Things look like a you know a car .

325
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:09,000
Things look like a fine right? so basically crazy shapes out there, right?

326
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:15,000
But this one. Yeah, this one looks this way because of the discrete values of the height.

327
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:20,000
Yeah, exactly. this is because the highest this brings just like you know, parity is even weird, Right?

328
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:26,000
But because it's binary Yeah, because the value but we never require the x to be normal to begin with.

329
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:31,000
So those are, I mean, I think the the bigger look as normal as they could be given high.

330
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:44,000
The mother is. Yes, this correct? Yeah, welcome. Really, I think that the things to watch for is the is like different, you know.

331
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:49,000
Basically the distribution of the residual. if they change when you change the variable on the x-axis.

332
01:29:49,000 --> 01:30:02,000
Then that's something you should watch for right so what you would expect that residual half of normal center, 0 symmetric, constant distribution, and that distribution doesn't change regarding with other variable because the residual

333
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:11,000
is the error of the is the accumulate of the random error, and the random error was random for the unit. They're supposed just to be a random error, unpredictable.

334
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:21,000
Random arrow right? If the result will become predictable then, that's something we're going on. Why, not there is 0 is unpredictable, right?

335
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:44,000
If I tell you any of the acts I wouldn't know whether the residual is positive or so forth right because it's go up and down with all him any predictable pattern anything else

336
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:53,000
Okay, that's now move on to 4 on the 5.

337
01:30:53,000 --> 01:31:06,000
They both require us to use the excel spreadsheet, a fitting in your question, and the determinant, if less adaptation is a compounder where you fact modifier and for association with paradise

338
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:19,000
with right. so how do we do it? let me see

339
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:29,000
So what we do is that we need to compare the simple in your regression with a module in your regression with 2 variable, you know.

340
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:32,000
We already have this thing pulling your retina with parity and birthday.

341
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:46,000
Now we just include the third one. right? So we do with that. We can dial this multiple in regression

342
01:31:46,000 --> 01:32:01,000
And then download the data. The baby data

343
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:07,000
We want to fit the multiple integrator model with par parity.

344
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:16,000
And the birthway. and then, with another variable and you know questions asking whether gestation So let's just go the 3 right?

345
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:20,000
Yeah, this 3 here go to the multiple in your aggression.

346
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:26,000
We we can put them here. Well, remember x one let's think about X.

347
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:33,000
One should be parity X. 2 should be just station. Y should be birthday, so we have to them one by one.

348
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:48,000
I mean birth weight within the Y and with the jestation as act 2, because that's a potential confounder.

349
01:32:48,000 --> 01:33:04,000
And the parody, Am I doing it right? Let me go back to the question, asking whether jestation is a component, or you talk modifier or the association of Parity with birthday.

350
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:15,000
So we should put a parity there

351
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:22,000
Now we see I mean we are the see this right? when just station is in the model.

352
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:27,000
Right. Are you packed parity become actually even stronger?

353
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:30,000
Remember periods was minus 1 point. Something now is minus 3 5.

354
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:41,000
We have seen this, right? So whenever you have something in the model yeah. And then that changed the change.

355
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:45,000
The slope of another variable you can call the Confounder.

356
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:48,000
But this is not a typical means of confound number.

357
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:52,000
Right in front of me usually means when you have a third variable in the model, the previous variable.

358
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:56,000
There you pack, reduced, or even become 0, or even flip.

359
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:59,000
The sign now is that you have a new variable in the previous Microsoft.

360
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:08,000
Stronger. It is a confound of it's not a sort of a usual way of compounding, or actually, this can only make you stop if I become even stronger.

361
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:14,000
It's hard to find example. Why, this could be the case well probably exists right.

362
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:23,000
So it is a compounder, because it it it the module is, you know it's actually you know when when you put this in the model of the impact for the other one change.

363
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:27,000
But I I have yet to figure out the invitation for this.

364
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:36,000
Anyone has any idea of what why this might happen. I think something has to happen when they have a negative correlation, right?

365
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:44,000
Well, 3 variable. Both have positive correlation. When you include both in the model, the first one usually reduce the impact, because they both positive right and the 3 variable here.

366
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:49,000
One of them should have a negative correlation Right? which is the case here?

367
01:34:49,000 --> 01:35:05,000
Because it has a negative sort of a flow here right Originally this Harvard has the negative code collision with the was, why and this one has a positive I don't know between this X one X 2 where the parity and

368
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:12,000
gestation is negative, positive It may also be negative we have 90 cards and things might happen. calling in Georgia.

369
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:23,000
Okay, I I don't know exactly what's going on So the answer is that yes, transportation seem to be a confounded for parity, because it changed the impact of parity.

370
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:30,000
And the second question, Is it a you? fact, modifier.

371
01:35:30,000 --> 01:36:00,000
So anyone will answer this question by looking at it. is just station x 2 in fact, modifier for parity

372
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:04,000
Would we? i'm on a guess here would we say no because the P.

373
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:11,000
Value for the interaction is not significant. absolutely you're very very correct? Thank you so much.

374
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:15,000
Yeah, I mean, these are the place where you should look at this key value. this pivotal means.

375
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:24,000
One of the interaction term is 0. Now, if the inhabitant term is not 0, which means x, 2 will modify the impact.

376
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:29,000
Oh, excellent! which means we call it, if I modify you, think significant.

377
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:36,000
And this slope is not so hard right so I mean this time. probably is not real. Well, actually, it's not impact modified.

378
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:40,000
So that's the same with actu in the model the fact of X.

379
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:48,000
One change, but that's not the fact modify if I can modify me. 5 or x one actually change depend on different value of X.

380
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:55,000
That that means the interaction. Oh, we should really look at this by any question.

381
01:36:55,000 --> 01:37:06,000
So the answer here is that Yes. Oh, confounder! no, not a

382
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:26,000
You 5 modifier, Professor John Cr. could you repeat that again for the definition of a in fact, more i'm still confused about like what exactly the differences between that we can go back to the lecture.

383
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:31,000
But on the left hand side what we have X. 2 in the model.

384
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:35,000
Everything single subject in the model will have a difference in interest.

385
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:40,000
Time depend on the actual level on the rhythm.

386
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:45,000
5, we'll have between the model not only every single subject in the in the model, have a different interest.

387
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:48,000
That they also have different slope when they have a difference.

388
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:54,000
Slope for X. One that means is, in fact, modifier, because the slope chain the slope is the effect for x one.

389
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:57,000
If the slope change depend on x 2, which means x.

390
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:04,000
2 will change the effect of x one when we talk about variable changing the pack of another variable that's interaction.

391
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:08,000
Or you can call that you pack a module that's the same thing right?

392
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:13,000
So essentially want to see whether the interaction term is real or not that's one we spoke about P.

393
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:22,000
By the pivotal, says this is probably not. This is probably not non 0.

394
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:30,000
And when this is 0, then we pitch means the slope doesn't change, which means it's not if I modify so the effect modifier really means interaction really means the slope.

395
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:35,000
Depend on another variable, not the interrupt, not the intersection.

396
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:48,000
Here. the Interstate depend on an environment for the fact that, having had pulling the model should change the slope X one compared to the simple in your regression model that's different from you. back modifier.

397
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:54,000
You fact, the monetary was saying, the slope for every single individual depending on another, the value of another variable.

398
01:38:54,000 --> 01:39:03,000
Now let's hope for the hope for everybody okay, so every single individual has a different slope. that's called the pack of monopoly.

399
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:19,000
You know this is the reason that when I say interaction model are not one to use, and that's really necessary because it's kind of tricky to interpret interactions

400
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:29,000
It's kind of tricky for example interaction means if we say h is an interaction of something else.

401
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:36,000
For example, we have a educational intervention which supposed to make the case better by turns all out.

402
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:45,000
That different kind of case, and if it differently from this intervention that's the interaction, right?

403
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:49,000
Maybe older kids do not really benefit as much as younger kids.

404
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:56,000
Oh, you know case of maybe you know, boys, panic and more than girls when you have this kind of interaction between 2 variables.

405
01:39:56,000 --> 01:40:01,000
That's probably your time on it right it is possible to interpret.

406
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:11,000
That's why, sometimes, when you really see an interaction going out, usually including the model, but generally it is harder to interpret that a typical slope we talk about right.

407
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:26,000
That's why everything else equal If you don't feel strong. you fact, interacting impact don't include in your model, because that makes the model unnecessarily complicated.

408
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:30,000
Thank you you're welcome. Yeah, I hope this helps it is really something.

409
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:34,000
It's hard to so gather wrong with in the beginning.

410
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:41,000
But once, you, you know, played a few times right with real marble, real data, and trying to interpret the interaction.

411
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:50,000
After a few times they become used to it but in the beginning it's It's not natural, you know the calls have interaction.

412
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:57,000
Any other questions.

413
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:09,000
Okay, we have a final question. Right last has to use express cell spreadsheet of data to fit a linear regression, determine which, if any of other variable is that you pack the modifier for association of lens of

414
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:14,000
gestation with birthway. So how do we do this?

415
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:24,000
We should. First, you know we got we can we can. We can put the gestation at X one, and then put all of our ads too, and then look at interaction.

416
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:29,000
But because interaction is the metric this is symmetric it doesn't really matter.

417
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:34,000
We can just keep that station here. So now parity is not a the fact.

418
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:40,000
Modifier. So before we are saying, gestation is not a fact modifier for parity.

419
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:47,000
What is, how interacting, since the metric this is also not set saying parody is not a defect, modifier or just patient.

420
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:55,000
Now we can, you know, put in different variables. for example, we can grab like like age, right?

421
01:41:55,000 --> 01:42:05,000
We just replace age to parody. that is, the age seem to be an impact modifier for gestation, Right?

422
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:12,000
Because this is significant, although you 5 is pretty small by this significant.

423
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:19,000
Remember this data size pretty big, right? so it has very high power you're going to pick up very tiny effects.

424
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:25,000
And then you can do other things like I forgot what other variable we are.

425
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:34,000
Interest. For example, height, Why, you can't Put high here the height is definitely not a the fact. Modifier.

426
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:38,000
Actually, what's funny is that you know if you just put high and gestation in the model.

427
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:52,000
Both are highly significant. But when you're putting interaction the python depth, taking the model all of them becoming music and everything. This is the case, I talk about, you know, this p value unpredictable.

428
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:57,000
I suspect Height and the gestation are you know there are interactions.

429
01:42:57,000 --> 01:43:04,000
Somehow it's highly correlated with one of the variable which destroy all of them.

430
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:09,000
So this kind of thing are very hard to interpret that's why don't even try it right?

431
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:12,000
I I don't know if we tell you why when you increase the interaction.

432
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:22,000
The other 2 slow. Even the slow become used significant. But interacting term is very hard, and then let's go back wait.

433
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:33,000
Putting here the way it seemed to be a effect modifier, for just as as well as age

434
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:43,000
And finally, we can do smoking. Smoking is highly secured in the fact.

435
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:53,000
Modifier contestation, which means that so testation less how's the fact on birth weight?

436
01:43:53,000 --> 01:44:01,000
But that the fact is different for small commercial non smoker So that's the interaction.

437
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:20,000
The interpretation. So our final take home message is that, you know, age, height, and weight seem to be.

438
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:41,000
You pack Moby fire alright Last station? The other one is no sorry age, weight, and the smoke

439
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:49,000
Well, Hi is not

440
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:57,000
That's you know all based on t value

441
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:06,000
The interaction time

442
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:25,000
Any question.

443
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:34,000
Okay.

444
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:47,000
I think these are very helpful exercise to understand the material talk on the lectures, and then, please remember the targeting can be which we did yesterday, and perform the post-ac request both.

445
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:52,000
I'll do it tomorrow morning, and now let's move on to the final lecture.

446
01:45:52,000 --> 01:46:00,000
I'll just regression, and we still have a lecture. and 2 exercise and a quiz, but none of them are required.

447
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:05,000
So you don't have to turn them in We'll do them together. We actually will do the quick together even tomorrow.

448
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:18,000
Oh, so you don't have the time

449
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:22,000
Okay.

450
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:30,000
Oh, remember, we go all the way right from a to sample, cast to chi-square to linear graphs in the model.

451
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:34,000
You need a version which are dealing with different kind of data.

452
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:42,000
Now we can almost analyze any kind of data except you know there's some part of the data where although you have force some of the math that we use.

453
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:53,000
They're not ideal so we've developed a bad amount of, for example, in in in linear regression, Remember, although we don't put any restriction on X X could be continuous.

454
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:57,000
Could be binary. that could be normal could be now normal.

455
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:02,000
But we require the error to be normal, right.

456
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:07,000
The residual in y could be normal efficiency, which means, why should be continuous?

457
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:13,000
If y is not continuous, then the linear graph model will be a weird.

458
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:22,000
Why you have still run like just hang weird so we're gonna develop better tools to handle those, And what logic is one of them.

459
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:33,000
They're gonna marry more they are generalizing in your model. There are some regrets, and there are cops regretted they're manufacturing model, depending on different kind of why for a different kind of related to X and

460
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:40,000
Y. We also talk about, you know. give the relationship between X and Y is, linear I can use linear regression.

461
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:45,000
But if the radio is nonlinear you should do transformation first, right?

462
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:49,000
But what if you don't wanna do transformation what the model, the nonlinear, to begin with, right?

463
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:59,000
And there are also ways which is also power here. Okay, So in general, multiple in your regression, assume the outcome.

464
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:19,000
Wise continues, but if y is instead a binary but not won't work well, so we use new new you know extensions of linear graphing on the logist regression. But we cannot just you know directly using your right now

465
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:26,000
I have to modify the few parts right they'll make it sort of apply to the new data right now.

466
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:31,000
We open doors to different kind of regression model the linear regression Model is the foundation for other regression models.

467
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:34,000
That's why you know in the department of ball statistics.

468
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:39,000
We learn in your question for one semester, and then the second semester we learned, or just regarding other regressions. right?

469
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:43,000
So there are many regression forces. Each one is a has a different sort of a focus.

470
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:48,000
But they all people don't have a linear regression so let's see.

471
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:59,000
So in multiple linear regression we have this equation, right? The expected value in y is some for a linear function in all the acts.

472
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:08,000
That was our building block, our starting point which means that because it's an expected value of Y.

473
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:14,000
Yeah, the which means, if Y itself is normal, which means this is the mean of why right?

474
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:20,000
And there is still a variance which we do not capture here, but nevertheless means that why can't be anything?

475
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:26,000
Because you know, this linear predictor can give values on the real life could be positive to be negative.

476
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:32,000
It doesn't put any restriction on the value of y

477
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:38,000
What if we want to put the restriction on the value of Y or the value of the expected line?

478
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:55,000
For example, if we want to make y to be binary so, why can only be 0 and one, and if y can only be 0 one, the expected value of y will be the probability of y being one that'll be a number point of interval 0

479
01:49:55,000 --> 01:50:02,000
one right you'd want to put this high constraint for binary outcome.

480
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:06,000
Now this is not a very good model, because the right hand side can still sped out.

481
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:16,000
Things go outside the range. there's just no intrinsic constraint on the value of this linear predictor.

482
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:26,000
So that's that's number one thing that you know linear regression model doesn't really work well for binary data

483
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:30,000
Second thing is that you know this is, you know. Continue with the number one.

484
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:34,000
Right. So Paul will feed the linear branding model for binary data.

485
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:44,000
We just fit it regardless. Oh, we got it coefficient right? For example, here the outcome is is the probability of that.

486
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:48,000
Oh, how come, you know, is that 0 month and the predictor?

487
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:55,000
We have. One predictor is called a full thickness. Burn right, Amen.

488
01:50:55,000 --> 01:51:05,000
This is so possible to be a continuous trade that's suppose our model is, you know, have an intercept at 0 Point 5, and the slope is 0 point 0 1.

489
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:10,000
And then when we plug in the X variable to be 20, we got a predictor.

490
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:14,000
P. is 0 point 7, which is good, but if you're plugging the axis of 60.

491
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:17,000
Then we got a P. goes 1 point, one you cannot have a probability of that.

492
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:25,000
Be 1 point, one which is just, not interpretable which costs on trouble for invitation, right?

493
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:31,000
It's not like you cannot rescue from this for example, You can say anything about one. I will I would just interpret that one.

494
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:42,000
Anything below 0, just in terms of 0 you can still go ahead it's just not natural. But you are forcing constraints on your invitation.

495
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:58,000
It's better to have a model which happens the constraint building. Then, having a constraint, you know both on your invitation

496
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:02,000
So in this case we can use some sort of a mathematical trip.

497
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:08,000
I'm going to you know, using my medical format for those of you who are familiar with.

498
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:18,000
But exactly, we just try to use a mathematical equation to force the outcomes to be between 0 and one right.

499
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:24,000
This particular linear function? Can I be forced? Because linear function is a line, A line goes to infinity.

500
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:31,000
He just cannot bend it right. But what if we put another sort of the transformation on the linear function?

501
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:39,000
For example, there are many formal transmission, but we can take this: the smith 75.

502
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:46,000
It's called the logic function you Find is the Lock The logic function applies on a number on a probability.

503
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:52,000
P. is the log of P over one minus P. decipher.

504
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:56,000
If you see P over my minus p. one p is the risk. Then P.

505
01:52:56,000 --> 01:53:04,000
Over one minus B is the All. So this is the log of the So logic is also the log of all.

506
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:10,000
So if the P is between 0 and one, the P. over one minus p is always between 0.

507
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:17,000
To infinity. Therefore the log in the piece, always from minus infinity to the positions here should be a minus sign.

508
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:21,000
So the log of the key has no range restrictions.

509
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:26,000
So this logic of P. is sort of a I don't know if I've occur.

510
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:36,000
Yeah, I have a curve. So essentially the function transformed from the input of 0 and one to the whole real life from minus infinity.

511
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:42,000
So we can use this particular function to link to put the constraint that would want.

512
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:45,000
Okay for those of you who are not familiar with this kind of notation.

513
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:51,000
You can ignore that it just it's just some specific mathematical function that have this property.

514
01:53:51,000 --> 01:54:00,000
This is not only one, but it's a very widely useful has some nice, probably because they can cover it at all.

515
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:04,000
So the larger transformation is most most commonly used. Well, by the way.

516
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:13,000
Now, especially Well, Binder did a collective phone case control study, because it's the natural interpretation for all the ratio.

517
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:29,000
Remember we do as ratio in case control study, because all the ratio can be acting in unbiasedly from paste and closely

518
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:32,000
But that is not to say this is the only function we could use.

519
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:37,000
Any function has the kind of public having used, for example, in 200 and in the in practice people also use other function.

520
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:41,000
For example, a profit, orbit function or a C log function.

521
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:49,000
You can have any function you use you like. They all have these probability of transparent from 0, one from infinity to minus infinity.

522
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:54,000
But they have different invitation. the way you use different function like this transformation function?

523
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:58,000
Or we call the link function You end up with different regression models.

524
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:01,000
Right, you're using a logic transformation we call the logistic regression.

525
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:06,000
But when you use the probated link function called the Probate regression, we use the same.

526
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:11,000
All our you. You got a compounded, complementary logist regression, you know you have managed very vigor model.

527
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:18,000
Depend on the link talking to you you're gonna learn the link function, which is way beyond, you know, scope of this course.

528
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:30,000
So we're gonna focus on the district question because it's in this battery useful for case control study because the interpretation of this logist, you know, logistics link it's very natural in case my first time we have

529
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:34,000
to example, later on, to to convince you that's the case here.

530
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:40,000
I just show by no means. logistic is the only function we could use here.

531
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:45,000
Okay, So this is the picture of the logic function, right?

532
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:48,000
When you have P right from 0 one to 0 to one.

533
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:55,000
The larger the p really go from minus infinity, infinity.

534
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:58,000
And other function I have similar s shape. They just have different kind of ads, right.

535
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:03,000
Some are more twisted on our left twisted i'm, our shifted or regardless.

536
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:16,000
They all have this similar shape to transform from 0 one to minus infinity.

537
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:23,000
Okay, So this function deal is the problem of the range in one. all we have more problems than that.

538
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:28,000
When we didn't. he was by the right data remember for continuous outcome.

539
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:38,000
If we use normal distribution. The normal distributor had 2 parameters, the mean and the variance, or the me on the standard deviation, right?

540
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:44,000
The linear graph model will model the mean of what? because the expected value of Y is the mean of one.

541
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:48,000
While we are assuming the standard deviation, Why, given all the access is constant.

542
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:55,000
That's the assumption

543
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:58,000
Remember the call from the assumption. the cost of variance.

544
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:04,000
Assumption is crucial, right? I mean roughly crucial for or

545
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:10,000
We hear a question right? if that's not going violated you lose power, right?

546
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:16,000
But for binary data we don't have that luxury to have that assumption.

547
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:22,000
Remember what binary data let me on. the various are linked her.

548
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:25,000
Now the variance of y equals P. times one minus P. where P.

549
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:28,000
Is the mean of line, so the mean will determine the variance.

550
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:33,000
The variance will be largest. One p is 0 point 5, for the virus will be smaller when P.

551
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:41,000
Goes to 0 or goes to one. You just cannot have constant variance, for binary data is the nature of binary data is not normal.

552
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:57,000
Therefore, you cannot have binary or confidential which means that if you use linear regression to fit binary data, Not only you have the range problem for interpretation, you'll also lose power, because you're not taking into account the the

553
01:57:57,000 --> 01:58:04,000
link between you know me and Americans. My final data do not follow normal. You force it.

554
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:11,000
Use normal to to model it. usual power you lose information it's not.

555
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:18,000
I do.

556
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:28,000
Yeah, let me know when I have a question.

557
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:35,000
And there is the third problem, this in interpretation: right?

558
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:41,000
Remember, in the multiple in your regression we assume the linearity between wine.

559
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:53,000
And are we setting for theitation? is that for you, and increase in a particular variable the expected value y will increase by a constant pulling all out of variable faith.

560
01:58:53,000 --> 01:59:00,000
Bye, which is also to say, for double changing that slide from 10 to 11.

561
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:03,000
We'll have the same impact on the copy by y as changing X.

562
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:07,000
One from 100 to 101 as long as you increase X. one by one unit.

563
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:21,000
It doesn't care the original. Oh, okay, he also doesn't care about the other ads as long as you keep them confident

564
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:36,000
However, you just cannot have that. well by their alcohol, because you cannot, you know, change the value of okay, and also changing key.

565
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:41,000
The difficulty in changing heat

566
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:45,000
It's gets hard on the harder as you get close to 0 one, right? When P.

567
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:52,000
0 point 5. You can change the P relatively easy, but when key is already 0 point 9, 5, you can no longer increase.

568
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:57,000
P. file a huge amount anymore, because P. cannot go over one.

569
01:59:57,000 --> 02:00:03,000
This is about the same problem, as you know, some as the problem challenge number one, but no carry in different format.

570
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:11,000
Again you were saying, This is saying that the linearity condition assumption just cannot hold for these kind of model.

571
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:16,000
Again using a logic link we'll have this problem we will solve this problem right?

572
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:21,000
If we don't assume p itself he's a linear act but rather the larger The P.

573
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:27,000
Is linear X, then, that's fine because the larger the peak can go from that minus infinity infinity.

574
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:31,000
So you can change your hobby right you don't have this problem.

575
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:49,000
So instead of modeling P to be linear, in that, we, instead of all the log of the key to be linearized

576
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:56,000
Okay, Now we have a different model right for the linear regression model.

577
02:00:56,000 --> 02:01:02,000
Why is continuous, So the mean of y or the expected value of y equals linear in that.

578
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:18,000
And then the interpretation of beta there is that the change in the mean response associated with one unit changing Xj Holy wall, Colbert's poison call veterans means other variables. pretty much right covariance means

579
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:26,000
you have one variable. of interest. then all other variable will call the whole areas, which means they vary, you know, together with this variable right.

580
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:39,000
And then, if you hold all the progress constant, or hold all the variable, a constant or adjusting for all the variable control followers, there are mean the same thing the less in the rotation of beta J find the logistics question model

581
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:43,000
which is given here instead. the larger the peak he is the expected value of. Why?

582
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:52,000
Because why is binary? So the logic of the expected value of y equals the being your function of fact.

583
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:58,000
Then. now our invitation for pay that they change great. You will change x Y.

584
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:02,000
We will change Xj. by one unit it's not a P.

585
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:19,000
That will change It's the larger. the p will change what can I say the log off will increase by a constant amount equal to the slope of that, but they go terrible, so you're not increasing the probability you're not increasing the risk

586
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:27,000
by a fixed amount. You are increased in the log off, and the Logos and the rest. they are about to one corresponding to each other.

587
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:34,000
The log of the

588
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:38,000
So that's where you know the all of this thing become so useful right?

589
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:50,000
Because it was just a question required, and also case case control study require that's why we we do it

590
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:58,000
So, although we really impacted, we want to know the risk and the relative risk, because those are really useful.

591
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:07,000
Hi, but we did. We do a detour with study us instead, and finally try to translate that to the risk I'm making interpretation.

592
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:13,000
So people just directly write off in their paper, saying, Okay, the hard ratio of this factor as well.

593
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:21,000
I find out a little hard. I mean that's more rigorous right? because you really are starting off when you're closing it from all the rest.

594
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:31,000
Sometimes you have to make this rare disease. assumption, right things like those. So that's why, in some paper they directly say the ratio is one, and one which is fine.

595
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:36,000
If the other either of that article are experts right, they know what all means.

596
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:41,000
All the ratio mean, or when you put all the ratio in the like.

597
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:47,000
The news article targeting Late Audience: I find out to be problematic right, cause no late person knows what the hazard is.

598
02:03:47,000 --> 02:04:03,000
They know the chance of getting a disease right. They understand that, but they want to send all the so you have to do some translation sooner or later.

599
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:08,000
Okay.

600
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:12,000
Right. So I just said right. The interpretation in Logos is rigorous, correct.

601
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:23,000
Mathematically I was practically is not very useful, because feel people know what log of me

602
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:28,000
I mean, Few people even know what awesome not permitted a log off so to make a lot of better.

603
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:45,000
So instead, we say a unique increase in logos we convert that to off, and all that's a little better than log on, because the on the logarithmic scale is even harder to interpret right on the on an audio skill We are

604
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:59,000
one step closer to the risk. Sorry it turns out that because the logoff is the log logarithm of all you believe exponentiated, we take the exponential of the law.

605
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:06,000
We got the original call right so we're saying here made the J.

606
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:12,000
Remember a quantified the log of ratio associate with why you they change your eyes.

607
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:17,000
Log on ratio is the log of the odd ratio is also the change.

608
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:20,000
In the logoff is the same thing you know I i'm talking about.

609
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
I know a lot of mathematical terminology.

610
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:34,000
I don't have a better way of phrase it. but those who put an applement with logarithm, so I try to play the you know a little better, because Beta quantified the log operational therefore e would the

611
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:39,000
beta qualify the ratio finally by the aud ratio.

612
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:45,000
Essentially, we are a little more familiar with operation. We have done that in high school, right?

613
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:49,000
So we sign e to the beta is the ratio.

614
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:56,000
Oh, the off between 2 subjects. One subject has a covariant X. K.

615
02:05:56,000 --> 02:06:00,000
Equals x plus one. The other subject has poverty, equals.

616
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:07,000
Xj equals X. right? So these 2 subjects have all other covers being equal, takes up one.

617
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:19,000
This one they did, for by one unit, and for this to cover, we can computer rest of carrying a disease which means Y equals one. I know we have computer alls of getting like these.

618
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:27,000
And then the ratio of the All the ratio is activated by this E To the basically I know we go many staff.

619
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:37,000
Finally to get the invitation of data. but that's it it turned out to be very useful in hate control studies.

620
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:41,000
I mean it's equally used for even more useful in cohort study of a caller study.

621
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:49,000
We can do more things, but for case controls that this is especially useful, it's probably the only the the most wide use to.

622
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:53,000
If you have case control study, you see pretty much 900%.

623
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:58,000
The case. people do logist regression

624
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:01,000
If you have Cova study, you have the other type of regression.

625
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:09,000
There are other regret in dealing with binary data. But for case control study, you want to question is the tool

626
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:17,000
Any questions so far

627
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:27,000
Why are both wise here? Well, yes, I would have expected that one of the wise would be 0 if you would computer ratio.

628
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:30,000
Yeah, we are not really talking about. We are talking about 2 subjects.

629
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:37,000
Right we're talking about for y equals one for one subject versus the off a white, or one for the other subject.

630
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:40,000
So you can say, this is why, why, what? Why, K. This is different.

631
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:48,000
One on different subjects. we're just pretending you know we're coupling the house for them to be one.

632
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:55,000
Yeah, the the notation is not ideal i've yet to find a better way to right this Tom.

633
02:07:55,000 --> 02:08:00,000
That's why it could be confusing that's Why, you know you have any question in terms of the invitation.

634
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:10,000
Please let me know we're we're comparing 2 subjects here, and also we use jay to denote it.

635
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:14,000
The Jays covariance right? but there should also be a eye to be.

636
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:21,000
Know the subject. Id you just you know if you write ijk You know. just become very confusing if you don't write them.

637
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:24,000
It's also confusing I I I don't have a better way of putting this.

638
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:35,000
But we are comparing 2 subjects here. Okay? So previous slide, that was for the power legislature, right?

639
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:44,000
We can now measure the incremental impact of a continuous predictor on the odds of life as well.

640
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:49,000
The all is imagining some event here. The device of life was one, because wine is biler right?

641
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:58,000
So Y equals one is is a event we have been dealing with vital data before.

642
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:05,000
Remember we deal with 2 by 2 table right that's fine our data, and there we have a lot of pools like high school things like those.

643
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:10,000
Remember, same linear regression is an extension of 2 sample.

644
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:20,000
Kita. right we'll run simple integration in your regret how no 2 group data you got the same result As to some of you have.

645
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:32,000
So the question is, if you run a just regression 2 by 2 contenders, the table would you get the same result as those we got earlier, like 2 sample proportion tests like high school test?

646
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:44,000
Right, you'll be much more comforting i'm convincing you if we got the same result re referring right

647
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:48,000
So let's say how we run the logic right Now i'll i'll put back to a table.

648
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:57,000
Let's just regret and go beyond to back to table at least you should be able to handle provide to table

649
02:09:57,000 --> 02:10:05,000
Okay, and this is for binary. If you have multiple category, you have to pick a baseline level.

650
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:08,000
We call the reference category or reference level, right?

651
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:17,000
And then computer, all is against dial level, because logistical question is intrinsically modeling binary data, right?

652
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:23,000
We'll talk about off the top of the probability of some event versus probably not having that event.

653
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:30,000
They have a vital right. So you have category, but they know you have to find a reference level or group them into 2 before you have a pilot.

654
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:41,000
This regression. So in that sense let's just regret do not directly replace chi-square tests because chi-squared? Has they model multiple category data directors, right?

655
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:49,000
Although just a question don't do that but they are John the rise they found logistic question: There are multiple of this regression.

656
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:54,000
There are. like all the numbers, there are different generalization going beyond binary data.

657
02:10:54,000 --> 02:11:02,000
But again, those are beyond the this course. Okay.

658
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:14,000
Alright, Let's Now take this 2 by 2 table I will go over this slide and then take a break, because it picks on time for right.

659
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:18,000
Suppose now we have a binary 2 by 2 table for simplicity.

660
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:23,000
We have a variable, which is an exposure we call the exposure status.

661
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:27,000
You have 2 value exposed, non-exposed, we have another variable which is alcohol.

662
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:31,000
How the Dz status, which is disease and node d.

663
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:34,000
Why, this is the hypothetical table. therefore we are not putting real numbers in there.

664
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:37,000
We just put in, you know. hypothetical number right?

665
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:42,000
Abcd are the are the number of other tools for cells, and then we have marginal songs.

666
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:57,000
Right. These are the number of people having disease. the bar. The number of people not having disease, E or number of people, is both E bar number of people not exposed, and N is the total of the phone numbers.

667
02:11:57,000 --> 02:12:03,000
We know from this 2 people we can compute the a lot of Rachel.

668
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:08,000
We can ask me the audio for the population to be Oh r hat equals 8 times D.

669
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:14,000
Divided by B. Times, C. What is that? All ratio?

670
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:22,000
Right, that is, the ratio of the off of having the disease in an exposed group versus the non-exposed people.

671
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:32,000
How was the definition right in the exposed group you can compute the risk of having a disease? Dagger can be the odds of having a disease similar in the not the exposure we got to the all of having a disease now

672
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:40,000
i'll take the ratio of the 2 h in the 2 group. You got a operation that's what you call

673
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:43,000
I know we can use the high-squared path.

674
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:49,000
Remember to to assess whether this odd ratio is significant, different from one or not.

675
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:54,000
We got even construct a 95% come the innovative with all Rachel, and so on so forth.

676
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:58,000
Right. So now the question is that can we analyze the same data using logist regression?

677
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:09,000
And are we going to get the same result

678
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:15,000
Okay, I will stop here and take a take a 10 min break and then continue with the wrath of the lecture.

679
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:45,000
Hopefully, we can finish elected today. So tomorrow we can focus on happiness

680
02:25:50,000 --> 02:26:00,000
Okay, that's continue So our goal is to apply logic regression on these 2 by 2 contingents paper which are already familiar with.

681
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:06,000
Hopefully, we'll get the same result and then we talk about you know, just regression actually can go beyond this right?

682
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:13,000
Because here the exposure is binary, the case where exposure is continuous.

683
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:16,000
And not only that, remember the main point of legislation is done.

684
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:23,000
You can use the multiple exposure right the exposure and the other covariance compounding factor in the model which, let's go back to the table.

685
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:30,000
Cannot in corporate. So on the P key here is just a you know.

686
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:39,000
Do throughout sort of the tracking weather. let's just get same result when we have single data.

687
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:45,000
So it turns out that we can also compute all ratio from a logist regression.

688
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:50,000
Now that's introduced a little bit no patience right we have to make it rigorous, so let's say X.

689
02:26:50,000 --> 02:27:00,000
Is, the exposure is binary. therefore x is one. you if exposed, and 0 otherwise, that that similarly, why is one.

690
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:06,000
We have a disease outcome, and 0 otherwise so both xy are binary here.

691
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:18,000
That's the simplest case. Now let's use p to denote the probability they always need the no pay for the probability of why, being one giving particular acts so here X.

692
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:24,000
Could be 0 one but taxes. No, so I will regret the model after we feed.

693
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:29,000
The logistic version would be large in the P. Remember, the larger the P.

694
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:41,000
Is beta 0 plus beta one x I don't look at this, because ads can take a value of 0, and one when you plug in 0 or plug in y you got a 2 different logic.

695
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:47,000
Basically the same. The the x equals 0, the unexposed group.

696
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:50,000
We will have a larger. The P equals beta, not exposed group.

697
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:58,000
We have a lot of the P. because beta now plus by the one that's always saying right after you you'll pay the data.

698
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:02,000
You've got this number you can you can plug in and make predictions.

699
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:10,000
And now now, let's spelled them off right when X is 0, which is the non-exposed group, we have the log of the P.

700
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:13,000
Equals by the not. the next is one which is like both group.

701
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:16,000
We have log of the peak was based on Alpha Beta.

702
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:20,000
One.

703
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:29,000
So if we really think about what the p is in the non-exposed group, he's the logic of the probability that because the P.

704
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:35,000
Is the probability of having a disease given. not exposed I mean i'm using this conditional.

705
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:43,000
This bar stands for conditioning on something happening. Okay, so he's the probability of giving it having a disease in the month.

706
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:51,000
Both group. This is the rest. This is the rest having disease now. it's both.

707
02:28:51,000 --> 02:29:01,000
But we are not directly modeling the risk. But the bottom of modeling by the log off the log off is some function of the risk.

708
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:07,000
So Beta not now. Remember, Beta, Now is the intersect right?

709
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:10,000
The intercept has an interpretation in this particular model.

710
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:16,000
In this particular setting the interests are not. Has the invitation being the log off, have to be careful.

711
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:20,000
This is not all as a racial it's just the log off?

712
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:26,000
How about a disease for those unexposed

713
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:38,000
And look at this. The Beta law plus beta. One will be the log off of disease for those exposed. when you take the difference.

714
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:55,000
The beta one itself. Now half the interpretation number log. All the ratio is the same thing as the difference in logo, because logarithm has the the probability of turning ratio into a difference turning product into some so this

715
02:29:55,000 --> 02:30:05,000
is the difference in Logos, which also is the logo ratio comparing those exposed to those unexposed.

716
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:16,000
So I will write a little bit I don't know Why, it's helpful or not. but you know the log of the awe.

717
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:27,000
Oh, P. one minus the log of the odd Oh, P. 2!

718
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:33,000
Because the the difference in the law that evils the law of the odds of P.

719
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:41,000
One divided by the R. of P. 2. so the the difference in Logos equals the log of the racial dog.

720
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:46,000
That's the log operation that's just mathematical property of the of the Logarithm.

721
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:51,000
So that's why we we use this larger function. not for no reason there is a mathematical reason.

722
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:53,000
Right. We are modeling the log of the ratio.

723
02:30:53,000 --> 02:31:05,000
And this thing in the middle here is the hard ratio. Right is the log of the all ratio

724
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:11,000
And because Beta is the log of it all ratio, we can take the hey.

725
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:13,000
The inverse function of logarithm which is exponential right?

726
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:28,000
Will be exponentiate beta one. we got all the ratio comparing those exposure, so that e to the beta one is the other reason we are looking for so essentially E to the beta one is the operation.

727
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:39,000
We are looking for from this data

728
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:44,000
I'm not definitely not going to test on this so don't worry if you couldn't follow all the mathematical details.

729
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:54,000
But the key is to know that just regression, you know the caller efficient when you exponentially the coefficients, you got all racial. right?

730
02:31:54,000 --> 02:32:01,000
So basically here, Okay, made a lot is a lot of therefore give you to calculate e to the beta.

731
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:06,000
Now E to the intercept. in the logic regression model is the off and E to the slope.

732
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:15,000
In the latest version model is the operation so really we are working on, you know, like It's about natural scale.

733
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:21,000
We are modeling off and operation on the exponential scale because we took a logarithm.

734
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:31,000
Okay, So that's now go on with this real example right because the previous example has no data in it. here.

735
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:35,000
We have no data right, that's not plugging in a real data.

736
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:41,000
So basically, this is saying, if you straight your regression model on this data, you can eat with the slope.

737
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:46,000
You through the gap. the same all the ratio has to make.

738
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:54,000
Now let's be the real model and see whether that's the case but

739
02:32:54,000 --> 02:33:09,000
So in this actual data the Pi examine a subset of data collecting 1,988 alcohol stopping the national health Interview survey. and i'll come why is an indicator whether or not the person has defined

740
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:13,000
as alcohol abuser one is. Yes, 0 is not so.

741
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:22,000
The Y is outcome. Your outcome is binary that's address us to use logist regression, and now we have a We have 2 predictors, right?

742
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:27,000
Because we have 2 predictors, the 2 by 2 table won't work anymore.

743
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:33,000
The 2 by 2 cable only works. We have one particular wise exposure.

744
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:38,000
You have, you know, if you if your exposure, how come has multiple categories?

745
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:42,000
Now you have. you can build a bigger table, but you have more than one predictor.

746
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:46,000
You pick a table wouldn't wouldn't work either what you really need.

747
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:51,000
He's a multi is a high dimensional table Basically, the table is 3 dimensional.

748
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:55,000
When you have 2 disposers you can't even put a paper like that, right?

749
02:33:55,000 --> 02:34:00,000
I have to break it down the first later a secondly it's more complicated.

750
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:07,000
But now you have a 3 dimensional table, your data actually 3 dimensional, because you have x, one x, one and one right.

751
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:18,000
So now the 2 prosecutor X one, is the is the tax rate on beer in the State, and that's totally the tax re palm cigarette in the State.

752
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:24,000
And this time you know our particularly it's not even binary So the payroll wouldn't fit, anyway, right all particular.

753
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:32,000
Continue. So now is the case. We definitely have to use this regression

754
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:43,000
Okay, So we're on the study between alcohol abuser and the tax rate on either beer or cigarette.

755
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:50,000
You can't imagine. the high quality probably increased fear tax rate will reduce alcohol.

756
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:53,000
Consumption will probably reduce alcohol abuser.

757
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:58,000
Well, who knows right? The the you know the paws all graph is more commonly than i'm not now.

758
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:03,000
Right.

759
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:08,000
E. We have all deep beer types, and cigarette hacks are successfully public health strategies.

760
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:16,000
The increase tax might be reduce alcoholism we'll see

761
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:24,000
So there are 2 nice things of this data set. First of all, the tax rates are pretty low.

762
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:29,000
Okay, not not pretty low. It means that the tax rates they are just a few numbers.

763
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:39,000
There's a small number of potential x one values and then we have several observed values, and each x one value.

764
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:43,000
So for this special data set, we can do something an awkward make more sense out of it.

765
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:51,000
But it doesn't apply for more general data set So in this case basically means there are some States with the same X-ray.

766
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:57,000
Your tax rate. I know we can plot them, and this option is not available.

767
02:35:57,000 --> 02:36:03,000
All of the data sets, unless you have your experience has a lot of duplicates and your data center.

768
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:08,000
Let's first see what we got here

769
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:17,000
This is the plot of the data on the what on the x-axis, the beer tax rate.

770
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:23,000
It ran from 0 to 2 point, 5%

771
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:41,000
On a y-axis is the mean alcohol is the right which range from about 0 point 3 for 3% or 18%, and then each third go here

772
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:55,000
What is each circle is, I think, each circle

773
02:36:55,000 --> 02:37:00,000
Please hold on a second. Alright, So this is the thing, right?

774
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:07,000
This data file. we have to go back here. This data set is on individuals.

775
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:13,000
Okay, So your role is a person, and the person will either be a alcohol abuse or not abusing.

776
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:27,000
However, the variable our measure based on a tax rate for that person in the state of that person, you would imagine that.

777
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:41,000
Sorry I have a phone call, I mean, cause you would imagine that for people from the same state their tax rate will be the same

778
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:49,000
So even though this data family have thousands of individual if we really plot it right.

779
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:54,000
If we really plot it you'll act we'll have thousands of pets rate, and y will be 0 and one.

780
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:58,000
If you make a scalar, all of that will look awful.

781
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:03,000
Because why? is binary and accessible number to just get 2 black lines.

782
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:07,000
Think about that. we've got 2 black lines which do not really help help right?

783
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:12,000
But we had a large rate here, because many people come from the same state.

784
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:22,000
So our Y originally is binary. but now we can group people from the same state, and then estimated the P.

785
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:25,000
In that state. right? So, for example, each circle here is a state.

786
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:33,000
Are you state? We have many individual, some of them. They all have the same fear tax rate, because they come from the same state.

787
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:39,000
But some of them has a wise one. Some of them has a y 0, because we have many of them from the same state.

788
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:43,000
We can add them in. How many has a wide one, and then part that at the in the Y access.

789
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:48,000
Okay, So this is not a part of the raw data.

790
02:38:48,000 --> 02:39:00,000
This is a pl of some process, the data because if you're directly part of all that a lot in a wise binary. So what are the size of this?

791
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:13,000
The number of people in that particular you're not a particular State

792
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:18,000
Okay, So a bigger subcommittee, there are more people put together with that common tax rate.

793
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:30,000
And then you'll estimate of the mean alpha alcoholism rate should be imprisonment more accurate, because you use more people to ask me that some State has very few subjects in the study, therefore although we

794
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:34,000
have made a half of a rate of 8% for this date for this county.

795
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:41,000
I don't know but it may not be very accurate just give you an idea.

796
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:46,000
Well, i'm trying to say that this plot is not a part of the raw data.

797
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:51,000
It's a plot. of of some summary of the data, because if you bother out in a directory, or what is binary, it's very hard.

798
02:39:51,000 --> 02:40:02,000
It'll be an obvious looking figure. but now the last this part give you some idea right of the association between packs rate and the chance of having alcohol, alcoholism.

799
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:12,000
You see there's a slide i'll work on very very slide, and maybe the variance is bigger than you would imagine.

800
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:29,000
But there's a slide downward trend suggesting that higher beer has grade, is associated with lower alcohol, which is a good news for the investigator.

801
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:38,000
Okay, Hello, let's move on let's really fit the logic graph model to the data.

802
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:42,000
Remember here the data is on the individuals, not on the space.

803
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:49,000
Each individual has a y is 0, or one

804
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:55,000
It will take this digital software to fit the model there's no formula available.

805
02:40:55,000 --> 02:41:00,000
You need some algorithm, but once you're in the model you got the same thing off, you got a inner stop.

806
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:04,000
You got a slope they just have different from a Turing that looks just by the model.

807
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:15,000
But you got the same thing all of it right? So what we learn for a single in your brains do a 5 here interstack flow, you know, nevertheless, have different interpretation. but you have a P.

808
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:22,000
Value for each. This is the model, the largest of the largest of someone being alcoholism.

809
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:26,000
Alcohol. He was a linear function in the X.

810
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:36,000
He acts as a tax rate, actually is a continuous great

811
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:41,000
Okay, he is the probability, wise one. Well, we are not following Pd.

812
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:47,000
Directly, or modeling a log of the

813
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:53,000
Okay, cool.

814
02:41:53,000 --> 02:41:57,000
And let's put them all over here that's that's interpreted right with more real numbers.

815
02:41:57,000 --> 02:42:04,000
What does that mean? X. One is is continuous. Where is the tax rate? right?

816
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:10,000
Remember the intercept only has a interpretation when X is 0.

817
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:26,000
So when X is 0 means, there's no beer test which I think is arguably reasonable interpretation, because there could be states with no tax right? It's not outside the range of the data. Well, you plug in X y

818
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:28,000
equals 0. This term goes away. Do you have the interests?

819
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:32,000
Have the lap which means the law laws of alcoholism.

820
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:37,000
When the beer tax rate is 0 it's this this number by itself.

821
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:46,000
Doesn't make a lot of sense and here, you take the exponential with this is the log off.

822
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:54,000
Therefore the exponential of this number is the Us. The Os. is the risk divided by one minus the risk.

823
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:59,000
Thanks. The exponential of this number. You need a calculator equals 0 point 1, 1, 3.

824
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:08,000
The exponential number is always positive, even though the number itself may be negative, and the rest, you know the odds is 0 point.

825
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:13,000
1, 1, 3 steel is is something interpretable for people familiar with us.

826
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:20,000
But not so interpretable people, not from the results, so we would rather transform back to risk right.

827
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:28,000
In this case we call the problems for the province of alcoholism in that State with no fear attack after me.

828
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:37,000
The one you can get it, you know. Promise the equation you can get is 0 point 1 and one remember the Os is always great on that risk.

829
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:40,000
When the risk is small, the Os will be called the risk.

830
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:44,000
In this case the risk is not so small, but not so big either.

831
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:47,000
Their followers just slightly bigger, 10% bigger than the rest.

832
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:58,000
So turn on the big. the risk is about 10%. Oh, the problems of So all we we go all the way in the end, interpreting the intercepts this particular number.

833
02:43:58,000 --> 02:44:08,000
Translates to that the province of alcoholism when there's no beer tax rate beer type will be about 10%.

834
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:22,000
That's all question

835
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:28,000
Yeah. So you you see this thing, this is the log balls a log off when you'll take exponential.

836
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:40,000
You got it off. And then to really got a rest, you need to take the off divided by one, plus the all the Os equals risk devices by one minus risk.

837
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:54,000
The rest equals off, divided by one plus off that's just the equation to transform between risk and all

838
02:44:54,000 --> 02:45:04,000
Okay, we are done with intercept now. let's look at a slope slope is a similar to windows up a little trickier.

839
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:06,000
The inner side models to all the racket.

840
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:15,000
One group, but the slope models always model the ratio between 2 different hypothetical subjects.

841
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:25,000
So part unit increase. in this case per percentage point, increase in beer, right?

842
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:31,000
The aws of alcoholism will reduce because it's negative will reduce bye E.

843
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:40,000
To the slope by the slope is the log ratio. therefore E to the slope will be the odd ratio for the reduction of the by.

844
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:52,000
This a month. Okay, and this reduction it's not reduction in magnitude.

845
02:45:52,000 --> 02:46:05,000
Well, i'm saying it's not like the odds will decrease by this amount is the odd will reduce 2 is like 90 94 point. 8% original value.

846
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:12,000
The odds will multiply by this number, because the reduction is not the logarithm scale.

847
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:18,000
Therefore the on offshore is, it will you will reduce multiplying.

848
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:31,000
Basically, if you'll increase tax rate the os will reduced to is 94 point, 8%

849
02:46:31,000 --> 02:46:39,000
Which means, if you increase the pack rate by 2 unit, 2 percentage points and the odds were reduced by 94, point 8%.

850
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:44,000
Then another 98, point 4%, that'll be 89.9 for point, 8%.

851
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:54,000
So in this case, the slope really work on the off on a multiplicative scale, not on the added scale, because the logarithm playing a row in there.

852
02:46:54,000 --> 02:47:08,000
So in general, if we increase the beard tax rate by Z percent, then awesome. we were reduced by 94.8%, mark, you know, raised to disease power right?

853
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:16,000
Every unit increase in tax rate. don't reviews by by to itself, you know, to 94.8%.

854
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:20,000
So you can say, reduced by 5 or 5 point, 2%.

855
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:24,000
You can say that

856
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:28,000
So that's why you know this whole thing is measuring log of ratio.

857
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:33,000
It's matching or racial so this is the odd ratio.

858
02:47:33,000 --> 02:47:45,000
It's not a difference in all

859
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:50,000
Okay.

860
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:54,000
Now let's go back to kind of p by which for our formula right the P.

861
02:47:54,000 --> 02:47:58,000
Value for this lonel, Rachel. What is slope is 0 point 4, 9.

862
02:47:58,000 --> 02:48:14,000
1 16 s every time, which means, although the trend Yes, good for the investigator right to try and follow the trend of all of this, the higher tax rate we're reduced out all of them.

863
02:48:14,000 --> 02:48:24,000
But this slope is not significantly different from 0 so there's not enough evidence showing the soft piece mount 0.

864
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:30,000
So you could be getting this slow negative just by chance, you know.

865
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:34,000
Repeat this thought. You may actually get a still being positive so don't.

866
02:48:34,000 --> 02:48:40,000
I was saying, You know the investigator shouldn't be happy to too soon after seeing the plot, the P.

867
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:48,000
Value doesn't support a hypothesis

868
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:57,000
So the key model, doesn't this prove that they're you know the the authority right? there could still be association.

869
02:48:57,000 --> 02:49:06,000
He just is not supported by the data do we conclude that there's no association, no we fail to reject it not.

870
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:11,000
We cannot say that now is true. Do we conclude we have installation power.

871
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:17,000
We don't know the power by this study probably from a survey.

872
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:22,000
The sample size is pretty large, although the summer size is not always the same way.

873
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:24,000
You'll deal with continuous outcome versus binary outcome.

874
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:29,000
So on average of one binary outcome, has less information that one continues on.

875
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:34,000
So remember the rule of law right we're used when you do multiple linear regression.

876
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:38,000
The number of subjects should be 10 to 20 times more than a number of variables.

877
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:42,000
Right? Well, logistics, regression, the rule of summons are even bigger.

878
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:46,000
You need at least £20, because everything else equal right?

879
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:49,000
You just imagine things in 0 to one. you got less information on average.

880
02:49:49,000 --> 02:49:58,000
Now you might go things continuously. I got. I think you you agree with me, you know, intuitively, I cannot possibly find that Tommy is by the rule of phone.

881
02:49:58,000 --> 02:50:03,000
You need more subjects. Well, just regression model, then a linear pressure model.

882
02:50:03,000 --> 02:50:12,000
Nevertheless, I believe this survey probably have thousands of subjects. so you can't really say they have need for sufficient power, and not to measure you.

883
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:20,000
Never did a power analysis, some of you might say, can we do about power calculation afterwards?

884
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:25,000
I remember when you do power calculation, you need a lot of numbers.

885
02:50:25,000 --> 02:50:38,000
One of the number is is impact 5, right? When you do power like population viporial study, you need to add me the fact that which is a little chicken, that Because if you already know the fact that why do you even need a problem.

886
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:41,000
right, so you know you need to just have a gas of the outside and power.

887
02:50:41,000 --> 02:50:49,000
You'll study that's the formal approach and some people think they could do the power. Now it's optimized.

888
02:50:49,000 --> 02:50:57,000
For example, when you, when you you perform a study without a suitable power analysis, and then you'll collect your data.

889
02:50:57,000 --> 02:51:02,000
No, this always happens right. many, many times it happens because you you think 500 subjects is.

890
02:51:02,000 --> 02:51:06,000
It makes sense. You just collect 500 subject without formal polymers.

891
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:13,000
You got the data, and then you'll analyze your data. Then you may or may not get a sign in the P.

892
02:51:13,000 --> 02:51:23,000
By right. if you'll get a second key value and when you'll send me the paper, the the reviewer or the ad, if I might say, Oh, maybe you are overpowering yourself, or if you don't get a second p

893
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:32,000
value, another reviewer added, from I say, Oh, maybe you don't have enough power, right? in both cases they might suggest you to do a so called the post-hot power analysis.

894
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:37,000
So basically trying to ask you to figure out what your power really was.

895
02:51:37,000 --> 02:51:49,000
I mean? that would be a curious question. But some people, some started patient argue that the post-hoc power does is fundamentally flow.

896
02:51:49,000 --> 02:51:54,000
Are you off? What if I thought you used to ?

897
02:51:54,000 --> 02:52:02,000
If you use the impact 5, Remember, this is your effect size.

898
02:52:02,000 --> 02:52:10,000
If you use or you pack size, you observe from your data, then it is a cheap and that problem, because if you have a signal and a P.

899
02:52:10,000 --> 02:52:13,000
Value. Then you use your effect size to do the power use.

900
02:52:13,000 --> 02:52:29,000
You almost always find you have high power, because the effects that should be large enough. You'll have a small key out to begin with right? if you have an instagram with a p value. I Use this effect size to do the post how power

901
02:52:29,000 --> 02:52:39,000
analysis. Then very likely you got it on. you know insufficient power, because it's that size should be small people got a large key value to to begin with.

902
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:59,000
So the post i'll call announce is this fund of underlying in this argument you're not gonna get anything meaningful before we call the impact size is random, and you're taking it as if it is the truth

903
02:52:59,000 --> 02:53:05,000
So the question is very hard to say. with other formal power analysis we never know.

904
02:53:05,000 --> 02:53:11,000
I just say, from the rule of thought with 1,000 subjects the power typically should be good.

905
02:53:11,000 --> 02:53:15,000
And now you'll fail to do that so I don't think insufficient power should be the usual.

906
02:53:15,000 --> 02:53:23,000
But the postal power analysis wouldn't help me here, because if I really run the power analysis with the z-axis.

907
02:53:23,000 --> 02:53:35,000
Very often I will find I have you sufficient power, because the fact side is too small

908
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:43,000
So this question is really hard to answer.

909
02:53:43,000 --> 02:53:53,000
I think just answering. We don't know we sometimes be the best guys

910
02:53:53,000 --> 02:54:02,000
So just like linear regression, right? The The powerful legislation also evolve several polyty, but one of them is sample size.

911
02:54:02,000 --> 02:54:06,000
One of them is effect size, one of them in on the variability, and so on, so forth.

912
02:54:06,000 --> 02:54:16,000
And one of them is hypothetically right. So you love this request.

913
02:54:16,000 --> 02:54:20,000
The basically you try to the sample size determinant amount of information.

914
02:54:20,000 --> 02:54:29,000
You will have right. You love this regression the month, you know. the sample size depends on the total number of subject.

915
02:54:29,000 --> 02:54:43,000
Well, not only I not also depend on the number of subjects with y equals one, because if you don't have a lot of subjugate meals, study, apparently you don't have enough, information but even if you have a large

916
02:54:43,000 --> 02:54:52,000
sample size if all of them but almost all of them had the line life or 0. Oh, wife, was what basically you have unbalanced.

917
02:54:52,000 --> 02:55:00,000
I'll call they have little information you don't think about that you have a body.

918
02:55:00,000 --> 02:55:05,000
Hi Salvada the same outcome. Then you do not have information to pick out the other outcome.

919
02:55:05,000 --> 02:55:15,000
Things associated with the other outcome. so the more balanced your outcome, the more information you have keeping the sample size constant.

920
02:55:15,000 --> 02:55:19,000
That's why Case control studies helpful because in pace control study.

921
02:55:19,000 --> 02:55:24,000
You have artificially. Yeah, a file of Allcom.

922
02:55:24,000 --> 02:55:28,000
You can get 500 patients, 500 controls then this automatically power.

923
02:55:28,000 --> 02:55:36,000
I'll come right by the co-host that you don't have that option right.

924
02:55:36,000 --> 02:55:42,000
If you study a rare disease, you may need a very huge sample size to just look at a handful of of these people.

925
02:55:42,000 --> 02:55:47,000
That's a wasteful resource right So same issue here.

926
02:55:47,000 --> 02:55:55,000
And secondly, you need to have a some different value of act right remember, if you're all your acts have only one value.

927
02:55:55,000 --> 02:56:00,000
Then again, you don't have information basically you don't have some variability in both X and Y.

928
02:56:00,000 --> 02:56:06,000
For you to collect enough information. Variability means more information, but those of you are familiar with like entropy Right?

929
02:56:06,000 --> 02:56:13,000
The more of ourabilities, the bigger entropy, more information

930
02:56:13,000 --> 02:56:23,000
So luckily right in this case we have pretty low alcoholism rate.

931
02:56:23,000 --> 02:56:31,000
Right, I'll call it great great number one not also amuse our studies on violence.

932
02:56:31,000 --> 02:56:34,000
We have a lot more people who are non alcoholism than our corporal.

933
02:56:34,000 --> 02:56:44,000
So, even though we have thousands of subjects in the study, our effective sample size may not be that big.

934
02:56:44,000 --> 02:56:49,000
So this. So the information on the package that will depend on the balance.

935
02:56:49,000 --> 02:57:01,000
So we really can't say about power and second thing is that what the variability in beer tax rate we range from 0 to 2.5, 7, right?

936
02:57:01,000 --> 02:57:07,000
We have somewhere available. Not huge, either

937
02:57:07,000 --> 02:57:18,000
So you essentially, we don't really know anything for those days, or if we raise the tax rate about 2.5%.

938
02:57:18,000 --> 02:57:27,000
Almost most of the States has a very low path, rate a handful has, you know, big than one between 1 2 2.5, nothing beyond 2.5.

939
02:57:27,000 --> 02:57:40,000
We just don't have a lot of information we don't have a lot of our ability in a tax rate to say much

940
02:57:40,000 --> 02:57:45,000
So this is to say, even though we may have a sample 1,000 here.

941
02:57:45,000 --> 02:57:52,000
The model information is probably smaller than you would imagine. so we may be having insufficient power or not.

942
02:57:52,000 --> 02:58:02,000
We don't know no that's the downside of not having a formal power analysis before you design your study right after. you see the result.

943
02:58:02,000 --> 02:58:07,000
It's become even more confusing

944
02:58:07,000 --> 02:58:10,000
Oh, we were saying, you know you might. you might argue, How do I do?

945
02:58:10,000 --> 02:58:16,000
A formal policy, right? If I don't know the quality of interest.

946
02:58:16,000 --> 02:58:20,000
I need that size and things like those right, which is a very valid question.

947
02:58:20,000 --> 02:58:25,000
You need to make it a vast gas like from the literature, from your knowledge.

948
02:58:25,000 --> 02:58:32,000
Well from a pilot study without those if there's no literature.

949
02:58:32,000 --> 02:58:40,000
Nope. no best guess. Guess no pilot study then that means you're the first one to study this question in the world.

950
02:58:40,000 --> 02:58:48,000
Of course you don't have things to borrow but on the other hand, you are studying a very novel question, so you can think about your study.

951
02:58:48,000 --> 02:58:52,000
Will be the pilot study for people. so which is supposed to go that back right?

952
02:58:52,000 --> 02:58:57,000
There is a lot of people studying this question then you probably have a lot of information already.

953
02:58:57,000 --> 02:59:05,000
The power you'll study but if there's not then you're the first one which is good right, which is good.

954
02:59:05,000 --> 02:59:10,000
Always look out of the note, though the bridefire right alright.

955
02:59:10,000 --> 02:59:15,000
So let's now consider the second variable which is the cigarette tax rate.

956
02:59:15,000 --> 02:59:20,000
If we replace thanks one by Cigarette has 3.

957
02:59:20,000 --> 02:59:35,000
Let me go a different plot. You see, this time the the slope is actually positive, so I only party, which, if by itself is true, that means increased.

958
02:59:35,000 --> 02:59:43,000
Cigarette has rate will increase out of all

959
02:59:43,000 --> 02:59:45,000
Which may I may not make sense depending on how you improve them right?

960
02:59:45,000 --> 02:59:51,000
You could say it. Doesn't make sense How kind of help you make cigarette more expense, Mike Martin.

961
02:59:51,000 --> 02:59:56,000
Expensive, expensive. We have more more people drinking helpful. but you know you can also think about that makes sense right?

962
02:59:56,000 --> 03:00:03,000
Some people may, maybe, you know, addicted with both cigarettes and alcohol.

963
03:00:03,000 --> 03:00:08,000
If cigarette become more expensive, then they will switch to a drink.

964
03:00:08,000 --> 03:00:12,000
More alcohol. you can always make a sense of your data once you'll see the result.

965
03:00:12,000 --> 03:00:18,000
That's why, having a hypothesis you see the data is more is very important.

966
03:00:18,000 --> 03:00:28,000
No way You won't you won't try to you know always find fine explanation for your result, and then just feed the model.

967
03:00:28,000 --> 03:00:31,000
This, again, is alcoholism versus cigarette path.

968
03:00:31,000 --> 03:00:40,000
You see, the slope is slightly positive, very tiny. but pocket, the P value is above 0 point.

969
03:00:40,000 --> 03:00:52,000
0 5, but but close to it right and then that's the fitted regression line, and then the variables.

970
03:00:52,000 --> 03:01:02,000
And then let's do some exercise right so what is the in interpretation.

971
03:01:02,000 --> 03:01:11,000
The intersect

972
03:01:11,000 --> 03:01:22,000
It takes some, you know. mathematical calculation

973
03:01:22,000 --> 03:01:36,000
And they want to try. So is it. When x 2 equals 0, the y equals minus 2 point, 3, 5, 7, which in this case is

974
03:01:36,000 --> 03:01:45,000
Alcoholism equals negative. 2 point, 3, 5, 7.

975
03:01:45,000 --> 03:01:49,000
This clock. you're right I want when x 2 is 0.

976
03:01:49,000 --> 03:01:54,000
You know the interests have me is the value for the logite of he is negative.

977
03:01:54,000 --> 03:01:58,000
2 point, 3, 5, 7, but the larger the P. is not P.

978
03:01:58,000 --> 03:02:04,000
So so there is some transformation it's it's a little involved.

979
03:02:04,000 --> 03:02:16,000
Let's let's do it together right see if I can Why, it

980
03:02:16,000 --> 03:02:24,000
So the logic Okay, he calls the log of P over one minus P.

981
03:02:24,000 --> 03:02:36,000
Now equals 0 point 2 point, 3, 5, 7. given x, 2 equals 0, but the log all the piece hardly internal.

982
03:02:36,000 --> 03:02:43,000
We have the big out of peak, so the first thing we can do is to off, which equals P over one minus P.

983
03:02:43,000 --> 03:02:54,000
That'll be exponential minus 2. point 3 to 5 7. You need a cop away there, and I need a capitalized up on this, and then let's do it right.

984
03:02:54,000 --> 03:03:03,000
So that will be exponential minus 2 point, 3, 5, 7.

985
03:03:03,000 --> 03:03:15,000
Are you close? Yes, 0 point 9, 5 0 point. No, This you write it 0 point.

986
03:03:15,000 --> 03:03:24,000
What was that? 9 for? Oh, 0 point 0 9, 4, 5, ?

987
03:03:24,000 --> 03:03:29,000
0 point 0, 9, 4, 7 0 point 0 9 that's like 0 point 0, 9, 5.

988
03:03:29,000 --> 03:03:35,000
Okay.

989
03:03:35,000 --> 03:03:44,000
So the so the inter side itself is the log off. therefore the exponential need to set it off.

990
03:03:44,000 --> 03:03:58,000
If you want to do one step further. then you've got p equals 0 point 0, 9, 5 divided by one plus 0 point 0 9, 5 do a little bit, you know.

991
03:03:58,000 --> 03:04:05,000
That's true so that's this thing divided by wow pause.

992
03:04:05,000 --> 03:04:14,000
It's found out on the minus 2 point 3 5 7, so that will be 0 point 0, hey?

993
03:04:14,000 --> 03:04:21,000
Sam. Okay.

994
03:04:21,000 --> 03:04:27,000
0 point 0, 8, 7, so that's the risk of having alcoholism.

995
03:04:27,000 --> 03:04:32,000
When the small cigarette tax rate is 0.

996
03:04:32,000 --> 03:04:44,000
Any questions so far

997
03:04:44,000 --> 03:04:50,000
Okay, I guess i'm not answering the question here right so that's the question.

998
03:04:50,000 --> 03:04:59,000
The interpretation intersect. Did the log off. So this is a log awesome?

999
03:04:59,000 --> 03:05:13,000
Wow! I'll. Oh, given actually do right the log all the being on alcohol!

1000
03:05:13,000 --> 03:05:29,000
Is them give a no fear tax way. So they interpretation of the here at the bottom of the code, coefficient of the on the cigarette tax rate, which is the slope. right?

1001
03:05:29,000 --> 03:05:36,000
So if the log of is, you know, minus 0 point, 2, 3, 5 in the office, 0 point 0, 9 5.

1002
03:05:36,000 --> 03:05:40,000
The risk is 0 point 0 8 7 you can't interpret any of this right?

1003
03:05:40,000 --> 03:05:44,000
That's all the interpretation of the intersection for some function in this time.

1004
03:05:44,000 --> 03:05:53,000
Let me take on the caller picture on the flow that's the odd in the log, hard ratio so 0 point 0 0, hey?

1005
03:05:53,000 --> 03:06:11,000
He's the log off racial. Oh, alcoholism for that's 2 is one versus x 2 reasons.

1006
03:06:11,000 --> 03:06:19,000
0 can see there's 2 individual one how's up cigarette has rate.

1007
03:06:19,000 --> 03:06:37,000
No, not actually one, if you know, actually is is something x plus one versus. Actually, because I so basically when you're in, will you consider 2 subjects where there cigarette tax rate deeper by one that each of them will have

1008
03:06:37,000 --> 03:06:41,000
a lot of odds of being alcohol and the racial.

1009
03:06:41,000 --> 03:06:44,000
You know the log of the ratio of the ratio Bill too?

1010
03:06:44,000 --> 03:06:49,000
Well, the difference in the log out of those 2 is the slope.

1011
03:06:49,000 --> 03:06:59,000
Well, you have just like what I did earlier. Right The slope is the logout ratio. therefore the odds ratio with the E to the slope.

1012
03:06:59,000 --> 03:07:08,000
0 point 0 0 8. let's do the math exponential 0 point 0 8.

1013
03:07:08,000 --> 03:07:13,000
That is 1.0, 8, so that's all the ratio.

1014
03:07:13,000 --> 03:07:25,000
This equals 1.0 0, 8 right that's awesome ratio of alcohol

1015
03:07:25,000 --> 03:07:31,000
Or x 2 equals 2 x plus one versus X. 2 equals. X. Right?

1016
03:07:31,000 --> 03:07:36,000
So between 2 individual they they're out of their their their tax rate different by one.

1017
03:07:36,000 --> 03:07:42,000
The odds Ratio of them. between them is 1.0 8.

1018
03:07:42,000 --> 03:08:01,000
So the person with higher via a cigarette hex rate, we'll have slightly higher chance of being a But the difference is 1.0 8 on the ratio scale, and this time we cannot transform this into a

1019
03:08:01,000 --> 03:08:11,000
relative risk. Okay, the relative risk will be a different number. They are the odd racial.

1020
03:08:11,000 --> 03:08:17,000
If you ask me what is the relative risk I can tell you it doesn't have a fixed number.

1021
03:08:17,000 --> 03:08:21,000
So the relative risk between this 2 individual will depend on a particular actual value.

1022
03:08:21,000 --> 03:08:26,000
So particular cigarette has weight. so only the aud ratio is a big amount for the rather risky.

1023
03:08:26,000 --> 03:08:44,000
It's not pixel on these changes according to different next 2 level

1024
03:08:44,000 --> 03:08:59,000
Okay, Any questions, so far.

1025
03:08:59,000 --> 03:09:05,000
And now, let's move on now, we have the interpretation of the indoors. Have the slope.

1026
03:09:05,000 --> 03:09:11,000
See, we have a P. value of 0 point 0 7, 5, which is, you know, nothing.

1027
03:09:11,000 --> 03:09:22,000
They become but close to it, and

1028
03:09:22,000 --> 03:09:27,000
So, although you will still dust in a little bit, but seems like we have like higher power.

1029
03:09:27,000 --> 03:09:29,000
Now, when we analyze the the beer text rate, right?

1030
03:09:29,000 --> 03:09:36,000
Because we have the same data. The Y is the same, for the power must come from X.

1031
03:09:36,000 --> 03:09:45,000
So if you know this previously, the beer tax rate has a very little range from 0 to 2.5%. Right now.

1032
03:09:45,000 --> 03:09:50,000
The cigarette has really has much wider range from 0 to 40%.

1033
03:09:50,000 --> 03:09:54,000
So you have a big or a variety of different X value here.

1034
03:09:54,000 --> 03:10:00,000
So rather than we have more information maybe that's the reason we have more power.

1035
03:10:00,000 --> 03:10:06,000
But we never know for sure.

1036
03:10:06,000 --> 03:10:13,000
Although our key value here is more significant, although still not over the the color point or 5.

1037
03:10:13,000 --> 03:10:19,000
But it's more significant before, but the flow become less secondhand.

1038
03:10:19,000 --> 03:10:23,000
The slope is 0 point 0 0. Previously, although the P.

1039
03:10:23,000 --> 03:10:29,000
Value was large. the slope was a little higher, although also small, but higher.

1040
03:10:29,000 --> 03:10:35,000
Right pen time, I would say 7 times higher. Now the slope we call here right?

1041
03:10:35,000 --> 03:10:39,000
So we got the most We've got a much weaker slow.

1042
03:10:39,000 --> 03:10:45,000
So which means this impact. 5. and the you know p vio they don't go along with each other.

1043
03:10:45,000 --> 03:10:53,000
Remember key by those standards Statistical thing in because the fact size for the slope stands for scientific sticking with us.

1044
03:10:53,000 --> 03:11:02,000
They're not the same thing right? everything else equal larger slope usually give you a smaller key value. but not always when you change your data, anything can happen.

1045
03:11:02,000 --> 03:11:09,000
But in this case we have a more significant key value. Oh, we have a last thing, and it can be back fine.

1046
03:11:09,000 --> 03:11:15,000
And also the fact now is positive. How do you adjust people I don't know.

1047
03:11:15,000 --> 03:11:17,000
People always say, you know, we increase a cigarette tax rate.

1048
03:11:17,000 --> 03:11:25,000
More people will go switch for drinking Now, Maybe but you never know That's just a hypothesis until you run an experimental study.

1049
03:11:25,000 --> 03:11:38,000
You can never be known for sure, at this, data do not really support our heart, because, you know, this key value is actually using everything

1050
03:11:38,000 --> 03:11:47,000
Any questions so far

1051
03:11:47,000 --> 03:11:51,000
Okay, you know, I would try to finish the the lecture today.

1052
03:11:51,000 --> 03:11:56,000
But doesn't matter? I don't have to finish out tomorrow.

1053
03:11:56,000 --> 03:12:09,000
So when we have multiple variable, in the model in the logistical model, everything we learn about compounding and the interaction and the impact modification they carry over that's fine need.

1054
03:12:09,000 --> 03:12:14,000
Your graphic model is the foundation right to all other regression models.

1055
03:12:14,000 --> 03:12:20,000
So now we can include both beer attacks and the cigarette hacks in the model with them.

1056
03:12:20,000 --> 03:12:23,000
This is a multiple logist regression model i've been with them.

1057
03:12:23,000 --> 03:12:32,000
We can also create an interaction model. right? We see that

1058
03:12:32,000 --> 03:12:38,000
Will increase cigarette tax rate the pier, the beer tax rate. Change a little bit.

1059
03:12:38,000 --> 03:12:45,000
Well, i'm on I it's still not significant and this one is still asking, Let me come when increase interaction.

1060
03:12:45,000 --> 03:12:57,000
You know the number also change a little bit. Well, everything is insignificant. so everybody wouldn't run this model, just you know we show them here just for your interest.

1061
03:12:57,000 --> 03:13:07,000
The number always changing, which is always so that's not a surprise

1062
03:13:07,000 --> 03:13:15,000
So so far we have continues predictors, and we know how to interpret that.

1063
03:13:15,000 --> 03:13:20,000
Now suppose our predictor itself is binary, which has actually simpler right.

1064
03:13:20,000 --> 03:13:25,000
If I we have a 3 which is binary, stand here.

1065
03:13:25,000 --> 03:13:30,000
Either mother is alcoholic

1066
03:13:30,000 --> 03:13:50,000
I'm, that we fit a model here you see this is significant. So the whether mother being a alcoholic, this is highly significantly associated with whether the person is alcohol, and then the intercept is that's

1067
03:13:50,000 --> 03:13:59,000
positive, which means they are positively associated. So the question is, what is the interpretation of exponential of the intercept?

1068
03:13:59,000 --> 03:14:03,000
So the intersection is 0 point 5, I mean, it would like 0 point.

1069
03:14:03,000 --> 03:14:06,000
5 is 1 point, 6, 9. What is the interpretation of this number?

1070
03:14:06,000 --> 03:14:10,000
Anyone else try I know it's challenging but it's fun you know.

1071
03:14:10,000 --> 03:14:29,000
Give a shot. Don't worry getting the law and pull it fine

1072
03:14:29,000 --> 03:14:33,000
I think you have to translate it or transform it into probability.

1073
03:14:33,000 --> 03:14:44,000
Hmm! So that would be 1.69 divided by one for P Umhm i'm confused.

1074
03:14:44,000 --> 03:14:56,000
It was something plus Oh, no problem. Yeah, it it was like, Yeah, I forgot the equation. But yeah, I think it's the transition, probably.

1075
03:14:56,000 --> 03:15:03,000
And then that number will well, basically mean that if x 3 is 0.

1076
03:15:03,000 --> 03:15:15,000
So you're mom was not an alcoholic You have percentage chance of being an alcoholic as Well, thank you for trying anybody else.

1077
03:15:15,000 --> 03:15:27,000
Wants to try. Yeah, I think it's all ratio of you having alcoholism when your mom is alcoholic.

1078
03:15:27,000 --> 03:15:33,000
Versus Well, versus your mom was now Stockholic.

1079
03:15:33,000 --> 03:15:46,000
It's 1.6 9. thank you Yeah, the the second answer was, You know it's Carlac, so that because we are dealing with the regression model.

1080
03:15:46,000 --> 03:15:52,000
So everything by the estimate, the interests have the slope will be on a lot of level.

1081
03:15:52,000 --> 03:16:02,000
I'm done. when we exponentiate them we'll be on the odd level in particular. the intersect will be the off and then the slope.

1082
03:16:02,000 --> 03:16:04,000
Why are you in? Take the foundation will be the observation.

1083
03:16:04,000 --> 03:16:11,000
So this thing is an operational. You just need to figure out what kind of odd ratio this card off would be the odd ratio.

1084
03:16:11,000 --> 03:16:21,000
Oh, the group, you know, X 3 equals one versus the group at 3 equals 0. right?

1085
03:16:21,000 --> 03:16:27,000
So basically the group of people, their mother, were alcoholic, and then they have a higher oz.

1086
03:16:27,000 --> 03:16:34,000
Those those group with the mother was not alcohol, and the difference in all, not the different.

1087
03:16:34,000 --> 03:16:42,000
The racial evolve is 1.6 9 so it's 69% higher than you have This do not translate to relative range.

1088
03:16:42,000 --> 03:16:46,000
We don't know the run of the risk we can't translate between us and rest.

1089
03:16:46,000 --> 03:16:55,000
But we cannot translate our ratio and relative risk and risk ratio, because that depend on the baseline risk.

1090
03:16:55,000 --> 03:16:59,000
In this case we can actually figure out around the rest, because we only have 2 level.

1091
03:16:59,000 --> 03:17:03,000
But in general we cannot. yeah to to translate through risk.

1092
03:17:03,000 --> 03:17:07,000
Also we need a study design to be co-host study in in, you know.

1093
03:17:07,000 --> 03:17:11,000
If this is a case control study, we cannot possibly figure out the rest.

1094
03:17:11,000 --> 03:17:21,000
I think I I mentioned that already. Oh, sure! feel aware. Alright.

1095
03:17:21,000 --> 03:17:29,000
So suppose this was the original data, right? Yes, no. for the mother Alcoholic?

1096
03:17:29,000 --> 03:17:35,000
Yes, No, for the children alcohol. This was the data to Fidel, a just reporting model.

1097
03:17:35,000 --> 03:17:43,000
To get this to get this model. No, not this one. Yeah, this model.

1098
03:17:43,000 --> 03:17:47,000
So essentially here. we have now some nice out 9,000 subjects.

1099
03:17:47,000 --> 03:17:54,000
Each one has a binary X. and the binary one i'll feed the logistics.

1100
03:17:54,000 --> 03:18:01,000
We're in a model on this 9 called the subject once it will fit You got this, but they got a slope.

1101
03:18:01,000 --> 03:18:08,000
How you got all the ratio. But remember, you can get the same odds ratio with our video distribution model.

1102
03:18:08,000 --> 03:18:16,000
You simply take the 61 times 8,512, divided by 913 times 336.

1103
03:18:16,000 --> 03:18:21,000
When you do the math, you will see you got the exact same operation, because that's the same.

1104
03:18:21,000 --> 03:18:29,000
All the ratio. Europe after alcohol, right

1105
03:18:29,000 --> 03:18:38,000
And this all the ratio, as I mentioned earlier is unbiased, regardless of whether you'll study design was was cohort or case control.

1106
03:18:38,000 --> 03:18:47,000
All the research is the same

1107
03:18:47,000 --> 03:18:54,000
Any questions so far

1108
03:18:54,000 --> 03:19:00,000
So this is a confirmation. that if we apply Let's just rewrite the model on pull by 2 table.

1109
03:19:00,000 --> 03:19:03,000
We got the same number, same patriarch, same keyword.

1110
03:19:03,000 --> 03:19:12,000
We run sort of a chi-squared path. Your pile will almost be the same to the p value of this line will be this pile.

1111
03:19:12,000 --> 03:19:16,000
I didn't run the pipeline but if I run in.

1112
03:19:16,000 --> 03:19:23,000
I know the provider will be this one technically. there may be slightly different, because they based on different minds, but because they're happening against the same now.

1113
03:19:23,000 --> 03:19:28,000
So they're almost always very, very close to each other Well, I know this.

1114
03:19:28,000 --> 03:19:36,000
All the ratio is like lips. Second, never get it different from one, because the slope is a little different from 0.

1115
03:19:36,000 --> 03:19:47,000
Right. So everything just along alright, that's not move on to some model diagnostics.

1116
03:19:47,000 --> 03:19:52,000
I know what I actually do it. I I probably would just push it over, and tomorrow i'll review a little bit.

1117
03:19:52,000 --> 03:19:57,000
Okay, tomorrow. We may not have time to finish all the exercise, because we still have the time.

1118
03:19:57,000 --> 03:20:04,000
Football, you know. Course evaluation that we need to review the you know the queries number 10 or so long so for oh, that's fine.

1119
03:20:04,000 --> 03:20:11,000
I already share all the and so keys I was all the access to all the projects you have to go over them by yourself.

1120
03:20:11,000 --> 03:20:16,000
If you are interested and nothing is do after tomorrow morning.

1121
03:20:16,000 --> 03:20:25,000
Okay, So remember, you multiple integration model, we had something called R Square which can help us.

1122
03:20:25,000 --> 03:20:29,000
The to me how well the model is right, not by itself, but sometimes usual.

1123
03:20:29,000 --> 03:20:37,000
The R square is always between 0 and one and the higher Bible means bad of all of it, and that's where I really come from.

1124
03:20:37,000 --> 03:20:42,000
The correlation between the predicted value and the and the observer.

1125
03:20:42,000 --> 03:20:46,000
Value, and the hardware always increase when you add more variable to the model. Right?

1126
03:20:46,000 --> 03:20:51,000
So also, of course.

1127
03:20:51,000 --> 03:21:08,000
As myself there's no r square. for logistic ration. because you observe, the wise is finally happily in correlation based on binary value is not impossible. but it's not favorable now with that I still people do

1128
03:21:08,000 --> 03:21:14,000
that they develop some similar version of ours where they call the pseudo-asper for logistic question model.

1129
03:21:14,000 --> 03:21:17,000
They they share some of the property of our square, so you can use them.

1130
03:21:17,000 --> 03:21:29,000
If the software report that what technically that's not the same thing as ours, where so, not everything basically I'm saying, not everything translates, you know, between models, right?

1131
03:21:29,000 --> 03:21:37,000
Nevertheless, there is another need, new statistic that we can use to to measure how well logistic record model is.

1132
03:21:37,000 --> 03:21:46,000
This is unique. 2 binary data. So you know in in continuous data. You can measure R. Square. You can measure other things mean square error in logistical background model.

1133
03:21:46,000 --> 03:21:51,000
You don't have arts go you don't have mean square error anymore, although you can find something similar.

1134
03:21:51,000 --> 03:21:56,000
But there's something unique to logistical model is called a c statistic or something hot.

1135
03:21:56,000 --> 03:22:07,000
Soft is also called a Uc. Well, those who have heard about it this area under the pro, this Aoc or cisco tech is not specific to logistical question.

1136
03:22:07,000 --> 03:22:18,000
Model. it's actually covers all different model where you have a binary outcome

1137
03:22:18,000 --> 03:22:30,000
Okay, So you send me what's going on we have a logistical record model, just like linear graphic model.

1138
03:22:30,000 --> 03:22:42,000
We can plug in any value of the predictor, make prediction on what right in in this case, once we have the value of at x one, we have computer logic of P.

1139
03:22:42,000 --> 03:22:46,000
Once we have the log in the P. we can compute the P.

1140
03:22:46,000 --> 03:22:52,000
Hat use this model. This is basically the the off, the P. divided by one plus the other. P.

1141
03:22:52,000 --> 03:22:56,000
That will be the P. hat. So plugin X one.

1142
03:22:56,000 --> 03:22:59,000
Using this comic formula, we can get a key hat.

1143
03:22:59,000 --> 03:23:05,000
Oh, Annie, absorbable! I observe this is the way to predict.

1144
03:23:05,000 --> 03:23:12,000
Once we got a pee hat. you have Mega prediction, or what? Because why?

1145
03:23:12,000 --> 03:23:15,000
If Pee had just the expected value, why, why itself is 0 1?

1146
03:23:15,000 --> 03:23:23,000
You still have to make a decision whether the classified people as one group of on the other, a typical way of simply put a cut off right.

1147
03:23:23,000 --> 03:23:29,000
If the P. had is larger than something you classify that person as a alcoholic versus, not at the hollow.

1148
03:23:29,000 --> 03:23:34,000
There's a call out you can pick and there you can make type on it.

1149
03:23:34,000 --> 03:23:45,000
Have 2 errors here. This is not a pipeline and have to error for the for the multiple testing, but rather the prediction, because there's a 2, one is 0 one, and there's a predictive one of 0

1150
03:23:45,000 --> 03:23:48,000
one why you have this. You can make both title error.

1151
03:23:48,000 --> 03:23:52,000
Right again. this proof type of type, 2 error. They go against each other.

1152
03:23:52,000 --> 03:24:02,000
Usually people use so far the so-called sensitivity and the specificity, and classify this, or sometimes use the true part of 2 negative grid.

1153
03:24:02,000 --> 03:24:08,000
One thing. When you predict the p hat, you use a cut off to predict why, and you make 2 type error.

1154
03:24:08,000 --> 03:24:14,000
And then there are some of the alcoholics will be correctly classified.

1155
03:24:14,000 --> 03:24:23,000
Some of will be incorrectly classified. I will try to quantify how well your model predicts.

1156
03:24:23,000 --> 03:24:28,000
I think i'm going to stop here I have a few slides probably about Aoc.

1157
03:24:28,000 --> 03:24:36,000
I'm gonna continue I finish that tomorrow morning what about 10 min and then we do the force evaluation.

1158
03:24:36,000 --> 03:24:39,000
And then, you know, review the quiz from lecture 10, and so on, and so forth.

1159
03:24:39,000 --> 03:24:44,000
And then we pick the rest of time tomorrow to do the exercise and the quiz for lecture.
