00:00:02,679 --> 00:00:04,359
Hi, my name is Emily Youatt and

2
00:00:04,359 --> 00:00:08,563
I'm a clinical assistant professor in
the Department of Health Behavior and

3
00:00:08,563 --> 00:00:12,590
Health Education here at
the University of Michigan.

4
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:16,680
Today I'm going to talk about health
behavior or health behaviors, and

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,710
how our individual health behaviors
influence population level health.

6
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:24,310
What do I mean by health behaviors?

7
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:29,470
When I say health behavior I mean any
action taken by a person to maintain or

8
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:34,410
regain good health, or
to prevent illness or harm.

9
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,430
Often when people think
about health behaviors,

10
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:39,380
we think about the every
day choices people make.

11
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:42,820
What we eat, drink, how much we move, or

12
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:48,719
what risks people choose to take or
to avoid.

13
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,859
So in this lecture I'm going to address
why individual health behaviors matter,

14
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:56,630
or how they contribute to
broader public health trends.

15
00:00:56,630 --> 00:01:00,050
Then I want to spend some time thinking
about the reasons people engage in

16
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:01,850
unhealthy behaviors.

17
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:05,440
Why do people do things or act in
ways that they know may harm them or

18
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,250
make them sick?

19
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:10,770
After that I want to introduce
you to a model or a framework for

20
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,270
thinking about unhealthy behaviors and

21
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:18,880
how there are many different factors
that contribute to any health behavior.

22
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,520
Following that I'm going to dig a little
deeper and explore some of the major

23
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:27,610
health behavior decisions and associated
health conditions that have significantly

24
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:32,098
contributed to poor health and
premature death at the population level.

25
00:01:32,098 --> 00:01:36,410
In the penultimate segment I will discuss
how the stress people experience in their

26
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:39,910
daily lives may influence their health and
well being.

27
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:44,459
And finally I'll summarize for
you what research evidence suggests is

28
00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:49,478
the most effective way to encourage
people to change their health behaviors.

29
00:01:49,478 --> 00:01:53,630
First, let's quickly review the importance
of health behaviors to the broader picture

30
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:58,730
of the public's health.

31
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:02,320
So you've seen this information
presented in a previous lecture in

32
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,430
a slightly different format.

33
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,350
And the bottom line is this.

34
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:11,070
When we look at the causes or the factors
that contribute to premature mortality or

35
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:15,450
avoidable early death,
we see the individual behaviors

36
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:19,180
can be linked to about half
of those premature deaths.

37
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:23,270
Said a little different way, if we want
to think about prolonging life, and

38
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:28,180
specifically about prolonging healthy
life, there is consensus among

39
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:32,950
all of the major public health agencies,
the Centers for Disease Control,

40
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:36,830
the Public Health Service, and
the National Academies of Medicine.

41
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:42,560
That what we need to do is to focus our
efforts on improving health behaviors,

42
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,010
not to say that we should
ignore those other areas.

43
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:48,950
Certainly we need to continue
to explore how genetics

44
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:51,200
contribute to our overall health.

45
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,730
We need to invest in strategies to
maintain a healthy physical environment

46
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:59,700
and to improve both physical and
social environments.

47
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,170
An additional healthcare, or

48
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:06,590
new medical advancements and technologies,
will prolong life for some individuals.

49
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,390
All of these factors matter, but

50
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:12,380
the greatest opportunity, or
the biggest bang for our buck

51
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:19,150
lies in improving the actions people
take to maintain their own good health.

52
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:23,090
So how does that knowledge of the
importance of improving health behaviors

53
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:25,890
align with healthcare expenditures?

54
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:27,858
Well, see for yourselves, pretty terribly.

55
00:03:27,858 --> 00:03:31,040
Currently about 88% of health care

56
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,510
expenditures are spent
on medical services.

57
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:40,280
While a paltry 4% of funds are dedicated
to efforts to improve health behavior.

58
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,575
So this is Is an instance where scientific
knowledge about what would be best for

59
00:03:44,575 --> 00:03:50,535
improving health at a population level
is not driving how we spend as a nation.

60
00:03:50,535 --> 00:03:53,905
There are a number of good reasons for
this mismatch.

61
00:03:53,905 --> 00:03:57,841
And I hope you'll spend some time on your
own, or in your discussion sections,

62
00:03:57,841 --> 00:04:05,500
thinking about some of the reasons for
this disconnect.
