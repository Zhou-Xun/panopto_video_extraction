1
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:32,890
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

2
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:38,530
I know, I know.

3
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:44,530
I don't know how many.

4
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:01,380
Well, now I know.

5
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:13,150
I suppose that's good. You know, I know you guys got energy and I was like, Let me bring some.

6
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:24,040
And you did that. So what you have been passed around is the a tendency and two bags of candy, one's chocolate ones, just non chocolate.

7
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:30,040
I thought about those that that may not like chocolate.

8
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:34,390
So doing something, find your own flavor out of the bag. So please find a tendency,

9
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:46,870
grab some candy and when last person's done these in your bags down here so you having my dad is like you should work, has to do class.

10
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:52,900
And I'm like, no, no, no. The best thing is that is like a tiger slayer or tamer.

11
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:57,070
I don't want to kill animals. I mean, unequaled ever so tamer.

12
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:01,030
That's why I'm doing a little leopard print money. Shoot. Well, all I got.

13
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:05,350
But for Halloween, I will be a red Eminem. Oh, okay.

14
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,280
So that's that's been a tradition of mine is to be ready.

15
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:17,230
So I hope you can enjoy working out this weekend because I know it's a amazing it's a very big game.

16
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:26,250
So it's MSU University of Michigan and so I will do you guys are going to be partaking in some fun stuff.

17
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:35,560
You're having a good Halloween weekend. So having said that, what I have on the screen is just something fun.

18
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:45,820
And that's I was trying to get a bigger. But I'm wondering if any of those resonate with you from from your younger days.

19
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:50,740
The Simon says is at the bottom battleship is to the left.

20
00:02:51,080 --> 00:03:00,700
Another one's a little game the Tamagotchi that what have you your teammates your teammates classmates virtual have already weighed in.

21
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:08,980
So what I want to do is ask you a question, each of you, is there anything up there that you resonate with?

22
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:13,870
And if not, what is your favorite hot beverage?

23
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:21,459
There's nothing to fear that resonates with you. You can answer the question, what is your favorite beverage attendant?

24
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:24,550
She's going around candy bags to going around. Let's get it going.

25
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:29,140
Oh, I never went to school connected.

26
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:37,450
All right. For those walking in, there's a tendency and a and it a candidate to next for you so I anything resonate with you up there?

27
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:42,160
If not, what is your favorite? Yeah. You got a big beverage going on right now, but what is your favorite hot beverage?

28
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:47,290
Oh, yeah, I like.

29
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:51,790
I like to drink. He liked my grades.

30
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:56,100
He liked it. Oh, yeah, that's good. That's good. Yeah, I like it.

31
00:03:56,110 --> 00:04:04,959
Hot chocolate with the cream. I just throw Alexander tea with any hot tea with honey.

32
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:11,080
So none of that resonates. Tamagotchi was oh oh this if I were going to be I have a coming out to you.

33
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:19,970
I think it's the light behind you guys in the road.

34
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:26,030
Anything resonate with you? If not? What is your favorite hot beverage? I feel like.

35
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:30,050
Oh, yeah, okay. Makes me feel.

36
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,710
I need to say yes behind you.

37
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:37,930
You had a Tamagotchi, right?

38
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:43,009
Right. You know these things, they're still alive with my mind are still alive when they're not my mother.

39
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:46,280
My kids are like they love them. Yeah. Anyway. Okay.

40
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:57,680
Yes. I always want them to have never let me so very excited about that.

41
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:02,569
But I distinctly remember going yes to for Christmas when I was like five.

42
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:14,990
And you kind of shared with my brother and I got to grad game and he got the car and my mother got a hot, hot toddy on a cold day.

43
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:21,380
You're only 21. I'm going to ask, what's the alcohol with your toddy?

44
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:28,610
Always awesome. Okay. Tamagotchi had kind of and I'll actually just got it.

45
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:36,530
Got it on my last year, but I think that looks like it is.

46
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:42,179
Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Yes, it is. Yeah. Thanks to those in attendance.

47
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:49,819
Thank you. Okay. I definitely had to talk about the year and I took really good care of it.

48
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:56,030
And then one morning I woke up the heat and it had just run away. I like strictly at all I.

49
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:04,340
I had a life for over a year of. She knew exactly what it felt as moving into me.

50
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:08,180
Okay. Jasmine. Jasmine?

51
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,310
Yes. I talked to the staple of the household.

52
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:15,810
That's what staple love. All that you got.

53
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,220
Oh, I see. I see.

54
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:26,560
I see. I see. I see. Okay. You don't have a high coverage state of shock me.

55
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:31,020
See what my body was like.

56
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:35,930
Yeah, but Jasmine. Yeah, I had some tamagotchis.

57
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:39,000
Pink, yellow, blue examples. Endless. Good, good.

58
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:44,660
Okay, very good. Yeah, I like to play my brother's X-Box.

59
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:49,040
He's great time. He did not like me playing his games, but anyways.

60
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:52,520
Yeah, six brothers here. I get it. Okay, I think.

61
00:06:53,090 --> 00:07:08,060
Oh, my God. Oh, gosh, I wish I knew where it was. Like I heard t but what was the flavor in the chemical.

62
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,440
Okay, three got three.

63
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:21,530
And even then I had a Tamagotchi tamagotchi feed blue, yellow, green goes blue and pickles blue tamagotchi pink tamagotchi love all that.

64
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,550
He got something Tamagotchi. I have to have a kid.

65
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:34,219
I had to have I got you do not like I like this little child.

66
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:38,720
I think they're nice. Very nice. I like coffee.

67
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:46,700
Okay. I think serve too. Sugar ice cream. Just like peppermint.

68
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:55,730
Yeah. I also like I wanted to talk about games, but I think that's very good.

69
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:59,680
I do not consider it a game.

70
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:07,250
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I saw that. I was going to say my favorite however.

71
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:14,780
Express I'm very glad you are. Like I had a blue Tamagotchi.

72
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:19,010
Blue Tamagotchi I had a Gamecube and Gamecube.

73
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,750
You know, it's like a Nintendo.

74
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:27,229
Like it's like an Xbox that smaller. It's like a literal like you. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

75
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:33,730
Okay. I had to think about what you were saying. It was like you just did it.

76
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:37,270
I had to do to see that. Really great.

77
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:46,640
Yeah. Peppermint mode that you can, you know, right?

78
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:55,760
Yeah. All right. I thought I did you I feel like favorite hot beverage and they're and again so if this is anything up there resonating with you,

79
00:08:56,390 --> 00:09:02,629
if not, what is your favorite hot beverage? I do see that it's on the gadgets and I had never understood how to use them.

80
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:11,540
So my husband died or anywhere, you know, so so they lay the little eggs in the whole thing and it just seemed to go straight.

81
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:21,120
Okay. Very good. And so your classmates are basically saying they found as they came out, the new version is not as cheap anymore.

82
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:29,130
I think, Andrew, you're talking about Tamagotchis. And then I also Tamagotchi was her favorite as well.

83
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:36,479
So again, there is no that that has anything up there resonate with you?

84
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:45,490
If not, what was your favorite cat, those burgers or do you see anything that reminds you of things you played with when you were young?

85
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:52,580
Know. Okay, so what's your favorite have both of these.

86
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:57,700
It doesn't agree with you doesn't green tea and just. Oh, okay.

87
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:02,150
There isn't a tendency just repeating myself and there's candy bags going around.

88
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,049
So for the candidates, then just bring them back down here and stop cheering.

89
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:14,610
And it's still terrible for you as well, is it shares for you differently?

90
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:29,740
I would say it's just some presentations.

91
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:38,580
I'm not drinking or what I'm doing, but you know, it's your screen.

92
00:10:42,280 --> 00:11:04,320
It's like it's just so it seems like, all right, everybody get a piece of the candidate.

93
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:11,070
Cool stuff. All right. If not the dum dums are the dum dums arresting somewhere.

94
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:24,030
You've got the bag of dum dum and you want to share around if you need otherwise.

95
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:29,220
I mean, name, I'd say to sympathize. Thanks very much.

96
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:34,500
All right, kids. On Monday will thank you for stop by the house for what was left.

97
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:45,420
This was made 22 years ago by my daughters, travels with me and my kids.

98
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:51,640
So why are we talking about stakeholder management?

99
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:59,410
We've talked about a lot of things when it comes to human resources and human resources in health care and public health's influence.

100
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:06,160
But it's really the work that you're doing. But I'm really wanting to resonate with you today,

101
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:13,720
with you talking about the science and the arts of who you will be and how you will go forward as the next public health leaders.

102
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:17,270
And it's going to be really, really, really, really important that, you know,

103
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:23,079
hopefully I leave you with some tools today about people that weigh in and people you

104
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:29,440
need to be thoughtful about being a specific human resource point for an employer,

105
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:38,770
trying to let you be as thoughtful as you can be around the work that you're doing and how it impacts the humans that you're you're connecting with.

106
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:52,299
So today, just understanding when you're working on multiple projects, when you're working on multiple initiatives,

107
00:12:52,300 --> 00:13:00,380
when you're giving something as a program or an effort that somebody wants you to have as a deliverable.

108
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:05,690
Thinking about the whole picture, stepping back and looking at the whole picture of what it is you're doing.

109
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:13,300
So today, understanding how initiatives are supported, thinking a little bit larger than it's just mine and I have to do it.

110
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:23,050
Understanding how do you value it? Stakeholders understanding the different levels of stakeholders and steps in a stakeholder management plan.

111
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:30,220
We talked about human resource management plans, but this one is more akin to those that you are engaged in.

112
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,540
And I'm going to do what?

113
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:40,839
I'm going to try to reference a lot about the COVID work that you have them specifically my work and what we were doing in the last two,

114
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:50,800
two and a half years and how this played a key role with human resources and other executive players as we move forward.

115
00:13:51,490 --> 00:14:03,430
And so when you think about a project or what's taught in a certification class around project management, they tell you to think about the roles.

116
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:10,660
You definitely want to think about the role you play, but there are other roles within what you do and what you touch.

117
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:21,220
And of course, you know, if you're an employer, some of the roles in in a project could be the employee that's your customer or a vendor,

118
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:31,390
the initiative sponsors who's actually ultimately accountable for the work that is happening within a project.

119
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:35,320
Stakeholders and business owners, which will we'll get into a little bit more here.

120
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:39,040
Program managers, project team committee and subject matter experts.

121
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:48,730
Those are just some of the roles that can play in how you can deliver a very successful project program,

122
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:54,280
opportunity, event or presentation about what it is you would like to have supported.

123
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:57,610
Because you've thought it through. You've thought it through.

124
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:03,920
And I really like a great English accent.

125
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:18,999
So I found this particular video that comes from a number of individuals who and it's not going to stop because it's not literally moving forward.

126
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,430
You're not seeing it because.

127
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,810
She says she should have gone straight to it.

128
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:37,530
Probably going straight to it for those online. It's not showing here.

129
00:15:37,530 --> 00:16:02,370
So that's. It's just really a group of individuals supporting, in fact, around what they've been working on from the international level.

130
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:18,300
And you hear that language trying to move forward with games and not to make fun of the U.S. in the past.

131
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:27,600
I think what's happening is that we share screen, share the same screen.

132
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:43,630
Start. The volume of people in my body is just like nothing.

133
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:52,530
And of course, one of your stakeholders or myself, seven people might go to project management to really understand your stakeholders.

134
00:16:52,920 --> 00:17:00,210
For me, projects are delivered by three or four people. So while Change Methodology Project Plan sounds like residential.

135
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:04,180
It's all about stakeholder engagements and building trust.

136
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:14,230
That is the Golden Rule. The Golden Rule is early. Stakeholder management continue to maintain the Golden Rule for successful project management

137
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:19,350
to make sure that all stakeholders engaged and that you understand all the requirements.

138
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:24,749
I think after after many years working on projects across all industries, knowing your stakeholders,

139
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:31,380
getting to know more, they expressed priorities and preferences pretty important, especially as early as possible.

140
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:41,340
So. I learned early on and sort of a fun thing to do that when you want to deliver something, some,

141
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:45,659
some sometimes it's best delivered in a different dialect, different tone, different way.

142
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:53,540
And I've heard that the English, when they're delivering it, we seem to tone into trying to really understand what they're saying.

143
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:54,870
So I went and found this one,

144
00:17:54,870 --> 00:18:03,630
but it's still a standard golden rule to understand and get get engaged quick with your stakeholders and what it is you're doing.

145
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:08,130
So I want to share and get back to the presentation.

146
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,830
So I think, you know.

147
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:22,330
Andrew, can you give me a thumbs up if you're seeing that on the screen? I can.

148
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:43,090
This moves so far ahead.

149
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:49,690
Steel So wanting to move into stakeholders.

150
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:58,990
How do you know if you have the appropriate? How do you know if you have the appropriate initiatives, support and stakeholders involved?

151
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:08,250
So really looking at some of the definitions and when we think about stakeholders, most of the time it goes to the for profit industry of.

152
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:14,650
You know, you've got your investors and they're stakeholders in the business. You want to make profit for them and that that is true.

153
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,950
But when it comes down to the level of work that we do,

154
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:22,299
we really want to be a little bit more thoughtful about who is engaged in the work that we're doing.

155
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,810
So we have to we can, like I said, deliver the best product that we can.

156
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:31,690
And thinking about it from a health care perspective or an employer perspective, the stakeholder or business owner,

157
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:37,060
it's people or groups who have an interest influence in the outcome of the initiative.

158
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:42,909
Normally, stakeholders are from within the company, but many include suppliers, investors,

159
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:50,290
end users, community groups and government organizations and plan stakeholder management.

160
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:56,890
It's there will be times in which someone who's a subject matter expert or someone who

161
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:03,070
wasn't really tied to an initiative or program that you can come come swoops in and.

162
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,260
Sorry. Dropped a little bomb on your project and you're like, I didn't think about that person.

163
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:14,490
I didn't think about including them. I should have included them because something could have gone forward in a,

164
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:19,209
in a more efficient way, if possible, and so planned for stakeholder management,

165
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:27,280
the process of developing appropriate management strategies to effectively engage the stakeholders throughout the lifecycle or whatever.

166
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:34,479
You're trying to deliver an initiative based on the analysis of their needs, not yours interests and potential impact on the initiative.

167
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,969
Success. This probably starts to resonate.

168
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:43,280
If you had some projects over the summer and watching your leaders work through some of their projects,

169
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:49,189
or you're working on them and they're telling you to go meet with, go sit with, go, understand, go, survey, go.

170
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:55,520
Bring forth, go. Give all that thoughtful leader.

171
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:01,930
Planning for stakeholders. Planning, actually, for challenges and barriers.

172
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:09,090
Hearing information and feedback. There's four steps in planning.

173
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:16,210
Identifying, planning, managing and controlling it will be very important.

174
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:23,470
But tools I'm putting forth to you today can be completed in a very formalized way.

175
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:29,320
Or you can just start to put them in your informal thought process around.

176
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:36,639
When I do something, I need to identify stakeholders and try to identify people by name and title the people,

177
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,720
the groups and organizations that have significant influence on what you're doing.

178
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:46,600
Direction and success. Or who are significantly impacted by the initial plan by what it is you're doing.

179
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:55,210
Plan stakeholder management. This is the strategy and mechanisms and we're going to go through each of these through through the class today.

180
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:59,800
But the strategies and mechanisms that will be used to achieve the greatest support.

181
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:07,020
To achieve the greatest support. I can't even I.

182
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:15,129
I paused because that's that's I've seen many a project move forward or fail because they're just

183
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:20,950
we just did not go forward to gather the greatest support of stakeholders and minimize resistance,

184
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:30,280
manage stakeholder engagement, the process and steps that will undertake or carry out the plan strategies that you have.

185
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:33,970
Controlling the stakeholder engagement.

186
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:37,450
Controlling the stakeholder engagement. How can you control somebody?

187
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:41,980
Right. You think about that. I can't control what the finance going does.

188
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:45,969
I can't control what the physicians do. I can't control with Amato's.

189
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:47,860
I can't control such a such.

190
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:55,030
Describe the methods that will be used to monitor stakeholder engagement and alert the project team if problems are surfacing.

191
00:22:55,030 --> 00:23:00,430
Identifying, planning, managing and controlling.

192
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:08,370
Oftentimes when we receive an initiative or a program and we're trying to do our best, we just want to deliver it.

193
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:13,270
As in the previous slide deck. Don't jump to number five.

194
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:19,810
You step back. Think about it. Think about what it is you do going forward.

195
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:27,250
Want to make sure there's a number and channel and make sure that. I think it's still the same slide.

196
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:34,420
Okay. Sorry about that. Are you guys seeing the slide deck move, Andrea?

197
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:37,720
And for anybody? I'm okay.

198
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:41,260
Thank you. And I was reading in chat. It seems like it was stuck on the same slide.

199
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:52,969
Okay. Thank you. So when we're talking about identifying stakeholders, what do you what are you asking yourself?

200
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:59,420
What should you be asking yourself? And that was a little naive to how we learn just because change is scary.

201
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:03,410
You're used to going through your normal way of operating.

202
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:07,670
You know, you get in a job, you know, meet some people,

203
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:16,940
find out what the culture is and the climate oriented very well thinking about, you know, how you dealing with human resources,

204
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:22,760
but now your project's a little bit bigger and it's you and you really have to think about identifying

205
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:26,450
people that are going to be working and engaging in something that's going to help you deliver.

206
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:30,260
Will the person the questions that you want to ask yourself.

207
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:36,690
Will the person or organization be directly or indirectly affected by this initiative?

208
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:44,600
Does the person or organization hold a position from which they can influence the initiative?

209
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:50,210
And so I'm going to pause for a minute and just say, yes, all of these questions.

210
00:24:51,860 --> 00:25:01,730
When COVID hit and we had to figure things out, we had to really understand who and where and what were our stakeholders?

211
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,710
What did that look like? What could that have look like?

212
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:07,220
What are the possibilities?

213
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:15,740
Who in the organization should be directly or would be directly or indirectly affected by this, by what we were doing and putting in place everybody?

214
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,630
That's what it felt like.

215
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:28,850
So exactly what we were everybody associate with University of Michigan, whether that was on campus, off campus, remote in remote places of the world.

216
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:35,329
We were really thinking about our stakeholders that just wasn't residence halls and think far

217
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:41,540
and wide about that and who held a position from which they could influence the initiative.

218
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,600
Right. Questions we had to ask.

219
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:52,720
Now the question you ask, does the person or organization have an impact on the initiatives, resources, material, personnel, funding?

220
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:58,100
Was our stakeholder, the government in any way.

221
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:07,400
Giving us rules, Dr. Fauci, and others giving us rules on who can influence what we could and could not do, giving us funding, no funding.

222
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:11,330
So we thought about the federal government in any way as a stakeholder.

223
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:18,170
Does the person or their organization have any special skills or capabilities the initiative will require?

224
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:28,480
Does the person or organization potentially benefit from the initiative or are they in a position to resist this change?

225
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,370
Think about something that you're trying to put forward.

226
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:38,999
It's not just your employee that you're trying to gain engagement from or it's not just the finance budget guy,

227
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:49,620
but who else could possibly resist what you're doing and how will you go about engaging with them so that you can deliver the best?

228
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:57,319
The initiative that you can. At what point does the person have the greatest impact on the initiative?

229
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:02,870
When you're thinking about others and you're including them and you're engaging them and you're trying to identify who they are.

230
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:07,310
Will this person have the greatest impact on the initiative regions?

231
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:17,160
Possibly for us. When we were doing Cove, it could have had a major impact on trying to keep a lot of people engaged and identified early on.

232
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:21,290
It's the prep work that you do. Identifying is the prep work that you do.

233
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:28,880
When you think about something that was given to you, it'll be beyond these classes when you're in your career.

234
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:37,460
But I'm asking you to really think about those and influence the work that you do and how are you engaging them and how are you identifying them?

235
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:41,150
Why do they matter? What can they do? What can they not do?

236
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:45,080
So you're fresh in an organization. How are you even going to find that out?

237
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:50,030
There might be Sallie Mae and Jim, Joe and Todd waiting in the wings for you,

238
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:56,510
and they're going to resist anything that you do because they've been there 15 years and you just got there.

239
00:27:57,530 --> 00:28:01,910
How do you how do you find those people, that hub? What does that even look like for you?

240
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:09,830
You're humming along, playing a presentation and going into a meeting, and you have had no prep on the prep.

241
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:16,520
Identify anybody and you're doing your thing. And all of a sudden, the meeting turned a horrible, horrible.

242
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:22,760
Does anybody then in one of the did anybody experience a bad meeting with their leader?

243
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:29,730
Hands. I don't know who it was. You don't need to tell them.

244
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:33,660
I just want to know if you were in a meeting where it went horribly wrong for them.

245
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:40,490
I don't say horrible, but the outcome just wasn't it just wasn't as efficient as it could be.

246
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:45,739
Sometimes it's really thinking about all the aspects of what they were trying

247
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:50,240
to deliver the outcome and who needed to know the prep before the meeting.

248
00:28:51,820 --> 00:29:02,810
The work that you want to do. So I put this map up there.

249
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:11,149
Moving away from that part of a part of the responsibility that I had was working with university, the University of Venice,

250
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:18,200
which you've always seen that infographic that I was put up to 51,000 and this many people in this many claims and such, etc.

251
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:23,390
What's behind when I ask you if you have bennies, you've got a benefit program,

252
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:28,670
you go into a you actually go into an organization and they offer you benefits.

253
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:32,300
How did they develop that? Where did that come from?

254
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:37,220
Why does that matter? Who said that's what I should be offering you?

255
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:50,030
Well, our benefit administration office, which is the little bubble on the far left, uses this particular diagram to get tons of feedback,

256
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:57,860
tons and tons of feedback we hear from our executive vice presidents on our policies.

257
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,780
That's a regular cadence in a meeting.

258
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:08,840
We have what we consider I think that is in that in that which is the medical benefits advisory committee has people

259
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:16,970
from all over the university engage to look at certain specific areas of the benefits and healthy advisory committee.

260
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:26,990
Those are usually on the other end. Medication Therapy Management, MTM Integrated Disability Advisory Committee Committee.

261
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:38,900
Integrated Disability Coordinating Committee. Last Monday, it was important for us to pull together the idmc to talk and be ready for long COVID.

262
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:50,720
Why? Why, why do we need to pull together people to talk about long COVID in our benefits program?

263
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:57,650
What do you think we would be offering? You're familiar with Mongolian?

264
00:30:57,830 --> 00:31:05,990
Is that a foreign top, a foreign something for you? And are we familiar with one common resident who's familiar with long COVID?

265
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:15,530
Right. Okay. So it's the symptoms by which that are lingering and to a degree we'll continue on the suffering scale,

266
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:19,880
really impair you from doing the work that you need to do, whether mentally or physically.

267
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:23,720
And we have a lot of experts and a lot of money researching this,

268
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:30,680
but from a stakeholder bringing together an integrated disability management committee

269
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:40,220
because we had everybody from legal to risk man to work connections to our psychiatrist,

270
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:44,840
to our nurses, to our our social workers.

271
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:48,290
It was 40 people coming together to talk about long COVID.

272
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:54,440
Because we have to address our policy as it exists today. They're stakeholders.

273
00:31:54,710 --> 00:32:01,770
And if we change a policy, what's going to happen to the employees and to those that are serving those in the long term,

274
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:11,030
that they're stakeholders, they are absolute stakeholders looking at, you know, you heard me say that we gave those 80 hours for long COVID.

275
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:17,390
So now I just take them away and don't tell the stakeholders that we're taking them away.

276
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:25,340
We should be talking about that. Another group that's involved in the benefit designs is expert committees that

277
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:29,540
need to spin off and do deeper dove work for a high deductible health plan,

278
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:39,400
if that's something we wanted to do. A benefits financial policy group which whereby we have principles that we found what we do.

279
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:45,230
And so the financial group looks at the pros and cons of the decisions we make.

280
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:52,130
Population health strategy. Look at that. Population health spread, as you've heard me talk about that a million times.

281
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:57,970
Benefit sits in our stakeholder benefit lead team.

282
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:06,010
Those those are individuals right now in this organization who are one person removed from the executive vice president.

283
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:13,859
So for Michigan medicine, it's like a kind of read a deep a different for campus it's just different individuals

284
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:18,600
but bringing together those stakeholders to understand the movements that we make.

285
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:25,510
In benefits is important and to have their input in what it is we do as stakeholders.

286
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:33,910
Our benefits department could consult with so many on the outside, basically say that we benchmark and we've done our work.

287
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:41,079
We we feel we've got justification and ignore all of the experts that we have

288
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:46,010
in-house to help build a benefit program that we will offer through H.R.,

289
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:52,090
through a recruitment tool. That's how that works as a stakeholder and getting them engaged.

290
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:57,640
PBAC Pharmacy Benefit Advisory Committee. Tons.

291
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:05,250
Of meetings. Socialization. Understanding of what it is we're doing from stakeholders.

292
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:10,200
Stakeholder roles. Plan for stakeholder management.

293
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:17,680
It's it's what you're trying to do is provide a clear and actionable plan for those you want to engage in.

294
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:21,479
So there's identify and planning, right. That is going to be managing and control.

295
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:25,590
And so right now we're talking about planning, looking at again,

296
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:31,770
you can do this formally or you can think this through in your in in your place, in space that works for you.

297
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:39,540
But looking at how do you want to interact with the projects, take measures to support the projects or initiatives interests.

298
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:44,879
So here's some examples. Rate in certain quadrants, who who is a stakeholder?

299
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:50,280
We need to meet their needs. Who's a key player, who's low priority?

300
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:56,370
Who do I just need to keep informed when you're doing a project and it's going to be impactful to a unit,

301
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:03,809
to a to an employer, you need to know, okay, it's not put somebody aside because they're low priority.

302
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:08,970
It's just they do not need as much engagement from you as as necessary.

303
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:19,440
Watch for shifts. People actually get promoted and that person you get those low priority may very well be promoted.

304
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,500
And now we'll need more additional information to get on board them.

305
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:28,470
So when we looked at COVID, well, help.

306
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:36,470
This was one of the things we put together of trying to understand our stakeholders and trying to manage with them.

307
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:42,710
Who was level one, who was level two, who was level three, and what that looked like when we received a confirmed event?

308
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:48,050
Let's just say there was a cluster of 100 people in marketing and we received that.

309
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:53,000
How do we notify Washtenaw County Health Department?

310
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:58,370
What does UHC need to do as a stakeholder and who's informed?

311
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:03,100
Dean of Students Notifying Environmental Health Services.

312
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:10,170
It was really trying to clearly map out so people are leaders didn't say, I have no idea what to do with this.

313
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:19,820
You in your initiatives, you in your world should always think about the plan for somebody that's coming in to what it is,

314
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:27,500
who's going to weigh or influence what you do. Making persona your answering the question for them that they know how to engage with you.

315
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:31,100
And it's not one of those. I, I don't know what to do.

316
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:35,110
We don't know what to do in 100 cases in monthly.

317
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:38,210
What do we do? Clearly defining it.

318
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:43,460
Whatever your initiative or your project is, defining how you want people to engage with you is important.

319
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:44,960
So who is level one?

320
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:53,270
Who's level two from an implementation action plan and notifying different operational leaders and who is going to be responsible for that?

321
00:36:53,270 --> 00:37:01,550
And what did that look like? Because ultimately, those individuals who were 100 positive cases also needed to know A, stakeholders what to do.

322
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:20,170
You can see this. Identifying, planning, managing.

323
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:21,910
So.

324
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:32,070
Things to ask when you're managing and you've heard me kind of say it a little bit already, is that who's going to be unaware of what you're doing?

325
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:37,350
Given your you and your boss, you've been given this project, it's going to impact probably 500 people in the company.

326
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:42,930
Who's going to be unaware, right? It's going to be the 500 people in the company because only you and your boss know that this

327
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:45,930
initiative is coming down from the president and that's what you're going to be doing,

328
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:48,810
or you're going down from a position leader and that's what's happening.

329
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:57,360
Who's going to be unaware, who might be resistant to what you're doing, who might be neutral, where the initiative,

330
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:01,889
but neither supportive or nor resistant, who's going to be supportive and who's going to lead?

331
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:05,610
Who's going to be your champion? You're early. You're you're early.

332
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:14,530
Engage your I call them so. Thinking about this from a covert standpoint.

333
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:26,260
I brought the ball back to science thinking about masking and I appreciate those that have taking the opportunity mask I think you.

334
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:34,980
Was never really. Masking more vaccinations.

335
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:45,130
I'll do both of those. Masking at some point became the not recommendation requirement on campus.

336
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:53,230
Vaccinations became not the recommendation, not the requirement, but the policy.

337
00:38:55,780 --> 00:39:04,760
So in its development, let's just put ourselves in January 2021, wherever you were.

338
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:09,850
That was the time when vaccines started to become available.

339
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:14,050
That's when masking was being asked.

340
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:21,310
We were really thinking about the huge engagement of an in-person semester from January 2021.

341
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:28,180
So I'm just curious. Before we implemented that and it's gone.

342
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:34,450
I know it's got to be an easy answer to who would have been unaware that these policies were coming down the pipeline.

343
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:43,500
Yeah. I heard a mother who said it was like leadership will know.

344
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:46,860
And like, at least in my case, when you were in the city,

345
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:53,910
it was like the emergency team that kind of was tracking or monitoring what the California state was saying.

346
00:39:54,840 --> 00:40:01,380
And then it was up to the health officer to, I guess, make the final decision and then.

347
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:05,840
Trickled that down, too, but nobody knew that was coming.

348
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:12,830
Right. We were just sort of listening to the news, engaging in what we think was the right public health measures.

349
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:21,560
And then, boom, we got we got information from CDC and a policy from from local government, from the state, from the federal saying.

350
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:27,740
We would recommend that you mandate a vaccine, but no one was.

351
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:34,100
Students were not aware. Employees were not aware that this was coming.

352
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:40,160
Even some leadership and management, as many people as we tried to engage hundreds of leaders.

353
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:46,460
Still, there were leaders that were unaware who would have been resistant to a vaccine.

354
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:58,730
A lot of you know, I'm going this son who would have been resistant to a vaccine in a mask.

355
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:11,330
Aware that the state has stated because at the time I think it was Governor Whitman who said that we should Max,

356
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:18,010
we should have vaccine resistant to the changes and impact the initiative that the initiative may bring.

357
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:27,590
We've been resistant. I know personally that there was they didn't want to be told to do something.

358
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:35,089
You can't. I like mandate that they get something whether it be for I think it depends a lot on

359
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:37,969
the sectors that they're and I think people I felt like people in health care are more

360
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:44,510
willing to a lot of people don't they they weren't around him all the time to what

361
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:48,740
have to be vaccinated to wear a mask if no one's around me like it applied to them.

362
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:54,190
I mean, versus the actual date when people.

363
00:41:55,170 --> 00:42:00,870
Let me bring it home to you a little bit and you're spot on. If you're watching the news.

364
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:09,640
You saw that those three individuals who were trying to kidnap Governor Whitmer were.

365
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:15,530
Celine indicted. But they were resilient.

366
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:21,120
You know what they were resistant to? Does anybody know what they were resistant to?

367
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:27,020
Are you following that at all? Because.

368
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:37,860
Think of yourself as a health care leader. You have individuals that are working with you that are resistant to what you are trying to put in place.

369
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:45,100
And they want to kidnap you for it. Public health, trying to make them healthier.

370
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:52,680
Safer. How does it feel? But did you identify these stakeholders?

371
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:56,490
Did you think about them as someone who would be resistant?

372
00:42:57,030 --> 00:43:00,720
And what was your thoughts about that? She absolutely did.

373
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:07,740
I can tell you that we absolutely did. And I can't even begin to tell you the personal emails I received and what I was called.

374
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:13,460
People completely resistant to the university trying to make this a healthy or safe place.

375
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:20,060
The best way we know how, with all the tools we think that work from a public health perspective, trying to work on their behalf.

376
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:26,000
People who are resistant, they're aware of it and they're hotly aware of it.

377
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:28,790
And you're going to put something in place.

378
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:35,600
You're a fresh leader coming off your fellowship with your new job, because in your fellowship you have some sort of protection.

379
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:41,209
But when you get your new job, it is all yours and you're trying to put something in place.

380
00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:49,100
Who's going to resist it? This is not in class that you can spin away and talk about, you know, Nancy versus Sally.

381
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:57,470
This is something that you really believe is going to help the cold, the tone, culture and climate and health of your organization.

382
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:02,420
Who's neutral about it? I'll move on from that, but thank you for answering that.

383
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:09,470
Thank you for answering that. And then have to use both neutral and aware of initiative, neither supportive nor resistant.

384
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:15,410
Right. It's just your silence. Yeah. You're all familiar with the bell curve, right?

385
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:19,910
So I always feel like middle bell curves kind of just silent moving along.

386
00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:25,580
But you hear from the far left and the far right and they're very, very, very vocal.

387
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:34,250
But you have that neutral sense, supportive, aware of the initiative and the potential changes and impacts and is very supportive of it.

388
00:44:34,850 --> 00:44:43,760
School of Public Health, possibly most clinicals, most nurses who have to get vaccines as part of their job.

389
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:51,650
Michigan Medicine mandates a flu. They're supportive of getting the vaccine and they're still wearing masks today.

390
00:44:51,830 --> 00:44:54,890
Those that are in clinical settings support.

391
00:44:55,930 --> 00:45:00,880
Leading. Actively engaged to ensure the project's success.

392
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:08,070
Let me tell you that, you know, when when it becomes your responsibility,

393
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:13,380
that is you whatever you're trying to put in place, that is what you're trying to do for us.

394
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:22,000
It happened to be hundreds of individuals leading the effort DPS, the Department of Public Safety,

395
00:45:22,510 --> 00:45:27,670
they were important to it and leading it for many reasons because as a stakeholder,

396
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:34,600
what we did, they either were or weren't willing to transport students to Q and I.

397
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:39,890
Stakeholders had to be engaged, had to help us lead.

398
00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:44,630
It, had to understand. We had to think about that, about who that needed to be.

399
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:50,060
Who was that in the room? The bubble circles of everybody engaging for what it is we need to do.

400
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:57,470
So managing those stakeholders and looking at who's unaware, who's resistant, who's neutral.

401
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:09,820
Time now. There are formal ways to do this for those that need to map it out.

402
00:46:11,270 --> 00:46:19,250
The number of tools you can Google. I will not tell you your preference and what you may or may not like to think about your initiative,

403
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:23,210
even if it's just a little scratch pad that you're doing.

404
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:28,639
Oh, my God, I get this. I have to deliver X project and I got to, you know, I know I'm new,

405
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:32,660
but I really feel like I need this area, this area, this area that you're in, if you don't know, ask.

406
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:38,000
Somebody. Ask your boss. Ask who you think will be a future colleague.

407
00:46:38,510 --> 00:46:41,690
Who else should I think about in they will appreciate?

408
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:49,280
So we split this a little bit different. You're managing a certain sector of health care.

409
00:46:50,330 --> 00:46:56,150
You are heavily engaged in what you do. And the organization has basically say that you're successful.

410
00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:01,040
You just had a great performance management evaluation and you got your 2% raise.

411
00:47:01,050 --> 00:47:05,660
Yep, 2%. And all of a sudden there's an initiative going on.

412
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:13,790
You were never called as a stakeholder, knowing you had value to add to a project.

413
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:21,020
If you do that. To others, it will be done on to.

414
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:25,040
You know how that feels. Know what that means?

415
00:47:25,070 --> 00:47:28,729
Understand its value. Understand why you're giving something.

416
00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:34,850
But you're also getting something. The stakeholders that are involved in what you do can help you deliver success.

417
00:47:34,850 --> 00:47:42,600
And there are stakeholder maps here. Right here.

418
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:46,780
So you've got to measure dementia somewhere simple like, say, four quadrant.

419
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:55,930
Some are pretty engaged and pretty involved. And I would ask that you just sort of put some of those tools up that works for you.

420
00:47:57,030 --> 00:48:03,579
The sample stakeholder controlling, identifying, planning, managing, controlling.

421
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:08,380
When I ask a question, how can you controls and how does any how does that even work?

422
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:15,250
So if you're communicating proactively, people will listen and understand and respond.

423
00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:22,170
And if you communicate correctly, to meet the needs and expectations to address issues as they occur,

424
00:48:22,890 --> 00:48:25,740
people will understand the confidence they need to have in you because you're

425
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:29,700
willing to partner as you see them as a valued stakeholder in what it is you do.

426
00:48:31,830 --> 00:48:38,700
So I think this one is just sort of a quick example of who's the business owner.

427
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:45,120
You can't read that really well. So basically just a sample of here's some roles on this side.

428
00:48:45,810 --> 00:48:54,060
Here's the person or group that is responsible. And then here's a description of what it is I think I want to engage them in.

429
00:48:54,990 --> 00:49:01,710
Give them some opportunity to control the information with me and we'll move forward with the initiative.

430
00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:07,100
This is real. This was put together.

431
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:14,730
Yours truly. With a few others for it and its old gentleman sharing it in.

432
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:18,210
I really keep thinking that the slide comes through.

433
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:20,450
Okay. I feel like I need some clearer think.

434
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:31,620
But on the left, the stakeholder, the President and the Eels Public Affairs, student life debt of students, housing, faculty staff.

435
00:49:32,070 --> 00:49:41,520
University Health Services. DHS School of Public Health, FLC EOC is the Emergency Operations Center and then Campus Health Response Committee.

436
00:49:42,030 --> 00:49:49,320
Those are multiple people, not really just one president, but the Eaos represent a larger group and his cabinet.

437
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:54,840
Public affairs. Whole entire unit. Because multiple people were delivering messages that we needed.

438
00:49:54,840 --> 00:50:00,150
But what's the stakeholder? What's the deliverable that we needed?

439
00:50:00,570 --> 00:50:05,610
CHC is at the bottom and that was the committee that was meeting twice a week,

440
00:50:05,610 --> 00:50:14,490
Tuesday through Friday for an hour and a half every week to really engage in what it is we need to strategically put together for the university.

441
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:18,690
So C agency needs to understand what status is.

442
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:23,090
We were given basically twice a week to the School of Public Health.

443
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:27,330
They needed to get that status to UHC. They needed to get a status update.

444
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:34,410
Official deliverable for the president when we talked to him was anything that needed to be officials

445
00:50:34,410 --> 00:50:41,130
officially stamped or needed his consultation on and how were we actually engaging with them?

446
00:50:41,910 --> 00:50:49,080
The frequency was daily for the President's level, weekly for public affairs, weekly for student life, daily for housing.

447
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:52,410
Weekly daily for housing. Why?

448
00:50:52,890 --> 00:51:01,260
Why do you think we needed to bring that stakeholder in and troll manage them, give them an understanding daily at that time.

449
00:51:08,370 --> 00:51:13,200
Thinking about COVID. Thinking about housing from a daily perspective.

450
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:21,510
What would be important? This case is pop up daily and housing you and I to you and I spaces right?

451
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:32,640
Communicating with housing daily. We sent everybody home March 2020 and then we brought housing back as 12,000 students.

452
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:37,250
And if we didn't communicate with them daily, what might happen?

453
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:47,209
Right. So again, it's just it's just trying to give you the details in the meat around why these stakeholders matter in your in

454
00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:52,460
your life and how frequent you want to you want to engage with them so that you can control the narrative,

455
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:59,600
control the message. If it's your project, your baby, you get it.

456
00:51:59,810 --> 00:52:04,880
You've planned it all out. How are you engaging other people to walk along with you?

457
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:08,900
And who is that? What does that look like and how often do you need to talk with them?

458
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:15,290
Who was the owner of the priority preferred delivered methods to whom?

459
00:52:16,850 --> 00:52:19,520
Who are the external audiences, external stakeholders?

460
00:52:19,910 --> 00:52:26,149
And what were the notes of the attachments that needed to go with those and to those stakeholders?

461
00:52:26,150 --> 00:52:36,020
Thinking it through, thinking it clearly, through exactly what it is we need to say, how we need to say it so that everybody can come along.

462
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:38,900
And as I took that pause earlier,

463
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:49,640
gave us the greatest support because we did so getting the greatest support from for the work that you do makes it feel like the A-plus work.

464
00:52:55,980 --> 00:53:05,330
Okay. So this is my. This is my coworkers, kid.

465
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:14,159
Anthony is an absolute hoot. And so I always put him in my presentation to give me a little smile and laugh.

466
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:19,049
But it really comes to the RACI charts.

467
00:53:19,050 --> 00:53:26,020
Anybody familiar with RACI? But I don't like it.

468
00:53:26,590 --> 00:53:31,300
Yes. Responsible, accountable.

469
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:37,450
Consulted and informed. It's.

470
00:53:39,130 --> 00:53:47,590
Now on a different side of stakeholder management, Matt is identified the land manager trying to control them.

471
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:59,460
And part of that control is a racy chart. Example I'm going to try to work through is from 2014.

472
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:12,030
We did not have a emergency closure for severe weather here at the University of Michigan.

473
00:54:12,270 --> 00:54:19,860
The last time we attempted to close the university and it was it didn't close was 1972.

474
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:25,170
In 2014, we had a huge snowstorm.

475
00:54:25,890 --> 00:54:30,390
January. MATTHEWS Jerry, first in January 2nd in classes. We're going to start January 3rd.

476
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:35,549
And it was like 17 below. Flights were canceled.

477
00:54:35,550 --> 00:54:41,700
The students were trying to get back for the winter term. We had no emergency closure procedure.

478
00:54:43,410 --> 00:54:50,700
Mary Sue Coleman At the time, I enlisted human resources and said, You need to pull the team together.

479
00:54:50,970 --> 00:54:56,670
You need to put together the entire resources and stakeholders. And in three months.

480
00:54:57,810 --> 00:55:01,620
I need a plan. I do. I do not want to go through this again.

481
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:11,610
What ended up happening was a very emergent call to leaders was made at that time in 2014.

482
00:55:12,270 --> 00:55:16,820
We did not have to. So you can imagine people are just coming off your leader.

483
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:18,520
You are in this role.

484
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:24,100
You just coming off of your beautiful vacation from somewhere and you're thinking you're coming back to your job and your role and well,

485
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:30,760
your leader says we need to shut down. You don't have Zoom. You have none of that, but you don't have a procedure to do that.

486
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:35,440
You don't know how to contact your staff. You don't know what to say to your staff. You don't know what what what's happening to your staff.

487
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:39,370
Stakeholders needed to be engaged to develop a plan.

488
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:49,510
And we developed a racy chart based a lot off of some, some of our geo geographical weather friends.

489
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:53,860
In addition to communications, there were several subcommittees put in place,

490
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:57,460
but Michigan Medicine and Campus came together and put together RACI chart.

491
00:55:58,150 --> 00:56:10,700
Ultimately, Mary Sue made the decision. To close campus for those who did not had emergency procedures that needed to continue.

492
00:56:12,890 --> 00:56:20,490
Thinking that through. Those who needed to stay open were who I know.

493
00:56:20,490 --> 00:56:26,170
You know this answer. I'm looking at this group right there.

494
00:56:26,970 --> 00:56:30,890
Michigan Medicine. Right. It's the low hanging fruit.

495
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:39,690
What about the millions? And when I say let me really think that through, I think I do want to say billions, billions of dollars.

496
00:56:40,950 --> 00:56:51,730
Hang in the balance with research. You have Rebecca Cunningham, who's leader of a lot of research that we do around here.

497
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:59,240
And she said. I mean, I've got animals that need to be fed for research.

498
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:03,200
I've got different type of research that's going on and labs and places,

499
00:57:03,470 --> 00:57:08,150
and I've got grants and information that I need to give to the federal government stakeholder.

500
00:57:11,910 --> 00:57:14,940
What did she need to know? Why didn't billions?

501
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:20,930
You've got billions. And there was no real plan to shut the place down.

502
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:25,349
But you heard what the decision was. For emergency.

503
00:57:25,350 --> 00:57:35,130
So she was underneath the emergency and was able to work out in through her finger eyes principal investigators to figure out what they needed to do.

504
00:57:35,430 --> 00:57:40,620
Nasty. Dicey. Imagine the liability on the other side.

505
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:45,000
A slipping and falling on campus. What that would mean?

506
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:49,020
The risk taken and involved legal. What do you think they were saying?

507
00:57:49,170 --> 00:57:52,260
Stakeholder. What did that look like? What were they responsible for?

508
00:57:52,270 --> 00:57:56,530
What were they accountable for? So looking at this RACI chart,

509
00:57:57,460 --> 00:58:05,350
the responsible person does the does the work to complete the task accountable person delegates working is at least the one to review the task

510
00:58:05,350 --> 00:58:14,380
consulted provides input based on how either how it will impact their future or informed needs to be kept in the loop on a project in progress.

511
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:17,799
So when you're thinking about your stakeholders and you're trying to identify them and

512
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:21,850
you're trying to think about a plan of how to control and talk to them and manage them,

513
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:30,700
what might happen if someone is your boss, is really responsible for what you're doing,

514
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:33,880
you're accountable for the work, your boss is really responsible.

515
00:58:34,210 --> 00:58:44,920
So who else is to be consulted and informed? So I think and I don't think I put it here for you see what you're looking at.

516
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:48,910
There is a idea about the RACI chart.

517
00:58:49,990 --> 00:59:01,540
I would normally go and find the lengthy Excel file sheet that talks about, again, the levels of engagement and the RACI chart.

518
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:04,480
With all the leaders you can imagine an Excel spreadsheet.

519
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:10,720
All the leader's titles were sort of up at the top and then all of the responsibilities on the left.

520
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:17,680
And then there was an R and A or C or an eye for them to understand and for us not to hear.

521
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:23,680
Well, I don't know what to do. They knew how they were going to be engaged in and at what level.

522
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:32,560
So now at this point in time, every single year, every managerial supervisor and leader, because they are a stakeholder in this,

523
00:59:32,890 --> 00:59:38,290
signed a document that basically states they understand the emergency shutdown procedure.

524
00:59:39,690 --> 00:59:42,760
And how they're engaged that came out of that in 2014.

525
00:59:43,590 --> 00:59:47,340
In addition to. There are certain triggers.

526
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:53,610
If many of you watched the health response maze and Blue Dashboard is what it was used to be called.

527
00:59:54,150 --> 01:00:02,610
We would have trigger responses, right? If we meet, if we had 702 and I and we had a set positivity of 1900, I'm making this up.

528
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:07,800
But there are triggers. To tell stakeholders how to respond and how to act.

529
01:00:08,250 --> 01:00:13,860
That is exactly what's happening in a severe weather procedure for campus.

530
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:20,760
But it took a number of stakeholders three months to pull this together to say this is how we will respond.

531
01:00:20,790 --> 01:00:25,560
And so that is what we've been living off of. The university has been around for over 200 years.

532
01:00:26,530 --> 01:00:31,610
We've never had that. Until 2014.

533
01:00:32,930 --> 01:00:38,930
You will be future leaders coming up with things that your organization has never had.

534
01:00:40,190 --> 01:00:48,020
How will you engage humans that need to respond and help you deliver the most appropriate?

535
01:00:49,470 --> 01:00:52,980
Initiative, program project that you can.

536
01:00:55,110 --> 01:01:00,360
What does that look like? How have you thought it through?

537
01:01:01,660 --> 01:01:05,490
How have you owned it? To make for certain that.

538
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:19,660
They're responsible or accountable. And so this is sort of just a I think read this one, just looking at designing a whole something different, right?

539
01:01:21,070 --> 01:01:24,460
Project deliverables are activities. You're going to you're going to design the site map.

540
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:31,000
Who's going to do that? Who's who should be consulted is the project manager.

541
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:34,750
The strategist is responsible for it. The designer is accountable to it.

542
01:01:35,260 --> 01:01:43,060
The front end developer is informed and the back end developer is informed when it comes to the design site map design wireframes,

543
01:01:43,780 --> 01:01:50,770
you can read them as you see them creating a style guide, reading them code templates.

544
01:01:52,450 --> 01:01:58,360
So. And doing just a quick little exercise with you.

545
01:01:58,410 --> 01:02:02,990
I tend to go to either picnics or weddings. And today I'm going to pick a wedding.

546
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:09,990
When we think about a wedding. Who's responsible.

547
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:21,230
For the wedding. Balls coming over the stadium is responsible for winning.

548
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:26,710
It's like we're just on land.

549
01:02:29,010 --> 01:02:32,190
Olympic events. I watch swimming.

550
01:02:32,550 --> 01:02:36,770
Swimming? I felt sugar. Zero. Oh, yeah.

551
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:41,370
And it was you. And who's responsible in a wedding? In what way?

552
01:02:41,730 --> 01:02:47,920
Right. Imagine I'm your boss.

553
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:55,030
And I just said for putting on a wedding planner who's responsible of with bride's parents.

554
01:02:55,660 --> 01:03:02,860
The bridesmaids. Ladies. I need you to toss the ball over here.

555
01:03:03,350 --> 01:03:07,540
Okay. This zone might make this my end zone.

556
01:03:07,540 --> 01:03:12,590
End zone? 50 yard line. Okay, so toss the ball to this end zone.

557
01:03:13,130 --> 01:03:20,670
Somebody over here needs catch their ball. Let's go. It's going to be.

558
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:30,860
And I don't want to watch you.

559
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:35,089
Beautiful beach. I want a beautiful beach.

560
01:03:35,090 --> 01:03:38,000
I want to see. I would love to go back to Hawaii.

561
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:48,200
I personally right now Hawaii specifically, I'm just like, well, if I'm responsible for everything you like planning,

562
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:53,269
that usually comes down to the bride because they're the ones who pictures what the responsible for like what?

563
01:03:53,270 --> 01:03:56,420
Like if you're planning it. Yes. Or they get like an event planner.

564
01:03:56,900 --> 01:04:01,220
If you're talking about like the finances that usually is like the bride and groom or the family of the bride and the groom.

565
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:07,180
Throw that to my 50 yard line. 50 yard line.

566
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:12,490
I don't know where she started, but, Johnny, when did you run somebody?

567
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:28,760
Where do you think those places you've been swimming?

568
01:04:29,150 --> 01:04:35,670
I don't know. Is that. Only slam every four years.

569
01:04:35,930 --> 01:04:39,440
Okay. Where was it? Was it a lake with an ocean?

570
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:45,350
Was it on campus? Can you believe the university pool?

571
01:04:45,650 --> 01:04:48,710
All right, I'll take it. All right. Who's responsible for a wedding?

572
01:04:49,950 --> 01:04:56,130
Uh. Depends on what you talk about with responsibility.

573
01:04:58,970 --> 01:05:08,450
I agree with all the points that were made, the transfer of size dance and the wedding planner.

574
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:13,300
The wedding planner is responsible. I think that's interesting.

575
01:05:13,310 --> 01:05:18,500
Interesting, interesting. I will debrief a little of that. The next question I have is who's accountable?

576
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:25,490
Who's accountable for and where does that.

577
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:31,130
A wedding. I remember. I just went to in this summer.

578
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:36,130
And that's so convenient right now to one of my best friend's wedding.

579
01:05:36,140 --> 01:05:39,340
So I was like, okay, and who's accounl?

580
01:05:39,350 --> 01:05:43,250
So we talk about who's responsible, who's accountable.

581
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:53,180
So when I was saying the wedding planner, because what judges said would never be responsible.

582
01:05:53,270 --> 01:05:57,770
Right. But if it goes wrong, I'm coming to the wedding planner.

583
01:05:58,550 --> 01:06:13,610
It's outside. Oh, okay. I've got the wedding that I've never had already came up with.

584
01:06:16,220 --> 01:06:27,350
I woke up, I think I just ran out of bed, and I'm like, I just want to do it closer.

585
01:06:28,370 --> 01:06:49,790
It's good. You know, when I saw somebody made this statement, which is to say it wasn't anything,

586
01:06:49,850 --> 01:07:14,270
you see a power source anywhere, you just just to keep in mind about the body from the podium.

587
01:07:14,620 --> 01:07:18,890
I don't know, like on the best part.

588
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:22,610
You know, I was I was looking I was trying to see it's been over there.

589
01:07:22,890 --> 01:07:31,670
You know, at least on the ground.

590
01:07:32,420 --> 01:07:36,870
It's another one over there watching it.

591
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:51,840
Sorry, guys. I think I think it's a surprise.

592
01:07:53,840 --> 01:08:06,170
I guess it's almost three years later.

593
01:08:09,130 --> 01:08:21,160
Oh, I don't know. But I was talking about what are they doing?

594
01:08:21,170 --> 01:08:26,660
All right, so we were unaccountable. We heard about responsible, now accountable.

595
01:08:26,930 --> 01:08:30,140
It's a big planner. That's quite interesting. It's great.

596
01:08:30,210 --> 01:08:34,100
It's okay. Can you throw back over to the end zone over here?

597
01:08:34,130 --> 01:08:40,580
All right, so my next guest is far from that severe torture.

598
01:08:40,850 --> 01:08:46,760
So what you want is to start Rolling Stone.

599
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:11,420
So many things that they. I don't know, man.

600
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:16,510
I wasn't about to meet with the finest fast food.

601
01:09:16,950 --> 01:09:21,770
Okay. Um, this is common sense.

602
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:25,790
It can be if you want it to be. Okay. Either that or talk about it.

603
01:09:31,940 --> 01:09:36,200
The press goes, I'm going to press this. Okay. Who's a cannibal in a wedding?

604
01:09:36,230 --> 01:09:46,100
We heard responsible. We are accountable. And I guess maybe the people who are, like, in charge of the food or florists.

605
01:09:46,730 --> 01:09:50,900
I would also agree that the wedding planner is accountable. But people like, I guess,

606
01:09:50,900 --> 01:09:59,120
like the stakeholders are involved in arranging things to setting up the venue and stuff for the bride and groom and the guests.

607
01:09:59,790 --> 01:10:03,200
Okay. You're about to make some of my special teams here.

608
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:10,340
I realize somebody is somebody who has an idea, but they're all looking at the wall.

609
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:16,430
Later. I should have taken a picture. You're in big government. Who's accountable?

610
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:22,970
I think I went in. Okay. What's your problem?

611
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:30,030
Magazine I read. That's probably favorite of magazines.

612
01:10:30,150 --> 01:10:33,320
Long time. But like Cosmo.

613
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:37,160
Cosmo. Hate to write. You remember?

614
01:10:37,310 --> 01:10:41,000
Okay. All right. Good job.

615
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:49,690
I am looking for who should be consulted. It's coming to your own, like 45 because you just got married.

616
01:10:49,930 --> 01:10:57,280
She knows all the answers. Uh huh. Who should be consulted?

617
01:10:59,930 --> 01:11:05,830
Well, it's a good question. Maybe the extended family.

618
01:11:05,910 --> 01:11:11,190
I think grandparents are like people if they're contributing in some way, but not like paying for fully.

619
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:15,690
We get word yet on live music.

620
01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:19,300
My parents like. Okay. I think I asked that. So you got that one?

621
01:11:19,390 --> 01:11:30,220
Yeah. You can pick another one. Sorry, you can't see me, but in the board game I would pick.

622
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:37,850
I like settler's guitar. So again, Sadler is a good time for a board game.

623
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,520
Okay. Very good. Very good. All right.

624
01:11:40,610 --> 01:11:54,240
You can throw it back to this end zone because I want to hear who should be informed will when you make its comments.

625
01:11:54,470 --> 01:12:02,990
Right. Good. Sorry, guys. If we lose, my battery went out for those that are on the screen.

626
01:12:02,990 --> 01:12:12,050
So I have to apologize and try to get back to where we were. Kids who are gone should be informed.

627
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:20,770
I have the ball. Oh, I thought it was okay. We're just gonna go watch them go home.

628
01:12:21,060 --> 01:12:25,690
How you doing? Enjoy. All right.

629
01:12:25,900 --> 01:12:29,710
Very good. I should be informed. I would say the room.

630
01:12:30,670 --> 01:12:34,270
Let's go. Why do we have to do it?

631
01:12:35,050 --> 01:12:38,240
Say things for me, okay. I want to know the answers.

632
01:12:38,260 --> 01:12:42,040
I'll take a bath. I'm going to get one more informal from the end zone.

633
01:12:42,550 --> 01:12:46,000
Things are tough and tough to make up.

634
01:12:50,220 --> 01:12:53,860
I'm sure. Who should be informed? We're just on land and we should be informed.

635
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:59,290
Something I like about my hometown. My friends are there.

636
01:12:59,980 --> 01:13:04,200
Like, I guess gas. Like where to go and, like what to do tonight.

637
01:13:05,180 --> 01:13:06,610
Those guys should be informed. Okay.

638
01:13:06,970 --> 01:13:18,460
What I loved about this exercise is when you leave this university, we all have different views of who should be responsible,

639
01:13:18,910 --> 01:13:22,420
who should be accountable, who should be consulted, and who should be informed.

640
01:13:22,630 --> 01:13:26,440
And you're coming from your place of information. But you heard each other.

641
01:13:26,650 --> 01:13:32,470
You literally hurt each other. And it was really interesting that we had the event planner to be responsible and accountable.

642
01:13:33,970 --> 01:13:39,130
So at what point in time do you do the legwork to think through what's the bride's responsibility?

643
01:13:39,940 --> 01:13:45,010
What's the groom's responsibility? Is mom and dad supporting it financially?

644
01:13:45,910 --> 01:13:51,400
What's their involvement? Their stakeholders, the people who are unaware are going to be the guests, right?

645
01:13:52,030 --> 01:13:58,060
You can inform them through some sort of you can inform them through some sort of invitation.

646
01:13:58,990 --> 01:14:07,180
But when we think about planning a wedding and who's responsible, the deliverable.

647
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:15,090
Is what? The dinner.

648
01:14:17,100 --> 01:14:20,910
I love you all. You cannot.

649
01:14:21,660 --> 01:14:25,110
Sean Spencer, did you tell me you married? Can I? Sure.

650
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:28,829
The deliverable is flash at the ceremony.

651
01:14:28,830 --> 01:14:39,330
Or will you actually get married? Because everyone comes to see us and they saw me for me.

652
01:14:39,330 --> 01:14:44,370
And I can't tell you how to think about this, but I'm asking you to think about this.

653
01:14:44,730 --> 01:14:55,200
We're talking about a wedding. But when there's health care dollars and patient outcomes accountable, it's this is going to be you.

654
01:14:55,230 --> 01:15:01,260
And what I'm trying to say is the deliverable is a marriage certificate.

655
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:07,460
Even at a party, you have people in there dress up in it.

656
01:15:08,410 --> 01:15:15,560
But who's responsible for that certificate being signed and delivered?

657
01:15:17,830 --> 01:15:25,060
So, yes, the reason why I'm choosing this wedding is because maybe many of us have never been through a wedding.

658
01:15:25,750 --> 01:15:29,920
I have. I can be a stakeholder to give you information.

659
01:15:31,220 --> 01:15:41,240
So ask me. That's the that's the journey I'm asking you to go on as a leader, being thoughtful from a human resource perspective,

660
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:46,490
using your stakeholders, engaging them, people who may know some information.

661
01:15:46,730 --> 01:15:49,640
You're coming at it from what you know, and that's great.

662
01:15:50,210 --> 01:15:59,180
But I am a resource and I somehow happen to remember Spencer's, but he was a resource and we could turn to each other.

663
01:15:59,390 --> 01:16:07,220
And I was hoping. Can you give me an experience?

664
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:11,750
But great. I would ask each other.

665
01:16:11,750 --> 01:16:16,340
Why did you say in big letters from can can they be one in the same?

666
01:16:18,140 --> 01:16:24,950
Can the event planner deliver the sign executed certificate?

667
01:16:27,020 --> 01:16:29,210
They are responsible for some things.

668
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:36,740
And so when you think through just think through the wedding of who would I say is this and who has a what does that look like?

669
01:16:37,460 --> 01:16:39,980
You may or may not ever get married. That's on your own business.

670
01:16:39,990 --> 01:16:44,930
But what I was trying to do again was have you think through why you're saying what you're saying,

671
01:16:44,930 --> 01:16:49,580
what you're doing, and reaching out and thinking who are stakeholders engaged in this?

672
01:16:50,150 --> 01:16:55,760
Because without having people in place and you're managing and controlling that, the event planner is going to be able to do that.

673
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:00,290
What are you delivering? You can be a hot mess of a wedding,

674
01:17:01,940 --> 01:17:08,120
but thinking it through to understand the people that are involved that this actually they care

675
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:14,540
about and wanting to see a great event happened for you or for your loved one or someone.

676
01:17:14,750 --> 01:17:23,900
And that's the same thing in health care. Someone wants to see the best care given for their loved one or for you or for them.

677
01:17:24,170 --> 01:17:28,430
There are people that you're going to work with that will be stakeholders that you

678
01:17:28,430 --> 01:17:32,899
yourself will be stakeholders and how you present that someone will come to you and say,

679
01:17:32,900 --> 01:17:37,850
We need your thoughts on where and what space are you coming from?

680
01:17:37,850 --> 01:17:45,560
What have you researched? What do you know? What can you give? What can we be a stakeholder and engage in stakeholders?

681
01:17:46,010 --> 01:17:50,459
It's the human resources of the business that we do. With that.

682
01:17:50,460 --> 01:18:01,520
I'm on time is 520. I'll have a great afternoon. So the reason being on the way out, because you're having the town.

01:18:08,870 --> 01:18:21,600
I have to tell you that Mexico and have a guest speaker get your attention one more time.

684
01:18:24,180 --> 01:18:28,709
I know I am one of mine. I have no problem projecting my voice.

685
01:18:28,710 --> 01:18:36,930
I try not to do that. So I was trying to let you know that seeing your voice let you know that next week we have a guest speaker.

686
01:18:37,050 --> 01:18:43,740
I'm going to try very hard not to have sort of respect for that person coming out of there.

687
01:18:45,180 --> 01:18:53,240
It's immigration. I did not mean. That'd be great.

688
01:18:54,530 --> 01:19:01,170
I don't need that. Oh.

689
01:19:06,830 --> 01:19:12,370
I think I need to talk to you again.

690
01:19:12,990 --> 01:19:30,780
How do I know you haven't heard about. I'm going to pull out of it, but I got to figure out how to let you do this.

691
01:19:31,350 --> 01:19:40,410
I don't know. How did I get here?

692
01:19:42,750 --> 01:19:46,430
I mean, you started writing.

693
01:19:48,350 --> 01:19:55,760
You know, you don't really care, you know? I feel like I do need to, you know.

694
01:19:55,790 --> 01:19:56,610
You know.
