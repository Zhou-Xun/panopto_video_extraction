1
00:00:01,289 --> 00:00:02,749
Hey, everyone.

2
00:00:02,749 --> 00:00:06,196
This is the quick review for gluconeogenesis,

3
00:00:06,196 --> 00:00:10,173
which is the last lecture and the carbohydrates unit.

4
00:00:10,173 --> 00:00:13,186
So I'll also be going fairly quickly through it.

5
00:00:13,186 --> 00:00:17,673
So we've been talking about glycolysis infection synthesis and all that.

6
00:00:17,673 --> 00:00:23,603
So basically, gluconegenesis is somehow the reverse of glycolysis and

7
00:00:23,603 --> 00:00:25,848
we'll talk more about it.

8
00:00:25,848 --> 00:00:29,677
So it's really similar to like call says it starts with lactate, glycerol and

9
00:00:29,677 --> 00:00:30,383
amino acids.

10
00:00:30,383 --> 00:00:35,987
Those are the three precursors for gluconeogenesis.

11
00:00:35,987 --> 00:00:40,416
We have differences that by which some enzymes are irreversible.

12
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:45,346
So you have a different enzyme that does that reverse job for them.

13
00:00:45,346 --> 00:00:50,665
For example, G 6-phosphatase does the reverse job of glucokinase and

14
00:00:50,665 --> 00:00:54,337
why are we using glucokinase and not hexokinase?

15
00:00:54,337 --> 00:00:56,503
Because gluconeogenesis only happens and deliver.

16
00:00:56,503 --> 00:00:59,104
It does not happen in the muscle.

17
00:00:59,104 --> 00:01:04,765
So this is impossible to happen with hexokinase.

18
00:01:04,765 --> 00:01:08,361
Because the muscle and the fat, they do not undergo gluconeogenesis.

19
00:01:08,361 --> 00:01:14,647
So glucokinase deliver is the main enzyme we're talking about.

20
00:01:14,647 --> 00:01:20,124
Fructose 1,6-bispEhosphate does the reverse of the PFK1 and

21
00:01:20,124 --> 00:01:23,066
pyruvate to exile acetate to PREP.

22
00:01:23,066 --> 00:01:24,216
It skips pyruvate kinase.

23
00:01:24,216 --> 00:01:27,750
So basically, it's not really the reverse of pyruvate kinase.

24
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,259
It just gives it on the side.

25
00:01:29,259 --> 00:01:32,774
So it's kind of in parallel to it, but in the opposite direction and

26
00:01:32,774 --> 00:01:34,202
we'll talk more about it.

27
00:01:34,202 --> 00:01:39,682
So as mentioned, adrenaline and glucagon, they serve two different purposes.

28
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:42,834
Adrenaline is really trying to get energy into the muscle.

29
00:01:42,834 --> 00:01:48,416
Glucagon is trying to raise blood glucose and cortisol, it's induced by stress.

30
00:01:48,416 --> 00:01:52,361
It's more potent.

31
00:01:52,361 --> 00:01:58,164
It's more of a long-term effect and it just causes breakdown of

32
00:01:58,164 --> 00:02:03,220
everything in order to increase blood glucose levels.

33
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:08,712
So it's really in times of chronic stress and it's even sacrifices the muscle,

34
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:12,037
and causes its amino acid breakdown basically.

35
00:02:12,037 --> 00:02:16,072
So that's something to keep in mind that cortisol,

36
00:02:16,072 --> 00:02:21,955
it's just giving up almost everything just to keep the blood glucose high.

37
00:02:21,955 --> 00:02:24,048
Not high, but like normal glycemic.

38
00:02:24,048 --> 00:02:30,224
Whereas glucagon, it spares the muscle and it only uses deliver.

39
00:02:30,224 --> 00:02:33,744
So gluconeurogenesis is expensive,

40
00:02:33,744 --> 00:02:39,134
because you just use a lot of energy to get back to glucose.

41
00:02:39,134 --> 00:02:44,819
But it's better for the greater good, because that glucose can be used by

42
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:49,967
the muscle or can go to the blood and that definitely is important.

43
00:02:49,967 --> 00:02:54,439
So glycerol over here, if you want to calculate those.

44
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:58,626
So alanine feeds them over here doesn't use any ATP and

45
00:02:58,626 --> 00:03:02,003
then I'm just gonna go through one of them.

46
00:03:02,003 --> 00:03:05,073
And that way, you can go from there.

47
00:03:05,073 --> 00:03:06,846
So I'm gonna go with black data, actually.

48
00:03:06,846 --> 00:03:08,782
So lactate starts from here.

49
00:03:08,782 --> 00:03:14,163
Every lactate that becomes pyruvate will yield one NADH.

50
00:03:14,163 --> 00:03:16,799
One NADH is 2.5 ATP.

51
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:19,487
And to make glucose, you need to lactate,

52
00:03:19,487 --> 00:03:24,499
because lactate is a three carbon molecule and glucose is six carbon molecule.

53
00:03:24,499 --> 00:03:30,059
So this means that you need two-lactate to become two-pyruvate, to become

54
00:03:30,059 --> 00:03:35,378
two of each until it becomes wonderful glucose that require six carbons.

55
00:03:35,378 --> 00:03:37,821
So basically, multiply everything by 2.

56
00:03:37,821 --> 00:03:41,146
So basically, two NADH would mean five ATP.

57
00:03:41,146 --> 00:03:43,334
So you've made five ATP over here.

58
00:03:43,334 --> 00:03:47,607
And then for every pyruvate to become exile acetate, you're using one ATP.

59
00:03:47,607 --> 00:03:48,990
So this is minus 2..

60
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:50,987
So 2 minus 2, basically.

61
00:03:50,987 --> 00:03:54,507
And then here, you're using a GTP and

62
00:03:54,507 --> 00:03:58,691
then I believe it's making an ATP over here.

63
00:03:58,691 --> 00:04:02,363
And then here, you transform NADH to NAD.

64
00:04:02,363 --> 00:04:06,044
So you are losing NADH over here.

65
00:04:06,044 --> 00:04:10,840
So basically, this step kind of removes that other

66
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,859
step almost as far as I believe.

67
00:04:13,859 --> 00:04:19,078
But then the ATP is being produced over here in one, two, three, four, five, six.

68
00:04:19,078 --> 00:04:23,271
So basically, six ATP is being used over here and

69
00:04:23,271 --> 00:04:27,783
this is why gluconeogenesos cause the body six ATP.

70
00:04:27,783 --> 00:04:32,831
So the energy you're using here will basically zero,

71
00:04:32,831 --> 00:04:36,571
the energy you've produced over here.

72
00:04:36,571 --> 00:04:42,910
And then you've used ATP's times 2 times 2 times 2 and this is 6.

73
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:48,212
For alanine units more than that, it's -15 just because it's an amino acid and

74
00:04:48,212 --> 00:04:52,906
has to go through the urea cycle to get tid of the nitrogen which we'll talk

75
00:04:52,906 --> 00:04:55,577
about later and this is why it's -15.

76
00:04:55,577 --> 00:04:58,288
So the ketogenic diet as mentioned,

77
00:04:58,288 --> 00:05:03,106
you make more ketones when you're under anaerobic conditions.

78
00:05:03,106 --> 00:05:05,497
I mean, sorry, under aerobic conditions, but

79
00:05:05,497 --> 00:05:07,608
there is no exile acetate to react with it.

80
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:12,467
So if you're a ketogenic diet which means that you're not really eating

81
00:05:12,467 --> 00:05:16,689
a lot of carbs, then you can't really undergo anaplerosis and

82
00:05:16,689 --> 00:05:21,710
increase exile acetate if anything you're undergoing caterplerosis and

83
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:24,996
you're removing exile assets from the system.

84
00:05:24,996 --> 00:05:33,583
So the TCA cycle is less efficient and there's more gluconeogenesis.

85
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,909
And definitely if you're on a ketogenic diet,

86
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:37,952
then you're just consuming mainly fat.

87
00:05:37,952 --> 00:05:41,129
So you're foregoing eating fiber and so

88
00:05:41,129 --> 00:05:45,810
on, and this puts you at risk of other potential problems.

89
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:49,245
Thus far, there is no long-term human studies on this.

90
00:05:49,245 --> 00:05:51,281
So all this data's.

91
00:05:51,281 --> 00:05:55,951
So effectively and you, but

92
00:05:55,951 --> 00:06:02,781
more is to be discovered in the coming years.

93
00:06:02,781 --> 00:06:06,611
Okay, so I'm gonna go back to gluconeogenesis quickly.

94
00:06:06,611 --> 00:06:11,535
So the key enzymes that play our PEPCK, PC, FB bisphosphatase,

95
00:06:11,535 --> 00:06:16,282
G6 bisphosphatase which are all relatively reversed enzymes

96
00:06:16,282 --> 00:06:20,688
moving in the upward direction as opposed to glycolysis.

97
00:06:20,688 --> 00:06:25,079
So PC is activated by acetyl-CoA and

98
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:30,464
pyruvate pyruvate carboxylase active, and

99
00:06:30,464 --> 00:06:36,141
then FB bisphosphatase down regulated by ATP.

100
00:06:36,141 --> 00:06:40,578
So if you have energy, do not really need to undergo gluconeogenesis.

101
00:06:40,578 --> 00:06:43,421
So you're negatively regulated.

102
00:06:43,421 --> 00:06:47,291
And then also if you have less a AMP,

103
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:51,692
then it means you have more ATP and so on.

104
00:06:51,692 --> 00:06:57,335
Some hormones will talk more about it as we're going through this.

105
00:06:57,335 --> 00:07:01,082
So this is pyruvate carboxylase over here,

106
00:07:01,082 --> 00:07:05,547
which is one of the important enzymes PEPCK as well.

107
00:07:05,547 --> 00:07:08,872
Fructose 6-phosphate over here and G6 phosphate.

108
00:07:08,872 --> 00:07:14,361
So they're all doing the reverse to eventually yield glucose.

109
00:07:14,361 --> 00:07:17,212
Fatty acids cannot be converted into glucose.

110
00:07:17,212 --> 00:07:19,706
So the answer is no.

111
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:20,934
So let's talk about PEPCK.

112
00:07:20,934 --> 00:07:23,739
So here is the first committing and rate limiting step,

113
00:07:23,739 --> 00:07:25,894
because it's obviously after pyruvate.

114
00:07:25,894 --> 00:07:29,065
So it immediately determines where pyruvate is gonna go.

115
00:07:29,065 --> 00:07:31,792
Is it going to keep going through the TCA cycle.

116
00:07:31,792 --> 00:07:37,188
It's gonna become alanine or is it gonna go all the way back to form glucose.

117
00:07:37,188 --> 00:07:42,393
Sorry, I was talking about pyruvate carboxylase.

118
00:07:42,393 --> 00:07:44,007
So please neglect that.

119
00:07:44,007 --> 00:07:47,074
This is PEPCK over here that we're talking about.

120
00:07:47,074 --> 00:07:49,766
So it's the rate limiting step.

121
00:07:49,766 --> 00:07:52,173
It's not regulate the LA, hysterically.

122
00:07:52,173 --> 00:07:56,723
Insulin will negatively regulate this by an activating FOXO and

123
00:07:56,723 --> 00:07:59,258
then cortisol will regulate this.

124
00:07:59,258 --> 00:08:00,734
Because as mentioned,

125
00:08:00,734 --> 00:08:05,023
cortisol will increase gluconeogenesis whereas insulin will not.

126
00:08:05,023 --> 00:08:06,084
So this makes sense.

127
00:08:06,084 --> 00:08:11,268
Insulin wants to increase glycolysis and glycogen synthesis,

128
00:08:11,268 --> 00:08:15,785
and it wanted to reduce glucose from being in the blood.

129
00:08:15,785 --> 00:08:20,359
So it really does not want gluconeogenesis to be happening at the same time

130
00:08:20,359 --> 00:08:24,217
that it's trying to promote glycolysis and glucose uptake.

131
00:08:24,217 --> 00:08:28,966
On the other hand, cortisol aims to increase blood glucose and

132
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:32,562
this is why it will positively regulate PEPCK.

133
00:08:32,562 --> 00:08:37,483
So PEPCK is really cataplerotic, because it's using up exile acetate.

134
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:41,666
So it's taking away the buses from the whole bus system over here.

135
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:44,857
So it's making the bus system less efficient,

136
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:48,860
because we have less buses to drive passengers basically.

137
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:49,545
[COUGH] And

138
00:08:49,545 --> 00:08:55,287
then pyruvate carboxylase is the enzyme I was talking about [COUGH] is over here.

139
00:08:55,287 --> 00:08:57,772
It determines a pyruvate will become exile acetate.

140
00:08:57,772 --> 00:09:03,428
So this is really anaplerotic, because the pyruvate does indeed become exile acetate.

141
00:09:03,428 --> 00:09:07,352
This means that we are increasing buses into the system.

142
00:09:07,352 --> 00:09:12,093
So despite what will happen to exile acetate next, the fact that pyruvate

143
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:17,304
carboxylase is adding more buses by transforming pyruvate into exile acetate.

144
00:09:17,304 --> 00:09:19,578
This is considered to be an operatic.

145
00:09:19,578 --> 00:09:24,242
So keep in mind, pyruvate

146
00:09:24,242 --> 00:09:29,758
carboxylase is anaplerotic.

147
00:09:29,758 --> 00:09:34,724
So if you have a deficiency in pyruvate carboxylase, then you will probably

148
00:09:34,724 --> 00:09:39,861
have an increase of pyruvate and then less pyruvate can become exile acetate.

149
00:09:39,861 --> 00:09:42,696
And if carboxylase is not functioning and

150
00:09:42,696 --> 00:09:47,235
this will definitely impair the whole gluconeogenitic process.

151
00:09:47,235 --> 00:09:50,536
Because if you can't really make exile acetate,

152
00:09:50,536 --> 00:09:55,263
then you can't pull out exile acetate to undergo gluconeurogenesis.

153
00:09:55,263 --> 00:10:00,340
So it's worth thinking about how this affects the whole system.

154
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:04,829
So over here, we are also talking about fructose bisphosptate one which is

155
00:10:04,829 --> 00:10:06,193
the reverse of PFK1.

156
00:10:06,193 --> 00:10:09,879
It's inhabited by having fructose 6-bisphosphate, why is that?

157
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:15,035
Because we said that fructose 6-bisphosphate is the passive aggressive

158
00:10:15,035 --> 00:10:19,631
customer on the side, which will increase the activity of PFK1.

159
00:10:19,631 --> 00:10:24,475
So if PFK1 is active, you can't really have the between quotation marks.

160
00:10:24,475 --> 00:10:27,869
Their reverse reaction that is driven by fructose

161
00:10:27,869 --> 00:10:31,515
6-bisphosphate won't be active at the same time.

162
00:10:31,515 --> 00:10:36,532
So if this is activating PFK1, fructose bisphosphonates one needs to be shutdown.

163
00:10:36,532 --> 00:10:37,612
So it's not gonna be on.

164
00:10:37,612 --> 00:10:38,983
So it's either or.

165
00:10:38,983 --> 00:10:41,737
So if you have a lot of F26 bisphosphate,

166
00:10:41,737 --> 00:10:46,634
it means you have a build up of products that need to go through glycolysis and

167
00:10:46,634 --> 00:10:51,469
you need the PFK1 to be activated and gluconeogenesis to be deactivated.

168
00:10:51,469 --> 00:10:54,570
Also AMP, it means that you have low energy.

169
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:59,128
So if you're low on energy, you need glycolysis to go through to be able to

170
00:10:59,128 --> 00:11:03,109
produce energy from either the TCA cycle or glycolysis itself.

171
00:11:03,109 --> 00:11:09,040
So you do not need fructose 6-bisphosphate to be active and

172
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,654
to undergo l gluconeogenesis here.

173
00:11:12,654 --> 00:11:14,932
They're saying that it's the same enzyme, basically.

174
00:11:14,932 --> 00:11:17,505
So there are just different parts of the same enzyme.

175
00:11:17,505 --> 00:11:22,674
So definitely keep in mind that if PFK2 is active,

176
00:11:22,674 --> 00:11:28,579
it means that you're producing more F26 biphosphate.

177
00:11:28,579 --> 00:11:31,118
If you remember the lecture from glycolysis,

178
00:11:31,118 --> 00:11:34,253
if you're producing more of this, you activate PFK1.

179
00:11:34,253 --> 00:11:40,841
You deactivate fructose 6-bisphosphate and vice versa.

180
00:11:40,841 --> 00:11:45,752
If you have less PFK2 activity, then you have less F26 biphosphate one,

181
00:11:45,752 --> 00:11:48,065
then you cannot activate the FK1.

182
00:11:48,065 --> 00:11:56,035
So by default fructose 6-bisphosphate one will be active.

183
00:11:56,035 --> 00:11:59,163
This is a nice diagram.

184
00:11:59,163 --> 00:12:04,933
It's a nice table explaining how things work and how they're regulated.

185
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:08,948
So as for insulin, insulin as mentioned, it will deactivate FOXO.

186
00:12:08,948 --> 00:12:14,186
So what FOXO would do is it would increase PEPCK activity and

187
00:12:14,186 --> 00:12:18,283
increase atrogenes to promote proteinosis.

188
00:12:18,283 --> 00:12:20,683
So if you are deactivating FOXO,

189
00:12:20,683 --> 00:12:24,467
then you are not allowing it to activate PEPCK case.

190
00:12:24,467 --> 00:12:30,602
So less PEPCK means less cataplerosis and less gluconeogenesis,

191
00:12:30,602 --> 00:12:36,746
and this is what insulin tries to do or insulin like growth factor.

192
00:12:36,746 --> 00:12:37,996
On the other hand,

193
00:12:37,996 --> 00:12:43,245
cortisol which at all costs want to increase blood glucose will activate FOXO.

194
00:12:43,245 --> 00:12:46,588
So that there is more gluconeogenesis and that there is

195
00:12:46,588 --> 00:12:51,239
more prosthesis which is the breakdown of protein as we saw from the previous

196
00:12:51,239 --> 00:12:55,832
picture in one slide where there's protein breakdown, and the muscles.

197
00:12:55,832 --> 00:12:59,065
So at all costs, cortisol will activate

198
00:12:59,065 --> 00:13:03,737
everything that can activate to increase blood glucose.

199
00:13:03,737 --> 00:13:09,146
Insulin resistance makes you think that if someone is also resistant and

200
00:13:09,146 --> 00:13:14,467
they can't really efficiently block FOXO, so they can't really stop

201
00:13:14,467 --> 00:13:19,625
PEPCK from being active and this is definitely not super healthy..

202
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:23,232
Because if someone is insulin resistant and their PEPCK is always active,

203
00:13:23,232 --> 00:13:27,482
then they're undergoing gluconeogenesis and they're already insulin resistance.

204
00:13:27,482 --> 00:13:33,818
So they have a lot of glucose in the blood that cannot be taken up by the cells.

205
00:13:33,818 --> 00:13:39,513
And now that they're undergoing gluconeogenesis that cannot be controlled,

206
00:13:39,513 --> 00:13:42,998
because their insulin cannot really do its job,

207
00:13:42,998 --> 00:13:47,758
because the cells cannot sense it, then they're just gonna end up

208
00:13:47,758 --> 00:13:52,192
having more hyperglycemia which is definitely not optimal.

209
00:13:52,192 --> 00:13:55,711
How is obesity associated with hyperinsulin anemia?

210
00:13:55,711 --> 00:13:59,896
There is an overload and nutrition, of course.

211
00:13:59,896 --> 00:14:03,036
So insulin resistance happens to try and

212
00:14:03,036 --> 00:14:09,052
protect the cells from consuming all of the additional glucose in the blood.

213
00:14:09,052 --> 00:14:13,432
And then eventually and ultimately, if there's always more intake and

214
00:14:13,432 --> 00:14:18,242
more glucose in the blood, the tissues will just ultimately stop responding to

215
00:14:18,242 --> 00:14:22,082
insulin, because they do not want to take any more glucose.

216
00:14:22,082 --> 00:14:26,827
And then the pancreas will kick in and try to release more insulin, because it

217
00:14:26,827 --> 00:14:31,577
thinks that there's a lot of glucose in the blood that we need to dispose off.

218
00:14:31,577 --> 00:14:36,629
And so it releases more insulin and then the tissues become more desensitized.

219
00:14:36,629 --> 00:14:38,694
It's just a vicious cycle, really.

220
00:14:38,694 --> 00:14:43,335
And then more insulin is still being secreted by the pancreas that thinks it's

221
00:14:43,335 --> 00:14:44,397
doing more good.

222
00:14:44,397 --> 00:14:47,873
And then eventually the pancreas just gives up,

223
00:14:47,873 --> 00:14:52,706
because just releasing all this insulin, but it's not helping and

224
00:14:52,706 --> 00:14:56,464
reducing and reducing glucose levels in the blood.

225
00:14:56,464 --> 00:15:01,623
So it eventually gives up and the beta cells just slowly stopped working.

226
00:15:01,623 --> 00:15:07,187
The beta cells are the cells in the pancreas that released the insulin.

227
00:15:07,187 --> 00:15:12,104
[COUGH] As mentioned, cortisol would have a positive impact

228
00:15:12,104 --> 00:15:16,541
on PEPCK as mentioned and G6-phosphatase as well.

229
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:21,422
Just the last step over here to ensure that even if PEPFCK is up regulated,

230
00:15:21,422 --> 00:15:24,189
we also need to make glucose at all costs.

231
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:29,248
So the last step that determines if you're making glucose or not is G6-phosphatase.

232
00:15:29,248 --> 00:15:33,929
So think of it as cortisol is all activating the very first

233
00:15:33,929 --> 00:15:38,221
step that's initiating cataplerosis over here and

234
00:15:38,221 --> 00:15:43,000
then it's activating the very last step that ensures that

235
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,917
glucose is being made from G6-phosphatase.

236
00:15:46,917 --> 00:15:50,456
Also, stress definitely induces cortisol levels.

237
00:15:50,456 --> 00:15:54,576
So if someone is diabetic and is under a lot of stress, it means they're

238
00:15:54,576 --> 00:15:58,300
just undergoing gluconeogenesis non-stop which is not good.

239
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:02,915
It increases their blood glucose.

240
00:16:02,915 --> 00:16:10,190
[COUGH] So gluconeogenesis depends on substrates.

241
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:13,741
So you need those three substrates as mentioned earlier.

242
00:16:13,741 --> 00:16:18,257
And also glycolysis are also fatty acid oxidation

243
00:16:18,257 --> 00:16:22,245
provides some energy for the acetyl-COA.

244
00:16:22,245 --> 00:16:27,095
It will activate pyruvate carboxylase, so that it can alleviate some of

245
00:16:27,095 --> 00:16:32,834
the acety-COA build up and then pyruvate carboxylase will make more exile acetate.

246
00:16:32,834 --> 00:16:37,962
And as mentioned, this is an operatic.

247
00:16:37,962 --> 00:16:45,401
And so we've talked about how insulin controls this and that's it.
